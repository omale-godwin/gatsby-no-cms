Library is regarded as the store house of information and knowledge. Students should be able to use the library to enable them solve their problems. They need to acquire information in order to expand their knowledge and understanding; students should use the library to do their assignments, research and preparation of their examination. Regular consultation of library materials can help students to achieve them. </p> <p>According to Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, library is defied as a room or building containing books that can be looked at or borrowed or a set of books, records etc. that are produced by the same company and have the same general appearance. </p> <p>According to encyclopedia Americana, the word library is derived from the Latin word libber. Meaning “book” the library initially stocked collections of clay tablets, papyrus and even scrolls were housed in libraries long before the concept of the book emerged. </p> <p>In other words the library is a place where books and non book materials are kept for consultation of the users. Library is referred as a store house of information. Library stores the intellectual records of the society, retrieve and decimate them for the benefit of the society. Library as an institution has the responsibility of collecting books and other information materials and make them available to people for reading, study or reference.</p> <p>People use library resources to obtain information of personal interest or to obtain recreational materials such as films and novels. Students use library to supplement and enhance their classroom experiences, to learn skills in locating sources of information and to develop good reading and study habits. Public officers use libraries to research on legislation and public policy issues. They provide information and services that are important to learning and progress. </p> <p><strong>1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Users patronage of the institute of management and Technology Enugu library.</p> <p>The institute of management and Technology Enugu library was as old as parent organization. It was established in 1973. The library was formerly located in campus (II) of the institution with a branch in campus (III). But in 2002, the library was located in campus (III) fully with the construction of new library of congress in campus III. The library has 480,000 volumes of books. It has been growing from strength to strength. The library consists of the following Sections/Departments. Cataloguing and classification Department, Bindery and acquisition Department, Serials/ Government Document Department.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS </strong></p> <p>This project is to find out the problems that libraries in our Country are facing, for example inadequate use of library both Academic library and other types of libraries inadequate trained staff or libraries who will be guiding or directing students. </p> <p>        Poor finding of the libraries, especially Academic library, it faces the problem of money to acquire their materials. Un conducive atmosphere such as noisy environment. </p> <p>    Inadequate strategic position where the library should be situated for easy entrance of people, for effective use of library by students and others, these problems must be solved. </p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the quality of students’ patronage of the institute of management and Technology library Enugu as stated in the following objectives.</p> <p>(1)        To determine who are the users of the institute of management and Technology Enugu library.</p> <p>(2)        To find out what collection development exists in the library. </p> <p>(3)        To asses the teaching of use of library. </p> <p>(4)        To find out how effectively the library holdings will made use of the library.</p> <p>(5)        To examine the quality of the library staff. </p> <p><strong>1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        This study is focused on the users patronage of the institute of management and Technology Enugu library. This study is within the institution. The students to study are the old students, this group of peoples are choose because they have been in the school for a long period. They have acquainted with the school environment.  </p> <p><strong>1.5  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY                </strong></p> <p>Since Academic library is part of the parent organization, students of the institution are advice to be making effective use of library because it was established for the benefit of students. Academic library plays a vital role of teaching, research, dissemination of information and serve people that live around the area. In academic library, materials are provided to support learning as well provides materials that will assist students in their own personal reading and self development. This project serves as a reference point of other schools and libraries because after reading it amendment can be made to their own library. It helps them to know the areas where they will play a vital role in the educational upliftment of the student in the library. It will serve as a reference point to the researchers as well as draw the attention of the government both state and federal government to the importation of library to an individual. It will attract the attention of those students who find it difficult to use library, it will help them to make library their second home.                                     </p> <p><strong>1.6a</strong> <strong>      RESEARCH QUESTIONS                    </strong></p> <p>[1]    Who are the users of the institute of Management and Technology Enugu library?</p> <p>[2]    What collection development problems exist in the library?</p> <p>[3]    How effectively is the library holdings are made use of?</p> <p>[4]    How does the library staff relate to students in finding their needed information?                   </p> <p><strong>1.6b       HYPOTHESIS</strong>                         </p> <p>[1]    The students of institute of Management and Technology Enugu are the users’ of institute of Management and Technology Enugu library.</p> <p>[2]    The collection Development problems exist in the institute of Management and Technology Enugu library are science and engineering materials.</p> <p>[3]    The library holdings are made effectively in the Institute of Management and Technology Enugu library everyday but the peak period is during the examination.</p> <p>[4]    The staff of the Institute of Management and Technology Enugu library helps them in finding their needed information.                                                                                   </p> <p><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>According to oxford Advance Learners Dictionary.

A CASE STUDY OF </strong></p> <p><strong>ANAMBRA STATE UNIVERSITY, ULI.</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     </strong><strong>Background to the study</strong></p> <p>Reference service is one of the essential services of the library. Meaning reference service is the activities, roles, functions and services rendered by the reference librarian constitute reference service. According to Prytherch, (2002) He states that: “reference service deal with the provision of reference work by library staff”.</p> <p>According to Ohio Library Council, (2005) Reference services is “A way for libraries to meet the needs of their user (clientele) communities”. Reference service involves instructing clients to operate independently and at own pace to uses electronic and print resources of the library, it also involved personal assistance given to the users to enable them meet their needs.</p> <p>James (2005) states that reference work started in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to respond to several forces and trends. In the next several decades from the 1930s through the 1950s, a new technology that provides, access to the library to a lager member and much wider variety of people was introduce. That technology is obviously, the telephone and the reference literature of the day speaks of its advantages but also its challenges. For example, having distinguished between “important questions coming in via the telephone those business men and involving important topics from less important” ones from club woman planning programs, context questions like should this service be centralized or dispersed? Should it be staffed differently from the desk? What information resources should be dedicated to it? And many more.</p> <p>According to (ALA RUSA, 2008) reference service includes reference transactions and other activities that involve the creation, management, and assessment of information or research resources, tools and services. Creation and management of information resources includes the development and maintenance of research collections, research guide, catalogues, database, web-sites, search engines etc that patrons can use independently, in-house or remotely to satisfy their information needs. Assessment activities include the measurement and evaluation of reference work, resources and services.</p> <p>According to Esharenana, (2008) sees reference section as that section of library which provide a variety of services and perform functions necessary to assist the users including provision of information service on demand and in providing institution in the use of library, selected of documents and organization of reference materials.</p> <p>According to Obiora, (2004) states that reference sources are publications – book and non-book materials consulted only within the library for specific facts or definite piece of information on a subject. There are two types of reference sources, general reference sources which include Encyclopedia, Directories, Dictionaries, Yearbooks and Handbook while special or subject reference sources are Mathematics, Biology, and Library Science.</p> <p>According to Esharenana, (2008) states that reference question is a sentence, phrase or word posed by a patron to the reference librarian asking for information or assistance in order to meet the need.</p> <p>According to Ramum (2003) reference policy is regarded as a kind of set of plan and as a kind of framework within which reference staff and clienteles work.</p> <p>Ahi Rusa, (2003) states that a reference librarians is person that provides reference service. He should posses a wide range of intellectual interest, desire to assist the patrons, flair for organizing documents ability to search literature and adequate knowledge of the library and external resources.</p> <p>According to Scott (2007) is pubic service counter where professional librarian provide library users with direction on how to make use of library materials, advise on library collection and services and expertise on multiple kinds of information from multiple sources.</p> <p>According to Anderson (2005) digital reference is a service and the reference transaction is a computer mediated communication.         </p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>Statement of Problems</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to critically analyze the problems and prospect towards the services in the reference section and equally to view the problems that have prevented it from executing effectively and efficiently the bibliographical functions in the library.</p> <p>One observes that the very rapid expansion of our reference sources have reached a stage of concern. One finds that the library does not tackle the problem of acquisition of up-to-date reference materials like journals to keep the clienteles (students and lecturers even the parent institution) abreast of the new trends in their various field of study.</p> <p>Development of the reference collection and organization which effect in the backbone of a reference eservice should also be looked into. A maximum attention would equally be paid to the relevance of the exiting services, to see how it meet the needs of the patrons, because the effective use of these materials depends on the services provided by the reference personnel or librarians.</p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong>Purpose of Study </strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to know the problems and prospect of reference services. Therefore the researcher will be able to find out the following purposes:</p> <p>i.            To know if the reference section of the academic library is well organized.</p> <p>ii.          To know if there reference services are being rendered in line with other reference services in other libraries.</p> <p>iii.        To identify the strength and weakness of the library’s reference collection because any effective reference service may not be feasible without an appropriate and adequate reference collection.</p> <p>iv.         To enable the researcher carry out the findings so that to make recommendation for effective reference services in the library.</p> <p>v.           To take the library to another level through the reference services.   </p> <p><strong>1.4     </strong><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>For the success of this study, this study demands an answer to the following questions:</p> <p>i.            Is the reference section of the academic library adequately organized to perform its functions?</p> <p>ii.          To what extent can the reference materials in the library said to be appropriate for the needs of the clientele?</p> <p>iii.        Are the reference services being rendered in-line with other reference services in other libraries?</p> <p>iv.         Does the library make available all the useful reference materials needed by the users for them?</p> <p>v.           Does the library clientele find it easy with the reference librarian in terms of research?</p> <p><strong>1.5     </strong><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>1.          This study will lay on the reference services in academic library users.</p> <p>2.          It will provide a useful information on how reference services are being searched by the users.</p> <p>3.          It demonstrates to library staff the feelings of its clientele towards the type of reference materials they provide for them.</p> <p>4.          The recommendation to the made will be the one that if implemented will enhance an effective reference information services of the library to its user.</p> <p>5.          To enable adequate access to the materials be the library users.  </p> <p><strong>1.6     </strong><strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study is restricted to the university of Anambra State Uli Campus library. The reference services rendered to the users are deeply discussed. </p> <p>        Reasonable conclusion and recommendation was made because of limited time and space placed on this research, make it impossible to evaluate in details everything about the problems and prospect of Anambra State University reference library section. Only activities performed in the library and the general overview of their statistical record and their reference materials have been look into.</p> <p>        The quality of staff was also evaluated, the nature of their work and services towards their users.</p> <p><strong>1.7     </strong><strong>Definition of terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Reference Services</strong>:      According to Ala, (2008) reference service involves reference activities that includes the creation, management and assessment of information, research resources, tools and services. Creation and management of information resources include the development and maintenance of research collections, catalogues, research guides, databases, web-sites, search engines etc.</p> <p>So that patrons can use independently to satisfy their information needs. Therefore reference is sees to be an act of documenting important materials for future use while services is the ability to make sure that reference section is functioning effectively. It deals with provision of reference work by library staff. </p>\n\nTHE PROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF REFERENCE SERVICES IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN ANAMBRA STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF REFERENCE SERVICES IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN ANAMBRA STATE", "id": 2}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE CLASSIFICATION AND KNOWLEDGE </strong><strong>DEVELOPMENT BY TECHNICAL LIBRARIANS</strong></p> <p><strong> IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN </strong></p> <p><strong>ANAMBRA STATE</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0     </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p>Library classification forms part of the field of library and information science. It was a form of bibliographic classification (library classification are used in library catalogues, while “bibliographic classification”, also covers classification used in other kinds of bibliographic data bases). It goes hand in hand with cataloguing and classification, sometimes grouped together as technical services. The library professionals who engages in the process of cataloguing and classifying library materials is called a cataloguer or catalog librarian. Library classification scheme are one of the two tools used to facilitate subject access. The other consist of alphabetical indexing language such as Thesauri and subject headings.</p> <p>Library classification of a piece of work consists of two steps. Firstly, the aboutness of the material is ascertained. Next, a call number (essentially, a book’s address) based on the classification scheme in use at the particular library will be assigned to the work using the notation of the systems.</p> <p>However, a library classification is a system of grouping the like terms and separating them from the unlike one’s. library classification documents library materials or any information (books), serials, audio visual material, computer files, maps manuscripts, realia) according to their subject and allocating a call number (information needed) to that information resources. Bibliographic classification schemes group entitles together that are relevant the same subject, typically arrange in a hierarchical tree structure (like classification schemes used in biology). A different kind of classification scheme called a faceted classification scheme is also widely used which allows the assignment. It multiple classifications to an objects, enabling the classification to be orderly in multiple ways. Barr Jim (2009) knowledge management is about cooperation and contact.</p> <p>It is important to note that unlike subject headings or thesauri where multiple terms can be assigned to the same work, in library classification schemes, each work can be placed in one class. This is due to shelving purposes. A book can have only one physical place. However, in cataloguing one may have main entries as well as added entries most classification scheme like Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and library of congress classification scheme also add a cutter number to each work which adds code for the author of the work.</p> <p>Classification system in libraries generally play two roles. Firstly, they facilitate subject access by alloying the user to find out what is available in a give library on a particular topic. Secondly, they provide a known location for the information source to be accessed leg where it is shelved.</p> <p>Lawrence Sand Giles CL (2006) Accessibility Information on the web nature.</p> <p><strong>1.1     </strong><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Library plays a very important role in this economic and industrial development of developed countries. As early as 1995, Ifidon (1995) demonstrated how libraries (i.e academic, public and special libraries) were important building blocks in the economic and industrial development of developed countries Ifidon (2005) documented several information services that were provided by libraries in Canada, Germany and United Kingdom (UK) to the industry. Community which includes: providing access to patents… informations, reference services borrowing privileges, current awareness services, inter library cooperations, translation services etc. The range of these services varied according to the resources which can be tapped and the financial support given by local government and industries. A study of Kansas public libraries in the United States of America also showed that nearly a third of business and economic development organization in all pars of the state used public libraries as a resources high proportions of business that have their own libraries also use the resources and services of public libraries in most cases in the United State of America (USA) such as library system of Lancaster Country (PA) and the Cecil Country (MD) public library. Small Business Information Centre (Hamilton Pennell, 2008).</p> <p>Most libraries in African are still in a weak position to successful playing their roles in economic and industrial development. Libraries are still tied in the traditional role of providing access to information resources by only acquiring processing and disseminating library materials.</p> <p>Originally libraries were small, served the monitory and possessed a collection of books imported from colonial countries. This situation has not changed even when independence came to many African states. Most libraries have renamed with the Tittle content generated from the north, as their development was ignored in favour of the efforts to uplift poverty. Further, the rising cost of journal prices and adequate and expensive distribution mechanisms on knowledge and innovations in Africa have also inhabited libraries to provide access to updated and relevant literature for economic growth and industrial development journal subscriptions normally increase at rate of 11.16% every year beyond the reach of many institutions in Africa Ngika, (2006).</p> <p>Academic libraries are among the best developed libraries in Africa and they can play a great role in serving the industry community. These libraries are well equipped.</p> <p>However, there is a significant variation in there development and growth both in quality because their support mainly comes from their institutions with minimum subsidization they receive from government or other affiliations (Ocholla, 2008) despite the development of ICT, changing nature it will also serve as a guide line for the students scholars in library and information science field of study.</p> <p>It will also serve as books of record in the field of information science.</p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>It is a common knowledge that the viability of academic library have not been explored nor utilized. This is because of the excruciating in effective equipment of libraries in the Nigerian contemporary societies which has been culminating to the traumatizing non-challant attitude of the masses towards sourcing information from libraries, lack of interest in academic study cum knowledge acquisitions from academic libraries in Anambra State. It is unfortunate that Anambra is a failed state in regards to library building and knowledge acquisitions this is demonstrated by the past governments of Anambra State on their failure to support effective library buildings in the state, which has been stigmatizing (militating) knowledge exploration in the academic setting which demoralizes the interested researchers (readers) in Anambra State for the past twelve years in which knowledge development in Academic Library has become a past history in Anambra State     </p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In line with the statement of the problems of this study which are not limited to the excruciating lack of effective support towards equipping academic libraries non-challant attitude of masses towards gaining new knowledge from academic libraries lack of proper library classification which makes information difficult for the researches, this work aims to the following;</p> <p>1)           To find out factors affecting classification and knowledge development by technical librarians in Academic Libraries in the state.</p> <p>2)          To recommend the most possible solutions to those identified factors (affecting) militating against effective classification and knowledge development in Academic Libraries in this state.</p> <p>3)          To determine the strategy through which government of Anambra State will ensure proper and adequate library building in all the Academic settings.</p> <p>4)          To examine the level of information accessibility and enhance effective information dissemination for depositions in the Academic Libraries in Anambra State. </p> <p><strong>1.4     </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>This field research work will be significance in the following ways; </p> <p>i.            It will serve as a book of reference for further research work in Anambra State and Nigeria general.</p> <p>ii.          This research work will also be significance in enhancing effective classification and knowledge development in Nigeria contemporary society and in Academic settings generally.</p> <p>iii.        It will be of great help in ensuring proper classification in Academic libraries in Anambra State. It will also serve as a guideline for the students, scholars in library and information. It will also serve as books of record in the field information science.</p> <p><strong>1.5     </strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In line with the statement of the problems and in chronological with the purpose of this research work; the following (4) research questions were posed by the researcher which will guide this field research work.</p> <p>1)          What are the factors affecting effective classification and knowledge development academic libraries in Anambra State?</p> <p>2)          To what extent could there be solution to the problems militating against effective classification in Academic libraries?</p> <p>3)          To what extent does government of Anambra State enhance adequate library buildings in Academic environments?</p> <p>4)          To what extent do masses access and utilize the information in academic libraries in the state?</p> <p><strong>1.6     </strong><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work is focused on classification and knowledge development by technical libraries in Academic libraries in Anambra State. It covers the problems affecting effective classification and knowledge in Academic libraries. It also touches the solutions to the problems and the strategy designed through ensuring government and provide effective and active participation in Academic libraries buildings in the state.</p> <p><strong>1.7     </strong><strong>LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>In the course of this study the researcher encounters many impediments and challenges as follows: -</p> <p>TIME CONSTRAINTS: Time constraint is one of the major factor that limits this course of study mean while, the researcher faced many activities coupled with her course of study.</p> <p>FINANCIAL CONSTRAINT: The researcher of a student was financially constraint in the sense that she found it difficult to travel round Anambra State from week to week.</p> <p>NON-CHALLANT ATTITUDE: of the respondents towards the questionnaires was also one of the factors that limited the researcher.</p> <p>Some wrong information and fear of giving information among the respondents was also a difficult factor in achieving this research work target.  </p> <p><strong>1.8     </strong><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>1.          CLASSIFICATION: Is a systematic arrangement of things, people, animals, books in groups or categories according to established criteria.</p> <p>2.          KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT: Is the process of capturing, developing, sharing and effectively using organizational knowledge.

According to oxford advanced learner’s dictionary 8th edition, stock is a supply of something that is available for use. Stock in library terms refers to book and non book materials in a given library.</p> <p>The term acquisition means different thing to different people. Evans, (2000) defined acquisition as the process of securing materials for the library collection, whether by purchase as gifts or through exchange programs. </p> <p>Gorman (1998) described acquisition as the procedure which is primarily concerned with ordering, claiming and receipt of materials for the library. </p> <p>Acquisition according to Bakare (1999) is the means by which books and non book material are collected in a library or group of libraries.</p> <p>The Librarian Glossary (2001) defined acquisition as the process of acquiring, or the department concerned with acquiring for the library.</p> <p>Webster part II (1984) defined acquisition as the act of acquiring</p> <p>According to oxford advanced learner’s dictionary, acquisition is the act of getting something especially knowledge and skills.</p> <p>Wulfekoetter, (1961): Acquisition is the means by which additions are made to the library; this involves bringing in new materials into the library stock. These materials maybe acquired through direct purchase, gifts, exchanges, donations, inter-library loan cooperation and legal deposit especially if the government designated the library as a legal depository centre.</p> <p>It is also the process of obtaining library materials, both books and non book materials, which aims at building up a library collection.</p> <p>Effective acquisition development can only be possible in any library if the functions of that library are quite clear in a policy statement. It has always been impossible for any library to possess every material.</p> <p>Stock acquisition in Alex Ekwueme library, Federal Polytechnic Oko, involves print and non print material. (Book and non Book materials).</p> <p>Book acquisition according to Adedibu, L.O (1983) is the procurement of library books whether they are acquired by purchase, gift or through exchange.</p> <p><strong>        BOOKS:</strong></p> <p>These are monographs, textbooks or set of blank sheet of papers bound along one edge and enclosed within protective covers to form a volume especially a written or printed literary composition presented in this way. Librarian Glossary (1971)</p> <p>Stocks acquired are usually housed in a library.</p> <p><strong>LIBRARY:</strong></p> <p>Webster part II (2004) defined library as a collection of reading materials. Webster’s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language (1994) defined library as a place set apart to contain books and other materials for reading, study or reference; as a room, set of rooms or building where books may be read or borrowed.</p> <p>Kumar (1992) defined library as a public institution or establishment charged with the care of a collection of books, the duty of making them accessible to those who require the use of them and the task of converting every person in its neighborhood into a habitual library gore and reader of books.</p> <p>According to Okeke (2001) library is an institution meant to collect, organize, preserve and disseminate informational materials to library patrons. </p> <p>Chukwuma (2004) defined it as a place where professionally selected and acquired books and non book materials are processed and orderly arranged to make for ease of location, retrieval and use.</p> <p>Hornby (2010) defined library as a building in which collection of books, CDs, newspaper etc are kept for people to read, study or borrow. </p> <p>Academic library:</p> <p>According to the Librarians Glossary of terms (1979) academic libraries are those libraries of universities, university colleges, and all other institutions forming part of or associated with institutions of higher education.</p> <p>Ezamba N.C. (2004).says that an academic library can be defined as a library attached to tertiary institutions. Academic libraries are varied and distinctive as the institutions they serve.</p> <p>Obodoeze,F.O.(2004) Opines that academic libraries are those libraries that exists in institutions of higher education such as universities, colleges of education, colleges of technology and polytechnics.</p> <p>Therefore, stock acquisitions in academic libraries are the process or action taken by libraries to build up the library’s collection. Various ways are involved in acquiring library materials such as acquisition by purchase. In purchasing process, there is need for selection before acquisition, acquisition through gifts, exchanges and legal deposit.</p> <p>Selection involves careful choice of items to be acquired by the library. Selection is based on the needs of user because the library in the polytechnic is primarily set up to support the polytechnic curriculum. Many things are considered during selection and acquisition and they include the objectives of the parent body/institution that is every institution has objectives and materials are acquired in the subject field of the institution’s interest.</p> <p><strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF ALEX EKWUEME LIBRARY, FEDERAL POLYTECHNIC OKO.</strong></p> <p>Alex Ekwueme library, Federal Polytechnic, Oko is an academic library made up of a network of three libraries located at Oko, Atani and Ufuma campuses. What is today known as the Alex Ekwueme library, Federal Polytechnic, Oko started in a one (1) room apartment with (400) volumes of books mostly in the field of classic and literature. This was when the Anambra state Government approved the institution as a college of Arts and Science to offer a remedial courses for students at the G.C.E ordinary and advanced level examinations. When the institution was upgraded to college of Arts, Science and Technology on June 28, 1980 more books were acquired to provide information resources to facilitate teaching, learning, research and community services.</p> <p>The growth of the library was sustained with the unassailable objectives of the library, collection development in Alex Ekwueme library was expectedly dictated by the institutions curricula.</p> <p>The college was formulized as Anambra State Polytechnic, Oko through Edict no. 12 of 1985. The library was moved from the one room it occupied to its present location and more books were acquired to beef up the collection.</p> <p>The professional librarian Mr. U.C.U Uchedili was appointed to organize the library in line with established procedure in any academic library. This was during the regime of Professor C. Ezeilo as the rector in 1981. In 1993, the quality of its education programmes, the availability of vital infrastructure and personal initiatives of Professor Ben Nwabueze, the minister of Education. The Polytechnic was taken over by the Federal Government. At the same time, Atani campus of Polytechnic was established as one of the visionary strides of Professor Ben Nwabueze. </p> <p>The nucleus of Atani campus library was established with 1,272 volumes of books in the field of Computer science, mathematics and Satatistics. The first professional librarian, Mr. Rowland Ofuluo was appointed in 1995 by recommendation of the polytechnic librarian. Dr Obiora Nwosu left the polytechnic for Nnamdi Azikiwe University. The polytechnic was at that capacity until June 2010 when Mr. F.O Obodozie took over as the substantive polytechnic Librarian.</p> <p>Today, Alex Ekwueme Library, Federal Polytechnic, Oko has benefited from TET fund sponsorship, Federal Government grants and donations from philanthropic individual like Dr Emeka Offor. As a result of these interventions, the library has grown into one of the foremost academic libraries in Nigeria. They have also applied to Ranforly libraries in England to include Alex Ekwueme library in global rating of Academic libraries.</p> <p>At present they have 220,000 volumes of books with 120,000 titles. It has equally grown in staff strength with (48) forty eight professional and Para professional staff. There is still room for improvement in manpower development.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>It is obvious that diverse problems militate against Alex Ekwueme library in Federal Polytechnic Oko. Recently stock acquisitions in the academic libraries have little or no attention</p> <p>In many libraries in Nigeria especially academic libraries, there is lack of fund to build up library stock. This is because sometimes Government do not provide enough fund to acquire library materials which aims at building up the library collections. Sometimes when government maps out fund for a particular institution, those in charge will not use it adequately and judiciously.</p> <p>There is a problem of staffing in the department compared to the number of library users. In most academic libraries, there are few numbers of staff to compare to the number of users they attend to. When you come to the library, there are lots of students seeking for attention of library staff.</p> <p>Inadequacy of reading space and furniture is also one of the problems in Alex Ekwueme library. When materials are been acquired in the library, there is no reading spaces and furniture for the library users. </p> <p>The above problems affect stock acquisition in Alex Ekwueme library in Federal Polytechnic, Oko.</p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objectives of the study carried out by the researcher are as follows:</p> <p>i       to identify the various methods of acquiring library materials at Alex Ekwueme library, Federal Polytechnic, Oko.</p> <p>ii      to ascertain the extent and procedure of book acquisition in the library.</p> <p>iii     to determine the needs of stock acquisition in Academic Libraries.</p> <p>iv     to find out the types of materials that are to be acquired in the library.</p> <p><strong>1.4   SCPOE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work is limited to the acquisition of library materials in Alex Ekwueme Library, Federal Polytechnic, Oko, in Orumba North Local Government Anambra State. This research work discusses the acquisition of print and non print materials in the above mentioned polytechnic. This research work will examine the different types of materials which are been acquired by the library, the reasons for the acquisition of those library materials, its importance to library users.</p> <p><strong>1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Few books were written on the field or topic stock acquisitions, what we have severally are materials on collection development in which acquisition is included.</p> <p>This research work is carried out by the researcher in order to help users especially library science students to identify the processes of stock acquisition in an academic libraries making reference with Alex Ekwueme library, Federal Polytechnic, Oko so as to  enable them to differentiate between stock acquisition patterns in various libraries (public, school, special and national libraries).</p> <p>Additionally, the study will help to contribute to the knowledge of anybody who might need information or assistance in the following ways:</p> <p>·        It will help students and researchers especially library and information science students who may need this work as a reference in the field of stock acquisition.</p> <p>·        It will serve as a guide to library staff to their users/patrons.</p> <p><strong>1.6   RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>The researcher formulated the following research questions on the assumption that it would aid her in bringing the research work to a logical conclusion.</p> <p>    i.        What are the various methods of acquiring library materials at Alex Ekwueme library federal polytechnic, Oko?</p> <p>  ii.        Are there procedures of book acquisition in the library?</p> <p>iii.        What are the needs of book acquisition in Academic Libraries?</p> <p> iv.        What types of materials are needed to be acquired in the library?</p> <p><strong>1.7   DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>BOOKS:</strong></p> <p>According to librarian Glossary (2001), These are monographs, text books or set of blank sheet of paper bound along one edge and enclosed within protective covers to form a volume especially a written or printed literary composition, presented in this way.</p> <p>Books are non-periodical printed publication of at least forty five (45) pages. It is known that books carry the knowledge of the society and this knowledge is needed every time by the members of the society. As a result of this, books are published constantly to carry information.</p> <p>Dina and Olukola (2002) cited UNESCO to define book as a non-periodic printed publication of at least (49) forty nine pages exclusive of the covers. A book can therefore be described as a collection of sheets in printed or written form which has been cut, sown, and usually bound between covers into volume. A book may be more than one volume like Encyclopedia Britannica which has 30 volumes. Books can be divided into fiction and non-fiction.</p> <p><strong>NON-PRINT MATERIALS.</strong></p> <p>Non-print materials consist of library resources that are not in printed format. They are called audio-visual materials (A.V.M). These materials require special equipment for their use. They require auditory and visual appreciation to use them. They are divided into three:</p> <p>    i.        Audio: They consist of sound recordings produced on magnetic tape. Examples are audio cassettes, audio tapes, records, educational radio programmes, etc.</p> <p>  ii.        Visual: Visual senses (eyes) are required for their use. Examples are slides, film-strips, transparencies, microfilms, ultra fiche, microfiche, etc.</p> <p>iii.        Audio visual: These materials require both audio (ears) and visual (eyes) senses for their use. They include television, videotapes, tape/slide programmes.</p> <p><strong>COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT:</strong></p> <p>This embodies a number of library activities which include the selection of library resources, the acquisition of those materials selected, development plans for sharing resources between libraries, maintenance of resources acquired, weeding, conservation and preservation of library materials.</p> <p><strong>SELECTION:</strong></p> <p>This is the process of choosing books to be included in the library holdings.</p> <p>Uchedili U.C and Uchedili E.E (2006) opined that selection is a process of deciding which materials to acquire for a library collection. It is a matter of systematically determining quality and value. They further suggested reasons for selection in libraries which are as follows:</p> <p>    i.        Achievement of objectives: Every library has a set of objectives which represent the basic function of its parent body.</p> <p>  ii.        Need/use: Library only needs to acquire materials needed by its users. Every library is established with potential users in mind, so selection must be according to their needs because effective collection building cannot take place without reference to the needs of the users.</p> <p>iii.        Selection due to variety of resources: Library has to select which materials to acquire amongst others in the same subject.</p> <p> iv.        Limited resources: Libraries select because no library can afford to buy all that is needs.</p> <p>Non print materials with reference to Alex Ekwueme Library is in audio visual Unit (AV unit) .</p> <p>Uchedili and Uchedili (2006) says that non print materials are the audio visual materials. They include:</p> <p>Equipment;</p> <p>16mm sound projector,8mm projecter,2X2 slide projector, film stride projector, overhead projector,television,reel-reel player, cassettes,record player, video tape recorder, cameras etc.</p> <p>Materials;</p> <p>8mm films, 16mm films, graphic materials, microform, transperencies,multimedia kits etc. These materials require special handling and a good environmental condition. In Alex Ekwueme Library, federal polytechnic, OKo they have the following non print materials as mentioned by the polytechnic librarian Mr. F.O. Oboboeze as follows;</p> <p>Four overhead projectors, two slide projectors, four television sets, 29 computers, but only six are functioning, four reel-reel tapes, two loud speakers, satellite dish installed by TET fund and White screen for projector</p>\n\nSTOCK ACQUISITION IN ALEX EKWUEME LIBRARY <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STOCK ACQUISITION IN ALEX EKWUEME LIBRARY ", "id": 4}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>SCHOOL LIBRARIES AS AN EFFECTIVE INSTRUMENT FOR ACHIEVING ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE A CASE STUDY OF SCHOOLS IN OWERRI TOWN</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>        The word according to the new Lexicon Webster Dictionary of the English language. Library is defined as a room or building housing a collection of books usually arranged according to same plan. Such collection of book on related topics issued by a publisher.</p> <p>        The library has collection of records of human culture in print and non-print information purveying materials housed, preserve, organized, interpreted and managed by a professional librarian, to meet the broad and varying needs of users or clientele, for their information, knowledge, education, research, recreation and aesthetic appreciation.</p> <p>        However the word library is defined as a room or building containing books that can be looked at or borrowed by members of the public or members of the group or organization that owns the library.</p> <p>        According to Longman Dictionary of English language and culture; A building in which collections of books, CDs, newspapers, etc are kept for people to read, study or borrow.</p> <p>        The library is an integral part of any academic institution where it is situated and no such institution can achieve its well throughout objectives without the library. It is not an adjunct to the parent institution, but an indispensable part. It is necessary to have library in our post primary schools because it is the central organ of an academic institution which determines the excellence of the institution in teaching and learning. School libraries are found in elementary post primary and higher schools and house the materials and services that students and teachers requires to carry out their academic activities. Their holdings consist of printed an audio-visual materials that support and extent the curricula and that attempt to make reading attractive to students.</p> <p>        According to encyclopedia Americana, they offer reference and inter-library loans in terms of size, 54.6% of school libraries have fewer than 2000 books, while 3% have more than 10000% books. In the early 1990s there were approximately 3500 school libraries in Mexico, representing a 24% increase in just two years. School libraries have also extended their missions and the level of their services in recent years.</p> <p>        Furthermore, from the above one can see that the school library has a remarkable role in academic excellent of students because the process of teaching and learning cannot be effectively done without incorporating the library of secondary education system. It is therefore an instrument of education excellence. In this regard Ishola (2002) says “That whose function is to broaden the education of students by introducing them to spheres of knowledge outside the narrow confines of their school curriculum”</p> <p>        The school library can serve as follows:-</p> <p>i.            Resource centre: Offers a wide variety of materials that information is not only stored in print form but also in non-print.</p> <p>ii.          Teaching Agency: Teacher students various skills which when acquired enhances their academic performance and discourage leaving by rote.</p> <p>iii.        Services Agency: Offer various services users to aid them make maximum utilization of the library resources.</p> <p>iv.        Recreation Agency: Guides students in their research work involving using the library by providing minor reference assistance to them.</p> <p>v.          Educational Agency: This is the overall development of an individual, growth, progressive reconstruction of experience and a life long process. The educational roles of the school library are:-</p> <p>a)           Inculcation of permanent literacy </p> <p>b)          Promotion of early child education</p> <p>c)           Enhancement of secondary education </p> <p>d)          Development of reading habits.</p> <p>The school libraries thus has challenged the functions of parents, teachers, classroom and the various institutions that were formerly the exclusion, sources of knowledge and information.</p> <p>The characteristic of the school library:</p> <p>1.          <strong>User:</strong> They are made up of the pupils, students and teachers. Some are more intelligent than others or some are eager to read while others are backward. The libraries should give more attention to the less intelligent once in order for them to meet up.</p> <p>2.          <strong>Contents:</strong> It contains materials that are book and non-book  materials also contains materials based on the syllables and subjects taught at school chosen on basis of its individual merit considering the special needs and problem of the institution and the medium that most effectively conveys the desired content so that its objective will be met.</p> <p>3.          <strong>Location:</strong> It is part of the school community. They are to achieve the objectives of the school that set it up the library as a complement.</p> <p>4.          <strong>Functions:</strong> It is an integrating factor in the work of the school. The work of the school library is directed towards the definite education aims of the school.</p> <p>A large percentage of pupil and students in nursery, primary and secondary schools are ignorant of the fact that personal intelligence and more knowledge of a subject does not automatically establish firm knowledge of a subject and excellence in school, the school library is an invaluable and for  achieving academic excellence. Also teachers, parents and libraries are today concerned about the poor reading habits of our students, poor performance at school and fall in our educational standard. This cry has invariably elicited very passionate question in the minds of those who love and care of all round development of these students. The libraries are yearning collectively on how to combat this problem knowing the adverse effect of this ailment first in the lives of the pupils and students, secondly in the progress of a country like ours.</p> <p>The relationship between school libraries and reading habits and that between school libraries and academic excellence has been a subject of theoretical interest and practical importance amongst librarians. However, this relationship has been established through effective reading and general success in academic pursuit. In the primary schools, the library laid the foundation for reading habits by importing reading skills at the formation stage of the pupils education. In the secondary schools they form the foundation for independent learning at present school and at successive stages of the students life by establishing firmly the reading habits acquired in the primary school. Also the school library communicates information from several information carries, for better understanding and broadcasting of knowledge and there produce profound effects on the various categories of the students populace who acquire the skill of utilizing and assimilating information from the library, thus become more successful than others by virtue of information and knowledge they possess via the library collections.</p> <p>It was in view of this that Morgan (2003) asserts that in the hands of a cultured teacher the school library may serve as a link to bind together the home and school, and to arouse the interest of parents in what and how their children are reading, by referring them to the library.</p> <p>Teachers can suggest to pupils valuable books suitable for their age, attainment, tastes and necessities. Seldom does a day pass when the vigilant teacher has not an opportunity, either in a class or in private conversation, to drop into the prepared soil of pupils mind a hint of some valuable books to read in the library.</p> <p>In conclusion “there is no better intellectual and moral influence than that which comes from reading a good book aloud in the family circle” Morgan (2003) concludes that:-</p> <p>Learning with tear is now a thing of the past like wise learning from single textbook. As every good and resourceful teacher knows one of the crimes or worst “sins” a teacher can commit against his students is to feed them with wrong and out-dated information, also for the purpose of education to be fully achieved, students and teachers need to consult several source for better understanding and clearity. Also, nothing could be as dangerous as ignorance and an ill-informed student as they fall prey to rumours and false propaganda. The library selects, acquires and store in a classified arrangement on shelves the best and up-to-date sources of information that keeps staff and students abreast of new developments in knowledge and understanding of the subject matter, encourage practical work and develop the powers of analytical appraisal and of critical thinking.</p> <p>Learning can be one of the most exciting experience in life, while reading is identified as the single most important determinant of a child’s success at school and in modern society as well. Learning also in modern life depends largely upon ones ability to interpret the printed messages accurately and fully, while reading is an educational task, essential for ones excellence in all academic pursuits. He who has other reasons for learning and reading besides interest in the subject has everything going for him, his interests broadens and cheap source of information during childhood education. Thus ideas absorbed from reading and learning through then remains with the students for the rest of their lives and produces profound effects and influences on their academics. Also the school library in no small measure plays a great part on the attitudes, behaviours, aspiration academic pursuits embarked upon by students and in determining the kind of people they can be </p> <p>Good readers who have mastered the tasks of reading agree that early exposure to a wide range of printed materials is a highly relevant factor in reading. The handicap most secondary schools students face in reading development is lack of good reading materials. The school libraries are indispensable in the area of provision and proper use of books, this have made them the forum on which the educational activities of our secondary school revolves. It behaves on students numerous information sources to exploit so as to enhance their academic performance and to excel. This way, it lays foundation for a brighter future. Knowledge acquired from the information embedded, in the library and resources is like a fortune rightly acquired. For it is “the heart of the institution and the apex on which the intellectual life of the school and student rest”.</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF SECONDARY SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN OWERRI TOWN</strong></p> <p>The development of secondary school libraries in Owerri town could not be treated in isolation from that of school libraries in general in Owerri which commenced in the early 1950’s.</p> <p>This historical development of secondary schools library started in government secondary school, Owerri now government college, Owerri which was established in 1952 and modern school, Owerri now Girls’ Secondary School, Owerri established in 1955.</p> <p>Libraries in secondary school are established in government trade centre, which serves the educational (Technical) needs of those students in the technical education sector.</p> <p>Moreover, due to the type of materials the library stock, it could not serve the general interest of the students in Owerri town. For this reason another library was established in the modern school, Owerri which now serve various categories of students. Despite the type of materials that the library stocked it contributed immensely to the educational development of the town. This was the state affairs until another library was established in the government secondary school which before then serve as a book depot for schools in the then Eastern region, as it was from there that books meant for primary and secondary in the eastern region sent by the then Colonia government were deposited for the various number of volumes of books meant for their school. However, it must be noted that the central library at Enugu was also providing library service known as “library on wheels” to schools in Owerri town (secondary school) before the war, (Nigeria civil war). This factor led to the promotion of the establishment of libraries in secondary schools in Owerri town which were though largely organized and were left to the part-time of teachers. The libraries then in some of these schools were either location in one classroom or found to be in the principals office.</p> <p>In 1955 the Government College, Holy Ghost College, Girls Secondary School Owerri were founded. The Government Technical College, Owerri was founded in 1952, FederalGovernment Girls College, 1973 and Bishop Lasbrey Girls Secondary School, 1952 become secondary school in 1986.</p> <p>In 1957 a library was established in the government college with the aid of the books deposited in the institution. Then a teacher librarian was trained by the administrators who were white men at Enugu. It has the largest volume of books amongst all the schools in Owerri town which strives till today. The library building had a statue of students clutching a book in a round-about in front of the library to indicates the building. The person in charge of the library holds a degree in library science education.</p> <p>The Government Technical College Library was established in 1956 for students in the technical and trade sector of education. Its resources is limited to the type of courses offered in the college. This is an N.C.E graduate in technical in education but with librarianship. With background knowledge of librarianship acquired through attending seminars, workshops, conferences and long period of the classroom complex which is located in a large hall. It has volume of books ranging between 1000 to 1500.</p> <p>In 1973, the Federal government Girls Secondary School Owerri was established and in 1974 was founded. The library caters for the interest needs of students in the secondary section and those in higher school section (lower and upper sixth students) this accounts for its large number of volumes of 3,500. The library is manned by a professional librarian with a bachelor of library science degree. Since 1973 the school has achieved its inception. The library is allocated an entire building and has links with the academic feats.</p> <p>After the conversion of Bishop Lasbery Girls Secondary School Irette to a secondary school then the library was established in 1986, which is located in one classroom and manned by a teacher librarian. The library has volumes of books ranging between 800 to 1000.</p> <p><strong>1.3   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>        This study is the investigation of the extent to which school libraries contribute to academic excellence. Also school libraries has effect on the pupils, students and teachers and their indispensable contributions to the teaching and learning programs of the schools is yet to be fully understood. As a result of this problem, what this research study tries to portray is the mechanism by which the school libraries comes about it.</p> <p><strong>1.4      </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The library is a central focus because in every academic institution.

The librarian has to acquire and provide access to information stocked in the library. The user is very important in the practice of librarianship, this is the library process revolves around the users.</p> <p>The library provides user education in order to equip a user with enough knowledge on the use of library so as to enable them use the library resources effectively. The reason for the provision of user education in the library is that library processes could be so complex that an average user may not easily comprehend how to utilize the available resources. As a result of the era of information explosion in which we are, information is expending at a very fast rate and new resources are being introduced into the library (Aina, 2004). With the advent of information and communication technology (ICT), which has permeated all the activities of libraries, it is important to explain the working of a library to a new user in detail. The ultimate objective of any library is to enable users exploit its resources to the fullest.</p> <p>Fjallbrant (1990), defines user education as: “the teaching of those skills that will enable students to locate and use materials effectively and feel confident in using the library.” Also, its aim is to acquaint users with the use of materials in the libraries. Similarly, Fleming (1990) defined user education as “various programmes of instruction, education and exploration provided by academic libraries to users to enable them to make effective, efficient and independent use of information sources and services to which these libraries provide access.”</p> <p>Bello (2003) defined library user education as: “A device by the librarians to educate users on how to use the resources available in the library in a result oriented ways.” Thus its concerned with information retrieval, since the objectives of the user education in academic library according to Osagie (2003) are as follows:</p> <p>·                    To enable users to know how to use the library catalogue independently in any library with particular reference to the author, title and subject catalogues. </p> <p>·                    To enable users to understand the classification schemes in any library so as to be able to locate materials with little or no problem. </p> <p>·                    To be able to see library catalogues as indexes to the entire collection and use them as such. </p> <p>·                    To enable the users to see the library as a repository of knowledge that determines the success of the students academic programme because its not possible for an individual to have the collection of a library.</p> <p>Students in Nigeria tertiary institutions are introduced to the use of library in one form or the other, in order that they might know what to consult in their quest for information. Today, most students in higher institute of learning find it difficult to explore the world of information sources in the library thus leading to poor appreciation of the library and its resources, which contributes to their inability to undergo meaningful researches or at best become poor library users. It is believed that a concerted effort to know and understand library more will eventually enable the individual to develop his/herself to the fullest potentials. This becomes very important as it will enable man to contribute effectively and positively to the development of the society at large.</p> <p><strong>BRIEF HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE CASE STUDY LIBRARY, UMUNZE </strong></p> <p>        The federal college of education (Technical) Umunze in Anambra state is one of the eight (8) colleges of education [technical] established by decree No. 4 of 14th March, 1986. At its inception, the college moved to Umunze in November 1989, following a presidential directive. At Umunze, the institution inherited buildings of the former All saint Anglican secondary school. At present, the infrastructures inherited from the present, the infrastructures inherited from the school are being renovated and refashioned, as it were, to reflect the grandeaur and convenience of a technical teacher institution.</p> <p>        The college was initially cited at Lomu in the North-eastern out skirt of Umunze town along way leading to Ogbunka and Owere-Ezukala all in Orumba South local Government Area of Anambra State, Nigeria. In 1999/2000, the administration of Dr. C.V. Nnaka (Mrs) made a deliberate effort to move the college to her permanent site at Nsogwu in the south central part of Umunze town with the erection of a gigantic building to house the school of Agric and Home economics education which has been accomplished.

It is needed in all facts of human Endeavour. No society and libraries can function effectively without the intensive of information whether in print or non-print format.</p> <p>It is therefore pertinent to know how this information can be retrieved and disseminated for use by the users or the society in a modern world. The different systems of information retrieval in academic libraries are therefore discussed in this write up with special interest on Federal Polytechnic Library Nekede, Owerri.</p> <p>The world in information cannot be mentioned in isolation of human beings. Information has been described as the master resource, the chief raw material and the principle product on modern economic. Even before the modern world, the ancient world has been dealing with information gathering, storage and retrieval which were done in an ancient way where papyrus, clay tablets e.t.c. were used.</p> <p>Information can be seen as data that have be subjected to functions capable of answering a users query, be it recorded, summarized or simple collection that would help in decision making, according to Uwem, (2008) defined information as a finished product ready for use, the source and medium of communication not with sanding information therefore, can help to ensure the effective use of other resources when it gets to the right people and at the right time.</p> <p>Consequently, the basic objective of any library be it academic, public, school or special library includes the acquisition of information, surveying materials properly processing, organizing, storing and retrieving for disseminating such information to interested users. Hence every academic libraries whether the limits of its fund, develop sufficient information both in scope, nature and size to support the users information needs and aspiration will largely depend on a specific question and its ability to supply known information are produced in form of language even to retrieve information is inform of language, most times, the users found it increasingly difficult to cope with the basic problems of accessing particular information items for use.</p> <p>This research purpose to investigate the various system adopted by the academic library under study in retrieving for use known information items when needed and to retrieve documents on a particular subject problem and questions encountered.   </p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The period under review in this research work is of great importance in academic libraries. It is a period of technological information explosion. </p> <p>This is a period when many retrieval systems exists, where more efficient and accurate retrieval system has been developed like computer and internet which links different but many stations together.</p> <p>However, there are basic problems which militate against the efficient utilization of these resources and these problems include.</p> <p>a.  Lack of funds </p> <p>b.  Government apathy to academic libraries</p> <p>c.   Low literacy level in Nigeria</p> <p>d.  Poor computer informed staff in the academic libraries.</p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong> Objective of the study</strong></p> <p>In order to evaluate information retrieval system in Federal Polytechnic Library Nekede, Owerri, the following objectives are to be focused.</p> <p>i.            To identify the existence of information retrieval system in the library.</p> <p>ii.          To know how information resources are organized in the library in its retrieval effort.</p> <p>iii.        To identify the problems encountered by the library in its information retrieval effort.</p> <p>iv.         Identify the process on how information retrieval system are improved in the library.</p> <p>v.           To highlighting the changes of information retrieval system in the library.     </p> <p><strong>1.4     </strong><strong> SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is limited to the information retrieval processes in academic libraries. This study is further narrowed down to academic libraries and specific focus on Federal Polytechnic Library Nekede. The different information retrieval processes were reviewed with unique interest in the libraries as it applies to the library under study. This library was chosen so as to evaluate the developments and the changes that have taken place in the library under study as regards to information retrieval system.</p> <p><strong>1.5     </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is significant because there is no society that can function without information. So information can only be relevant when it gets to the right people at the right time and in the right dosage. It is sine-qua-non to library users, librarians, administration and the entire society.</p> <p><strong>1.6     </strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p> What are the extent of information retrieval system used in Federal Polytechnic Library Nekede?</p> <p>i.            How does Federal Polytechnic Library Nekede, organize their materials in the library. </p> <p>ii.          What are the problems of information retrieval systems in the library?</p> <p>iii.        How does information retrieval systems improve in the library?   </p> <p>iv.         Do they have changes in information retrieval system in the library?</p> <p><strong>1.7     </strong><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS    </strong></p> <p>For the purpose of understanding this project work under study, the following items are relevant to point out. They are as follows: -</p> <p><strong>ACADEMIC LIBRARY</strong>: An academic library is a library that is been established in higher institutions, such as universities, polytechnics and college of education which serve the teaching and research needs of students and staff. This library serve two complementary purpose which are to support the school’s curriculum and to support the research or the university faculties and students.</p> <p><strong>INFORMATION</strong>: This refers to a fact told or communicated that, fact is a piece of information that is referred as true. It can also be seen as a processed data which is communicated or receive which also can be used in making an information decision.</p> <p><strong>INFORMATION RETRIEVAL</strong>: This means the systematic storage and recovery of data as from a file and catalogue or memory bank of a computer. It equally means document delivery such as mails, photocopied document, data bank mail, links, library searches, personal files, catalogue and database design.</p> <p><strong>INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEM:</strong> This refers to a system that stores record in a file, accept requests for information, search the file for data relevant to each request, retrieve the data and provide the information to the requester. The aim of such system is to help access and use knowledge that has been recorded. An effective information system stores a large number of records yet retrieves desired record rapidly and accurately in response to requests</p>\n\nINFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES", "id": 7}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>INFORMATION NEEDS AND RESOURCE UTILIZATION BY PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS: A CASE STUDY OF </strong></p> <p><strong>ESUT TEACHING HOSPITAL PARKLANE ENUGU</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>        One of the most devastating scourges of our time is the problem of Human Immunodeficiency Virus/ Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Undoubtedly HIV/AIDS present a major challenge to human development in Nigeria. Besides poverty, no problem has given Nigeria a more daunting challenge than the present battle with HIV/AIDS. According to Omoniyi (2013), HIV/AIDS can only be transferred through exchange of body fluid such as blood, semen and vaginal secretions. This means that HIV/AIDS cannot be contracted through causal contract with infected person either at work, school or at home. Also Chagbe (2012) opined that the health of the people is the greatest natural resource of a nation upon which their happiness and power as a nation depends.</p> <p>        Moreover, health is of utmost important in every human fact. That is the reason why every hand should be on deck to promote it. For it is when people are healthy that they can work and any nation who’s workforce comprises of sick persons is finished. According to Moonie (2013) is of the opinion that most individuals that are affected by the virus are vulnerable to chains of other diseases and the cost of medication eats deep into their savings. Also, some families who have lost their bread winners to this disease are faced with untold hardship such as non payment of school fees, house rents and the consequences of being seat out of school and thrown out by landlords.</p> <p>In addition, the information needs needed to fight against HIV/AIDS include: Health education, the control of sexual transmitted disease, the establishment and management of surveillance programmes, prevent mother to child transmission, provide and manage antiretroviral therapy programmes, human resources development and government involvement. These information needs will help to combat HIV/AIDS.        </p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     </strong><strong>Background to the study</strong></p> <p>Managing information is an important part of coping with illness and includes communicative and cognitive activities seeking, avoiding, providing, appraising, and interpreting information. It is complex in that people’s information needs and behavior vary over the course of their illness and along with the availability and quality of information. In recent years, considerable research has been done on how people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (PLWHIV/AIDS) manage information. However, understanding of the role of information in the HIV/AIDS in ESUT Teaching Hospital, Park lane is still limited, because of the difficulties of reaching different groups of PLWHA.</p> <p>This study has been designed to reach many segments of the diverse HIV/AIDS community and broaden under standing of how information can better assist PLWHA.</p> <p>Information can be regarded as a resource that can liberate man. Osuala (2001) refers to information as facts and opinions provided and received during the course of life. A person using such facts generate more information some of which is communicate to others during discussion, by letters, symbols, etc. Aniogbolu, (2008) noted that most information users need information for problem solving, current awareness and recreational purpose. According to Aniogbolu (2008), the importance of information utilization by man to his development is becoming more meaningful to him as his information accumulation ability’s is taking a new dimension with the development of highly sophisticated information technology (Aniogbolu, Anyaobi &amp; Olise, 2010).</p> <p>Information needs is often understood as vague awareness of something missing and culminating in locating information that contributes to understanding and meaning (Kuhlthau, 2009). Belkin, Brooks and Oddy. (2008) in their part saw information needs as a gap in individual’s knowledge in sense making situations. Accessibility to the right information is necessary for the general well being of the individual, institution or organization.</p> <p>One of the most devastating sources of our time is HIV/AIDS; undoubtedly HIV/AIDS presents a major challenge to human development in Nigeria. Ojoawo, (2006) apart from poverty, no problem has given Nigeria a more daunting challenge than the present battle with HIV/AIDS. AIDS in indeed devastating Nigerian communities and poses a real threat to poverty reduction effort and the achievement of the United Nation Millennium Development Goals, (UNMDG). Indeed HIV/AIDS presents a serious challenge to Human Development in Nigeria because the exact cause of and spread of the epidemic is still very difficult to calculate.</p> <p>In Nigeria, the first case of AIDS was diagnosed in 1986. The infection rate has however, grown exponentially. Since then, by June 1999, the Federal Ministry of Health, (FMOH) in Nigeria had recorded 26,276 AIDS cases. Due to fear of stigmatization several cases are not reported through the hospitals, which mean the reported cases were gross under estimations of the rate of occurrence of the epidemic. The National AIDS/STDS Control Progremmes (NASCP) of FMOH estimated that the calculated number of AIDS cases would have reached 590,000 by the end of 1999 (Ojoawo, 2006).</p> <p>Currently Nigeria has become the first country in Africa to cross the critical epidemiological threshold of 5%. In fact, it has since been projected that by the 2009 in the absence of major changes in sexual behavior and other control measures, the number of people living with HIV would reach 5 million, of the 40 million people identified to be living with the disease, 3.5 million is the estimated number for Nigerian. This amounts to 10% of the 40 million people infected worldwide (UNAIDS/WHO/UNICEF, 2002). In a country like Nigeria, with limited public capacity and resources to combat the problem, the prevalence rate is 80 high that the HIV virus is infecting more than 30 people a day, and the disease is growing faster that the authorities’ response to it. The prevalence report in Nigeria revealed that there is no community in Nigeria with zero prevalence (FMOH, 2009).</p> <p>Ukwuoma (2008) noted that in 2003 and 2008 National Antenatal HIV Seroprevalence survey in Enugu State recorded the prevalence rate in both 2003 and 2008 as 4.9% and 5.1% respectively.</p> <p>People living with HIV/AIDS need information to survive. As a matter of fact, information is vital in the daily life of the people living with HIV/AIDS.</p> <p>It is a medium of social transformation and communication and an avenue for them (people living with HIV/AIDS) to get involved in government programmes and policies about HIV/AIDS. Therefore, good access to information becomes a must for PLWHA. It is therefore, necessary to consider the information needs of people living with HIV/AIDS as well as their information resources. This study sought to investigate the information needs and resource utilization by PLWHA. Using ESUT Teaching Hospital Park lane, Enugu as study setting.</p> <p>ESUT Teaching Hospital Park lane, Enugu is situated at GRA Enugu North Local Government. It is a reference center for comprehensive treatment and support of people living with HIV/AIDS.</p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>The cause of the disease HIV/AIDS, allover the world, relates to individual social behavior such as casual sex, intra venous drugs use (FMOH, 2008). In Nigeria however, the leading driving force of the spread of the HIV infection includes low level of education, high level of ignorance, cultural practices that encourage multiple sexual partner such as polygamy and concubine, poverty and lack of access to appropriate reproductive health survives and information particularly the illiterate and young people. The practice of traditional surgery such as bloodletting procedures with unsterilized instrument on infertile women, and non observance of infection control procedures by traditional birth attendants who are heavily patronized in Nigeria, may all be responsible for spread of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria.</p> <p>Other factors blamed for the spread of the epidemic are the other cultural practices that expose people to unsterilized sharp objects used for body scarification and circumcision, the subordinate role of women and their attendant vulnerability which prevents them from negotiating safe sex, ignorance, stigma and discrimination, poverty, illiteracy and the non chalant attitude of some individuals.</p> <p>In spite of various efforts at both domestic and international levels, Nigeria’s situation seems not to translate to any reliable cheering news about HIV/AIDS epidemic. It is becoming more of a developmental problem than just a health problem. The problem constitutes a major challenge to sustainable human development in Nigeria, which must be a concern for all.</p> <p>Lack of information resources, lack of awareness   of the existence of information resources by the people living with HIV/AIDS, Non-utilization of the available resources by the people living with HIV/AIDS, High level of illiteracy among people living with HIV/AIDS, lack of skilled man power to appropriately organize that available resources in ESUT Teaching Hospital Library for easy accessibility and retrieval by people living with HIV/AIDS are the major problems faced by the PLWHA in ESUT Teaching Hospital Park lane, Enugu.</p> <p>This study focuses on the information needs and resource utilization by people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The case study is ESUT Teaching Hospital Park lane, Enugu. The following are the problems facing PLWHA</p> <p>a.  <strong>Emptiness</strong>: Most people living with HIV/AIDS feel they are empty vessels immediately they have been diagnosed as being HIV positive. The feeling that they have nothing to offer to the society also makes them feel empty and useless. They consequently develop an inferiority complex which worsens their condition. They become helpless.</p> <p>b.  <strong>Absence of Counseling</strong>: Most people living with HIV/AIDS who know their status were not given pre-test counseling and as such were not prepared psychologically. This affects the psychological well being of the people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), thereby leading to depression. Counseling is important to people living with HIV/AIDS. With counseling, which is supposed to be on-going process, PLWHA gain and demonstrate courage. Lack of counseling services in our hospitals is greatly affecting PLWHA. Even hospitals that have trained counselors do not offer appropriate counseling services and are not committed to work.</p> <p>c.   <strong>Lack of Family Support</strong>: Experience has shown that some family members abandon and sometimes isolate PLWHA on the grounds that they have tested positive to HIV. This is largely due to lack of awareness in our families such attitudes lead to suspicious among PLWHA. This eventually leads to untimely death in most PLWHA. Hence PLWHA to believe that it is better to die than to live. There is also little or no family support to give hope to PLWHA in most homes.</p> <p>d.  <strong>Stigma</strong>: This is one of the most subtle and debilitating challenges faced by PLWHA. It inhibits open, honest communication between them and others. Stigma makes the disclosure of the disease by PLWHA within the family difficult. Without disclosure, prevention and care are almost impossible, families and communities are deeply intertwined in the African context and should therefore be supported in preventing stigmatization. This will also promote better self esteem among PLWHA with respect to their careers. It will also eliminate the vicious cycle of self-stigmatization. People living with HIV/AIDS face stigma in the home, in the health care setting, in the religious sector, while the mass media can as well unintentionally promote stigma, though they have potential to shape the attitude, values and perception of a large member of people.</p> <p>e.   <strong>Human Rights Violation</strong>: Existing human rights instruments confirm that discrimination against PLWHA or those thought to be infected is a violation of their human rights. This is a great challenge facing PLWHA.</p> <p>f.    <strong>Discrimination</strong>: The acts of stigma constitute discrimination based on presumed or actual HIV positive status constitute discrimination based on presumed or actual HIV positive status and violates human rights due to the stigma associated with the rights of PLWHA. This situation intensifies the negative impact of the epidemic. At the individual level, for example, it causes undue anxiety and distress which by themselves contribute to ill-health. At the level of family and community, it causes people to feel ashamed and to conceal their link with the epidemic, as well as withdraw from participation in more positive social functions. At the level of society, discrimination against PLWHA reinforces the mistaken belief that such action is acceptable and that those infected with HIV/AIDS should be ostracized and blamed. This is a great challenge to PLWHA.</p> <p>Around the world too there have been numerous instances of HIV/AIDS related cases of discrimination. People with HIV or those believed to have HIV/AIDS have been:</p> <p>-      Segregated in schools and hospitals, and placed under cruel and degrading conductions. Cases of degrading treatment have often been reported in prisons where inmates are often without basic needs, including access to medical care.</p> <p>-      Refused employment</p> <p>-      Denied the right to marry</p> <p>-      Reflected by community</p> <p>-      Killed because of their sero positive status.</p> <p>-      Required when returning to their home country to present themselves for an HIV test. Individuals have being denied the right to return to their country on suspicion of being HIV positive. Others have been denied visa and entry permissions.</p> <p>In conclusion therefore, continuous advocacy campaigns are needed in response to the challenges faced by PLWHA and to bring about social change. All hand must be on desk to tackle the challenges facing PLWHA. To win the war against HIV/AIDS, PLWHA must be used as agents of change in the society.    </p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong>Objectives of the study</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of this study is to depict a comprehensive picture of information need and resource utilization by people living with HIV/AIDS in ESUT Teaching Hospital Park lane, Enugu. The specific purposes of the study are as follows:</p> <p>a.  To determine the areas in which people living with HIV/AIDS needs information ESUT teaching Hospital.</p> <p>b.  To find out the information resource used by people living with HIV/AIDS in ESUT Teaching Hospital Park lane, Enugu.</p> <p>c.   To determine the extent to which information resources encourage and support the people living with HIV/AIDS to take positive actions to deal with HIV/AIDS in ESUT Teaching Hospital Park lane, Enugu.</p> <p>d.  To determine the benefits derived from the use of information resources by the PLWHA in ESUT Teaching Hospital Park lane, Enugu.</p> <p>e.   To find out the barriers to access and utilization of information resources by PLWHA in ESUT Teaching Hospital Park lane, Enugu.</p> <p><strong>1.4      </strong><strong>Scope of the study</strong></p> <p>This study is limited to ESUT Teaching Hospital Park lane, Enugu, it investigates the information needs and resources utilization by people living with HIV/AIDS. The research wants to measure the following variables: the areas in which people living with HIV/AIDS need information, the extent to which information resources encourage and support the people living with HIV/AIDS, to take positive actions to deal with the HIV/AIDS, the information resources used by PLWHA, the benefits derived from the use of information resources by the PLWHA, and the barriers to access and utilization of information resources by PLWHA.</p> <p><strong>1.5      </strong><strong>Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>The significance of this study will be appreciated for the following reasons:</p> <p>It will accentuate public education and dissemination of information to reduce the stigmatization of persons assumed to be at risk of HIV/AIDS.</p> <p>This study will also be important because it will provide psychological and social support to people living with HIV/AIDS. They should never be abandoned or treated as social outcasts.</p> <p>The study is important because it will explore the necessary of the political action, that is social workers, individuals, community to participate with other groups to lobby at the state and federal level on behalf of PLWHA in order to improve their quality of life, protect their civil rights or liberty and to advocates for increased funding for appropriate education, prevention, intervention, treatment services and research.</p> <p>The study will also serve as database for policy makers in the area of HIV/AIDS.</p> <p>The findings of the study will help the government improve the scope and efficiency of its information systems and services where necessary to encourage maximum utilization by PLWHA.</p> <p>It will serve as an information base for future scholars in the area.</p> <p>Finally, it is hoped that the study will help policy makers, health care providers, health workers, information providers, library and information professionals, and other stakeholders in health sectors to respond positively to the information needs of PLWHA by identifying such needs and exploring avenues to improving will help the PLWHA to be aware of what is available for them, and perhaps make effective use of the available information resources for enhance health condition.         </p> <p><strong>1.6      </strong><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions guided the study:</p> <p>a.   To determine the areas in which people living with HIV/AIDS needs information ESUT teaching Hospital?</p> <p>b.  To find out the information resource used by people living with HIV/AIDS in ESUT Teaching Hospital Park lane, Enugu?</p> <p>c.   To what extent do people living with HIV/AIDS seek and share information and what type of resources do they use in sharing and seeking information in ESUT Teaching Hospital Park lane, Enugu?</p> <p>d.  What impact has HIV information had on the lives of PLWHA and on basic demography in ESUT Teaching Hospital Park lane, Enugu?</p> <p>e.   What are the barriers to getting HIV information by PLWHA in ESUT Teaching Hospital Park lane, Enugu?</p> <p><strong>1.7      </strong><strong>Operational definition of research concepts</strong></p> <p>The following research concepts are defined according to the way and manner the researcher used in this research work.</p> <p>i.            Information Need: It is defined as an individual or groups desire to locate and obtain information to satisfy a conscious or unconscious need.</p> <p>ii.          Resource utilization: This is the proper use of available information and library resources by people living with HIV/AIDS in respect to their health status.</p> <p>iii.        HIV: This means Human Immune deficiency Virus.</p> <p>iv.         AIDS: Stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.</p> <p>v.           PLWHA: Stand for People Living with HIV/AIDS.</p> <p><strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The university was established as a non residential multi-campus institution.

Speaking communication, photographs, art, music nearly anything that is perceivable.  This includes enormous assortment of stimuli, but realizable, everything we come in contact, which is capable of providing and does provides us with some sort of information.</p> <p><strong>INFORMATION ACCORDING TO WEBSITES THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY DEFINED:</strong></p> <p>Information as a process by which the form of an object of knowledge is impressed upon the apprehending mind so as to bring about the state of knowing it. This also includes some thing received or perceived or obtained- through information eg. Knowledge communicated by others or obtained from investigation, study or instruction. </p> <p><strong>FUNK AND WAGNALLS ENCYCLOPEDIA</strong></p> <p>Sees information as timely or specific knowledge acquired or derived signal element forming parts of massage or communication especially one assembled and made available for use by automatic machines, as in a digital computer usually machined in bits. </p> <p>The Encyclopedia Biotical; Also defined agriculture as the science of cultivating the soil, growing and harvesting crop and raising livestock. </p> <p>O. A. Iwena (2002) Defied agriculture as the production of crops and animals for man’s use in other words, agriculture is defied as the deliberate effort made by man to till the soil, cultivate crops and rear animals for food and other purposes.</p> <p><strong>TYPES OF AGRICULTURE </strong></p> <p>There are two major types of agriculture namely: </p> <p>a.          Subsistence agriculture and </p> <p>b.          Commercial agriculture. </p> <p><strong>A.    SUBSISTENCE AGRICULTURE:</strong></p> <p>It is the type of agriculture which is concerned with the production of finding a farmer to feed himself and his family. In order word subsistence agriculture is a system of farming where by a farmer cultivates crops and rear animals in order to provide food for use by himself and his family only.</p> <p><strong>B.    </strong> <strong>COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE </strong></p> <p>This is the type of agriculture which is concerned with production of food. Animals and cash crops in large quantities for sale. It makes use of modern and complex tools and implement like tractors, plough, harrows, ridges, planters, which are required for successfulness of it’s practice. </p> <p><strong>AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION </strong></p> <p>    It is a process or methods used in disseminating new ideas, techniques to farmers. This methods is grouped into (3) three classes: </p> <p><strong>a)    INDIVIDUAL METHOD:</strong></p> <p>The individual method includes farmer home visits aimed at direct contact between farmers and the extension agents. The purpose is to give advice or assist on wide range of farm and its problem. In order to succeed, it may require the assistance of volunteer leader to arrange meetings as to develop public relations with organization and important individuals.</p> <p><strong>b)</strong>     <strong>GROUP METHOD:</strong></p> <p>The group method involves the works together with groups of farmer supervision of the extension worker. (Eg) </p> <p>i.      Symposia </p> <p>ii.     Lectures </p> <p>iii.    Debates </p> <p>iv.    Group demonstration </p> <p>v.     Extrusion </p> <p>vi.    Field trips </p> <p>vii.   Agricultural show. </p> <p>Agriculture show is usually organized by state or even federal government and it includes demonstration/ Exhibition of farmer product from improved agricultural practices. </p> <p><strong>c)    MASS MEDIA: </strong></p> <p>This method is used to awareness and interest in new ideas and technique among the majority of farmers. In order words, this method enables many people to know about the new innovation. Mass media includes CD ROM, radio, Television, Newspaper, Film show, Computer show case, Pamphlets, Banners, Hand bills and Handouts.           </p> <p><strong>APPLICATION OF AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION </strong></p> <p>Over the years faculty members at university of Nebraska have designed computer network system for direct use by farmer’s along with wished agricultural specialists. There are now more than a thousand users of the system. The system disseminates/delivers information to Canada.</p> <p>There are two board classes of the users:</p> <p>a.           Agricultural specialist:- who advices other farmers </p> <p>b.           Individual farmers, business and agencies making use of system directly.</p> <p>In African, a deliberate effort/attempt have been by African governments to bring about agricultural development without much to show for these efforts. This can be attributed to the treatment of information delivery as matter of course by most African government. As often happens agricultural information is not integrated with other development programs to address the numerous related problem that face farmers.</p> <p>Information is an essential ingredient in  agricultural development programmes but Nigeria farmers seldomly feel the impact of agricultural innovation either because they have no access to such vital information or because it is poorly disseminated. The information provided is exclusively focused on policy maker’s researchers and those who manage policy decisions with scant attention paid to the information need of the largest beneficiaries of the policy decision. The non-provision of agricultural information is a key factor that has greatly limited agricultural development in development countries.</p> <p>If the approaches to agricultural development programmes are to work, African governments needs to take new approaches to information dissemination and management that grow out from a clear understanding of what farmers information need are. For instance a researcher might use beef grower to estimate when a particular cattle will be ready for sale and what cost and gain of selling will be.</p> <p>The cost of production for various crops can be calculated using crop budget and the economic value of land estimate with bay land. This programme also provided new items and message services.</p> <p><strong>ROLES OF INFORMATION IN AGRICULTURE </strong></p> <p>        It is found that most of the role of information in agricultural development are perceived by many, but performed by few. Also moist of the role perceived are not performed by many of those who do perceived them. Industrial revolution taking new turn away from machines and instrument for taking over contain mental tasks example the handle of all forms of data thus we have seen the growth of computer from simple to the larger high speed flexible digital computer of today.</p> <p>        No one categorically claim to know all the information need of farmer especially in and an information depended sector like agriculture, where there are new and rather complex problems facing farmer every day. It is safe to assert that information need of Nigerian farmers revolves around the resolution of problems such as pest hazards, weed control moisture insufficiency, soil fertility, farm credit, labour shortage, soil/erosion and so forth.</p> <p>        Information needs by the local farmer may be in form of extension education, agriculture inputs, agriculture credit and marketing modern farm inputs are needed to raise small farm productivity. These inputs may include fertilizers, improved variety of seeds and seedings feeds, plant, protection chemicals, agricultural machinery and equipment and water. An examination of the factors influencing the adoption and continued use of these inputs will show that information dissemination is a very important factor. It is a factor that requires more attention than it now gets.</p> <p>        The farmer’s need of information is at moment being diffused by extension worker, other farmers, government parastatals and agricultural equipment dealers. The impact is yet to be felt.</p> <p>        Farmers are among the potential beneficiaries of agricultural credit in Nigeria but because of their low levels of literacy they are mostly unaware of credit, farmers need information relating to source of loan such as names of sources. They need information on the term of loan such as the interest rates, loan able amount and mode of repayment regarding agricultural credit debts to small farmers usually through channels such as relations, friends, neighbours, government officials, commercial and credit banks. Grass root organs such as village leads and local government officials are used to diffuse such information because of their personal touch with small-scale farmer. Extension agent needs to intensify their effort in educating farmers to increase their level of awareness.</p> <p>        In Nigeria, ministry of agriculture through the field level extension worker and  broadcasting media provides agricultural marketing information farmers. A lot still have to be done in this area. Some of those in charge of marketing information are not trained for this job.</p> <p><strong>AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION DISSEMINATION </strong></p> <p>        With the past decades there has been burst of research activities and agriculture in Nigeria Universities and agricultural research centre located around all country far researching innovation that are capable of booting. The farmers agricultural production and Nigeria’s economic development have been discovered. The yam minisett-techniques, protein rich soyabean production and use of animal vaccine and drugs and labour saving devices are some of the many improved agricultural innovations not properly diffused. Prominent among the agricultural centres are:-</p> <p>        International institute for tropical agriculture (IITA)</p> <p>        The National Root Crops Research Institute. But unfortunately, most of these innovations do not reach the farmers field. This is because the medium for information disseminate in use is quite ineffective.</p> <p><strong>PRESENT SITUATION </strong></p> <p>        Institutional and governmental organ have been put in place to ensure that farmer get to know and adopt agricultural innovations relevant to their situation e.g. Agricultural extension and research license services (AERLS) The extension service of the  agricultural development project (ADP), ministries of agricultural both state and federal levels, media forum for agriculture, co-operation extension centers (CEC) of universities and public enlightenment units of the 18 agricultural research centres. These bodies serve as facilitators of agricultural message by acting as communications departments. They use computer, leaflet, newsletters, posters, exhibits, visual aids and radio, programmes to communicate agricultural information. Radio and television programmes are popular although controlled by government with its attendant problems regarding the choice of programmes of all the existing channels of extension highest in terms of providing credible information and advice, especially on agricultural technology.</p> <p>        A major function of extension is to get the farmers into frame, is fairly widespread in the middle belt region of Nigeria where information about fertilizer is well diffused. Even through the demand for fertilizer is buyout, the supply is mostly inadequate to meet the demands.</p> <p>        Apart from use of extension for diffusion of agricultural innovation, other channels like rural development field staff, contact farmer, schoolteacher’s private sector, agric-business people staff of the ministry of agriculture and the electronic and print media are used. These channels have their strengths and weakness farmer to strengthen the effort of the print and broading media in ensuring proper agricultural information dissemination to farmers the media forum for agricultures was formed by media practitioners from all over Nigeria, with the aim of providing better support for agriculture by improving the quality of agricultural coverage in the media.</p> <p>        Again the targeted audience is not properly reached as the main beneficiaries of information carried by printed media and broad casting are urban elites not people at the grass root.</p> <p>        The purpose of agricultural development programmes (ADP) was to evolve a new concept of reaching the farmer with research findings  and new discoveries in farming operations, this was not so, owing to the fact that most times farmers are left on their own while extension workers were quite busy trying to urbanize their work/accommodations. The problem of agricultural development cannot be discussed only in term of policies of the federal government the technique of production, which emanated from ignorance of the improved techniques of farming accounted for problems. Nigeria were more familiar with traditional technique which was in novelty and so not many Nigeria farmer’s got used to.</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF ANAMBRA STATE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME</strong></p> <p>Historical background:- Background study of agricultural development programme: Anambra state agricultural development programme (ASADEP), was inaugurated 5th, 1985 as one of the multi-state agricultural development project (MSADP-1) made up to the South East States.</p> <p>A tripartite arrangement between the World Bank, FGNANSG ensures proper finding for ASADEP. No wonder in 1986, the federal government signed a loan agreement of USD 162 million for all MSADP-I which at present includes the following states: Anambra, Abia, Akwa-Ibom, Cross-River, Ebonyi, Enugu, Imo, Kogi, Plateau and Benue.</p> <p>Old Anambra state (Anambra and Enugu States) got USD 22.4 million. That loan was terminated at June 30th 1995. There was an IFAA (International food and agricultural development). Loan of about USD 1.5 million expired in June 1997. Following the creation of state in Auguest 27, 1991 old Anambra state bifurcated into Anambra and Enugu states. It thus became necessary to restructure the former Anambra ADP and to establish two ADPS from the new territories. The World Bank provided fund for the creation of new headquarter builder in Anambra State. In January 1992, the present ASADP moved from Enugu to temporary office at Enugu –Ukwu. It was later moved to its own multi-naira magnificent headquaters office complex. In October 1995, the edifice is located on kilometer 41, Enugu-Onitsha express Awka.</p> <p>The broad objective is to improve the standard of living and welfare of the rural smell-scales/holder farmer, throughout the state of raising by their productivity and farm income, via integrated rural development.</p> <p><strong>1.3  STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </strong></p> <p>        Despite government effort to promote food production in Nigeria-through the use of various policy and programme, it appears that the efforts are yet to yield enough result. Village farmers are still lacking information about the latest research findings even where available, many still have no access to it. Government is bombarding public eardrum with slogans and platitudes: operation feed the nation, green revolution, self reliance-lots of publication in different forms like journals, books and bulletin were produced and circulated among organization agricultural productivity at the village level is still at the low ebb. The impact of new research finding is yet to be filed at the village level. Farmers are yearning for new technology that will enhance their productivity. Information for development is not to be advantages of the rural farmers the problems militating against effective dissemination of information to farmers are:</p> <p>        Lack of adequate and prompt fund for public awareness activities, lack of adequate and undated materials for research purposes, communication barrier, topography, wrong perception of researchers towards farmer illiteracy and superiority complex of research over farmers. In order to find out place of information in agricultural development, an analytical research of this nature is necessary and data gathered  will provide empirical evidence that will guide policy makers, students, researchers, extension workers and development bank officers for formulation new and better policy.</p> <p><strong>1.4  OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>i.      To determine the role of information in Agricultural Development in Nigeria.</p> <p>ii.     To test the justification for investing Agricultural Information.</p> <p>iii.    To determine various sources of information flows </p> <p>iv.    To determine whether the research finding disseminated accomplish the target goal among farmers.</p> <p>v.     To identify the effect of information in agriculture productivity.</p> <p><strong>1.5  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>Any society with inhibiting human’s must be adequately informed in view of the relevance of information to every individual in all shares of life.

Evaluation of technical services means to appraise or analyze the processes a library material should undergo right from acquisition until the material finally appear on the shelf for use. </p> <p>        This project evaluates the technical services of technical service division of Abia state library board. Before delving into the actual project, it is important to explain with library is. According to Okorie (1964:101)</p> <p>Libraries are usually those, whether municipal, country, regional or national, which are supported by public funds and open to the general library board. </p> <p>According to Uba (1973:163) the term “technical services” in library parlance appears to have tow connotations. Viewed from the stand point of reference services which industries and technical libraries offers to their users, on the other hand, it mans the other work of the technical processing department of libraries-that is, cataloguing and classification and allied processes. Technical services therefore, refer to all the activities and processes concern with selecting, obtaining, organizing and processing of acquired library materials in the library. It is to achieve this end in the economic way that technical processing which according to him, is a means to an end service because cataloguing and classification provide the tools without which information services is impossible. In libraries, the handling of technical services is always the sole responsibility of the technical department. According to Harrod [1971] technical services is a department of a library where the function of a book acquisition, cataloguing, classification and processing are carried out.</p> <p>Technical services department in any library is usually referred to as “behind the screen” department because most of their activities are carried out of sight of regular users of the library. Usually, the department is made up of the cataloguing section, acquisition section, serial section and bindery section. The cataloguing section’s function is to organize the total library resources by it clientele.</p> <p>The traditional means for accomplishing this goal are descriptive cataloguing, subject cataloguing and classification.</p> <p>This assignment required effective records preparation with all reasonable economy. </p> <p>The acquisition section’s function is to purchase expedition and from the most advantageous vendors the material chosen or selected, to process materials pre-cataloguing] otherwise procured, and to forward promptly and to the proper places all materials acquired. This large business operation must be forwarded economically. The economy involves the selection of agents, methods purchasing, treatment of return, and sale of discards. Although, foremost is budget expense control.     Technical services activities require the effort of a large potion of library staff and budget, and it is the “life wire” of any library.    </p> <p>The serial section’s function is subscribing various journals for the use of the clientele. The various journals subscribed to the library are selected, ordered, received and processed by the serial section.</p> <p>The function of bindery section is to provide suitable protection for each item added to the collection and to take action, and also to per-serve it for the use of the future generation.</p> <p>Harrod [1971:524] also defined it as “A library provided wholly or partly from public funds, and the user of which is not restricted to any class of person in the community but it freely available to all. </p> <p>Libraries are usually established by either the local, state or federal government to serve the information needs of the community in which it located by providing materials both books and non-book materials. However, the library does not exist for formal education alone. It exist and must cater for the class of people who are general readers and those who go to the library for recreation. Unfortunately, in Africa, Nigeria to be3 precise, public libraries are not properly funded and are under used. In the wards of Oyedeji [1975:159]. The libraries that exist are for the moment, mostly glorified classrooms and reading shelters for exam-hungry school boys and girls who pay little attention, which some of the libraries offer. It is the basic of this laxity in the use of the library that the researcher decided to carry this research to find out the reasons why libraries are under used. The researcher however, chooses the technical services aspects of the problem with the Abia state library as her case study, while she leaves the other aspect of the problems for others to conduct future research on them. As earlier said in this topic, the library is establish to provide both book and non-book materials, and services that will in the present and in the future contribute to the aims and objectives of the library.</p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Abia as a state has some problems to consider economic bedrock, one of the most populated industrialized and civilized state in Nigeria. According to Smith (978: 2) the researcher trends some of its development, it thus become of interest to her especially of the technical services of the Abia State Library Board in the organization of its resources for effective dissemination of information to meet the varied need of its numerous clientele.   </p> <p>        However, the researcher before going into the research envisaged some outstanding that may be glaring, ad these problems are:</p> <p>i.            Inadequate acquisition of materials.</p> <p>ii.          Lack of adequate budgeting allocation</p> <p>iii.        Lack of qualified cataloguers </p> <p>iv.         Lack of the correct number and types of staff to achieved its set objectives.      </p> <p>v.           Lack of library co-operation in technical processes.</p> <p>vi.         Poor/lack of binding services.</p> <p>vii.       Lack of well written selection policy </p> <p>viii.     Lack of effective user education/orientation on the use of the catalogue.</p> <p>ix.         Technical services department are policy equipped tools.</p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objectives of this study have summarized under the following. </p> <p>1.          To evaluate the technical services of Abia State Library Board</p> <p>2.          To survey the organization of the technical department of the Abia State Library.</p> <p>3.          To find out the problems that hinder the effective technical services of the Abia State Library Board and to offer suggestions on how best to arrest the situation.</p> <p>4.          To highlight the roles expected of a technical services department of a standard library.</p> <p>5.          To find out the general staffing position of the technical services of library.</p> <p>6.          To evaluate specifically the importance of the catalogue, its adequacy as a finding tool to the patrons and its users.</p> <p><strong>1.4     </strong><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This project is limited to the study of technical services of Abia State Library Board.</p> <p>There are some aspect of the problem facing technical services in a public library, which the researcher would have cared to investigate and finding possible solution to them, but acting director was first appointed the acting director of Abia State Library services following the recommendation of the Board, members to the ministry of education. On assumption of office, he immediately recalled to the headquarters the only cataloguer of the library in the person of Mr. James E. Nwosu from one of our out station libraries where he served for effectiveness of the technical services department of the library.</p> <p><strong>1.5     </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The researcher discovered that organization of resources in libraries is regrettably too inadequate. To this end, the significance of the study is to bring to awareness, some of these lapses in technical services using in Abia State Library Board as a case study since this is the most challenging aspect of librarianship and library services to the people, and suggesting ways to correcting these lapses and finally contribute to the frontiers of knowledge in this field.</p> <p>Students of librarianship as well as professional libraries and library staff will definitely find this work valuable for both professional and organization efficiency even the general public.</p> <p><strong>1.6     </strong><strong>A)    RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1.          How adequate is the budgetary allocation of the technical services department?</p> <p>2.          Does the technical services department process books and non-book materials acquired by the library?</p> <p>3.          Do you have enough professional cataloguers in the technical services?</p> <p>4.          Does the library keep a written selection policy?</p> <p>5.          What are the effects of inadequate supply of library materials?</p> <p>6.          What level cataloguing description does your library use?</p> <p><strong>1.6  B)    STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>i.      The technical section of the library is not in good condition because of inadequate financial investment on the section.</p> <p>ii.     The technical section do not make use of classification scheme due to lack of fund.</p> <p><strong>1.7     </strong><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS                  </strong></p> <p>Let us therefore define the following operational terms so that they will mean the same thing to different people at different times.</p> <p><strong>Evaluation</strong>:    This is decision about how significant or valuable something is, based on a careful study of its good and bad.</p> <p><strong>Library Material</strong>: The term is used to refer to a collection of books and other materials keep reading, studying and consultation.</p> <p><strong>Technical Services</strong>: An umbrella term which takes care of all the process a library material should undergo right from acquisition until the material finally appear on the shelf for use.</p> <p><strong>Library</strong>:           It is a place where books, journals, microfilms, audio and visual materials and computer data and terminals are kept and organized to support the cultural, information, recreational and educational needs of the general public or specific groups of users.  </p>\n\nEVALUATION OF TECHNICAL SERVICES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EVALUATION OF TECHNICAL SERVICES", "id": 10}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>PROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF REFERENCE SERVICES IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES</strong></p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This project is aimed at examining the problems and prospects of reference services in academic librarians, using the Anambra State University Uli campus library as a case study and how to evaluate the strength and weakness of the reference services in an academic librarian.

Meaning reference service is the activities, roles, functions and services rendered by the reference librarian constitute reference service. According to Prytherch, (2002) He states that: “reference service deal with the provision of reference work by library staff”.</p> <p>According to Ohio Library Council, (2005) Reference services is “A way for libraries to meet the needs of their user (clientele) communities”. Reference service involves instructing clients to operate independently and at own pace to uses electronic and print resources of the library, it also involved personal assistance given to the users to enable them meet their needs.</p> <p>James (2005) states that reference work started in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to respond to several forces and trends. In the next several decades from the 1930s through the 1950s, a new technology that provides, access to the library to a lager member and much wider variety of people was introduce. That technology is obviously, the telephone and the reference literature of the day speaks of its advantages but also its challenges. For example, having distinguished between “important questions coming in via the telephone those business men and involving important topics from less important” ones from club woman planning programs, context questions like should this service be centralized or dispersed? Should it be staffed differently from the desk? What information resources should be dedicated to it? And many more.</p> <p>According to (ALA RUSA, 2008) reference service includes reference transactions and other activities that involve the creation, management, and assessment of information or research resources, tools and services. Creation and management of information resources includes the development and maintenance of research collections, research guide, catalogues, database, web-sites, search engines etc that patrons can use independently, in-house or remotely to satisfy their information needs. Assessment activities include the measurement and evaluation of reference work, resources and services.</p> <p>According to Esharenana, (2008) sees reference section as that section of library which provide a variety of services and perform functions necessary to assist the users including provision of information service on demand and in providing institution in the use of library, selected of documents and organization of reference materials.</p> <p>According to Obiora, (2004) states that reference sources are publications – book and non-book materials consulted only within the library for specific facts or definite piece of information on a subject. There are two types of reference sources, general reference sources which include Encyclopedia, Directories, Dictionaries, Yearbooks and Handbook while special or subject reference sources are Mathematics, Biology, and Library Science.</p> <p>According to Esharenana, (2008) states that reference question is a sentence, phrase or word posed by a patron to the reference librarian asking for information or assistance in order to meet the need.</p> <p>According to Ramum (2003) reference policy is regarded as a kind of set of plan and as a kind of framework within which reference staff and clienteles work.</p> <p>Ahi Rusa, (2003) states that a reference librarians is person that provides reference service. He should posses a wide range of intellectual interest, desire to assist the patrons, flair for organizing documents ability to search literature and adequate knowledge of the library and external resources.</p> <p>According to Scott (2007) is pubic service counter where professional librarian provide library users with direction on how to make use of library materials, advise on library collection and services and expertise on multiple kinds of information from multiple sources.</p> <p>According to Anderson (2005) digital reference is a service and the reference transaction is a computer mediated communication.</p> <p>Statement of Problems</p> <p>The aim of this study is to critically analyze the problems and prospect towards the services in the reference section and equally to view the problems that have prevented it from executing effectively and efficiently the bibliographical functions in the library.</p> <p>One observes that the very rapid expansion of our reference sources have reached a stage of concern. One finds that the library does not tackle the problem of acquisition of up-to-date reference materials like journals to keep the clienteles (students and lecturers even the parent institution) abreast of the new trends in their various field of study.</p> <p>Development of the reference collection and organization which effect in the backbone of a reference eservice should also be looked into. A maximum attention would equally be paid to the relevance of the exiting services, to see how it meet the needs of the patrons, because the effective use of these materials depends on the services provided by the reference personnel or librarians.</p> <p>Purpose of Study</p> <p>The purpose of this study is to know the problems and prospect of reference services. Therefore the researcher will be able to find out the following purposes:</p> <ol><li>To know if the reference section of the academic library is well organized.</li> <li>To know if there reference services are being rendered in line with other reference services in other libraries.</li> <li>To identify the strength and weakness of the library’s reference collection because any effective reference service may not be feasible without an appropriate and adequate reference collection.</li> <li>To enable the researcher carry out the findings so that to make recommendation for effective reference services in the library.</li> <li>To take the library to another level through the reference services.</li> </ol> <p>Research Questions</p> <p>For the success of this study, this study demands an answer to the following questions:</p> <ol><li>Is the reference section of the academic library adequately organized to perform its functions?</li> <li>To what extent can the reference materials in the library said to be appropriate for the needs of the clientele?</li> </ol> <ul><li>Are the reference services being rendered in-line with other reference services in other libraries?</li> </ul> <ol><li>Does the library make available all the useful reference materials needed by the users for them?</li> <li>Does the library clientele find it easy with the reference librarian in terms of research?</li> </ol> <p>Significance of the Study</p> <ol><li>This study will lay on the reference services in academic library users.</li> <li>It will provide a useful information on how reference services are being searched by the users.</li> <li>It demonstrates to library staff the feelings of its clientele towards the type of reference materials they provide for them.</li> <li>The recommendation to the made will be the one that if implemented will enhance an effective reference information services of the library to its user.</li> <li>To enable adequate access to the materials be the library users.</li> </ol> <p>Scope of the Study</p> <p>This study is restricted to the university of Anambra State Uli Campus library. The reference services rendered to the users are deeply discussed.</p> <p>Reasonable conclusion and recommendation was made because of limited time and space placed on this research, make it impossible to evaluate in details everything about the problems and prospect of Anambra State University reference library section. Only activities performed in the library and the general overview of their statistical record and their reference materials have been look into.</p> <p>The quality of staff was also evaluated, the nature of their work and services towards their users.</p> <p>Definition of terms</p> <p>Reference Services:      According to Ala, (2008) reference service involves reference activities that includes the creation, management and assessment of information, research resources, tools and services. Creation and management of information resources include the development and maintenance of research collections, catalogues, research guides, databases, web-sites, search engines etc.</p> <p>So that patrons can use independently to satisfy their information needs. Therefore reference is sees to be an act of documenting important materials for future use while services is the ability to make sure that reference section is functioning effectively. It deals with provision of reference work by library staff.</p>\n\nPROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF REFERENCE SERVICES IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF REFERENCE SERVICES IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>STRATEGIES FOR GENERATING REVENUE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA</p> <p>(A CASE STUDY OF NATIONAL LIBRARY KADUNA).</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Information and its effective and proper dissemination is a powerful force to reckon with in any nation.

There will be no meaningful development in any nation if proper attention is not paid to libraries. Since researches birth new discoveries and inventions, it is a common place to have libraries as the incubating home of researchers, therefore, it logically follows that the invaluable roles that libraries play in the development of any nation cannot be overemphasized (Fabunmi and Folorunso 2009). Generally, public libraries are seen as public goods. They are universities of the people since it gives access to every intending member of the public. Library’s Glossary Dictionary (1977) defined a public library as a library established by local, state or central government for the use of the general public. There are however, some individuals or organizations that establish library that offers services to the public free of charge and such libraries also provide educational, social and political information to people in a particular community. Olanlokun and Salisu (1993) viewed that public libraries are libraries set up to provide free but traditional service to everyone. A public library is a service oriented institution with set goals to be achieved within the resources made available by the parent institution, which is usually the government. In other words, a public library is primarily established to provide viable and revealed services to the entire members of the public. Public libraries in Nigeria have the same universal function of serving the general public by providing educational opportunities for self-development. In order to realize the objective, the functions of public libraries therefore involve the acquisition, collection, organization, and dissemination of information available in the form of printed and non-printed materials for effective use. Users of public libraries are very many as they cut across all walks of life and also embrace illiterates, pensioners, children, adolescent, adults, farmers, physically challenged people etc. The public library is therefore the main arena through which the overall information resources in various areas of knowledge are made freely available to all members of the society irrespective of the age, sex, religion, cultural background and educational standard as well as political and social inclination. In 1953, the Federal Government of Nigeria with the help of UNESCO organized the first regional seminar on the development of public libraries in the various regions of Nigeria with the following objectives (Edoka, 2000): Creating and strengthening reading habits in children from early age; Supporting both individual and self -conducted education as well as formal; Providing opportunities for personal creative development; Stimulating the imagination and creativity of children and young adults; Promoting awareness of cultural and appreciation of the arts, scientific achievement and innovations; Providing access to cultural expressions of all performing arts; Fostering intercultural difference and favouring cultural diversity; Supporting oral tradition; Ensuring access for citizens to all sorts of community information; Providing adequate information services to local enterprises, associations and interests groups; Facilitating the development of information and computer literacy skills and; Supporting and participating in literacy activities and programs for all age group and initiating such activities if necessary.   Oderinde (1980) affirmed that the “foundation of Nigeria’s public libraries services was laid by non-Nigerians, and with funds from abroad”. It was only in 1950s that the government of the Federation of Nigeria started to encourage library development. It was argued that the UNESCO seminar on development of public libraries in Africa held at the University College, Ibadan in August 1953 was the starting point.

The Nigerian government has been culpable for this as little or no attention is given towards the development and funding of libraries in the budget. Even when it is captured in the budget, they are scarcely implemented. The management of libraries in Nigeria have not lived up to their expectation of sourcing for funds in developing libraries since the government has not done enough in developing them. This study therefore, looked into the different strategies through which revenue can be generated for the development and effective running of public libraries, a case study of Ibome-library, Uyo, Akwa-Ibom State, Nigeria.   Significance of the study The findings from this study will help to highlight the strategies through which public libraries can generate revenue, the effective and proper use of revenue generated and to identify the most effective means of generating revenue for public libraries.   Objective of the study This study was undertaken majorly to investigate the strategies for generating revenue for public libraries. The study also aims at: Determining the different avenues through which public libraries generate revenue. Ascertaining whether revenue generated by public libraries is channeled properly for the development and management of the libraries. Evaluate the most effective means of generating revenue for public libraries.   Research questions It is in view of the above problems that the following questions arise: What are the different avenues through which public libraries can generate revenue? Are revenue generated by public libraries used for proper management and development of the libraries? What are the most effective means of generating revenue for public libraries?   Research hypotheses Revenue generation does not significantly influence public libraries development in Nigeria. Revenue generation significantly influences public libraries development in Nigeria.   Limitations of the study The study was carried out to investigate the strategies for generating revenue for public libraries in Nigeria. The study is limited to Ibom e-library, in AkwaIbom, Uyo Local Government Area to be precise. This is because of her representative nature of all public librariesin AkwaIbom State, proximity to the researcher, time and financial constraints. Scope of the study This research work is on the strategies for generating revenue for public libraries in Nigeria, using Ibom e-library as a case study. Definition of terms Library: This is a building or room containing collections of books, periodicals, and sometimes films and recorded music for use or borrowing by the public or the members of an institution. Revenue: The amount of money that an organization actually receives during a specific period, including discounts and deductions for returned merchandise. Strategy: This is a plan of action designed to achieve a long-term or overall aim.  </p>\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR GENERATING REVENUE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STRATEGIES FOR GENERATING REVENUE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA", "id": 12}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>IMPACT OF STAFF TRAINING ON LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1.Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Libraries are established either by the government, individuals or corporate organizations for the use of the populace. According to the International Federation of Library Association and Institution, IFLA (2001), the public library is an organization established, supported and funded by the community, either through local, regional or national government or through some other form of community organization. It provides access to knowledge, information and works of imagination through a range of resources (financial, human and material resources) and services. Library users are usually made of people of different age range and educational qualifications – men, women, young adults and children. Staffing in a library system is made up of the director of library services, followed by the assistant chief librarian or deputy director. Their subordinates include all categories of librarians, library officers, library assistants, attendants, technicians and gardeners. These fall under the professionals, para-professionals and non-professionals all of whom should be qualified in terms of training and certification according to their levels. Training is a very important device in personnel management. Worker training and development as Adeniji (2011) said is an important programme that promotes the worker in an industrial set up. Considering the fact that information provision to every user is the mission of libraries, the need for training in this regard cannot be over emphasized. Just as Achebe (2005) said that libraries are local centres for information, a library worker whose work is to provide information for users in any way needs to be competent enough in any area he finds himself in the library. Tella and Popoola (2007) asserted that training is an essential strategy for motivating workers in the library as a service organization.

This definition is found lacking because training should be for managerial and nonmanagerial staff. A personnel training scheme, (PTS) as Abba &amp;Dawha (2009) called it is one that seeks to improve work performance. They cited Slee (1997) who saw this as a systematic approach to staff development and continuing education that is usually in form of a programme of learning opportunities aimed at ensuring that workers continue to acquire and adapt their skills and knowledge to a changing environment. They stressed that a well-trained worker knows the scope and expectations of their jobs and will be able to add building blocks to his/her expertise as he/she progresses. Everybody needs self-development professionally. By attending seminars and conferences, the managerial staff can improve professionally. Training is a public or private education programmes directly applicable to work situation. When there are lapses or loopholes in work efficiency and expected productivity, it means that the workers involved need more and better skills and knowledge to be gained through training.

It is the repository of information and information source. A library collects, organizes, stores and disseminates information. Thus, it is a resource centre for students, teachers, researchers and others. The library provides answers to specific and general information queries and problems.  The major, purpose of the library is to provide information, thus it is a repository of human experience not subject to the barriers of space and time. According to Lawal and Udofia (1994) the library meets the information needs of the users in four categories namely: i. Education to develop society, adults, children and to fill gap in memory. ii. Information to develop executive activities such as economics, social and commercial development.  iii. Aesthetic appreciation for culture, art, truth and judgement.  iv. Recreation to provide amusement, hobbies. The function of the library therefore is to implement, to enrich, to vitalize and humanize the educational programmes, as it strives to attain excellence in content, process and product. Being a carrier of knowledge, the library is a vital partner in knowledge, management and shares with all other instructional agents their responsibility for systematically designing, carrying out and evaluating the total process of learning and teaching (Davies, 1994). There are different types of libraries, which represents different categories of people professions and shades of opinion. We have the public library, academic library, National library, school library and special library.  A school library is an indispensable unit in any school, regardless of its educational philosophy. Thus an organized collection of book (reference books and for home reading) placed in a school under the care of a teacher-librarian for teachers and students.  In the words of Iroha (2001) a school library is a collection of a wide variety of library materials and resources housed in each school centrally organized by staff, professionally prepared to offer services to students and teachers that will enrich and support the educational enterprises. This is to say, a school library assists and supports the educational programme of the school by storing instructional materials for use in teaching and learning. Harold (2000) is of the view that a school library is an organized collection of books placed in a school for use by both the teachers and students. School libraries can also be said to be a miniaturized intellectual powerhouse or information centre found in primary schools, secondary schools and teacher training colleges. That is, it is a stepping stone towards a child’s intellectual development.  Perhaps, Onwubiko and Uzoigwe (2004) define a school library as the learning laboratory of the school equipped with books, magazines, newspaper, audio visual materials, aimed at enhancing effective teaching and learning on the part of teachers and students. In order to create an environment full of literature and cultivate the habit of using information materials for necessary teaching tools lead to the establishment of school libraries. The then Eastern Nigeria Ministry of Education recognized school library “as an education institution”. The provision of school libraries to improve standard in education delivery has been well articulated in the National policy of Education (1999). Emphasizing the need for school libraries, the policy states among others. “Libraries are one of the most important education services. Every state ministry of education needs to provide funds for the establishment of libraries in all our educational institutions”. A good library is a sine-qua-non for qualitative education and an instrument for the enhancement and the utilization of the library resources by students. It serves the purpose of inspiration, communication among students and the fulfillment of programme in the curriculum. The proper utilization has enabled students to seek knowledge in books in order that in the process, they may become efficient and enthusiastic readers and also the integration on the use of new media encourage them to become adaptive to the use of audio visuals, thus creating room for relaxation and enjoyment. As the school has a need for students, so far as their mind is concerned, to develop the abilities to think. Contemporary library media programmes have approached this task through concerted and articulated efforts designed not only to provide students with an appreciation of literature, but also to teach them how to locate, retrieve and evaluate the work of information contained in the graphic recorded and printed records in the belief that such skills are essential for survival in a rapidly changing world. The library is not just a reservoir of knowledge, information and human experiences but also has made provision of accessing this treasure. Beswick (1975) sees school libraries as a continuing change in the pattern of school teaching and learning away from instruction and towards exploration. In the opinion of Allen and Allen (1973), Ezewu (1987), the whole essence of libraries are two fold. Service and instruction service which involves provision of whatever materials, equipment, assistance and guidance that are required by the user. One cannot talk of the effective utilization of library resources without considering the role of the teacher-librarians. The teacher-librarian in other words known as the library media specialist promote access to a broad range of information and ideas, in order to assist students in acquiring the knowledge and skills that will equip them to not only to locate but also evaluate and use information effectively and thereby becoming information literate. Their services and tasks contribute directly to the development of these skills. These include collection development, organizations for retrieval of materials and information, information guidance services, material production, student instruction and instructional development services. School libraries are more concentrated on the physical object collected rather than their intellectual contents i.e. (stressing, cover over content). All too often they regrettably also provide instruction in every conceivable skill, and in every form of information sources available. Individual students fundamental mental processes, including their developmental aspects are often neglected and the implication for both teachers and students of helping the young develop the ability to think about how they are using information to solve problem are frequently ignored. These and others are among the militators to effective utilization of library resources by secondary school students. 1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM  This study tries to find out how and why students use the school library resources and the factors that militate against their use of the school library resources. Many school libraries do not have reasonable collection of library materials and trained librarian to manage the library, and some schools do not have libraries at all, especially in rural areas. As a result, students are not encouraged to utilize the resources of the library. 1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY The objectives of this study are as follow:  i. To investigates the problem that hinders effective utilization of information resources in the library by students. ii. To identify the resources available for study students’ use and know the satisfaction they derived.  iii. To determines the particular period students visit the library. iv. To determine the purpose for students utilization of school library.  v. To determine the extent to which the students’ use of library resources satisfy their information need.  vi. To determine if students’ background such as socio-economic background parental level of education, occupation, facilities at home, quality of residence family size are significant factors in the utilization of library resources. 1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS  The following research questions have been formulated to guide this work:  i. At what period do students visit the library? ii. What are the impediments or hindrance to the utilization of library resources by the secondary school students? iii. What are the resources available in the school library for use by students and what satisfaction do they derive? iv. What are the reasons for students’ use of the library? v. To what extent are student’s uses of the library satisfying their information needs? 1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY The study is on the problems of the utilization of school libraries resources by the students of secondary school in Anambra State; specifically by students of Christ the King College (C.K.C) and Dennis Memorial Grammar School (DMGS) Onitsha. This research focuses on students’ attitude and view concerning visiting the library and the level of satisfaction they derive after utilizing or using the resources the target of the study is to identify basic problems and proffer solutions to them. 1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY The study is aimed at examining the utilization of library resources by secondary school students in their school libraries. The study will go a long way in providing basic information to school principals and education board on the need for the development of school library resources that will appeal to both the educational and recreational needs of students. The result of the study will reveal the general state of school libraries and their resources and the student’s views and attitude towards the use of the library. One significance of this study is that the teacher-librarian would be able to put forward proposals to their principal for the betterment of library and information services to the students of their schools.  It is hoped that the findings and recommendations of the study will contribute immensely to the improvement of the management and utilization of school libraries resources in Anambra State. 1.7 BRIEF HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF DENNIS MEMORIAL GRAMMAR SCHOOL ONITSHA Dennis Memorial Grammar School was founded on January 24, 1925; it was built as a grammar school.

Selection is the process of choosing while acquisition is the process of obtaining library materials (Anyanwu, et al, 2006) selection must precede acquisition, what to select depends on the type of library since the library is interested in serving primarily its clientese which could be homogenous or heterogeneous (Oduagwu, 2002). Book selection is used as a generic term covering the selection of both book and non-book materials for library. Acquisition on the other hand is a process of obtaining books and other items for the library, documentation centre, or archives (Harrods, 2000). Acquisition is carried out through purchase, gift, exchange and legal deposit. Provision of current information which supports the curriculum of the parent institution is as a result of selection and acquisition in the academic libraries. The following factors are considered in selecting materials for academic libraries,  i. Aims and objective of the institution ii. The number of faculty members iii. The number of departments / subjects areas iv. Research and teaching needs v. The nature of materials required in terms of book and non-book. There is a specific library acquisition policy which specify the type and range of items to be selected and acquired. The purpose of the acquisition policy is to serve as a reference for the library staff to follow when assessing potential acquisition for the library collections including print and non-print materials, electronic and other type of resources. The mission of the acquisition policy is to ensure that the selection of library resources supports the educational need of the students, administrations and staff of the institution. Anyanwum et al, 2006 Started that selection is of very important because of literature explosion, reduction in library budget, reduction in income of library users and pressure from the both the publishers and the library users. Grey literature is one of the materials selected and acquired in Libraries. Grey literature is defined as…”information produced on all levels of government, academia, business and industry in electronic and print formats not controlled by commercial publishing” i.e. where publishing is not the primary activity of the producing body” M. C. Debachere has written that it is easier to describe, rather than define grey literature. Collectively, the term covers an extensive range of materials that can be found easily through conventional channels such as publishers, “but which frequently is original and usually recent” Peter Hirtle in Broadsides Vs. Grey literature defines is as: The quasi-printed reports, unpublished but circulated papers, unpublished proceedings of conferences, printed programs from conferences and other non-unique materials which seems to constitute the bulk of our modern manuscript collections (Hirtle, 1991). Dissertations also make up an important part of grey literature, as well as meeting papers” or preprints that are given out before conferences and meetings, and they could end up as journal articles (Augur 1989, 63). Grey literature is of paramount importance in the library because, it serves scholars and lay readers alike with research summaries, facts, statistics, and other data that after a more comprehensive view of the topic of interest. In all, selection and acquisition of grey literature in libraries therefore, is the process of choosing and obtaining this kind of literature in libraries. 1.2 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE TWO SCHOOLS UNDER STUDY 1.2.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON FEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, OWERRI (FUTO) LIBRARY. According to the FUTO library guide and regulations, the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO) library was initially located at lake Nwaebere campus as a temporary site while the permanent library was under construction at Ihiagwa. The preparatory work for the library began in June 1981 with J. C. Anafulu as the pioneer University Librarian. A classroom block was selected and converted into a make-shift library.  It was filled with shelves for ten (10) thousand volumes of library materials. Other members of the professional staff joined in October to prepare for the opening on the 19th November 1981. at the time of the opening, approximately 2,500 volumes were on the shelves. However, the importance of journals to the science and technology oriented University community was re-organised at an early stage and a list of about 600 tittles were ordered for. In the month of May, 1982, the reserved collections was introduced, the total volume of books held by the library reached six thousands (600), and borrowing privileges were then extended to students. After two years of operating in classroom blocks, the University library was moved to a permanent building in the first week of September, 1983. the building was modified to meet the requirements of a growing university library. On the 17th of May, 1983, the Library moved along with the university to its permanent site. On arrival, the pilot plant house of the school of science was immediately converted to a library. In no time it was realised that the building was too small to accommodate the ever-increasing stock, staff and library users. As such, the library moved partly to the library phase IV in 1995, thereby making available two library building fo use: Pilot plant and phase IV library building. The Pilot Plant Library building. The pilot plant library was left within serials section, technical section for catalogue and classification, acquisition section, the information technology unit, documentation and Archives section. The pilot plant library is regarded as reference library s no borrowing is done there. The library phase IV which was originally intended to be a reading room is centrally situated at a convenient distance from the Hostels. The organogram of the library materials is situated at the entrance to the Library. The library has seating capacity of about 500. There are various types of materials in the university library which are separated into six collections. These are the reference the loans, the reserve and the serial collections. They also include documentation / Achieves and information technology collections. A breakdown of the section to date is shown as follows: Books 60,000 Bound periodicals 4,850 Documents 3,200 Maps 948 Total of all formats 68,670 (Excluding current periodicals) Current periodicals 41 Library serials holdings 1,184 CD-ROM collection 64 EBSCO database (CDROM) 50 1.2.2 BACKROUND INFORMATION ON IMO STATE UNIVERSITY (IMSU) LIBRARY Imo state university library, Owerri is as old as its institution which was establish in 1981, following a law passed on the 13th of April 1981, by the Imo State House of Assembly during the Mbakwe’s Administration. The school was officially opened in two campuses, i.e. Aba and Etiti in October 1982. The school was later moved to Okigwe by the then Military Administratrion, major General Ike Nwachukwu (Rtd) but was relocated to Owerri from Okigwe in 1992 as contained in the law establishing the institution. Imo state university was opened in 1993 at Lake Nwaebere campus before the admissions of students, and Dr. Omonogbo became the first acting Librarian of the university library. Since then the stock has been increasing and it is of note that the library stock has received gifts both in cash and in materials from individuals and European union, British consulates and all activities of the goal of its parent institution. As stated in the Imo State University library fact sheets, the library system of the school consist of ten libraries; They are as follows: i. The Main library ii. The Law Library iii. The college of Medical library iv. The library of the faculty of Business Administration v. The department of the Architectural Library vi. Social Science Library vii. Humanities Library viii. Department of Education Library ix. Quantity Surveying Library x. The Agricultural Library The activities of all these libraries are co-ordinated from the main library which is the institutional library. This is to enable to provide efficient and effective services to its clients in various faculties and colleges of the institution. 1.3 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM Selection and acquisition of grey literature has always been problematic. As Charles .P. Augur points out in his book, the core reason for difficulties in identifying and acquiring this kinds of literature are due to its :poor bibliographic information and control, non-professional layout and, low print runs” (Augur 1989,3). The implementation of bibliographic control through ISBN, ISSN and report number has been somewhat helpful, but also disorganized. For instance, reports which makes up the lion’s share of grey literature, do not use ISBN as a rule Instead, reports numbering was intrated as a means to introduce standardisation. The problem is that, these numbers were designed to include subject matter, date, form, agency, section, additional data and consequently are quite long and confusing. In addition some categories of this kind of literature do contain security restrictions. M.C Debachere points out that problems arise in libraries when a pation request a particular document and it is not apparent where to begin the search. (Debachere, 1995, 95). 1.4 SCOPE/LIMITATION OF THE STUDY This research work is focused on challenges of selection and acquisition of grey literature in libraries. It is extremely difficult to conduct a research of this nature that embraces all libraries in Nigeria, this is because the vital data for such a study will be difficult to come by. Therefore, to ensure the efficient and effective collection of relevant data, the researcher brought the scope of the study to a more manageable size and will restrict the investigation to only two academic libraries, namely; Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO) and Imo State University (IMSU) libraries both of Owerri. It is natural to encounter problems in a study like this because it’s broader wise. In as much as time and financial constraint becomes my shortcoming, in terms of transportation and photocopying materials, this research work is limited to internet search and interviews form acquisition librarians of two schools stated above. 1.5 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY This study is carried to:  i. Identify the importance of grey literature in libraries. ii. To find out its selection and acquisition process. iii. To know the different types of grey literature. iv. To know what challenges are encounter in acquiring grey literature and how to face them. v. To know what constitute the grey literature and who uses them. vi. To identify the problems of grey literature and their possible solutions. 1.6 RESEARCH QUESTION 1. Is there need for grey literature in the academic libraries? 2. Does your library select and acquire grey literature? 3. If it does what kind of grey literature does it acquire? 4. Does your library encounter any challenges in acquiring the grey literature? 5. If yes, what challenges does it encounter? 6. When last did your library acquire the grey literature? 1.7 AIMS/PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The aim of this study is to fulfil the basic requirement for award of National Diploma (HND) in the department of Library and Information Science, Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Owerri. The purpose of this research work is to contribute to the development of library collection and to make effective tool in grey literature as management tool in an academic library. The study will also add to the literature of librarianship as well as be of immense help to the students, lecturers, librarians, schools and the nation at large. 1.8 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY This study is meant to provide assistance to those in scholarly environments wishing to extend their research capabilities. This study will also save the scholars and lay readers alike with research summaries, facts, and other data that offer more comprehensive view of their topic interest. Quick access, greater flexibility, and opportunity to go into considerable details when necessary are all the significance this study will provide to scholars/students. The study also is very significant to students who may wish to replicate the work for better research as it serve as reference source. 1.9 DEFINATION OF THE TERMS 1.9.1 SELECTION: It is the act of choosing items or library materials yet to be acquired for the satisfaction of library clienteles. It is the act of choice and a quantity of variety choosen from the lists of publication. It must precedes acquisition because, it is only when you select that you can acquire what you have selected. 1.9.2 ACQUSTITION: This is the act of obtaining materials selected. It is the act of making available the library materials that was selected from the list of publication, and it is done through the following channels, purchase, gifts, inter-library loan or exchange, legal deposit, etc. It is a term used for provision of library materials. 1.9.3 GREY LITERATURE: This is the term used to cover all publications that are not controlled by commercial publishing interests. That is, those publications that are issued by government, academia, business and industry in both print and electronic format. Grey literature comprises of newsletters, reports, working papers, theses, government documents, bulletins, fact sheets, symposia, conference proceedings etc. Virtually everything we read outside of journals and books can be considered grey literature. 1.9.4 LIBRARIES: When there is more than one library, there are libraries. A library is not a store house of books as commonly believed by some people (layman), rather it is a collection of books and non-book materials organised for use. It is a store house of information and knowledge. It is an agency that is involved in the selection, acquisition, organisation, preservation, storage, retrieval and dissemination of information through books and non-book material for users. 1.9.5 A library could also be “a building room or set of rooms containing an organised collection of prints and/or non-print materials for the use of the public or of some particular portion of it (Oduagwu, 2002).  </p>\n\nCHALLENGES OF SELECTION AND ACQUISITION OF GREY LITERATURE IN NIGERIAN LIBRARIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CHALLENGES OF SELECTION AND ACQUISITION OF GREY LITERATURE IN NIGERIAN LIBRARIES", "id": 15}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHALLENGES OF SELECTION AND ACQUISITION OF GREY LITERATURE IN NIGERIAN LIBRARIES</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE </p> <p>1.0 INTRODUCTION </p> <p>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p> Selection and acquisition are terms used in provision of library materials.

Acquisition is carried out through purchase, gift, exchange and legal deposit. Provision of current information which supports the curriculum of the parent institution is as a result of selection and acquisition in the academic libraries. The following factors are considered in selecting materials for academic libraries,  i. Aims and objective of the institution ii. The number of faculty members iii. The number of departments / subjects areas iv. Research and teaching needs v. The nature of materials required in terms of book and non-book. There is a specific library acquisition policy which specify the type and range of items to be selected and acquired. The purpose of the acquisition policy is to serve as a reference for the library staff to follow when assessing potential acquisition for the library collections including print and non-print materials, electronic and other type of resources.

It is the act of making available the library materials that was selected from the list of publication, and it is done through the following channels, purchase, gifts, inter-library loan or exchange, legal deposit, etc. It is a term used for provision of library materials. 1.9.3 GREY LITERATURE: This is the term used to cover all publications that are not controlled by commercial publishing interests. That is, those publications that are issued by government, academia, business and industry in both print and electronic format. Grey literature comprises of newsletters, reports, working papers, theses, government documents, bulletins, fact sheets, symposia, conference proceedings etc. Virtually everything we read outside of journals and books can be considered grey literature. 1.9.4 LIBRARIES: When there is more than one library, there are libraries. A library is not a store house of books as commonly believed by some people (layman), rather it is a collection of books and non-book materials organised for use. It is a store house of information and knowledge. It is an agency that is involved in the selection, acquisition, organisation, preservation, storage, retrieval and dissemination of information through books and non-book material for users. 1.9.5 A library could also be “a building room or set of rooms containing an organised collection of prints and/or non-print materials for the use of the public or of some particular portion of it (Oduagwu, 2002).  </p>\n\nCHALLENGES OF SELECTION AND ACQUISITION OF GREY LITERATURE.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CHALLENGES OF SELECTION AND ACQUISITION OF GREY LITERATURE.", "id": 16}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>IMPACT OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY IN THE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION IN SPECIAL LIBRARIES (A Case Study Of Nation Mathematical Centre, Abuja).</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION 1.1. BACKGROUND OF STUDY Information technology has been evolving rapidly during the last helf of the 20th century particularly since the 1960s and 1970s. it has revolutionaries the media and its modes of computing, storing and communicating information. The changes in the collection and distribution of information have affected society in many ways. These of information communication technologies in libraries has tremendously increased because it provides enhanced user satisfaction, cost-effectiveness, ensure faster and simpler programmes, resulting in rapid responses and easier operational procedures. Generally, the use of ICT in libraries includes on-line access to library collection, the use of bibliographic databases, on-line literature searching and the sue of personal computers. Information communication technologies (ICT) makie use of computing, and communications, facilities in support of teaching and learing. Information, communication and technology intail the acquisition, processing, storage and dissemination of information by means of computers, office machines and telecommunication, (Ehikhamena F. A. 1993). In other world, computer provides the processing, storage and retrieval capabilities while telecommunciaotn on provides the capability, for the transfer and communication of data from one work-station to another. Information communication technology is a term which encompasses the nation of the application of technologies to information handling, generation, storage, processing, retrieval, dissemination etc. (Marghalani M. A. 1987). In an increasing competitive environment the concern of managers of library and information services must not be only with survival of our library and information services, but also with their development within a clear and coherent policy framework. Just as in any other sector of eh economy, library services develop. There needs to be a clear view of the direction that development should take to best meet the developing needs of users. The new information age has permeated all aspects of human existence (spies, 1998). It has brought certain challenges to the academic world (Pinfield, 2001). In Nigeria, this challenge is even more critical today. It is apparent that any attempt to have meaningful academic communication can only be successful through the information and communication technology, which is the application of computer and its peripherals in communicating data within the shortest available time and over geographical spaces. This study is based on the availability and the utilization of ICT facilites used in libraries, since the library is the crux of academic activities, it is seen as an instrument of social change, public enlightment and national progress (Aboyade B. O 1982). It services as repository of information and knowledge that have provides the vital under-pining in the socio-economic, political and cultural sphere. In relating this function of libraries to information technologies, (Tamuno, O. G, 1997) comments that it is one thing to generate as much information as possible, it is quite another thing how ever, to make such information accessible and available when needed, which requires proper storage, processing accessibility and retrieval. The relevance of information communication and technologies in libraries, particularly in special libraries, is in activities concerned with information storage and retreiveal. These activities are concerned with in-house keeping routine such as acquisition, cataloguing, serials control, circulation, of library material and the collection fo management statistics. In libraries, information network has the potential for relieving human kind of many of its burdens. Networking refers to a broad system of computers terminates, video display units, telephone etc. which are use for data communication services. Therefore, to network in the special libraries parlance, involves the interconnection of computer terminals etc. the heart of information networking or connectivity is the issue of telecommunication, linking together libraries, librarian users in LOCAL AREAS NETWORK (LAN) or WIDE AREAS NETWORK (WAN) They endeavor to eliminate many of the repetitive and boring task related to the processing and communication of information. The volume and re of the generation fo information as well as the demand for it has made its conservation and storage and manipulation by electronic means inperative in an information conscious society. Advances in modern technology have naturally led to th de-emphasing of the traditional method of attaining various information processing and transfer objectives hence the introduction of computer and other modern information technologies in the libraies. THE EFFECT / IMPACT OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATON AND TECHNOLOGIES ON DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION IN SPECIAL LIBRARIES The presence and usage of the technological infrastructure in information retrieval and dissemination have helped to have better access to information.  - Encourage information and resource sharing among information institution. - Contribute to industrial bibliographic control. - Facilitates access to international data base. - Leads to efficient and effective delivery of information services. - Also facilitates generation and dissemination of management report. - Gives accurate and up-to-date information. - It enhances the status of the information professionals. 1.2 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF NATIONAL MATHEMATICAL CENTRE, ABUJA. The National Mathematical centre came into being on January 1, 1988 although the decree (Decree No.40) giving it a legal existence but was not promulgated until December 12, 1989. The creation of the centre was as a result of the mounting concern shown by the nation as a whole, about the decline in the number of mathematical scientists and the interest shown by students in the study of mathematics, theoretical physics, and computer science generally. The National mathematical centre was established by the Federal government to develop appropriate initiatives and resources of international standing for re-awaking and sustaining interest in the mathematical sciences at all levels in Nigeria, and also as an adequate response to the dramatic decline in the production of teachers and specialists in the mathematical sciences at all levels. Presently, the centre considers itself as nations apex research coordinating institute in the mathematical sciences. We wish to state that we are committed to strategic planning as a way of making the centre to fully realize the vision of its founding fathers as a centre of Excellence in the mathematical sciences in the West Africa sub-region and more importantly, to creating enabling environment favorable to speedy technological and industrial revolution by as promoting manpower capacity building appropriate to jumpstart the growth process. Decree No.40 of 1989 Establishing the National Mathematical Centre, Abuja. The genral aims and objectives of the National mathematical centre, as spelt out in the law establishing it (decree 40 of 1989) , are as follows:  1. To train and develop high level personnel in mathematical sciences, including mathematics, statistics, computer science and theoretical physics for Nigerian and African institutions. 2. To create a Resource centre to serve National and international communities as a focal point for advanced research and training in mathematical sciences and appilications. 3. To enhance collaborations among mathematical scientists especially between young Nigerian scientists and other advanced and experienced scientists from within and outside Nigeria. 4. To stimulate enthusiasm for the physical sciences in young Nigeria students and scholars. 5. To prepare Nigeria for a leading role in mathematical sciences. 6. To attract good mathematical scientists from all over the world into services of Nigerians. 7. To encourage and support activities leading to the improvement of the teaching and learning of mathematical sciences at all levels. 8. To conduct series of specialized lecturers or courses for the purpose of upgrading postgraduates students in the field of mathematical sciences to alevel where they can begin to understand research papers and seminars.  9. To conduct series of specialized lecturers for advanced post-graduate as well as post-doctoral and other participants based on a set of pre-assigned research papers, with the objective of generating “questions” that would be collected, discussed and used to determine new research directions for the participants. 10. To conduct seminars, workshops and symposia in such areas as the Academic Board of Centre may, from time to time, determine or plan. The National Mathematical centre is one of the 10 institutes selected as the first nodes of the network of international science and technology centers for sustainable development in the south, and its mandate is computer software research, development and application. 1.3 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM Nigeria, being one of the few countries of the world, which began to adopt information technologies in 1990s, is backward but somewhat fortunate because generally, the world of ICT-based libraries is still in its infancy. A number of problems contribute to this situation. 1. Administration barriers: This problem is much more acute in public university libraries than private university libraries and special libraries. Administrators, policy makers, and government executives do not take seriously the importance of ICT. Moreover, library administrators have failed to make its importance clear. Lack of knowledge of technological development has created a significance barrier to the installation or development of ICT facilities in libraries. 2. Lack of shared initiatives: Inadequate shared initiatives have made plans of ICT application in libraries very low. 3. Lack of skilled manpower: Library professionals in Nigeria over the past few years have not had adequate knowledge regarding computer applications and automation. 4. Lack of financial support: Inadequate financial support has made possibility of ICT application in libraries more complex. 5. Lack of infrastructure: Inadequate physical facilities hamper the growth of ICT. Telecommunications infrastructure and an uninterrupted power supply are crucial needs for Nigeria. 6. Lack of ICT resources: ICT means more than the use of computer. Less attention has been paid to other communication and related technologies. Some libraries have no internet connection. Most have a manual circulation operation. They have no barcode readers for use in automated circulation. Most libraries are using microcomputers only with no server in most of the libraries. 7. Absence of local resources: Most of the libraries use the CDS/ISIS in developing other software. 8. Psychological barriers: The reluctance of library personnel to accept new technologies hinders the development of ICT-based libraries. 9. Lack of Networks: There is no network, in the true sense of the term, among the libraries of Nigeria. 1.4 AIMS AND PURPOSE  This research work examines the use of ICT by special libraries in Nigeria in the dissemination of information in the educational system. Its aims is to reveal both the levels of information and communication technologies and plans for the future. The findings of a structural survival questionnaire are analyzed, providing information in available computer facilitates, library automation, internet connectivity, technical support, expenditure and ICT strategies. This is followed by a devalued case study of library services of the National Mathematical Centre, Abuja. This paper attempts to assess the contribution of ICT in providing information dissemination to Nigerians through libraries especially those that are specialized in operation and structure in areas such as education and research, trade and commerce, agriculture, health and recreation, etc. 1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS 1. Does ICT impact positively on educational performance in schools?  2. Does the use of ICT in special libraries improve attainment levels of users? 3. In Nigeria, is there a positive association between the length of time of ICT use and student’s performance in educational work? 4. Do schools with higher levels of ICT literary demonstrate scores than those with lower levels of ICT literacy? 5. Do schools with ICT resources achieve better results than those that are poorly equipped with ICT resources? 1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATION  Discussion on this topic will be stricted to special libraries. Furthermore, study is generalized on institution such as polytechnic, colleges of education, universities-private, state and federal around the country, with references on how it affects administrators and users, the National Mathematical centre, Abuja is taken as a case study. In addition, it attempts to asses the contribution of special libraries in helping Nigerians access and disseminate information digitally via the internet. Ti also asseseed the major types of information disseminated through special libraries. 1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY The study gives a representative overview of the attainment level of library staff in an important area of professional competence, and shows the importances of addressing the gap between the desired levels of ICT litracy and the actual level as it helps in information dissemination in special libraries. This is done with special emphasis on the national mathematical centre Abuja, which is a government library with specialized / concentrated interest in the dissemianto of the knowledge of mathematics generally in Nigeria. 1.8 METHODOLOGY In carrying out a research work one has to concern himself or herself about the methods of data collection. These include the various ways or means by which the research data are collected. In carrying out research work of this nature, the researcher had to conduct and intensive investigation into definerable problems. In the process of my data collction, the following data collection instruments were used: a. Questionnaire  b.

Since the down of history, man had generally requires information for his day to living information is required in decision and in other aspects of life. To function and be relevant, every society needs information. According to bent and melacklam, information is the life-blood of modern organisation. Owing to the pervasiveness of information in the life of organisation some writers have tried to analysis organizational function in term of receiving, recording, arranging and giving information. At the top management levels, it is vital in planning and strategies decision making.  Hence information is said to be data of value in decision making. It is critical resources that enable an organisation to function and flourish. It is first among the other corporate resources because decisions relating to others depend on it. But the collection processing and dissemination of information are not trouble free. This is basically due to the nature of information. Information is indispensable to all processes and is essential to natural development. It is both a national and international resource for social political, religious, economic, cultural as well as technological development. Information is important as the three basic necessities of life which are water, food and shelter and so should be given enough priority in order to achieve what is meant for. It is significant to note that information is useless unless it is used however, before information can be made use of, it has to be provided and the user of it has to be aware of it. In other words, the use of information depends on its availabllity and accessibility to users.  INFORMATION DEFINED. Information is the act of informiong or the condition of being informed or the communication of knowledge. The American library association glossary of library and information science (ALA) define information as all ideas, gfeats and imaginative works of mind whioch have been communicated, rcorded, published and distributed formally or in formally in any format. The new webster’s dictionary defines information as, the communication of news, knowledge obtained by search, study etc. it can also be considered as knowledge communicated concerning some particular facts, subjects or events. Information reducesuncertainty and adds to human knowledge. Information cvan be in two forms. Those that are pointers to other information and their sources which it provides substantive information, that is information itself. Information is regarded as resources for use, and its generation and use for efficiency nd effectiveness is a very demanding and stressful task because any information that lis not organised for future use may be wasted. Also, the relevance ttached to information makes people to seek it in diverse ways and for diverse needs. (hanson 1978) writes: information is normally intended for use rather than interest. It is sought by their final users for particular purpose in particular circumstances. It is of maximum potential use to person who wnts it when it meets his need not only in terms of general, subjects too. Needs can be seen as a requirement fro subsistence or for carrying out some function or activities. Thus, information needs refer to information demands, requirements, wants or de sires for some general and specific purpose. Kadiri describes need in relation to information as: a state of lack of desirable requisition or commodity i.e. information necessary to deal with a situation as an individual deems fit.  INFORMATION AND CHILDREN  Information needs and information seeking behaviour of children is defined as the provision of desirable, up to data factual knowledge to the children at the appropriate time to enhance their welfare and ways or patterns pursued by them in an attempt to resolve an information need or needs. Access to information is one of the human rights and each user of it should be able to get the right information he desires at the right time and place in the way he needs it. Information as a valuable commodity can be got from the library among other places and it is necessary that librarians satisfy users needs. In public libraries, the notion of book acquisition or children literature is important. Of greater value is how the books and other materials are presented to children fro effective use. As a result, there is need for public libraries to meet with the information needs nd information seeking behaviour of lchildren. This would not only enhance performance of the children, use of libraries but would go an long way in improving the services [rendered to children in public libraries. In addition, it would make for easy storage, processing, retrieval of information, dissemination and use. As information literacy becomes vital to functioning effectively in todays would, the public library has a responsibility in ensuring that the specific information and reference needs of children are adequately addressed. Children as reference client require skilled and considered assistance to locate information relevant to both their perceived and real needs. The public libraries meet those needs through the children section of the public library. A children section is an important resource to which children have easy access to information and utilization. It provides information in various formats. The children section provides pre-school programmes, story telling, reading competitive, riddles and joke among others. The library facilities education of children. It also performs vital function such as informational, educational, cultural and recreational services. Public libraries can play a major role in fostering in children the desire for education and helping them develop the skills for obtaining the kind of ever changing knowledge necessary to survive and prosper. Children by all means need information knowledge sake, self development, skill acquisition and to carry out a given assignment. BACKGROUND INFROMATION OF IMO STATE PUBLIC LIBRARY BOARD OWERRI. On 3rd February, 1976 more states were created in Nigeria and imo state was one of the states. It was carved out of the former east central state. As a result of this creation, the east central state library board broke into anambra and imo state library boards. However, it was only in September 1976 that the indigenous imo state staff in enugu transferred ;to Owerri to establish the administrative head quarters of the imo state library board. The movement was in part printing; bindery and reprography were the last to move by the end of September 1976. The asset and liabilities of the former east central state library board were shared prior to the movement. The anambra state  Library board retained the building and fixed assets while physical cash and information resources were shared.  Consequent to this, Owerri divisional library which was under completion was hurriedly finished and used as the head quarter. The new library was opened to the public on the 12th of November 1976 by the then military governor, Commander Godwin nidubiosi kanu. The building was designed to accommodate 85, 000 volumes. The sum of n35,909, 84 was said to be spent on the building at the time of its opening. Apart from this, additional buildings have been added. These are handicapped building which was opened on 1st November, 1989 and the administrative building and book exhibition which was taken over by the N.T.A. the library began its operation with a financial provision of some n564,837.66 for the financial year 1976/77. the sum was made up of n246,832.66 being financial inheritance from the east central state library board and 300,000 as financial provision by the imo state government. In addition a sum of n500, 000 was to cover its capital expenditure fro the year 1977. anambra and imo shared a considerable quantity of new books which had not been allocated prior to the creation of the states. Other material shared included 6 catalogues cabinets and card cards. Originally ordered for Owerri library some metal filing cabinets and a few typewriters. The library started its operatioin with a total of 100 staff and a stock of 1,380 volumes. At present, the total staff is 108 (December 2006) and in june – December 2007 the staff strength was 112. this history will be in complete without mentioning the carving out of abia state from imo state in September 1991. the resultant effect of this, is the emergence of abia state library, board. This led to the showing of the assests and liabilities between the new imo state library board and abia state library board. The shaving was completed in November 1991. its worthy of nite that most of the divisional libraries and branch libraries went to abia state. Out of 17 divisional and branch libraries, imo state inherited only 7. the first imo state library board was appointed in the 10th of November 1976 under the chairmanship of prof, a.o. anya. The chairman of the board from 1976 till data are shown in table .a.

Nwachukwu 5th 1999-2005 Mr. japhet Amadi 6th 2005-april2007 Dr. anozie ozurumba 7th April 2007 Mrs. A.n ndukwu The imo state library like other public libraries in and outsides Nigeria has strived to build up collection that relate to local interest and deals with general community. Today imo state library board has eleven branches located in various parts of the state, with the headquarter lat Owerri municipal. It has librarians. The public library of imo state renders services such as school library services, children library services, hand capped library services among others. The children library service was set up to cater fro the needs of pre-primary and primary school readers in the state. Holidays programmes are being organised for this group of readers every term. The library is divided into various sections. Such as administrative cataloguing, handicapped reference, acquisition, Nigeria, and children sections. In children’s section the way it is organised is quite different from the way the adult section is organised. STATEMENT OF PROBLEM  In strict pursuance of the objectives for which public libraries are established children with different information needs and various seeking have continued to flood the libraries looking for ways to achieve their pressing information needs. In doing this, children make a mess of the acquired materials and as a result material in the library are not properly organised. To properly store, organise and process knowledge that is children literature should be paramount in the minds of library staff in public libraries. This becomes fruitless if the children are not conversant with the information relating to the use of public libraries, how to satisfy their information needs. Children get disappointed for not getting what desired, their needs not met and their information seeking behaviour not identified. This study intends to investigate the children specific information needs, ways by which the children needs are met, the kind of materials consulted by children and reaction of the children when their needs are met and when their needs are not met. So, on the strength of the above, the following research questions are formulated; a. what are the children specific information needs b. How are the children needs met?  c. What are the types of materials used by children?  d. How do the children go about obtaining information they need? e. What are the children reactions when their needs are met and not met? f. What problems do children encounter in obtaining the information they need? AIM AND OBJECTIVE  1. identifying the information needs ;of children  2. finding out the ways in which children needs are met. 3. identify source of information available to children.  4. knowing the ways or patterns in which children seek information relating to their needs. 5. to determine problem encopuntered by children and also that of the libraries in disseminating information to children. 6. to attempt to provide recommendation and suggestion for procuring information for children. SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF STUDY Considering the time factor and financial constrints, the scope of this research is limitated to information needs and information seeking behaviour of children in public libraries. There is no limitation as to the source of information used for this study,- books, no-book material, journals, discussions public national, special libraries and information centres will fruitful utilized. The study has particular reference to imo state public library board Owerri. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY  This study is meant to extend the frontiers of human knowledge and solve most of the problems encountered in public libraries when dealing with children information needs and information seeking behaviour. It would also be of grate significance to staff of public and school/children libraries. Also to be director. Of public libraries as it would support plans for library development and input to improving services rendered to children. This study would serve as literature/reference material, for researchers in future and input to the literature available in this area of study. OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS INFORMATION The online dictionary of library and information science defined information as data presented in readily comprehensible form to which meaning has been attributed within the context of its use information knowledge.  INFORMATION NEEDS In 1967 information need was defined as an expression of the deficit of concreta information by an individual (collective or territorial) user solving a certain scientific or technical problem; it is said to be a necessity to acquire information about (or from) the suirendity enkvironment. Or any information a user ought to have whether the need is felt or not.  INFORMATION SEEKING BEHAVIOUR.  This is defined as patterns or paths pursued by an individual seeker or group of information seeker to solve or resolve an information need. Also Wilson (1999) defines it as those activities a person may engage in when identifying their own needs for information, searching for such information in any way, and using or transferring that information. CHILDREN  Children are taken to be young people within the age bracket of 0-12 0r 13 years. The term children is refers to the plural of the noun child. PUBLIC LIBRARIES Elizebeth Thomson (1971) defined the public library as an institution that exist to serve all resident of a commodity district or region and receive its financial support in a whole or part from public fund. It is also a place where children enjoy themselves in story telling. METHODOLOGY  The type of research designed to be use for this study is the survey research. Questionnaire will be distributed to children and staff of public library imo state. This will in essence give a proper under standing of the information needs and information seeking behaviour of children in public libraries. The data collection method is the interview and questionnaire methods which will give detailed information as the researcher will have to ask questions when facts are not very clear (this is for the interview method). The questionnaire will in the other hand give the respondents enough time to look properly into questions being asked.   </p> \n\nINFORMATION NEEDS AND INFORMATION SEEKING BEHAVIOUR OF CHILDREN IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INFORMATION NEEDS AND INFORMATION SEEKING BEHAVIOUR OF CHILDREN IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.", "id": 18}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>THE USE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES BY LIBRARY PROFESSIONALS IN DELTA STATE</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION<br/>Background to the Study</p> <p><br/>Today libraries are shifting their role from the custodian of traditional information resources to the provider of service-oriented digital an ICT-based information resources. Widespread use of computers, increased reliance on computer networks, rapid growth of the internet and explosion in the quality and quantity of information compelled libraries and library professionals to adopt new means and methods for the storage, retrieval, processing and dissemination of information (Quadri, 2009).<br/>In this age of globalization, the importance of ICT to library professionals cannot be over-emphasized. This is true because ICT facilitates quick and easy access to a wide range of information and information resources worldwide. In fact, it is now difficult to imagine a world without information technology (William &amp; Channaveeraiah, 2008). The provision and use of ICTs is part and parcel of the entire system to both the students, library professionals and the society at large. It is one thing to recognize the importance of ICTs and another to know if they are effectively used by library professionals. If ICTs are effectively put to use, the essence of acquiring them is to a large extent, justified (Quadri, 2009).<br/>Lowe and McAvley (2002) defined ICT as tools in the digital age used in the information profession for acquiring processing and communicating information. Similarly, Ebijuwa (2005) defined ICT as electronic tools used for collection, processing storage, transmission and dissemination of information. Haag (2002) sees ICT as any computer based tools that facilitate the search and retrieval as well as dissemination of information to information seekers and also supports the information processing needs of individuals, groups and organizations. In the view of Ehikhamenor (1993), ICT encompasses the acquisition, processing, storage and dissemination of information by means of computers, office machines and telecommunications. He further stated that while computers provide the processing, storage and retrieval facilities, telecommunications provide the facilities for the transfer or communication of data and information to users.<br/>With advances in ICTs, electronic information resources such as electronic books, electronic journals, CD-ROM databases, OPAC, online databases and the internet have launched the world and library professionals into an information age. In the developed world, no library professional can still rely on only traditional printed information resource to perform library services and operations effectively and efficiently. To library professionals, ICT is a significant development that provides tools for managing the vast quantity of information generated by modern society (Ebijuwa, 2005). With the emergence of ICTs, library professionals subscribe to e-journals, e-books, CD-Rom databases, online databases, web-based resources and a variety of other electronic resources. Library professionals participate in library consortia and build a network of information exchange via ICT facilities (Quadri, 2009).<br/>According to Khan and Bhatti (2008), a library professional is a person who looks after the storage and retrieval of information in the library. In the library, the library professional is usually a professional who is trained and educated to deal with information in a wide variety of formats and settings including the use of ICTs. Wordiq (2010) state that library professionals help users to navigate into the voyage of internet and evaluate information efficiently. Furthermore, library professionals after a helping hand for users to find out the required piece of information and to use it for personal and professional purposes.<br/>Rao and Babu (2001) opined that due to the advent of the internet, world-wide-web, ICT tools and proliferation of online catalogue, the role of the library professional has been changed. Now, library professionals are more efficient and have new roles as intermediary, facilitator, end-user trainer/educator, web organizer and designer, researcher, interface designer, knowledge manager/professional and provider of timely information via ICT-based resources. In the view of Career Overview (2011), with the advent of ICTs, library professionals should acknowledge and be knowledgeable in a variety of information sources and follow the new trends and advancements in computers, media and publishing. It is evident from the literature that information and communication technologies (ICTs) have affected positively the skills and responsibilities of library professionals in this new era. ICTs have changed not only the face of information but also the professional work ethic of library professionals. Technology demands high level of technical skill set from library professionals in order to make maximum use of new technological tools for providing effective and better services to users (Khan &amp; Bhatti, 2008).<br/>Library professionals are traditionally information brokers, they deal with the packaging and dissemination of information for people in the society. The need for the recognition and use of information by all sectors of the society has always been of paramount interest to the library professionals with the result that they are always in the vanguard for the creation of awareness of information need, access, retrieval and utilization (Ugboma, 2006).<br/>Book fairs, workshops, seminars and readership campaigns are some of the strategies that had been employed in the past to create an informed society.<br/>However, in the recent times, campaigns for the use of ICTs have been added in Nigeria, this campaign started in-house, that is, among and for the library professional themselves. This is evident from the themes of conferences and Annual General Meetings of the Nigerian Library Association, which since has been strengthening libraries and library professionals for new information age through ICT. It is obvious that library professionals are conscious of the need for them to acquire ICT knowledge and use ICT in order to function effectively in the new digital age (Ugboma, 2006).<br/>According to Ifidon (2003), for any library professional to function effectively in this information and digital age; it is imperative, therefore, that library professionals need to use ICT in the discharge of their duties, which is, matching information to users.<br/>Much more than before, information seeking process transcends the simple librarian-client relationship of question and answer to involve a whole new, more complex process of advisory, search, retrieval and delivery vis-à-vis ICE-based resources (Madu &amp; Adeniran, 2000).<br/>In a changing environment when most of the library services are ICT-based, it is important for library professionals to be well informed and updated regarding developments in ICT and therefore use ICT for library services and operations. Srivastava (2008) conducted a study to determine the extent of usage of ICT components by library professionals and found that ICT components form an integral part of library operations and services. The study revealed that library professionals use ICT resources in library services and operations. Also, DOS/UNIX databases, library application software, CD-ROM databases, word processing, bar-coding, multimedia, etc are important to library professionals.<br/>Similarly, Ramesh and Parameswaran (1999) conducted a study on the automation of public library and information services in and around Chennai and the attitude of library professionals towards the application of ICT. The results showed that the library professionals have a positive attitude towards the application and use of ICTs for library operations and services. Also, the library professionals showed their keen interest in professional development vis-à-vis ICT usage to keep pace with the trends of electronic information era. The study concluded that ICT applications and usage among the library professionals improved communication and helped in enhancing technical knowledge, providing better services, improving library status, change information handling methods and reduce work-load (Ramesh &amp; Parameswaran, 1999).<br/>Hence, this study seeks to investigate the use of information and communication technology by library professionals in Delta State.</p> <p>Statement of the Problem<br/>Library profession is revolutionizing significantly in many aspects. The emergence of new information and communication technologies, the internet, world wide web, among others pose new challenges for library professionals therefore, it requires library professionals to become positively energetic, equipped with greater skills and capabilities to survive and thrive in this new digital environment (Khan &amp; Bhatti, 2008). Despite the afore-mentioned positivity, library professionals in Nigerian Libraries are still lagging behind in the adoption, application and use of ICTs in the library profession. This is as a result of certain constraints such as poor budgetary allocation, inadequate ICT infrastructure in libraries, ineffective leadership, low professional status, poor information literacy skills and digital literacy, inadequately trained and skilled ICT manpower, limited ICT resources, insufficient communication skills and poor power supply.

Widespread use of computers, increased reliance on computer networks, rapid growth of the internet and explosion in the quality and quantity of information compelled libraries and library professionals to adopt new means and methods for the storage, retrieval, processing and dissemination of information (Quadri, 2009). In this age of globalization, the importance of ICT to library professionals cannot be over-emphasized. This is true because ICT facilitates quick and easy access to a wide range of information and information resources worldwide. In fact, it is now difficult to imagine a world without information technology (William &amp; Channaveeraiah, 2008). The provision and use of ICTs is part and parcel of the entire system to both the students, library professionals and the society at large. It is one thing to recognize the importance of ICTs and another to know if they are effectively used by library professionals. If ICTs are effectively put to use, the essence of acquiring them is to a large extent, justified (Quadri, 2009). Lowe and McAvley (2002) defined ICT as tools in the digital age used in the information profession for acquiring processing and communicating information. Similarly, Ebijuwa (2005) defined ICT as electronic tools used for collection, processing storage, transmission and dissemination of information. Haag (2002) sees ICT as any computer based tools that facilitate the search and retrieval as well as dissemination of information to information seekers and also supports the information processing needs of individuals, groups and organizations. In the view of Ehikhamenor (1993), ICT encompasses the acquisition, processing, storage and dissemination of information by means of computers, office machines and telecommunications. He further stated that while computers provide the processing, storage and retrieval facilities, telecommunications provide the facilities for the transfer or communication of data and information to users. With advances in ICTs, electronic information resources such as electronic books, electronic journals, CD-ROM databases, OPAC, online databases and the internet have launched the world and library professionals into an information age. In the developed world, no library professional can still rely on only traditional printed information resource to perform library services and operations effectively and efficiently. To library professionals, ICT is a significant development that provides tools for managing the vast quantity of information generated by modern society (Ebijuwa, 2005). With the emergence of ICTs, library professionals subscribe to e-journals, e-books, CD-Rom databases, online databases, web-based resources and a variety of other electronic resources. Library professionals participate in library consortia and build a network of information exchange via ICT facilities (Quadri, 2009). According to Khan and Bhatti (2008), a library professional is a person who looks after the storage and retrieval of information in the library. In the library, the library professional is usually a professional who is trained and educated to deal with information in a wide variety of formats and settings including the use of ICTs. Wordiq (2010) state that library professionals help users to navigate into the voyage of internet and evaluate information efficiently. Furthermore, library professionals after a helping hand for users to find out the required piece of information and to use it for personal and professional purposes. Rao and Babu (2001) opined that due to the advent of the internet, world-wide-web, ICT tools and proliferation of online catalogue, the role of the library professional has been changed. Now, library professionals are more efficient and have new roles as intermediary, facilitator, end-user trainer/educator, web organizer and designer, researcher, interface designer, knowledge manager/professional and provider of timely information via ICT-based resources. In the view of Career Overview (2011), with the advent of ICTs, library professionals should acknowledge and be knowledgeable in a variety of information sources and follow the new trends and advancements in computers, media and publishing. It is evident from the literature that information and communication technologies (ICTs) have affected positively the skills and responsibilities of library professionals in this new era. ICTs have changed not only the face of information but also the professional work ethic of library professionals.

Book fairs, workshops, seminars and readership campaigns are some of the strategies that had been employed in the past to create an informed society. However, in the recent times, campaigns for the use of ICTs have been added in Nigeria, this campaign started in-house, that is, among and for the library professional themselves. This is evident from the themes of conferences and Annual General Meetings of the Nigerian Library Association, which since has been strengthening libraries and library professionals for new information age through ICT. It is obvious that library professionals are conscious of the need for them to acquire ICT knowledge and use ICT in order to function effectively in the new digital age (Ugboma, 2006). According to Ifidon (2003), for any library professional to function effectively in this information and digital age; it is imperative, therefore, that library professionals need to use ICT in the discharge of their duties, which is, matching information to users. Much more than before, information seeking process transcends the simple librarian-client relationship of question and answer to involve a whole new, more complex process of advisory, search, retrieval and delivery vis-à-vis ICE-based resources (Madu &amp; Adeniran, 2000). In a changing environment when most of the library services are ICT-based, it is important for library professionals to be well informed and updated regarding developments in ICT and therefore use ICT for library services and operations. Srivastava (2008) conducted a study to determine the extent of usage of ICT components by library professionals and found that ICT components form an integral part of library operations and services. The study revealed that library professionals use ICT resources in library services and operations. Also, DOS/UNIX databases, library application software, CD-ROM databases, word processing, bar-coding, multimedia, etc are important to library professionals. Similarly, Ramesh and Parameswaran (1999) conducted a study on the automation of public library and information services in and around Chennai and the attitude of library professionals towards the application of ICT. The results showed that the library professionals have a positive attitude towards the application and use of ICTs for library operations and services. Also, the library professionals showed their keen interest in professional development vis-à-vis ICT usage to keep pace with the trends of electronic information era. The study concluded that ICT applications and usage among the library professionals improved communication and helped in enhancing technical knowledge, providing better services, improving library status, change information handling methods and reduce work-load (Ramesh &amp; Parameswaran, 1999). Hence, this study seeks to investigate the use of information and communication technology by library professionals in Delta State. Statement of the Problem Library profession is revolutionizing significantly in many aspects. The emergence of new information and communication technologies, the internet, world wide web, among others pose new challenges for library professionals therefore, it requires library professionals to become positively energetic, equipped with greater skills and capabilities to survive and thrive in this new digital environment (Khan &amp; Bhatti, 2008). Despite the afore-mentioned positivity, library professionals in Nigerian Libraries are still lagging behind in the adoption, application and use of ICTs in the library profession. This is as a result of certain constraints such as poor budgetary allocation, inadequate ICT infrastructure in libraries, ineffective leadership, low professional status, poor information literacy skills and digital literacy, inadequately trained and skilled ICT manpower, limited ICT resources, insufficient communication skills and poor power supply. It is against this background that this research is embarked upon to investigate the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) by library professionals in Delta State. 1.3 Research Questions The following research questions were raised to guide the study: What are the ICT facilities used by library professionals in Delta State? What is the attitude of the library professionals towards ICT usage? What is the level of use of ICTs by library professionals in Delta State? What are the benefits of ICT usage to the library professionals? What are the constraints militating against the effective use of ICTs by the library professionals? 1.4 Purpose of the Study The main purpose of this study is to investigate the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) by library professionals in Delta State. The specific objectives of the study include: To find out the ICT facilities used by library professionals in Delta State. To examine the attitude of the library professionals towards ICT usage. To explore the level of use of ICTs by library professionals in Delta State. To discover the benefits of ICT usage to the library professionals. To unravel the constraints militating against the effective use of ICTs by the library professionals. 1.5 Significance of the Study ICT as an advance technology, enhance service provision in the library as well as teaching, learning and research. Hence, library professionals are expected to use and maximize the awesome potentials of ICTs in order to improve their information search, storage, retrieval and dissemination and at the same time promote effectiveness and efficiency in the library and information profession. This study therefore, will be of immense benefit to policy makers and library management in Delta State, to enable them formulate effective policies towards the provision and use of ICTs in libraries by library professionals. Also, this study will be beneficial to library professionals in Delta State, in the area of creating awareness of the relevance of ICT usage in the library and information profession by library professionals. In the same vein, this study will be of significant benefit to students by providing them information on the use of ICTs by library professionals in Delta State. Lastly, it is believed that this research work will fill a gap in knowledge and will be useful to prospective researchers who intend to conduct similar study on this topic in the near future and this will go a long way to increase the literature base of this research. 1.6 Scope and Delimitation of the Study The focus of the study is on the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) by library professionals in Delta State. The study covers library professionals in libraries in Delta State. The study is delimited to library professionals in two academic libraries in Delta State. They are: Delta State University Library, Abraka and Petroleum Training Institute Library, Warri. The scope of this study covers ICT facilities used by library professionals in Delta State, the attitude of the library professionals towards ICT usage, the level it use of ICTs by library professionals in Delta State, benefits of ICT usage to the library professionals and the constraints militating against the effective use of ICTs by the library professionals. 1.7 Operational Definition of Terms The following operational terms have been defined as used in the study: ICT: This is an acronym which stands for Information and Communication Technology. It is the technology used for information gathering, processing, storage, retrieval and dissemination by library professionals and users. Library: This refers to a warehouse of knowledge where information resources are acquired, processed, organized and kept for usage and dissemination. Library Professionals: These are well trained librarians or information practitioners working in the library.

Therefore, nation state no matter their size or developmental status strive to achieve some level of consistency in development planning and good governance. However, achieving the goals of governance requires that deliberate plan of action be set out to guide government throughout the process. This plan will detail the vision, focus and steps to be followed such as the overall vision of the government. What is expected to be achieve at the end of the plan period, the direction of public and private investments, the pace and focus of infrastructural and non-infrastructural development etc. while the plan is purely a guide and emendable to review or (re-direction) as dictated by the operating environment, its absence or inconsistency can however spell domm for the sustainable development of a country. The importance of development planning and vision for sustainable development cannot therefore be over-empahsized.

The protein quality was assessed using blood associated parameters including Haemogiobin indices and selected serum enzymes. The processed melon seed meals were raw melon seed meal (RMM), fermented melon seed meal (FMM) and fermented cooked melon seed meal (FCMM). The three test ingredient (RMM, FMM and FCMM) were included as the sole source of protein in a basal broiler chick started diet. The soya been seed meal (SBM) bassed commercial broiler chick started diet served as the control. Blood associated parameters like Haemoglobin (Hb), PVC, RBC, WBC, Total protein, creatinine uric acid, GPT, GOT and ALP were used to assess the protein quality of the diets fed. There were four (4)  experimental groups, each made up of eight birds in three replicsates, allocated to the  experimental diet SBM (control), RMM, FMM and FCMM respectively of all the groups of broler chicks, those placed on the FCMM diet gave blood associated parameters that were similar in valve to those of the broiler chicks placed on the control (SBM) diet: while valved obtained for broiler chicks placed on the other diets RMM and FMM were quite low. The results indicated that the processing  of melon seeds by cooking and fermentation made the protein in melon seed more available to he broiler chicks, and also removed some or all of the anti nutritional factors in raw melon seed. It is therefore concluded that he simultaneous processing of melon seed using cooking and fermentation techniques before it’s inclusion in broiler chick starter diets, enhances the protein quality and status of melon seed as a component of broiler starter diet. </p>\n\nCOMPILATION OF BIBILIOGRAPHY ON POULTRY IN NIGERIA 2010 - 2015<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMPILATION OF BIBILIOGRAPHY ON POULTRY IN NIGERIA 2010 - 2015", "id": 22}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Preservation of Archival materials is very important and very essential for prolonging of information and knowledge form one generation to another.

The Romans Emperor Justine (527-565 AD) has been quoted as issuing a decree to this governors in every province to set apart a public building to store their ecordsa. As a matter of fact, the measure of a nations civilization has always been judged by the pride. It place on its written records which from the raw materials of it history many individual does not know the important of preserving records of the past history until when hey are in need of it, this behavior is not peculiar to Nigeria alone but has prevalled in every country where people have not been in the habit of taking adequate care of their records, despite this archival centers have sprang up. Where ever it is realized that to destroy record is to destroy the very source form which reliable history could be written.</p> <p>Archives have been defined as those records of any public private institution which are adjudged worthy of permanent preservation for reference and research purposes and which have been deposited or have been selected for deposit in an archival institution, Archives is also repository for an organized body of records produced or received by a public, semi-public institutional or business entity. In the transaction of its affairs and preserved by it or its successors. People some times refer to Archival institution “As Archives”.</p> <p>The institution and Administration of Archives may be traced from autiquity Archives and Archival administration as they are understood today, dates from the French revolution. The establishment of the Archives departmentales in 1796 and Archives National in  1989, there was for the first time a unified Administratiion of Archives that embarked in existent repositories and records producing public agencies, they are responsible for the care of its documentary heritage. Another result was the principle of accessibility of Archives to the public.</p> <p>The united Nations and the several internatioanal organizations maintain Archives. The internaitoanl council on Archives was founded in 1948 by professional Archivists. Meeting paris under the help of UNESCO. Membership is open to all professional Archivists and to representative of:-</p> <p>1.                 Central Archival directorates or administration.</p> <p>2.                 National and international regional association of Archivists.</p> <p>3.                 All Archival institution.</p> <p>The science of records controls has to face at least three central issues such as</p> <p>1       The determination of types of removed from agencies of origin.</p> <p>2       The time of disposition</p> <p>3       The manner of disposition.</p> <p>Practice varies but elimination usually occur before transferring records from the agency of origin. The Archival materials include all books, maps, papers, photographs and other documentary materials other Archival materials include motion pictures, sound recording, photographic records and computer records micro copies are determined by special legislation as a practical medium for making additiaonl copies of warfare as preservation against normal deterioration or damage for use in international exchange.</p> <p>The function of any Archival institution. The world over includes records disposition, arrangaement, description, publication, reference services and preservation of all the functions record.</p> <p>Preservation of Archival materials does not stop with safe-guarding he Archives form losses resulting form fire and water. It includes also the provision of special storage buildings the control of the environment in which the records are kept, provision of conservation workshops and laboratories and well trained staff for conservation and restoration of activities.</p> <p>In Nigeria these functions seems to have suffered prolonged neglect, due to miss guided actiosn and priorities misplacement, the term preservation has been defined as all measures taken by an archival to his archieves from deterioration. Preservation is aimed at preventing damages to the Archieves or restoring documents that have been damaged. According to Kelthpellia, and Meelia conservator constitutes two aspects conservation and restoration. Conservation is aimed at preventing measure taken to protect our Archives against diseases. It includes telling such steps as good house keeping or maintaining hygiene.</p> <p>Restoration on the other hand means taking correction measures for strengthening weakened or brittle documents. When deterioration has set in on paper restoration is the only way to revive the documents and make it useable and serviceable. The history or preservation is as old as he invention of the art of writing, before the invention of writing, the primitive mam had learnt to make impressions on the walls of his caves such drawing provided useful research information for the archives.</p> <p>Ancient Egypt were the first to develop the art of writing to record his dally activities record his social, economic physical and cultural as well as communications with others in distant lands and to records natural charges. The use of day of metal back leaves, parehments, papyrus, vellum, and paper. Some of those old form to written are still in else in some parts of the world despite the invention of paper. The felt still remain that all these materials were subjacent to rapid deterioration owning to national ageing and prolong stay and as a result of adverse weather effects and environmental factors such humility, light, insects heat and vermin’s.</p> <p>However for this preservation, different measures are adopted such as wrapping the materials with clothes using preventice and preservative oil and storing them in cylindrical tubes. The problems of preservation of document have increased tremendously as a result of the predominant use of paper in printing and writing.</p> <p><strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF NATIONAL ARCHIEVES ENUGU</strong></p> <p>The pioneering efforts of DR. KENNETH .O. DIKE  a prominent historian and scholar led to the establishment of the Nigerian records office, now called the NIGERIAN NATIIOANAL ARCHIEVES in 1954 with headquarters at Ibadan. His survey and report of non-current official records of Nigeria were accepted by the colonial government on 1st April 1954 he was appointed the supervise of records to preserve and organize the records of Nigeria.</p> <p>          The Nigeria records office as it was first called was place in the Federal Ministry of education in 1957, and in the same year it become a division in the federal ministry of information till 1979, when it was again transferred to the newly ereelted ministry of social development, youths, sports and culture.</p> <p>          The National Archives right form the beginning has established its branches at Enugu and Kaduna. The Enugu office was opened in 1952, the development now have two repositories bult with part of he U.A.C independence gift to the chief. The Archivist is Mr. UWAKWA ORIJI. There are many sections in the National Archives Enugu, they are as follows:</p> <p>1        Processing unit</p> <p>2        Bindery / repairing section</p> <p>3        Reprographic section </p> <p>4        Research room</p> <p>5        Library section</p> <p><strong>PROCESSING UNIT</strong></p> <p>This is where Archives start, the staff in this section will search for records and these records are in form of books, maps, papers photograph and other documentary materials. Records record of any public or private institution which is adjudged worthy of permanent preservation and conservation.</p> <p>After the survey of the materials the staff will inform the office that has those record to tie and keep them, provision should be made and how to carry those materials to the Archival institution. Now the material acquired is in Archival custody. After acquiring sorting follows. The material are now order. Listing and classification of these records is another stage. Then these records are prepared for easy identification. During the real processing, then the records are based and labeled to know the contents of each box. The box will be in stock and are placed in the shelves, now open for use because the physical and intellectual control has been done.</p> <p>MR: DENNIS OKE is in charge of this processing base unit. He is  an Archivist grade 2.</p> <p><strong>BINDERY / REPAIR/SECTIONS</strong></p> <p>In this section in the National Archives Enugu, the main preservation is done and maintained. The melteriells brought into the institution are examined to know the ones that are weak. The weak ones are sent to the buidery and repair section, materials brought into this section are examined again by the staff in charge to know the type of repair that will last longer. Millily the traditional repairs and rebined of documents is mostly done.</p> <p>          The traditional methods is where baking flour that is in form of paste is used ot rub on the paper mostly writeups nad pasted to it he write-ups. The flour paste serves as an adhesive to the paper.</p> <p>        Rebuilding of document is where give is rubbed on the spine of the text. In this section they bind books, rebuild books magazines and even projects for outsiders. Some of the machines in use in this section include:</p> <p>1      Blocking machine: Is use for giving title ot the books and is</p> <p>2      Polor: use for cutting of papers.</p> <p>3      Nipping pressing; Is used to give pressure to the book after binding</p> <p>4      Backing machine: Is used to give conceive and convex shape to the books.</p> <p>5      Typing machine: Is used for printing letters of the alphabet on the books.</p> <p>MR. C.C. ONURAL is in charge of this section and is a Higher Technical Officer.</p> <p><strong>REPROGRAPHIC SECTION</strong></p> <p>This section performs three functions to help it preserving materials. The first one is microfilming which means reproduction of documents; 33mm film is what they use. Microfilming is used to preserve the records, in that large volumes of records will be minimized to contellin in smell fum. It is easy to remove or evacuate in case of flood and fire outbreak, it saves the life span of the original copy, if photo production is another every of preserving the records; this is where old photographs of personalities are produced. As the photographs become old and brittle they are photographed to produced another one.</p> <p>          The type of machine used in the reproduction of these old photograph nad maps is called genography machine photocopying is another medium of preservation, it help to produced the Archival  materials in many copies.</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH ROOM</strong></p> <p>The reason for this section is to provide reference materials and assistance to researchers, because researchers are not allowed to go to the shelves or document boxes by themselves alone to collects materials, as a researchers, you introduce yourself to the security at the inquiring drop your bag and write your purpose of coming.</p> <p><strong>LIBRARY SECTION</strong></p> <p>The National Archival library is not like the academic school or public libraries; it is only a departmental library that preserves books and not Archival materials the library preserve, acquires and stores wide varieties of books and publications of government. The books are not catalogued rather they make use of register catalogue. The library helps users and researchers in their references works. Books are acquired through authors write-up and donations. The librarian in charge of this section is MR. CHRISTIAN UZOR, he is the librarian.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROLEM</strong></p> <p>THE INVESTIGATOR IS TRYING TO LOOK UNTO</p> <p>i       The condition of storage to the Archival materials.</p> <p>ii      The problem of absolute equipment for preservation.</p> <p>iii     The cellibers of staff that are supposed to work at the  Archival materials</p> <p>iv     The kind of paper and other materials used in the preservation of Archival materials.</p> <p>        The preservation Archival materials have suffered prolonged neglect, due to misplacement of priorities. Many problems in he field of preservation and repair apply to all countries advice, but there are at addition many specific problems concerning each individual country, which depend upon the climate, the condition of storage degree of deterioration of holdings the kind of paper and he calibers of staff and the restoration workshop.</p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVE OF THEY STUDY</strong></p> <p>The investigator wishes to</p> <p>i       Find out he methods of preserving Archival materials in national Archives Enugu.</p> <p>ii      Examine the problems associated with preserving Archival materials</p> <p>iii     Discover the causes of deterioration of Archival materials Archival Enugu.</p> <p>v      Recommend measures that will help to solve the problems.</p> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QEUSTIONS</strong></p> <p>1      What are he causes of deterioration of Archival materials at the National Archival Enugu?</p> <p>2      What are the materials deteriorate.</p> <p>3      What are the problems associated with preserving Archival materials at the National Archival Enugu?</p> <p>4      What are methods of preserving Archival materials at the National Archival Enugu?</p> <p>5      What recommendations would help to solve he problems associated with preservation of Archival materials at the National Archival Enugu?</p> <p><strong>1.5   SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will only focus on the preservation of Archival Enugu, belt it is uppposed ot cover wider extents, not only preservation but also administration to archives but due to financial constraints and time factors, the investigator could not make it.</p> <p><strong>1.6   SIGNIFICNACE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will help those that keep records to know the modern and improved in preservation method and also ginger those that make use of Archival materials  to know how to manage keep, preserve and conserve their material and or documents properly. </p>\n\nPRESERVATION OF ARCHIVAL MATERIALS IN NATIONAL ARCHIVES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PRESERVATION OF ARCHIVAL MATERIALS IN NATIONAL ARCHIVES", "id": 23}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0            </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Library is an institution housing a collection of books and non-book materials like the audiovisual equipments  in a systematic manner for easy receival by he users. The primary aim f he library is to provide and preserve the information for users.</p> <p>Chukwuma (2004), use of library states that “library is a place where professionally selected and acquired books and non-book materials are processed and orderly arranged ot make for easy location, retrieval and use”.</p> <p>Eyisi (2011), foundation of library states that “library is a collection of sources, services and the structure in which it is housed which is organized for use and maintained by a public body, an institution or a private individual”. There is need therefore, for any library to acquire information materials that would satisfy the need of us users and also preserve these information materials for posterity. This study will therefore, focus on the preservation of library materials in the Kenneth Dike E. library Awka.</p> <p>According to New enclopedia Britannica, preservation is defined as “planned management natural resources or the total environment of a particular ecosystem to prevent exploitation destruction or neglect and to ensure the future of that resources”.</p> <p>Boochaarden (1955), simple defined preservation as action taken, anticipated, prevent, stop or retard deterioration”.</p> <p>Preservation of library material in the public libraries is the act of keeping both books and non-book materials safe from the destructive effects of sunlight, human handling, animals and others insidious enemies of library material such as book-worms and moulds.</p> <p>The deterioration of information materials is not a recent phenomenon. Research predicts that all paper base records may face imminent ruin if nothing is done to preserve them.</p> <p>Williams (1970) noted that was everything in the library collection is deteriorating today was deteriorating yesterday and will continue to deteriorate tomorrow although we ought ot retard the process”.</p> <p>According to Akwabro (198) “the issue of preserving library materials stared as for back as 668-626 BC  in Assyria Egypt and China where knowledge was recorded in papyrills and palm leaves which were mostly used in Egypt then were special rooms and some people were employed to take proper care of them, chains were usually used to hold the table by typing them to he reading tablets.</p> <p>A preservation programme provides a complete protection services beginning with systematic cleaning of the collection at suitable interval. However, the entire collection will have to pass through repair, rebuilding, replacement, microfilm or new stabilization process. To ensure that library methals remain available to be presented to future generation of library usere. Libraies should engage in a variety of preservation efforts such as conserving the original material and the transfer of information form original materials to more durable formats.</p> <p>This can be achieved by appointing a conservator who will be expert in weather preservation, insection control, mold and footing as well as blinding and lamination, such a person must be expert in photograph reproduction; he guard against all chemical unstabilized articles especially the atmospheric condition and protects the books against excessive exposure to sunlight. He must know the problems of housing manuscript, maps and sheet music.</p> <p>Materials in the library face a lot of problems in the course of their preservation. Unfortunately, even when the custodians of these material become aware of these of these problems, they may be handicapped by the relative unavailability of expert advice on which procedures to follow in conserving these material.</p> <p><strong>1.1     HISTORICAL BACGROUND OF KENNETH DIKE D. LIBRARY IN AWKA</strong></p> <p>The history of Prof. Kenneth Dike state central e-library, Awka commissioned by his Excellency Chief Peter Obi (CON) governor of Anambra State on Saturday 15th March, 2014 facilitated by Chief (Barr) Joe martin Uzodike.

These include period students’ visit the library, purpose for students; use of the library, available resources for students’ use, satisfaction derived from the use of library resources, extent of information provisioning, problems militating against utilization of library resources, subject areas the library has more collection, if allowed to borrow books from the library, the types of materials allowed to borrow by the students, if the students know how to use the library, how they use the library, solutions and suggestion by students for effective utilization. <br/>The survey research method was used in carrying out research. The instrument for data collection is the questionnaire and interview schedule. The sample frequency percentage tables were used in presenting and analyzing the data. <br/>The findings of the study, among others are that the students use the library for reading pleasure and to prepare for examination. The students use the library during break hours and consult available resources for their use. Others include the extent of information needs, provisioning, users receive little satisfaction for services provided, and a lot of problems militating against the management and utilization of school libraries. <br/>Premised on the findings, some recommendations are made. the study concluded stating that of the proffered recommendations to be handled holistically rather than in isolation, if done, school libraries would be repositioned for effective management, performance and resource utilization. </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>1.1 INTRODUCTION </strong></em><br/>A library, according to Jonathan Crowther (2000), is a storehouse of knowledge. It is the repository of information and information source. A library collects, organizes, stores and disseminates information. Thus, it is a resource centre for students, teachers, researchers and others. The library provides answers to specific and general information queries and problems. <br/>The major, purpose of the library is to provide information, thus it is a repository of human experience not subject to the barriers of space and time. According to Lawal and Udofia (1994) the library meets the information needs of the users in four categories namely:<br/>i. Education to develop society, adults, children and to fill gap in memory.<br/>ii. Information to develop executive activities such as economics, social and commercial development. <br/>iii. Aesthetic appreciation for culture, art, truth and judgement. <br/>iv. Recreation to provide amusement, hobbies.<br/>The function of the library therefore is to implement, to enrich, to vitalize and humanize the educational programmes, as it strives to attain excellence in content, process and product. Being a carrier of knowledge, the library is a vital partner in knowledge, management and shares with all other instructional agents their responsibility for systematically designing, carrying out and evaluating the total process of learning and teaching (Davies, 1994).<br/>There are different types of libraries, which represents different categories of people professions and shades of opinion. We have the public library, academic library, National library, school library and special library. <br/>A school library is an indispensable unit in any school, regardless of its educational philosophy. Thus an organized collection of book (reference books and for home reading) placed in a school under the care of a teacher-librarian for teachers and students. <br/>In the words of Iroha (2001) a school library is a collection of a wide variety of library materials and resources housed in each school centrally organized by staff, professionally prepared to offer services to students and teachers that will enrich and support the educational enterprises. This is to say, a school library assists and supports the educational programme of the school by storing instructional materials for use in teaching and learning.<br/>Harold (2000) is of the view that a school library is an organized collection of books placed in a school for use by both the teachers and students. School libraries can also be said to be a miniaturized intellectual powerhouse or information centre found in primary schools, secondary schools and teacher training colleges. That is, it is a stepping stone towards a child’s intellectual development. <br/>Perhaps, Onwubiko and Uzoigwe (2004) define a school library as the learning laboratory of the school equipped with books, magazines, newspaper, audio visual materials, aimed at enhancing effective teaching and learning on the part of teachers and students. In order to create an environment full of literature and cultivate the habit of using information materials for necessary teaching tools lead to the establishment of school libraries. The then Eastern Nigeria Ministry of Education recognized school library “as an education institution”. The provision of school libraries to improve standard in education delivery has been well articulated in the National policy of Education (1999). Emphasizing the need for school libraries, the policy states among others.<br/>“Libraries are one of the most important education services. Every state ministry of education needs to provide funds for the establishment of libraries in all our educational institutions”. A good library is a sine-qua-non for qualitative education and an instrument for the enhancement and the utilization of the library resources by students. It serves the purpose of inspiration, communication among students and the fulfillment of programme in the curriculum. The proper utilization has enabled students to seek knowledge in books in order that in the process, they may become efficient and enthusiastic readers and also the integration on the use of new media encourage them to become adaptive to the use of audio visuals, thus creating room for relaxation and enjoyment. As the school has a need for students, so far as their mind is concerned, to develop the abilities to think. Contemporary library media programmes have approached this task through concerted and articulated efforts designed not only to provide students with an appreciation of literature, but also to teach them how to locate, retrieve and evaluate the work of information contained in the graphic recorded and printed records in the belief that such skills are essential for survival in a rapidly changing world. The library is not just a reservoir of knowledge, information and human experiences but also has made provision of accessing this treasure. Beswick (1975) sees school libraries as a continuing change in the pattern of school teaching and learning away from instruction and towards exploration. In the opinion of Allen and Allen (1973), Ezewu (1987), the whole essence of libraries are two fold. Service and instruction service which involves provision of whatever materials, equipment, assistance and guidance that are required by the user. One cannot talk of the effective utilization of library resources without considering the role of the teacher-librarians. The teacher-librarian in other words known as the library media specialist promote access to a broad range of information and ideas, in order to assist students in acquiring the knowledge and skills that will equip them to not only to locate but also evaluate and use information effectively and thereby becoming information literate. Their services and tasks contribute directly to the development of these skills. These include collection development, organizations for retrieval of materials and information, information guidance services, material production, student instruction and instructional development services. School libraries are more concentrated on the physical object collected rather than their intellectual contents i.e. (stressing, cover over content). All too often they regrettably also provide instruction in every conceivable skill, and in every form of information sources available. Individual students fundamental mental processes, including their developmental aspects are often neglected and the implication for both teachers and students of helping the young develop the ability to think about how they are using information to solve problem are frequently ignored. These and others are among the militators to effective utilization of library resources by secondary school students.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </em></strong><br/>This study tries to find out how and why students use the school library resources and the factors that militate against their use of the school library resources. Many school libraries do not have reasonable collection of library materials and trained librarian to manage the library, and some schools do not have libraries at all, especially in rural areas. As a result, students are not encouraged to utilize the resources of the library.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The objectives of this study are as follow: <br/>i. To investigates the problem that hinders effective utilization of information resources in the library by students.<br/>ii. To identify the resources available for study students’ use and know the satisfaction they derived. <br/>iii. To determines the particular period students visit the library.<br/>iv. To determine the purpose for students utilization of school library. <br/>v. To determine the extent to which the students’ use of library resources satisfy their information need. <br/>vi. To determine if students’ background such as socio-economic background parental level of education, occupation, facilities at home, quality of residence family size are significant factors in the utilization of library resources.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS </em></strong><br/>The following research questions have been formulated to guide this work: <br/>i. At what period do students visit the library?<br/>ii. What are the impediments or hindrance to the utilization of library resources by the secondary school students?<br/>iii. What are the resources available in the school library for use by students and what satisfaction do they derive?<br/>iv. What are the reasons for students’ use of the library?<br/>v. To what extent are student’s uses of the library satisfying their information needs?</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The study is on the problems of the utilization of school libraries resources by the students of secondary school in Anambra State; specifically by students of Christ the King College (C.K.C) and Dennis Memorial Grammar School (DMGS) Onitsha. This research focuses on students’ attitude and view concerning visiting the library and the level of satisfaction they derive after utilizing or using the resources the target of the study is to identify basic problems and proffer solutions to them.</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The study is aimed at examining the utilization of library resources by secondary school students in their school libraries. The study will go a long way in providing basic information to school principals and education board on the need for the development of school library resources that will appeal to both the educational and recreational needs of students. The result of the study will reveal the general state of school libraries and their resources and the student’s views and attitude towards the use of the library. One significance of this study is that the teacher-librarian would be able to put forward proposals to their principal for the betterment of library and information services to the students of their schools. <br/>It is hoped that the findings and recommendations of the study will contribute immensely to the improvement of the management and utilization of school libraries resources in Anambra State.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 BRIEF HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF DENNIS MEMORIAL GRAMMAR SCHOOL ONITSHA</em></strong><br/>Dennis Memorial Grammar School was founded on January 24, 1925; it was built as a grammar school. The school is being piloted by venerable F.U Mbanugo who is the present principal of the school. Dennis memorial Grammar School is situated at No. 1 Oguta Road /zIk’s round about Onitsha. <br/>The school library start immediately with the school provided with a small portion or space until 1980 the school mapped out a large land for the building of the school library.

They also have visual resources like computers which are 3 in numbers with internet, tape recorders and other sound producing instruments. The mode of acquisition is through old boys associations of the school and the state government.</p> <p><strong><em>1.8 DEFINITION OF OPERATIONAL BASIC CONCEPTS </em></strong><br/>i.

This term is not familiar with most librarians but this project will educated them on the term.<br/>The research work (project) is based on the polytechnics requirement of the award of Higher National Diploma (HND), it is therefore critically examined and carefully studied the above topic.<br/>This project covers all one needs to know about grey literature, its meaning, its characteristics, advantages and role, its types, its acquisition channels, its cataloguing procedure, and challenges encountered in its acquisition.<br/>Librarianship students will also find this work very useful because it will help to widen their knowledge horizon in using library terms.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>Selection and acquisition are terms used in provision of library materials.<br/>Selection is the process of choosing while acquisition is the process of obtaining library materials (Anyanwu, et al, 2006) selection must precede acquisition, what to select depends on the type of library since the library is interested in serving primarily its clientese which could be homogenous or heterogeneous (Oduagwu, 2002). Book selection is used as a generic term covering the selection of both book and non-book materials for library.<br/>Acquisition on the other hand is a process of obtaining books and other items for the library, documentation centre, or archives (Harrods, 2000). Acquisition is carried out through purchase, gift, exchange and legal deposit.<br/>Provision of current information which supports the curriculum of the parent institution is as a result of selection and acquisition in the academic libraries.<br/>The following factors are considered in selecting materials for academic libraries, <br/>i. Aims and objective of the institution<br/>ii. The number of faculty members<br/>iii. The number of departments / subjects areas<br/>iv. Research and teaching needs<br/>v. The nature of materials required in terms of book and non-book.<br/>There is a specific library acquisition policy which specify the type and range of items to be selected and acquired. The purpose of the acquisition policy is to serve as a reference for the library staff to follow when assessing potential acquisition for the library collections including print and non-print materials, electronic and other type of resources. The mission of the acquisition policy is to ensure that the selection of library resources supports the educational need of the students, administrations and staff of the institution.<br/>Anyanwum et al, 2006 Started that selection is of very important because of literature explosion, reduction in library budget, reduction in income of library users and pressure from the both the publishers and the library users.<br/>Grey literature is one of the materials selected and acquired in Libraries.<br/>Grey literature is defined as…”information produced on all levels of government, academia, business and industry in electronic and print formats not controlled by commercial publishing” i.e. where publishing is not the primary activity of the producing body”<br/>M. C. Debachere has written that it is easier to describe, rather than define grey literature. Collectively, the term covers an extensive range of materials that can be found easily through conventional channels such as publishers, “but which frequently is original and usually recent”<br/>Peter Hirtle in Broadsides Vs. Grey literature defines is as: The quasi-printed reports, unpublished but circulated papers, unpublished proceedings of conferences, printed programs from conferences and other non-unique materials which seems to constitute the bulk of our modern manuscript collections (Hirtle, 1991). Dissertations also make up an important part of grey literature, as well as meeting papers” or preprints that are given out before conferences and meetings, and they could end up as journal articles (Augur 1989, 63).<br/>Grey literature is of paramount importance in the library because, it serves scholars and lay readers alike with research summaries, facts, statistics, and other data that after a more comprehensive view of the topic of interest.<br/>In all, selection and acquisition of grey literature in libraries therefore, is the process of choosing and obtaining this kind of literature in libraries.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE TWO SCHOOLS UNDER STUDY<br/>1.2.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON FEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, OWERRI (FUTO) LIBRARY.</em></strong><br/>According to the FUTO library guide and regulations, the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO) library was initially located at lake Nwaebere campus as a temporary site while the permanent library was under construction at Ihiagwa. The preparatory work for the library began in June 1981 with J. C. Anafulu as the pioneer University Librarian. A classroom block was selected and converted into a make-shift library. <br/>It was filled with shelves for ten (10) thousand volumes of library materials. Other members of the professional staff joined in October to prepare for the opening on the 19th November 1981. at the time of the opening, approximately 2,500 volumes were on the shelves. However, the importance of journals to the science and technology oriented University community was re-organised at an early stage and a list of about 600 tittles were ordered for.<br/>In the month of May, 1982, the reserved collections was introduced, the total volume of books held by the library reached six thousands (600), and borrowing privileges were then extended to students. After two years of operating in classroom blocks, the University library was moved to a permanent building in the first week of September, 1983. the building was modified to meet the requirements of a growing university library.<br/>On the 17th of May, 1983, the Library moved along with the university to its permanent site. On arrival, the pilot plant house of the school of science was immediately converted to a library. In no time it was realised that the building was too small to accommodate the ever-increasing stock, staff and library users. As such, the library moved partly to the library phase IV in 1995, thereby making available two library building fo use: Pilot plant and phase IV library building. The Pilot Plant Library building. The pilot plant library was left within serials section, technical section for catalogue and classification, acquisition section, the information technology unit, documentation and Archives section. The pilot plant library is regarded as reference library s no borrowing is done there. The library phase IV which was originally intended to be a reading room is centrally situated at a convenient distance from the Hostels. The organogram of the library materials is situated at the entrance to the Library. The library has seating capacity of about 500.<br/>There are various types of materials in the university library which are separated into six collections. These are the reference the loans, the reserve and the serial collections. They also include documentation / Achieves and information technology collections.<br/>A breakdown of the section to date is shown as follows:<br/>Books 60,000<br/>Bound periodicals 4,850<br/>Documents 3,200<br/>Maps 948<br/>Total of all formats 68,670<br/>(Excluding current periodicals)<br/>Current periodicals 41<br/>Library serials holdings 1,184<br/>CD-ROM collection 64<br/>EBSCO database (CDROM) 50</p> <p><strong><em>1.2.2 BACKROUND INFORMATION ON IMO STATE UNIVERSITY (IMSU) LIBRARY</em></strong><br/>Imo state university library, Owerri is as old as its institution which was establish in 1981, following a law passed on the 13th of April 1981, by the Imo State House of Assembly during the Mbakwe’s Administration. The school was officially opened in two campuses, i.e. Aba and Etiti in October 1982.<br/>The school was later moved to Okigwe by the then Military Administratrion, major General Ike Nwachukwu (Rtd) but was relocated to Owerri from Okigwe in 1992 as contained in the law establishing the institution.<br/>Imo state university was opened in 1993 at Lake Nwaebere campus before the admissions of students, and Dr. Omonogbo became the first acting Librarian of the university library. Since then the stock has been increasing and it is of note that the library stock has received gifts both in cash and in materials from individuals and European union, British consulates and all activities of the goal of its parent institution.<br/>As stated in the Imo State University library fact sheets, the library system of the school consist of ten libraries;<br/>They are as follows:<br/>i. The Main library<br/>ii. The Law Library<br/>iii. The college of Medical library<br/>iv. The library of the faculty of Business Administration<br/>v. The department of the Architectural Library<br/>vi. Social Science Library<br/>vii. Humanities Library<br/>viii. Department of Education Library<br/>ix. Quantity Surveying Library<br/>x. The Agricultural Library<br/>The activities of all these libraries are co-ordinated from the main library which is the institutional library. This is to enable to provide efficient and effective services to its clients in various faculties and colleges of the institution.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</em></strong><br/>Selection and acquisition of grey literature has always been problematic. As Charles .P. Augur points out in his book, the core reason for difficulties in identifying and acquiring this kinds of literature are due to its :poor bibliographic information and control, non-professional layout and, low print runs” (Augur 1989,3). The implementation of bibliographic control through ISBN, ISSN and report number has been somewhat helpful, but also disorganized. For instance, reports which makes up the lion’s share of grey literature, do not use ISBN as a rule Instead, reports numbering was intrated as a means to introduce standardisation.<br/>The problem is that, these numbers were designed to include subject matter, date, form, agency, section, additional data and consequently are quite long and confusing.<br/>In addition some categories of this kind of literature do contain security restrictions. M.C Debachere points out that problems arise in libraries when a pation request a particular document and it is not apparent where to begin the search. (Debachere, 1995, 95).</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 SCOPE/LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>This research work is focused on challenges of selection and acquisition of grey literature in libraries. It is extremely difficult to conduct a research of this nature that embraces all libraries in Nigeria, this is because the vital data for such a study will be difficult to come by.<br/>Therefore, to ensure the efficient and effective collection of relevant data, the researcher brought the scope of the study to a more manageable size and will restrict the investigation to only two academic libraries, namely; Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO) and Imo State University (IMSU) libraries both of Owerri. It is natural to encounter problems in a study like this because it’s broader wise.<br/>In as much as time and financial constraint becomes my shortcoming, in terms of transportation and photocopying materials, this research work is limited to internet search and interviews form acquisition librarians of two schools stated above.</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>This study is carried to: <br/>i. Identify the importance of grey literature in libraries.<br/>ii. To find out its selection and acquisition process.<br/>iii. To know the different types of grey literature.<br/>iv. To know what challenges are encounter in acquiring grey literature and how to face them.<br/>v. To know what constitute the grey literature and who uses them.<br/>vi. To identify the problems of grey literature and their possible solutions.</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 RESEARCH QUESTION</em></strong><br/>1. Is there need for grey literature in the academic libraries?<br/>2. Does your library select and acquire grey literature?<br/>3. If it does what kind of grey literature does it acquire?<br/>4. Does your library encounter any challenges in acquiring the grey literature?<br/>5. If yes, what challenges does it encounter?<br/>6. When last did your library acquire the grey literature?</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 AIMS/PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The aim of this study is to fulfil the basic requirement for award of National Diploma (HND) in the department of Library and Information Science, Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Owerri.<br/>The purpose of this research work is to contribute to the development of library collection and to make effective tool in grey literature as management tool in an academic library. The study will also add to the literature of librarianship as well as be of immense help to the students, lecturers, librarians, schools and the nation at large.</p> <p><strong><em>1.8 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>This study is meant to provide assistance to those in scholarly environments wishing to extend their research capabilities. This study will also save the scholars and lay readers alike with research summaries, facts, and other data that offer more comprehensive view of their topic interest.<br/>Quick access, greater flexibility, and opportunity to go into considerable details when necessary are all the significance this study will provide to scholars/students.<br/>The study also is very significant to students who may wish to replicate the work for better research as it serve as reference source.</p> <p><strong><em>1.9 DEFINATION OF THE TERMS</em></strong><br/>1.9.1 SELECTION: It is the act of choosing items or library materials yet to be acquired for the satisfaction of library clienteles. It is the act of choice and a quantity of variety choosen from the lists of publication. It must precedes acquisition because, it is only when you select that you can acquire what you have selected.<br/>1.9.2 ACQUSTITION: This is the act of obtaining materials selected. It is the act of making available the library materials that was selected from the list of publication, and it is done through the following channels, purchase, gifts, inter-library loan or exchange, legal deposit, etc. It is a term used for provision of library materials.<br/>1.9.3 GREY LITERATURE: This is the term used to cover all publications that are not controlled by commercial publishing interests. That is, those publications that are issued by government, academia, business and industry in both print and electronic format. Grey literature comprises of newsletters, reports, working papers, theses, government documents, bulletins, fact sheets, symposia, conference proceedings etc.<br/>Virtually everything we read outside of journals and books can be considered grey literature.<br/>1.9.4 LIBRARIES: When there is more than one library, there are libraries. A library is not a store house of books as commonly believed by some people (layman), rather it is a collection of books and non-book materials organised for use. It is a store house of information and knowledge. It is an agency that is involved in the selection, acquisition, organisation, preservation, storage, retrieval and dissemination of information through books and non-book material for users.<br/>1.9.5 A library could also be “a building room or set of rooms containing an organised collection of prints and/or non-print materials for the use of the public or of some particular portion of it (Oduagwu, 2002).</p> <p><strong><em>REFERENCE</em></strong><br/>(1) Anyanwu, E.

This work is divided into 5 (five) chapter.<br/>Chapter one, highlighted what disaster is and different causes and types of disaster. In chapter two, the necessary literatures were reviewed. In chapter three, the research method used was survey method, the research finding were based on the data collected from the research instrument are shown in the methodology. Chapter four, shows how date collected were analyzed and interpreted. <br/>On conclusion, which is the last chapter, some recommendations were made after finding out that National Archives, Owerri Branch is intended to prepare for disaster occurrence, but the worst factor that make it unable to carry this task is inadequate provision of funds. The researcher, therefore recommend on how to remedy this problem of funds and other problems it is facing. </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>INTRODUCTION <br/>BACKGROUND TO THE PROBLEM </strong></em><br/>It is incredible but true that the generality of people including some educated elites do not know what archives are, some associated archives with artifacts, monuments, and others believe that the word is derived from archeology. At best, a good number of people think that archives are the old and use less staff meant for the incinerator. This ignorance permeates some an official publication in which archives is mentioned in casual reference to art and culture.<br/>The word “Archive” is pronounced “Arkive”. An ordinary meaning of the word Archive is public or government records and the place for keeping them. This is to say that the word has a dual meaning of being public or government records as well as being a place where such records are housed. They are kept officially or privately but the documents are exclusive. <br/>According to the Italian Archivist Casanova defined “Archives” as the orderly accumulation of documents which were created in the course of its activity by an institution or an individual, and which are preserved for the accomplishment of its political, legal or cultural purposes by such an institution or individuals. The essential elements in this definition relates to the reasons why materials were produced or accumulated. <br/>To be archives, materials must have been created or accumulated to accomplish some purpose. In a government agency, the purpose is the accomplishment of its official business. Casanova stressed their creation to accomplish “Political, Cultural or legal purposes. <br/>In professional parlance, Archives are document drawn up or used in the course of administrative or executive transaction (whether public or private) which formed a part and which are subsequently preserved (in their own information) by the person or persons responsible for that transaction or their legitimate successors.<br/>Originally, the term “Archive” is derived from Greek word “(Acheron) which means that archives belongs to an office. They are generally used to designate agencies or administrative units, responsible for identifying, appraising, accessioning, preserving, arranging, describing and providing reference services on archives materials and for approving the destruction of records of transitory values.<br/>When archivists accept holdings into their repositories, they are taking responsibility for the custody for these materials. All their efforts may come to naught if the archives are lost as a result of a disaster or breach in security. Security and disaster management are the key to the protection of archival materials from human and natural causes. However, many incidents which can be described as disaster have destroyed or seriously damaged parts of archives collections and building. An early account of damage to a book is a pious account of the loss of Queen Margaret’s gospels by a careless priest who dropped the book into a deep and fast flowing river. The story tells us that due to divine intervention, the book was located on the river bed and recovered undamaged and that this minor miracle occurred because the original owner was a saint. Since few of us are saints, we can take little comfort from this. <br/>More so, modern accounts of damage resulting from disaster include the Florence disaster of 1966 when a flood caused serious damage to National Library Holdings. This was perhaps the point in time when the disaster risk was fully realized. Also, the Los Angeles Public Library fire in 1986 and the tragic fire at the Academic of Science Library in Leningrad in 1988 were examples of disaster encountered in modern times. In modern times too, are also records of archives damaged due to earthquakes including the National Archives in Mexico in Mexico City which was damaged by the Mexican earthquake of 1985, the San Francisco City Archives in the U.S.A damaged by the Loma Pieta earthquake in 1989 and several archives institutions in the Hanshin Region of Japan in 1995.<br/>Thus, one of the fundamental aims of the International Council on Archives (ICA) is to promote the preservation of the world’s archival heritage. Aware of the widespread threats to this heritage, not least from armed conflicts in various parts of the world, and the role of disaster planning in meeting them, the XII General Assembly of ICA meeting in Montreal in 1992, called for the preparation of plans and publications to assist in preserving damage to archives from natural and man-made disaster. It would be comforting to think that the disaster threat comes from events which might be described as natural phenomena are therefore, infrequent and confined to a few regions of the world. This sadly is not the cases all too often that result from the carelessness of man himself. <br/>Also, a disaster can result from an act of vandalism; it could be a fire resulting from poor maintenance, negligence or arson. It is as well frequently simply as the result of a burst of water main pipe, which of the devastating effect of water. <br/>The word “disaster” is a strong one bringing to mind catastrophic occurrence such as the Florence floods, Mexico. One should remember that an event does not have to be of any significant size for it to be disastrous in an archive. A small event happening in the wrong time can be as potentially damaging as a large one. The use of the word disaster is to describe such events, whatever their size, is a careful and deliberate choice.<br/>Archival collections are created because of the enduring values which they posses. Necessary steps must therefore be taken to ensure their protection and physical well being. Unfortunately, the greater percentage of valuable records and volumes of archival materials are not housed under suitable ideal conditions but are kept as best they may be by multitudes of smaller archives and other establishments of a public or private nature that may not be primarily concerned with records protection. <br/>Also, it should be noted that far too many archives in the world have neither disaster preparedness nor a security plan in a place. Many archivists as well recognize the need to protect their holdings, but they fail to develop disaster preparedness and security plan due to a number of factors including inadequate funding and staffing and shortage of supplies. However, these problems should not prevent archivists from developing disaster preparedness and security plan is very simple, although it is time consuming. Archivists do not need high tech and expensive equipment and supplies to develop sound plans. <br/>However, whether National Archives Owerri Branch had or has not experienced any of these dangerous disasters like floods, fire, earth quake, hurricane, tornado etc. Despite, it has or has not experienced any of these mentioned disasters since it was established, it does not mean that it could not encounter any disaster throughout its life span. So there is a need for National Archives, Owerri Branch to be acquainted with, and prepare for disaster in case it occurred. <br/>The need for disaster preparedness should be a factor that should be taken serious by every archive establishment. The essence, of disaster preparedness is to reduce the dangerous effect cause by disaster since i.e. is known that total protection may not be achieved through preventive measures; this is why efforts are made to put in place preparedness measures. It is therefore, necessary to have a reaction contingency plan for the purpose of reading to an emergency situation. The objectives of such reaction will be to protect materials and to take action to remove the threat to the archival collections. <br/>Though, because of the valuable nature of archival collections, they need to be properly secured. So, there should be a need for adequate security management measures to be taken by the National Archives, Owerri Branch to secure her collection and buildings from disasters. This is because disaster is a thing that could come at any time hence there is a need to get ready for it at all times. The number of different disastrous incidents world-wide has caused many damages to archival collections. This has however, created on increased awareness of the need for disaster prevention, security and control planning is recent years. <br/>Protection from loss by fire is basic to any record-preservation program, which will emphasize fire prevention by insisting on high standards of housekeeping, periodic patrols and the like. Nevertheless, provision should be made by National Archives, Owerri, by providing some of these fighting equipment or fire detecting systems that are used in modern times like automatic fire alarm, automatic sprinkles, automatic extinguisher or automatic carbon-dioxide extinguisher etc. And also they should ensure that equipment are manned or handled by a well trained staff or expert.<br/>HISTORY OF NATIONAL ARCHIVES, OWERRI BRANCH <br/>The National Archives Owerri was founded in June 1986 alongside other institutions that were founded at that time. Formerly, the institution was temporary located at Okigwe Road Secretariat Owerri before it was relocated to the Federal Secretariat in Port Harcourt Road, in September 1996, under the leadership of Mr. E.I. Nsoro, who was its Pioneer Archivist. <br/>On its establishment in 1986, National Archives, Owerri was under the Ministry of Education.<br/>Later, it was attached to Ministry of Youths, sports and culture before it finally found itself in the Ministry of Information and culture. Later in the year 2001, culture was removed from information and it became known as Ministry of Information and National Orientation.<br/>The National Archives Owerri has the following sections:<br/>1. Administrative section <br/>2. Account section <br/>3. Search room section <br/>4. Repository section <br/>5. Library section <br/>6. Binding section</p> <p><strong><em>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </em></strong><br/>Human beings do not think about disaster. However, whether we think about disaster or not, they surely do occur sometimes with devastating consequences. A disaster whether natural or man-made or by a combination of these is an event which timing is unexpected and which consequences are seriously destructive. This, disaster is a threat that might cause harm to the office records, building, staff or an unscheduled disruption of normal office services. In as much as the National Archives Owerri may or may not have witnessed any dangerous disaster since its inception, thus the researcher wants to embark on this because of an interest to find out the need for disaster preparedness. <br/>More so, since there are needs for disaster preparedness, prevention, control planning and adequate security of archival collections, the researcher however wants to find out the reasons why there should be a proper security management and different protective measures in which the National Archives Owerri Branch should adhere to.</p> <p><strong><em>SCOPE/LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>This study is limited to subject areas such as different cases and prevention of archival disaster as well as its control measures and different fighting equipment for disaster and disaster preparedness which will serve as a medium for securing archival collections and buildings of National Archives, Owerri Branch.</p> <p><strong><em>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES </em></strong><br/>For any work to have a base, it must aim at something. Therefore, the researcher aims at studying the need for disaster preparedness and adequate security measures to be taken by the National Archives, Owerri Branch in other to secure and protect its collections and building from dangerous disaster.</p> <p><strong><em>RESEARCH QUESTIONS </em></strong><br/>The researcher wants to use the following questions:<br/>1. How is the management of National Archives, Owerri Branch preparing for disaster?<br/>2. Is there adequate funding for disaster preparedness and how does the government in Owerri branch help in funding disaster preparedness?<br/>3. In terms of securing archival heritage what type of fighting equipment do you have that would facilitate adequate security for National Archives Owerri Branch.<br/>4. Do you have trained/skilled staff who would handle disaster occurrence?</p> <p><strong><em>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</em></strong><br/>The study is meant to keep the archivist of National Archives, Owerri Branch abreast in need of guidance to implement a disaster management policy and strategy. It will also be of a great value to the students, educators, researchers and even the lecturers who are researching on disaster and/or disaster planning of archives and the security of archival collections. <br/>METHODOLOGY<br/>To have a reliable research, the method to be used in carrying out research work ought to be stated. Thus, the research is a case study of National Archives, Owerri branch, the method to be used in collection of data for this project include the use of the three method of data capturing techniques. They are:<br/>1. Gathering of data through visits <br/>2. Administration of questionnaire and <br/>3. Use of oral interview.</p> <p><strong><em>REFERENCES</em></strong><br/>Jonathan Growther (1995), Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary, 5th Edition.<br/>Cunningham, J.K.H.

Questionnaire and interview schedule were used as data collection instruments. The method of statistical analysis is the simple frequency table which used tables and percentages to represent the findings of the data collected.<br/>The findings show that the available resources are not adequate to meet the demands of the student and there is need to introduce user education to improve use of these resources.<br/>In conclusion, it has become clear from this research that the available resources in the library has a significant role to play in the attainment of an individual educational objectives.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></em><br/>The term, “use of library” is DEFINED AS PERSUING THE STOCK (BROWSING), ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE FROM LIBRARY STAFF, ACTUALLY FINDING INFORMATION OF VALUE, TAKING OUT a book in the library, studying one’s own material in the library, coming into the library and so on. But using library resources is not restricted in the above listed actives, rather it is likely to be a combination of any or all of these and perhaps several others.<br/>However, using library means the holding of library borrower’s cards and using or not using them. It also includes library attendance.<br/>Historically, the use of the collections of the library was restricted to the library building and it otherwise guarantee deposited by the users involved. Besides, as the number of books increased from a few hundred to a few thousands. The book chests gave way to book closets and then to small library rooms. Later on the medieval era, the book was simply for safekeeping because few copies were available.<br/>The role of the training library could be described as that of acquiring materials, processing them and making them available for use rather than preservation. As the library attached to an academic department, it is of necessity educational in purpose. It constitutes an indispensable intellectual store/repository in an academic community and form the never centred around which academic work revolves.<br/>The factor of availability is often talked about than recognised. Ease of use and ready accessibility, as countless studies have found, are the two major factors in determing which information is used. Information being the life wire of any society whether complex, industrial or simple, can be retrieved from the wealth of resources housed in the library.<br/>The essential logical problem of making library books physically available when needed by the library users is central to librarianship. Intellectual access to recorded information has quite properly been a major preoccupation of librarians. Its importance has been reflected in the effort devoted to the design and creation of bibliographies, catalogues, classification scheme and other devices that help establish the existence of individual documents and their relevance to specific enquires. However, intellectual access needs to be accomplished by physical access if the documents are to be used. The essential logical of making books available to library users has received far less attention in the literature of librarianship that has the discussions of intellectual access.<br/>Unfortunately, current library practice has paid little attention to the definition of “availability” let alone “use”. Also the number of books acquired tends to have little relevance in the objective assessment of readers requirement. The effective regulation of not borrowing out books is quiet understood, in the departmental library presently, not many copies of materials are acquired, and they are not loaned out to users, though the materials may be lent for photocopying. In photocopying the books, the students have to submit their ID and, school fees receipts or mobile telephone sets.<br/>Unfortunately no survey has been made prior to the present study. This present study therefore is to carry out an investigation on the “Availability and use of library resources in training library by students’. This is with a view to determining the extent to which the resources in the library are able to meet the needs and at the same time find out how the students make use of the resources.<br/>Resources in the library can be both books and non-book materials. The users are mostly students in the library and information science department, the use of library depends on the services provided by the students.<br/>It should be appreciated that the use and non-use of training library resources make a very important difference to a person’s attainment of his / her ultimate educational objectives. If then a library primary objective is to encourage optimal use of the service which it provide and it is true the successful use breed more intensive use.</p> <p><strong><em>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</em></strong><br/>Libraries of all kinds provide information services of various to various kinds of people. They are social service institutions that tailor their services to a particular constituency. Hence an academic library is established to cater for teaching and research needs of lecturers, students and information needs of non-academic staff.<br/>Library use can easily be transferable into recognizable benefit? This is a problem that will concern library practitioners, library educators and library users. It will be of interest to provide a useful insight to know if there are things the students can gain or benefit from using the library. Does the use of library improve student’s academic performance?</p> <p><strong><em>OBJECTIVE OF STUDY</em></strong><br/>The objective of this work is to investigate the types, quality and quantity of available resources in the training library. The research intends to examine t he following <br/>- To find out the level of available resources in the training library by students.<br/>- The frequency of use of the library material by the students.<br/>- To find out reasons, if any why students do not use the training library.<br/>- To check the recency of the library materials.<br/>- To find out the information resources available for library science students.<br/>- To find out if the available materials meets the needs of the students.<br/>- To determine whether the library offer them services.<br/>- To find out whether the library science students are satisfied with the services provided for them.</p> <p><strong><em>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</em></strong><br/>i. What are the information resources available for library science students?<br/>ii. How do library science students obtain resources required for their commitment<br/>iii. Do library students get satisfied with the resources provided?<br/>iv. What are the problems associated with satisfying the needs of library science students?<br/>v. How would the identified problem be solved?</p> <p><strong><em>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>The research work is on availability and use of library resources in training library by students of library and information science department of federal polytechnic Nekede Owerri.</p> <p><strong><em>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>This work is on availability and use of library resources in training library by students. This is to extend the frontier of human knowledge and in other to solve human problem encountered in training libraries when making resources available to students. It is an addition to the literature in library and information science. It will also guide future researchers and consultants who would replicate this work to improve on it.<br/>FEDERAL POLYTECHNIC AND THE DEPARTMENT OF LIBRARY / INFORMATION SCIENCE: HISTORICAL BRIEF<br/>Imo state Edict-No. 16 of April 1976 established the Federal Polytechnic Nekede Owerri. Among other things, the edict empowered the polytechnic to erect, provide equipment and maintain a library.<br/>In response to this, a chief librarian was appointed on March 1978. By the time the polytechnic open on the 5th of December 1978, a clerk typist and a messenger had been appointed to assist the chief librarian. By the time the polytechnic was till operating at a temporary site at the government technical college Owerri. It was exactly on this date that the library started operating with an initial collection of 300 volumes including serial titles, newspapers, periodicals etc. which were organized and consulted by users in a separate segment of the library.<br/>The polytechnic move to its permanent site in Nekede in November 1980, with the library occupying one room in the engineering block with a separate partition for serials in January 1983, the library moved to the classroom complex where it occupied more rooms.<br/>Today, the polytechnic purpose built a befitting academic library which occupies a two storey building was constructed under the regime of the former rector Dr. C. I. Osuoji and was completed.<br/>The polytechnic new college library was commissioned on Saturday May 19, 2001. By Prof. A. B. Borishade and opened to the members of the polytechnic Nekede (staff and students) in January 2002.</p> <p>HISTORICAL BRIEF OF THE DEPARATMENTAL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE<br/>The department of library and information science, college of technology now federal polytechnic, Nekede (hereafter referred to as Nekede Library school) is the older of the two library schools in a critically complex occupation as the most efficient way to transmit t he tricks and concept of the work to beginners. This association partly accounts for the establishment of library schools in different places. However, while educators and institutions in other parts of Nigeria were literally re-inventing the wheel by concentrating on University-based library school.<br/>From Ikpa-Iroh’s (2006) account, this library school was established in 1979 at the then college of technology Nekede at the outskirt of Owerri, the capital of Imo state. However the first set of students was admitted in the year 1980 / 1981 academic session. In the same academic session, Okpa-Iroha (1980/81), unarguably the father of polytechnic based library education in Nigeria made a formal application for polytechnic in the country to offer library science at National Diploma and Higher National Diploma levels. The details of his submission to the national Board for Technical Education (NBTE) titled: A case for running of library and information science programmes in the polytechnic system of Education in Nigeria. The uniqueness of the Nekede library school was captured by Ngoha (1984) who described it fittingly as the first one to be established outside the aegis of a university. It is therefore an undesirable historical fact that while the lending lights in Nigeria library practice and education were engrossed in a heated debate about the issue of library leaders education and the superiority of the programmes of existing library school, the authorities of the college of technology in Imo state provided the resources, facilities and personnel required to put the suitability and practicability of a non-university-based library school to test. This singular decision, which has radically attend the course of library education in Nigeria for the better is not worthy and commendable.<br/>As focused trailblazers, the promoters of the Nekede library school were conscious of the scepticism that trailed their new experiment in polytechnic based library education. Elder Okpa-Iroha, ably supported by his faculty colleagues and management of college of Technology, Nekede design a further two years Higher National Diploma (HND) in library science. Graduates of the National Diploma (ND) are eligible to enrol into the H N D programmes after a mandatory 12 months interlude of internship in libraries or allied information institutions. This maiden ND and HND programmes in library science were accredited in the 1985/86 academic session following successful defences of the proposal before the NBTE and other relevant authorities. <br/>The opportunities for the acquisition of library education in Imo State was widened further in 1990/2000 academic session. When the Nekede library school introduced a 1 year pre-national diploma in library and information science.</p> <p><strong><em>DEFINITION OF OPERATIONAL TERMS</em></strong><br/>Availability: The quality or condition of being available, capability of being used being at hand, being ready.

Data was collected using questionnaire designed and distributed to the staff of the library used as case study. In analyzing and presenting of the data collected, tables, frequencies and simple percentage (%) were used. The findings showed that the library is faced with different types of security challenges which are book theft, non-return of library materials, book mutilation, keeping books beyond due dates, purposeful mis-shelving of books, writing on or in books etc. Recommendations made in this study includes that there should be increased security in the library premises and library hall through supervision, patrolling and surveillance, libraries should be designed in such a way that collection security is taken into account, libraries should install goods and working electronic security gadgets in the library and its environs. The researcher suggested that further study should be carried out on; the need to observe library rules and regulations, preservation and conservation of library resources, securing the digital libraries against security breaches as these suggestions will further help to prevent the library and its resources against any form of security challenge.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 Background to the Study</strong></em><br/>Libraries as a store house of knowledge and information must be safe from security threats and vulnerability.<br/>Academic library collections are broad and varied. Academic libraries support the educational community through access to its collections. Borrowing privileges is an important means of giving access to the library’s collections for personal, educational and socio-economic advancement.<br/>Gelfand (2005) posit that the library is the only centralized location where new and emerging information technologies can be combined with knowledge resources in a user-focused, service, rich environment that support today’s social and educational patterns of learning, teaching and research. Library services can only be achieved through the availability of library collections. Anuobi and Okoye (2008) state that “academic libraries are faced with hybrid challenges of managing resources and are challenged to acquired the necessary skills needed for the adequate security of the library’s collection or resources both in print and non-print format.<br/>Chaney and MacDougail (2004) states that collections are vulnerable to abuse of one sort or another and library managers need to keep this characteristic well to the forefront of the library. Ensuring effective use, longevity and accessibility of library resources makes an effective programme of collection security necessary.<br/>Antiwi (2009) state that book theft (stealing of books) was already a great challenge to the library. Book theft started when the Persians went to Egypt and with one word drew papyrus from the Library of Ramses II without stopping for any formalities at the charging desk. They thus began this illegal practice which has continued to torment libraries ever since (Antiwi, 2009). Oyewusi and Oyeboade (2009) discuss the importance of access to collections in supporting the mission of the university. Their research view the importance of good collections as they point to the need for safety and security for those collections.<br/>Collection security refers to a process designed to protect library collections against un-authorized removal or loss. This involves protecting resources against disasters as well as thieves or intruders (Ajegbomogun, 2004). Information security governance is the manner in which information security is deployed, Da Veiga and Eloff (2007). Collection security management in libraries can be conceptualized to mean the overall manner in which collection security policies, programmes, procedures, or measures are deployed to mitigate risk and ensure access.<br/>Crime is increasing in a spectacular and frightening rate in academic libraries, vandalism, mutilation, defacement, theft, hiding of books, verbal and physical abuse, harassment and other criminal activities are some of the challenges regularly encountered by the library resources and the library staff. It is therefore vital that today’s academic libraries be positioned to be able to confront these challenges in an objective, analytical and professional manner without displeasing the library users. The act of stealing, mutilation and vandalization of library resources is no doubt spreading among library users. These negative acts not only cause some immediate damage but also have longer effect on those who witness them and the library’s collection at large.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 Statement of the Problem </em></strong><br/>Library resources are usually mutilated, stolen and vandalized by some delinquent users. The extent of these challenges varies from one library to the other but seems to be a universal problem. Libraries should therefore ensure that there is high rate of security of their resources. Academic librarians and information managers must have a clear focus and vision on the reality of these security breaches in academic libraries in other to successfully manage a flourishing and efficient library and resources/research centre.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 Objectives of the Study</em></strong><br/>The following are the researcher’s objectives of the study:<br/>i. To determine the existence of security policy in the academic libraries. <br/>ii. To find out if adequate security of library resources is necessary in an academic library.<br/>iii. To find out the type of library resources security breaches perceived by the respondents.<br/>iv. To identify in general the types of collections which are more vulnerable to security breaches.<br/>v. To find out the measures the library used to reduce and address security breaches in academic libraries.<br/>vi. To identify the challenges to library resources security management.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 Research Questions </em></strong><br/>The following research questions were presented for the study:<br/>i. Does the library have an existing security policy that defines what a security challenge is and how to handle it?<br/>ii. Is adequate security of library resources necessary in an academic library?<br/>iii. What type of library resources security breaches does the respondents perceive in the library?<br/>iv. What type of library materials are more vulnerable to security breaches?<br/>v. What are the measures used by the library to reduce and address these security breaches?<br/>vi. What are the challenges to collection security management?</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 Scope of Study </em></strong><br/>The study is on library resources and security challenges in the polytechnic library of Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Owerri. The study focuses particularly on identifying the various types of library resources and their security challenges and ways of reducing these identified challenges.</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 Significance of the Study </em></strong><br/>The researcher intends to contribute significantly to the importance of high rate of security on library resources as these resources contains useful information for human and nation development. Security challenges faced by the library resources militates against the provision of adequate information materials to library users. This work will also serve as a reference material to future researchers and library professionals who wish to write on library resources and security challenges in the libraries.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 Historical Background of Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Owerri </em></strong><br/>The Federal Polytechnic Nekede Owerri was established in 1978 by the Imo State Government through Edict No. 16 of April 1978 as the College of Technology, Owerri. It took off at its temporary site at the premises of Government Technical College (GTC) Owerri along Egbu Road in the same year. The school in November 1981 was moved to its present and permanent location at Nekede in Owerri. By the Imo State Government Edict No. 6 of 1987, the name of the institution was changed to “The Polytechnic Nekede, Owerri”. Six years after and precisely on 7th April 1993 the school was formerly taken over by the federal government and was renamed by the federal government to “The Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Owerri” which is the institution’s present name.</p> <p><strong><em>1.8 The Polytechnic Library of Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Owerri </em></strong><br/>At the inception of the school in 1978 at its temporary site at Government Technical College (GTC) Owerri, the Chief Librarian of the then College of Technology was appointed on March 1978 and the school open for its classes on 15th December, 1978. The collection of the library in 1981 at the inception of the institution at its permanent site was housed in one of the apartment of the School of Engineering block and was later moved to a new classroom complex on January 1993 by then the permanent site of the library has not been built until 1988 when the foundation stone was laid by the then chairman of the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) Dr. Abdullahi. The library building was completed in 2000 and commenced users services in 2001. Dr. C. I Osuoji was the then acting rector of the institution in 1993 and later assumed office as the rector in 1996 which lasted till 2000. Mr. Chukwuma Chukwu was appointed the acting registrar while Mr. J. U. Obasi was the acting librarian. Chief Sir Uduma took over from Dr. Osuoji in 2000 as the acting rector and handed over the mantle of leadership to Engr. O. I. Nwankwo who emerged as the 6th substantive digital rector from June 2010. Mr. C. A Omenka acted as the acting rector from July 2010 to September 2010 and handed over to Dr. (Mrs.) Celestina Njoku as the rector from September 2010 till date. Mr. Ifeanyichukwu Oti was the chief librarian from 2010 to 2014, while Chief Christian Enyia is currently the chief librarian of Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Owerri.<br/>The Federal Polytechnic Nekede library has many departments which includes: the administrative department, the technical service department made up of the cataloguing and classification section, collection development section and the bindery and reprographic section, the readers service department made up of the circulation section, reference section, serials section, reserved books section, special collections section and the audio-visual or media unit and currently the library has the E-library or digital library department. <br/>Today the Federal Polytechnic Nekede Owerri Library has about 32,196 (thirty two thousand one hundred and ninety six) volumes of books in its collection according to the school’s curriculum and 3228 (three thousand two hundred and twenty eight) periodical and journal titles. It also has its collections in digital format called audio visuals. The library is also linked to the libraries of other academic institutions both foreign and within the country through its wireless internet connections.</p> <p><strong><em>1.9 Definition of Operational Terms </em></strong><br/>Academic Libraries: These are libraries established in institutions of higher learning such as universities, polytechnics, mono-technics and colleges of education to meet the educational and research objectives of their parent institutions.<br/>Challenges: A new or difficult task that tests ones ability and skills.<br/>Crime: Activities that involves breaking the law.

Library committee is defined as a group of people appointed by a larger group to deal with a particular matter in the institution. In other words they are fully involved in the planning and improvement of academic libraries in the institution. <br/>According to Izebekher (1992) library committee is a crucial internal government unit of the library, a partner in progress and a force to drive home the demands and needs of the library in the academic board. <br/>In this, the establishment of the library committee has become an accepted practice in academic libraries in Nigeria. Therefore in every well organized library, especially in the academic context, emphasis has been made on the existence of a result oriented library committee. In some academic libraries, they are as old as the library itself. According to Oduagwu (2006): library committee is the management of a library, the government of a library, the library board, library trustee board, library advisory committee etc. the library committee plays an important role, it is the committee that is responsible to provide an atmosphere where student and faculty alike will feel free to seek help of libraries and staff in obtaining information either from our own collection or from other sources. They also take part in the college programs as it strives to meet the needs of students, faculty and staff in their academic and research programs as well as providing materials for their leisure and reading needs. Library committee could be seen as a group of people appointed by the institution and government to control the entire library system. The library committee is the body of the library that makes policy. They are appointed by the institution and the government as well. Their appointment does not base because of their profession and trust but because of their ability for leadership, and are devoted to the conviction that information seeking, reading are very essential to the institution. However it should be noted that the future of the library will depend on the effectiveness with which trustees members are handling polices, and serve the interest of the library. They also advance library objectives, refrain from interfering with management and avoid politics. The absence of library committee in the institution means that when issues affecting the library are brought before the management and the academic board meeting will only be treated by the librarian and some times, he loses out in the final analysis. The researcher as a student of an institution notes that the absence of a library committee in the universities contributed to the low standard in the management of the academic library. The committee guide and promotes the library development by recommending and securing necessary funds from appropriate sources. They also guide the library and its property by making rules and regulations for the proper use of its resources and service. The committee is an advisory body and is responsible for the provision of the library services. The committee meets with the vice chancellor (VC) on the advice of the university librarian. <br/>COMPOSITION OF A LIBRARY COMMITTEE: the library committee is comprised of faculty members representing all academic department and programs. The committee meets twice each semester and it is chaired by the library director. The main functions are:<br/>a. To assist the university librarian to select materials and in recruitment of staff. <br/>b. To serve their department and programs as a knowledgeable resource for library information.<br/>c. The committee maintains a good relationship with the government and secures the interest of the library in the over all government organization and financial structure in planning and improvement.<br/>d. They enlarge public and official understanding of the library, its purpose, problems and progress so that its public relationship may be fruitful. <br/>e. They also communicate to the library director, the needs of their department and programs. <br/>f. They report to the department and programs they represent and recommend appropriate faculty action. <br/>g. The committee works and make sure that salaries of the workers are being paid and promotions are duly received. <br/>A HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF IMO STATE UNIVERSITY (IMSU) LIBRARY. <br/>The Imo state university (IMSU) library is as old as the institution which was established in 1981, following the law passed on the 13th of April 1981 by the house of assembly during late Sam Mbakwe’s administration. The school was officially opened at two campuses Ekiti and Aba in 16th Oct, 1982. The school later changed site to Okigwe during major General Ike Nwachukwu’s regime and was re-located to Owerri from Okigwe in 1992 as contained in the law establishing the institution. Imo state university was opened in 1993, and Dr. Ononogbo was the first acting librarian of the university. Since then, the library stock been noted that the library has received gifts and donation, of materials from European union, individual, British consulted, and all its activities of the library geared towards the realization of the goals of its parents institution. The library consists of two relatively large building joined, it contains about 49,000 volumes of books and can accommodate between 250-300 readers. Membership of the library is by payment of fee after which a library card is issued, and the library is open to all students. The activities of all the libraries are co-coordinated from the main library. This is to enable the library to provide effective services to it clients in various department and colleges of the institution.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 SCOPE OF STUDY </em></strong><br/>The study is basically on the role of the library committee in the Imo state university Owerri. The areas to be covered in this study include: <br/>1. The need to redress the situation by ways of seeking to, or the development of the committee in order to help the librarian and his staff to achieve the educational objectives of the institution for which the library was established. <br/>2. The problems/impediments which the library had witnessed as a result of the absence of this library committee. These problems shall be viewed as they affect the library, the librarians, the student, as well as other users of the library. <br/>3. Further more, this project covers the roles of library committee in the development of an academic library, an appraisal of its role in Imo state university Owerri (its creation till date).</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 AIMS AND PURPOSE </em></strong><br/>1. To act as a channel of information between the library and the academic development and programs. <br/>2. To find out the important of operation of the library committee to the development of the academic library. <br/>3. To represent teaching and research interests relevant to the library. <br/>4. To find out the function of the library committee in academic library <br/>5. Advice the library on collection, facility, and service policies and on new initiatives. <br/>6. To promote the libraries role and enhance its effectiveness in the educational process. <br/>7. To determine the statistic of problems that the researcher may experience thus: <br/>i. If the library committee is really functioning in Imsu library. <br/>ii. Whether the committee faces problem in the course of carrying out their duties and types of problem they are facing. <br/>8. Provide advice to help the library to achieve its mission and realize its strategic plans.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 METHODOLOGY </em></strong><br/>The researcher will then want to let you know where the above information was gotten from. Also want to know the ability of the students, whether they know what a library committee is, their function and their problems of being absent in the institution. In an effort of getting information about this, questions are distributed to the student. The questions were collected back later in order to know their individual opinion.</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTION </em></strong><br/>In this research work: the following research questions were posed to effectively address the users involved in this project. <br/>1. Is there any problem encountered by not having a library committee in an institution.<br/>2. Is there any impediment that is hampering the growth of library committee?<br/>3. Who and who are involved in the committee?<br/>4. what are their function <br/>5. Is this committee important in the institution?<br/>6. Are the students deriving any benefit from the committee?</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</em></strong><br/>It has been noted that the academic library practices in many universities in the country is nothing to write home about. It is true that it is not only one factor that is responsible for the imperfection in the universities libraries; such the library committee can be having influence in matters affecting the libraries. However the committee becomes unavoidable in every academic library distribution because of its decisive roles. The absence of library committee in any university has been a concern to most people whose interest lie on the library and documentation services. The researcher duel into this area of study, the reasons behind the continued absence of the library committee in the universities.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY </em></strong><br/>It is hoped that this research will go beyond finding the problems being envisaged to provide recorded knowledge of an ideal academic library situation. By elaborately discussing the topic, a good reference material will be achieved at the end. <br/>By usefulness of this work to students of library and information science discipline in term of reference material, clarity of expressions herein, etc will be great. Nevertheless, after reading this piece of work, the decision for one to join the campaign in advocating a library committee in each of the Imo state university will be seen by both the researcher and the institution as underscoring all other aims.</p> <p><strong><em>REFERENCES</em></strong><br/>IFIDION, S.E (1998) “essential of management fro African universities libraries” Lagos: library service ltd.

It is most unfortunate however, that many Nigerians to date have not yet realised the importance of museums to the society.<br/>To such people, museums are associated with artificacts and monuments, which are regarded as old and useless objects. Meant for incineration.<br/>This type of impression attached to museums has such affect that most of the objects which would have been very useful in the general enlightenment and education of the public suffer from deterioration.<br/>The role of museums in the preservation of knowledge – (A case study of National Museum of Colonial History Aba which is the topic of this project) – cannot be well treated if the concept of “knowledge” and “museums” are not understood.<br/>Knowledge is a philosophical concept.<br/>The origin is something which the early philosophers like plato, Aristotle and Honer had tried through various approaches to trace. However, an ordinary meaning of the word “knowledge” is “understanding” “familiarity” gained by experience”. <br/>Although, simple proof shows that knowledge is an impression or of what one had been or (remnants of it). The impression of that object left in the brain or memory is the idea of it, so idea is knowledge. <br/>A museum is defined as a temple, home, resort of the learned, an institution or repository for the collection, exhibition and study of objects of artistic, historic, scientific and educational interest.<br/>2. “It is an institution established to encourage the preservation and discovery of, as far as possible, the deterioration and loss of objects treasured by the society.<br/>Museum originated with man’s interest in collecting, accumulating precious, beautiful and curious objects. The oldest of such collections were privately financed, made by the wealthy or by the church.<br/>Museums in general, do for objects what libraries and archives do for books and Government records respectively. It is necessary to stress here that the society does not tend to preserve her objects just to hoard them, but to preserve them because of their intellectual values.<br/>It is pertinent to note that the most important phenomenon which have influenced the direction of human development and progress are scientific discoveries and warfare of these greater attention has been paid to the preservation and presentation of information relating to the former but less has been done concerning the later. Yet information about scientific episodes and the development of warfare are of equal importance if we are to have a balance view of the course of human development and progress.<br/>Man, from the prehistoric times has always been inquisite. However, there should be no doubt, therefore about the enormous role which historic museum have played in the overall shaping of the society.<br/>Unpleasant and horrible as slavery may seem, the preservation of the relics of colonial history efforts becomes the responsibility of every government that needs to be informed about itself and of course the nation’s development.<br/>The knowledge about human past activities ovide a soud foundation for present day action.<br/>To take no cognisance of this is to black out the past and there is no known society that delights in doing so. It is in this context that the establishment of National Museum of colonial history Aba finds its justification.<br/>The museum and the exhibitions therein, are aimed at preserving the colonial history of Nigeria. The purpose of this work is to enable the public see the historical events that took place before Nigeria gained her independence.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 THE DEVELOPMENT OF MUSEUMS IN NIGERIA</em></strong><br/>The history of museums in Nigeria pre-dates Arab and European times.<br/>During these periods, various cultural materials of rival. Religious and political importance were fashioned, conserved and preserved in temples or traditional shrines and the palaces of kings and chiefs. Apart from housing such cultural materials like ivory, bronze and carved wooden objects, these institutions (temples, shrines and palaces) were preserved as monuments in their own right.<br/>Some natural features like caves (for example Ogbunike cave in Anambra state) were also maintained as monuments.<br/>Persons responsible for organising and preserving the cultural materials included the head of each household, priests of various shrines and any of the kings or chiefs officers.<br/>In Igbo land, for instance, a head of the household was in charge of his family’s temple. In such temple cultural materials like iron or bronze amulets, wooden statue (Ikenga) or images of deities were kept. The head of the household or (in some cases) priests took care of ritual objects like iron gongs, ivory trumpets, drums as well stone or clay images of deities are kept in the shrines.<br/>These heads or priests acted more or less as curators, taking care of these objects.wooden and iron/bronze staffs, statues and thrones, ceremonial regalia of past kings kept in the royal palaces were taken care of by any of the king’s officers.<br/>In these pre-colonial museums, objects were preserved because of their utilitarian or symbolic value. Some of the objects found in the shrines helped to “concretise” the deities.<br/>However, the development of modern museums began during the colonial period. In 1927, Mr. Kenneth Murray, an art teacher in the British colonial service was appointed to advise the Government “on the effect of the colonial education system on local arts” (Nzewunwa 1984:101). While performing the assignment Murray made a personal collection of several Nigerian art forms. Later he advised the government on the establishment of museums and the proclamation relevant laws to prevent the illegal exportation of Nigerian works art (Murray 1966:32). However, because of the second world war, Murray’s recommendations f or the establishment of museums in three centres in Nigeria could not be implemented. Murray was therefore permitted to continue with the purchase of a permanent centre for preservation of cultural objects.<br/>The Nigerian antiquities service was established on July 28th 1943 in response to appeals by concerned Europeans like Murray and Duck work, on education officer. In 1946, Mr. J.H. Bravnholtz a keeper in the department of Ethnography of the British museum, was sent to Lagos by the colonial office to advise the British Government on the preservations of Nigerian cultural resources. In 1947, Mr. B.E. Faggs, a trained archaeologist was appointed government archaeologist and assistant surveyor of antiquities. Mr. Fagg carried out much archaeological work in Jos Plateau and helped in the establishment of the Jos museum in 1952 in which most of the archaeological materials have been preserved to this day.<br/>The then department of Antiquities and the present National commission for museum and monuments saw to the establishment of museums in different parts of Nigeria to preserve Nigeria’s cultural objects. As of date there are 29 federal museums, including museums in the making (i.e centres) in Nigeria, and at least one in each state.<br/><br/><em><strong>1.3 THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF COLONIAL HISTORY, ABA</strong></em><br/>In 1975 it was discovered that the old consulate building of the then eastern central state (6 ikot ekpene road, Aba) was abandoned and in a state of disuse. Mr. Ebenezar Onyoma was appointed as the first head of station and after all the necessary protocol arrangements had been made, the building was transferred to what is now known as the National Museum of Colonial History, Aba, Nigeria.<br/>HISTORY OF THE MUSEUM<br/>The old consulate building had a unique history because it was pre-fabricated in England and transported in parts to Nigeria in mid-nineteenth century.<br/>The building was first assembled and located at Opobo as the administrative headquarters of the oil river protectorate. It served a dual purpose as the commercial nerve centre of the British trading companies in protectorate and as its administrative command post. <br/>In the course of time, owing to trading/administrative in convenience and poor communications, the consulate was transferred to Akwete.<br/>Akwete had a natural harbour, which suited British colonial interests. The colonial traders/administrators later found that most of the oil and palm kernel which they traded in was concentrated in the hinter land and since they wanted to dominate the trade the necessity for a final move arose. Aba was chosen because the river Asa occupied a strategic position.<br/>The building was dismantled and brought to the new headquarters. The apparently happened 1898, but research subsequently revealed the date as 1902.<br/>The Aba waterside (River Asa) was called Onummiri Opobo. The reason was that at the time the Opobo people admitted this legitimate free trade, the manned the canoes filled with pots. (A pot measure was much bigger than the standard British drum used as containers. A pot was up to two big drums in British measure and was made of wood and iron bars by the Portuguese). <br/>Chief Pepple was known as their leader.<br/>A road was named after him in recognition of the role he played in the trading and urbanization of the settlement of Aba.<br/>The present location of the museum of colonial history was the seat of government. All over business-commercial, administration, the judiciary was conducted from here.<br/>Renovation work on the building as well as the erection of other buildings that would make of the museum complex continued until early 1985. Similarly, a group of ethnographers were assembled who concentrated on the write-ups and collection of materials culture on colonial matters for the purpose of setting up a museum. On 8th March 1985, the museum was officially opened by the then Governor of Imo State, Brigadier General Ike Nwachukwu.<br/>THE COLLECTIONS<br/>The collections of the museum consist of photographers of historical events, ethnographic objects and archaeological objects. In fact, 80 percent of the collections are historical, in the form of photographs and write-ups. The museum has a total of 415 historical collections, 310 ethnographic objects and 151 archaeological objects that have been inventoried.<br/>ADMINISTRATION<br/>The museum is headed by a curator who oversees the affairs of the museum.

In spite of the numerous museums in the country, this paper based on general observations and data collected from the national museum Aba. This was necessary so that an indepth study could be made within the time available for this project.<br/>The major areas of concentration include the management and collections of the museum.<br/><br/><strong><em>1.7 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</em></strong><br/>The following research questions were formulated to guide the study:<br/>1. Is there any preservation programme in your museum?<br/>2. Do you have a preservation policy?<br/>3. What are the strategies used in the preservation of knowledge?<br/>4. Do you collaborate with other institutions to preserve knowledge?<br/>5. What are the problems usually encountered in the course of preserving knowledge?</p>\n\nROLE OF MUSEUM IN THE PRESERVATION OF KNOWLEDGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ROLE OF MUSEUM IN THE PRESERVATION OF KNOWLEDGE", "id": 31}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The study presents the views of eighteen (18) staff of ministries of Education and information libraries on the availability of staff motivation in government libraries and the extent, usefulness of the motivation techniques to the staff.<br/>Eighteen questionnaires were distributed to the sample population and were fully filled and returned.<br/>The findings were presented in a tabular form and percentages were used in analysis them from the data collection and analyzed it was observed that there are in existence some types of staff motivation factors and that these identified ones are useful through the government special libraries, under study here some problems facing the effectiveness of these programmers.<br/>Conclusively, recommendations to the funding were given as follows; funding, recognition, even distribution, and relevant motivational techniques at the end appendix, questionnaire and bibliographies were also included.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></em><br/>Motivation could be seen as that within the individual which his behaviours. One can therefore, say that motivation is the drive that ignites and energies the individual at work to act the way he does in any work group.<br/>A motivated worker especially in government libraries is expected to feel contented and happy, and would perform his assigned work willingly and enthusiastically. Staff motivation could be seen as that means of gingering up workers to perform well in discharging their duties.<br/>Staffing has been the main problem facing government libraries in Nigeria. In addition to undertstaffing in terms of numerical strength, most government libraries in the country have no qualified staff; Shair Ogusheye, Oguara, Moglim and a host of other highlighted this lack of qualified librarians in government libraries.<br/>However, the situation has not remained static, some improvements have been made, while Ogusheye found only twelve professional libraries among the thirteen government libraries. She studied in 1970, only seventy-five percent of libraries surveyed by Oguara in 1995 have professional librarians.<br/>Despite the improvement, a good number of government libraries are without professional librarians, this is due to the attitude of management of parent organization towards the library.<br/>STAFF MOTIVATION FACTORS<br/>An organization is said to have good management if it is not only able to top the maximum potentials from its employees but also able to produce a favourable comparative amount of job satisfaction for the employees.<br/>The motivational factors includes; good salary, good working environment, free medicare, job security, good carree benefit, good retirement benefit, subsidies of meal, housing allowance, a good sense of belonging and responsibilities as we as welfare and staff developments through seminars, conferences and framing e.t.c <br/>It is undoubtedly believe that the qualification and efficiency of output by any organization is determined by the caliber of manpower or human resources are some of the cardinal factors of production. And in view of the topic under study the efficiency of human resources management stems from the adequate definition of government librarianship and its services.<br/>Both staff and the organization to which he belong have mutual expectations and desirable benefits. The full attainment of any organizational goal is only made possible through the satisfaction of the needs and desires and of member of that organization .<br/>THE CONCEPT OF GOVERNMENT LIBRARIES <br/>According to a definition by the government libraries attached to government institution.<br/>A UNESCO PUBLICATION DEFINES GOVERNMENT Libraries as libraries primarily designed to serve a limited number of experts, scientist, research workers e.t.c ; and not coming within ang categories like national, university and school libraries. Their holdings are specific and relate to some particular subject coverage; for instance, agriculture, medicine, law history, economic e.t.c, these libraries may be attached to various bodies such as parliament, government <br/>Department e.t.c <br/>Here handy (2000) clearly acknowledge the nature of the job of a special librarian as that of exploiter of information. This shows the main job of government libraries in informant services rather than documentation or duty delivery. Government libraries enable professionals and researchers to keep abreast of available research and information relevant to their organization.<br/>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT LIBRARIES <br/>Government libraries can be grouped into the following categories; federal, state, and the local government own library centers. Both the federal and the state governments owned majority of the libraries out of those listed by Oguara. Only thre were owned by private association, thirty-eight by Federal and fifteen by the state.<br/>Government libraries are in adequate in that, many of these libraries are very small and highly specialized user’s access to their holdings is limited. The different types of government libraries are <br/>A. ministry of education library <br/>B. ministry of justice (law library)<br/>C. ministry of information library <br/>D. ministry of health library</p> <p><strong><em>1.1 HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF MINISTRIES OF EDDUCATION AND INFORMATION LIBRARIES </em></strong><br/>1.2 This ministries are part of the government administrative establishment set up to serve and maintain the regulatory and civil right of citizens, government through the office of its executive issues out order which will be expected to pass through a channel of hierarchy of command from the top the bottom in the organization. <br/>1.3 This simply shows how works are been carried out from the upward flow to the down ward to the last person in the level of command in discharging and carrying out of activities. This establishment was set up under the government policies and this policies affects all their activities in all the department .all the activities in and out of the ministry is maintained and supported by the government fund <br/>ROLES AND FUNCTIONS OF MINISTRY OF EDUCATION LIBRARY <br/>THIS IS A GOVERNMENT SPECIAL LIBRARY attached to educational ministry in other to solve and maintain some problems and standards associated to the educational sector in the state. Mean while, this library is district from other type of library ,because it manifest a peculiar characteristic it contains those relevant materials that meets the requirement of users or staff who might need it for educational, knowledge, collection, retrieval, selection dissemination, storage e.t.c purposes.<br/>This library also houses government special publication, especially on education issues and displays of new government approved reading materials to various schools and collages, some publications on workshop, seminar conference with relevant topic are also showcased in the education library. This library maintained and stored a special educational collection which are properly documented for easy retrieval and collection by cliental<br/>ROLE AND FUNTION OF MINISTRY OF INFORMATION LIBRARY <br/>This ministry is also a part of the government administrative function organ. This library have a special collection on informative, materials such as brakes, periodical , new papers, special government publication e.t.c <br/>This ministry in particular is divided into many broad branches according to their subject they are:<br/>A. department of news and broadcasting services <br/>B. department of culture, archives, monument and other evidential valued materials.<br/>C. department of display /extention services, (through creation of publicity, assaneness campaign of recent publication, public enlightenment, public relation) e.t.c. <br/>D. library board unit/section <br/>E. government press and publishing for instance publication of newspapers and books e.t.c <br/>F. administrative block; where duties are been discharged for effective utilization and productivity. <br/>Information ministry is very essential organ in the mination of information, because their main function is to discharge information to those who need it for a purpose.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </em></strong><br/>The major function of a library is the collection, organization, retiring and dissemination of information the desire with which to acquire are disseminate this information is the motivation of library staff. However, with the rate of government motivation strategies very few people have the interest of working in the library. We should realize that adequate motivation technique creates avenue for workers to have interest on the library Job. Also because of the negligence on the pent of the parent body and the rate of untrained librarians, the maximum satisfaction that they desired could not be attained.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF STUDY</em></strong><br/>General objective:<br/>The broad objective of the research work is to investigate the roles and the extents of the existence of the staff motivation in government libraries .<br/>Specific objective:<br/>a.

One cannot do anything without technology teaching aspect of our lives like making calls (telephone) banking Susanne and even library operations. It has changed and continues to change the world our parents knew. This has led to library Automation.<br/>Library Automation is seen as the computerization of library records and functions. It uses computer software and hardware for task that otherwise require a lot of paper work and staff time. It also make possible of a wide, free automation is traced to the continuous interaction between technology purpose and applications. One of the reasons for library automation is the apparent or visible improvement in the access to information by users in the library.<br/>Automation has many impacts on academic libraries. One of the impacts of automation in the library is the high and increasing efficiency of operation in the library. This helps to save staff time and it reduces work load. This increase efficiency has also helped to decrease delay, backlogs, errors, staff dissatisfaction etc.<br/>The efficiency has affected all the operation of the library. The functions of the library which acquisition, organization, dissemination and maintenance are performed. Automation has led to the timely delivery of the above functions. It also makes them accurate, precise are relevant.<br/>In the area of compilation of accession list, maintaining library statistics, charging and discharging of books, compiling over-due notices, keeping book on the reserved and maintaining library roster, automation has helped to avoid repetition. The benefit of networking and interconnectivity is also associated with library Automation.<br/>There are many other areas in which automation helped or has advantage over manual system.<br/>Automation has many positive impacts on academic libraries so also it has negative impacts (challenges) on the libraries. There are clear signs that automation of libraries also have with its some inherent problems. For example a novice searching of a book in the library that is automation many individual cannot afford to learn the skill to use them at the movement and without being a computer literate you cannot use the automated library effectively.</p> <p><strong>1.2 BRIEF HISTORY OF CASE STUDY (FEDPONEK)</strong><br/>The Federal Polytechnic Nekded Owerri Library was established by Edict No16 1978.

The instrument for data collection was questionnaires were used for data analysis.<br/>The study reveals that the importance of internet to student constitutes the most important aspect of academic enhancement; it helps and support students in acquiring knowledge especially the library students and other students. It also reveals that these students have different responses and different approaches in the importance of interne either by academic culture or for other reasons peculiar to them. The different categories of internet websites are used by students and their reasons for using them depend on the individual users. The findings also reveals that the students utilizes the internet in order to assist them in their various research works and thereby providing the needed information in their field of interest <br/>The utility of the internet and its websites as an aid to student appears to be means and channel of enhancing their knowledge.<br/>More importantly, the study seek to establish how internet importance are utilized by student in tertiary institutions especially the Imo State University student.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>The word internet is a connection of millions of computers around the glob, such that a user of one of the connected computers could have access to any of the other computers.<br/>According to Benson (2002) the internet is a loose of inter-connecting commercial and non-commercial computer networks. The constituent networks are tied together by telecommunications lines and by their shared reliance on standard communications controls. The internet with a capital “I” refers to a world-wide system of linked computer system. When used with a small “I” it is a term used to mean a group of inter-connected local networks. The net is the global association of thousands of networks and millions of computers across the world that carries data and makes the exchange of information possible. This network of computers is also referred to as global information system or information super high way.<br/>The internet is also known by some people as the web, this is the largest computer networks with thousands f network using a communication protocol known as TCP/IP which means Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.<br/>The internet sometimes called simple “This Net” is a world wide system of computer networks (connections)actually, it is a networks of networks in which users or any one who uses one computer can if they have permission to get information from any other computers (and sometimes talk directly to users at other computers) on-line chat.<br/>Before going into the project, there is need to shed light into information and computer because as earlier stated that the internet is a global association of thousands of networks and millions of computers across the world that carries data and makes the exchange of information possible. Like we know that computer is a mediator between the users because is through the computer that the user browses through the different website in the internet to get proper information.<br/>The world book dictionary volume one A.K. also defined internet as a global computer network which links smaller networks including the universities, government resources and also individuals.<br/>According to Cambridge International Dictionary of English, internet is defined as the large system of many connected as the large system of many connected computers around the world, which people use to communicate with each other.<br/>The internet is devoted solely for the purpose of connecting people from different areas in the world and also providing or making available information in a particular subject interest of the user. It also enhances users communicating via-e-mail with peers in other cities, or other culture or through contact with expert in the filed of interest.<br/>According to Madu (2004), the internet is a public cooperative and self sustaining facility accessible to hundred of millions of people world-wide.<br/>Physically, the internet utilizes a portion of the total resources of the currently existing public telecommunication network. Technically, what distinguish the internet is its utility of set of protocol called TCP/IP.<br/>Many internet users, electronic mail is most widely used applicated on the net. One can also carry on-line conversations with other computer users, using internet chart and more recently internet telephone hardware and software now allow read time voice conversation.</p> <p><strong>1.2 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF IMO STATE UNIVERSITY AND ITS LIBRARY</strong><br/>The then Imo State University in Uturu was established in 1981 following the bill passed by the late chief Mbakwe’s Administration on the 13th of April 1981.<br/>The school was officially opened in Etiti in 1981 with a second campus at Aba on temporary site. The school was letter moved to Okigwe by the then military administer major general Ike Nwachukwu (rtd).<br/>The establishment of the school grew out of the need for an academic institution of the highest status owned supported and managed by the state in order to attend the academic of Imo indigene in gaining admissions into university the first phase of the permanent building for the university was later completed at Okigwe, with an ultra-modern university building. The university was renamed Abia State University Okigwe in 1992 following the creation of new Abia state from the old Imo state.<br/>The present Imo State University Okigwe was left to Abia State because of the change of asset which presented Imo State from having no university now occupies the former temporary site of federal university of technology Owerru (FUTO) at late Nwaebere campus inheriting the physical facilities vacated by the federal university of technology Owerri as they move to their permanent site at Ihiagwa.<br/>The objectives philosophy as aspiration of the university includes encouraging the advancement of learning in Imo state and Nigeria in particular to guide all persons without discriminations of race, set the opportunity to acquire higher education for the purpose of carrying the philosophy and objectives. The university and its vice chancellor professor O.E. Nwaebo 2009 till date.<br/>The new Imo state university quickly matured and rose to the occasion to defend her future and defend her motto: Excellence in services guided by the philosophy and mission of the university as enunciated by the founding fathers.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The study is aimed at surveying the importance of internet to student of higher institution.<br/>However, the specific objectives are as follows:<br/>1. To find out if students use the internet<br/>2. To identify the reasons why students use the internet<br/>3. To identify how often the student use the internet<br/>4. To ascertain the contributions of the internet services to the academic achievement of the student<br/>5. To identify the factors affecting effective use of the internet by students<br/>6. To proffer solutions to factors affecting effective use of internet by students</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>The following questions were formulated in line with the objectives of the study. They are as follows:<br/>1. Do you make use of the internet?<br/>2. Why do you use the internet?<br/>3. How often do you use the internet?<br/>4. How has the internet contributed to your academics?<br/>5. What are the factors affecting effective use of the internet?<br/>6. What are the solutions to the problems militating against effective use of internet?</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Considering the fact that internet is used in all faces of the economy and in all fields of endeavour, this study will be of great significance to the entire society particularly in academic institutions in Nigeria universities especially to Imo state library. The study will be of immense value to researchers conducting their studies in related subject as it will remain a useful and reference document. The study will also help in developing the knowledge of the researcher in the internet facilities in academic libraries in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The emphasis on this project is the importance of internet to students of academic institutions in Nigeria, means that the researcher will concentrate on the reason why internet is important to student. It focuses on the following departments as area of study.<br/>Department of Library and Information Science and Mass Communication Students Imo State University Owerri.<br/>Project is limited to the student of IMSU because the students have similar objectives for making use of internet resources in their academic institutions.</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINITION OF BASIC CONCEPTS</strong><br/>IMPORTANCE: The state of facts of being great significance. It can also be an exaggerated sense of one’s own value.<br/>INTERNET: Internet is the largest computer network in the world. It is a network of thousands of networks using the communication known as transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP) (Oduagwu, 2008).<br/>STUDENTS: Here, the student can be seen as a person who is studying at a university or college.<br/>ACADEMIC: Here, academic includes a lot of reading and studying rather than practical or technical skills especially studying in school and universities. <br/>INSTITUTION: Here, institution is the highest level of education where you can study for a degree or do any research. They are institution for knowledge generation and development to become experts in many spheres of human endeavour.</p>\n\nIMPORTANCE OF INTERNET TO STUDENTS OF ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPORTANCE OF INTERNET TO STUDENTS OF ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS IN NIGERIA", "id": 35}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 OVERVIEW</strong><br/>One would ask what motivated the researcher to embark on this research work. The answer is simple. The researcher developed keen interest in serials acquisition policy, procedure and management in academic libraries two important factors motivated the researcher to undertake this study first was the acquisition of serials and the inability of librarians to really managed these acquired. Second was the important of serials in libraries.<br/>The role of serials in dissemination of information in academic library system cannot be overemphasized. Like orange juice, milk and bread, information better when it is fresh. Serials from the backbone of any academic library or research library because of their currency in information. In this way, they aid the dissemination of current information.<br/>Information explosion has necessitated an improvement in the gathering, processing and dissemination of information sources in libraries. Hence they could be say to be indispensable in academic libraries. The use of serials in academic research has continued to be on the increase in recent times. This has further necessitated their effective development and management.<br/>The term serials and periodical are synonymous. They are under interchangeably to refers to the materials imprint or non-print form that are produced serially or periodically. As indicated in the Anglo. American cataloguing rule (1978) a serial is a publication in any medium issued in successive part bearing numerical or chronological designation and intend to be continued indefinitely.<br/>The part of serial publication may be published at different materials e.g. daily, weekly, month, bi-monthly, quarterly, annually, bi-annually and so forth by an academic society, a research institution, a learned society, a reputable publishing organization, a professional body. Some serials one published on subject bases while some one on general topic. It is sterility that distinguishes serial publication from book and monographs and it is the periodicity that dictates format and price.<br/>Serials are pointed out lawal (1982) in serial acquisition and management in Nigerian university libraries problems and prospects.<br/>can be regarded as the nerve centre of any university or academic library because they contain the most up to date information or research and knowledge. Hey are useful for study teaching, learning and research purposes, serials includes journals, magazine, newspaper, bulletins, newsletters, memories, report, year book and directories.<br/>Today, it has not been easy for serials librarians to acquired all the necessary information resources needed. This is as a result of confusion and about over sources of and acquisition idiosyncrasies on the part of book dealers. Even where these materials are supplied, there is yet this problem of storage facilities and equipment to use. Insight shows that the attendant result of these ugly trend is that academics libraries one losing a considerable number of their clientele interims of providing the required information as and when due.<br/>For a library to achieve it’s objectives effectively. It must be able to co-ordinate both its human and materials resources properly. The effectiveness in the usage of serials depend on the efficiency of serials management in nay library. Serials have to be selected, acquired, stored, retrieve and disseminated to the users. This is where serial acquisition and management becomes indispensable.<br/>Woodward (1991) is of the opinion that acquisition and management of serials need skills as in any successfully manage business. It is a two way communication and clearly perceive task and understanding of the collection is a, must, he stressed that serial acquisition and management comprises all activities needs to facilitate and implement efficient and effective transfer of information to the potential users and thereby fulfill the objectives of the library wishes to achieve.<br/>Like any other concept, management evolves diverse memories in a variety ways. According to Fussler, K. (1963) acquisition is the process by which libraries achieve or documented materials needed by their patrons or clientele. While management according to entrain and jack (1981) is the planning and integrating of effort, judicious uses of resources, motivation of people and provision of leadership other to guide an organization towards it’s goal and objectives in the efficient manner.<br/>The carryout the above functions, managers are engaged in a continuous process of making decision. Acquisition and management is the beefing up the library stock and proper organizing and preserving of it, management is equivalent to decision making. <br/>The goal of serial acquisition and management is to deliver promptly that serial literature, which the users needs. Librarians serving in academic libraries should realizing that researcher and users of the library require a wide range of knowledge. Realizing the complexity of the situation as well as the increasing trend towards publication in serial form, the selection and acquisition should be done on those information need of the organization. The researcher will investigate into problems of serials acquisition and management in academic library of Imo State University.</p> <p><strong>1.2 BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON IMO STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY</strong><br/>The institution was established in 1981 by Imo state government as a dual or muilti-campus. The university has one campus at Ekiti and the other one were located at Aba.<br/>On October, 1981 the university was financed and structures were laid up by late of Imo state Sam Mbakwe being the governor of Imo state by then.<br/>The university move to it’s permanent site at Uturu Okigwe in 1986 with the creation of Abia State from old Imo State in 1992, the Soul of Imo state university was reborn at Owerri in 1992.<br/>The Imo State library is located in the core academic area and situated in an excavation which shields it from noise and predispose it to leaning and research. Conspicuous sign posts easily lead a new comes from the university main fate to the library. The library consists of two relatively large buildings which are joined together. The library can contain up to 50,000 vol. off books and 400,450 readers at fully carnality.<br/>There is a specious accommodation for an education technology centre. The library has a modest collection of books, journals, and little government publication, at the presents and embarks on an aggressive collections development programmes from places like Ranturly library services, UK, which includes among other things lecture note of the British Open University. The library also has an information and communication technology (ICT) centre housed very closed to the university librarians office.</p> <p><strong>1.3 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>Serial is the backbone of every academic library because of it’s indispensable nature as careers of current information on research findings in all field of human endevours. Therefore such as books are acquired organized, stored and display that users will make effective use of it. So, also there is need for proper co-ordination and management of serials. For that serial sections of a library to serve it’s patrons effectively.<br/>When one task about acquisition and management of serials. It involves normal disbursement of fund and how to manage fund coming in and going out of the library. But unfortunately one discovers that the proper co-ordination and utilization of serial resources in Imo state academic library are fraught with numerous problems which makes it difficult for the libraries to pay the expected roles.<br/>To determine the problems that affect the effective management of serials in Imo state academic library (university) is the essence of these investigation. The areas to be investigated are funding stating, selections of information materials, acquisition, storage facilities, personnel, organization, as well as the management style and techniques to these problems.</p> <p><strong>1.4 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The objectives of the study are <br/>I. To determine how the serial collections are acquired in Imo sate university library.<br/>II. To find out how the library serials are organized.<br/>III. To find out how these serials are circulated and disseminated.<br/>IV. To find out the qualification of staff working in the Nigerian section of the library<br/>V. To ascertain the factors that affect the acquisition and management of serials in the library.<br/>VI. To recommend solution on how to improve the acquisition and management of serial in Imo state university library.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>I. How are serials acquired in the library?<br/>II. how are serials organized in Imo state university library?<br/>III. How are serials circulated and disseminated in the library?<br/>IV. What is the strength and qualification of staff of Nigeria section of Imo state university library?<br/>V. How can serials collections be managed in Imo state university library?<br/>VI. What are the factors that hinder effective management of serials collections of the library?</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The study is limited to only the Nigerian section of Imo state university library Owerri. The researcher will cover such area as selection, acquisition, organization and storage, circulation and dissemination of information materials, funding, personnel, as well as management style of the serials department.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SIGNIFCANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The Imo state university library is a state owned organization. Like very other state owned organization. It has been fraught with so many problems which are left un attended to over the years, as a result, there has been so much decay in the library as well as the library serials department (NIGERIAN). The information materials are so old and current materials are very rare. Serials rendered to clients are not the best and therefore not effective. These problem and more one what the researcher intends to investigate.<br/>In discovering these problems, the investigator will also proffer valuable solutions to these problems.<br/>It is expected that the study will be kind of blue print for other academic libraries that would like to establish a serial department. The researcher also hope that the work will be significance to people with task of managing serial collections of the library. It is also hope that study will be of immeasurable benefit to the following people viz. libraries, librarians in training, universities, polytechnic or college of education planners, administrator, resources persons and pursuers of knowledge and learning.</p> <p><strong>1.8 DEFINITIONS OF TERMS</strong><br/><strong>SERIALS:</strong> A serial is defined as a publication issued in successive part bearing numerical or chronological designation intended to be continue indefinitely, serials include periodical (Newspapers, magazines, journals and memo’s, proceeding transactions of societies, annual (report, year book and numbered monographic series). <br/><strong>ACADEMIC LIBRARIES: </strong>These are libraries that cater for the teaching, research and recreational needs of students, lecturers, and non academic staff in institution of higher learning like polytechnics, universities, college of education and monotechnics etc.<br/><strong>LIBRARY ACQUISITION: </strong>Acquisition is the process on obtaining library materials to satisfy the need of users. It is also the process of obtaining books and other materials for the library, documentation centre or achieves.<br/><strong>LIBRARY MANAGEMENT:</strong> Library manager broadly defined includes all the things that go on from time a group of citizens establishes a library to serve it’s need to the moment that library does something which helps a citizen. The objectives of the institution and its methods, it facilities and personnel are involved.</p>\n\nACQUISITION AND MANAGEMENT OF SERIAL IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ACQUISITION AND MANAGEMENT OF SERIAL IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES", "id": 36}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Academic libraries play a prominent role in providing information services in various forms to researchers, scientist, policy makers, planners etc. a well organized academic library should have ICT to assist both patrons and information professionals in the libraries. This research work highlights the use and problems of I.C.T in Nigeria academic libraries particular interest on the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka. ICT facilitates access to electronic information which has become invaluable and complementing traditional library resources. This study describes what an ICT is all about. It identifies the role of ICT in academic libraries to improve the standard of information in the country. This research work also describes the types of ICTs found in academic libraries and the problems facing the use of ICT and also suggest strategies on how to overcome ICT problems in Academic Libraries. </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Layman tends to equate the application of ICT in any profession to being online, meaning connected to the internet. Although the internet is an integral part of the ICT, it is not all there is to it. This paper seeks to investigate the many opportunities for the application of ICT in Nigerian academic libraries. It is hoped that the use of ICT in academic libraries will assist both the patrons and the library and information professionals in the libraries.<br/>However, what is the ICT? ICT is an acronym for information and communication technology but beyond this acronym, “there is not a universally accepted definition of ICT why? Because the concepts, methods and applications involved in ICT are constantly evolving on an almost daily basis. It’s difficult to keep up with the changes they happen so fast. A good way to think about ICT is to consider all the uses of digital technology that already exist to help individuals, businesses and organizations use information. ICT covers any product that will store, retrieve, manipulate, transmit or receive information electronically in a digital form. For example personal computer, digital television, email, robots (wwwtutor24.net.2006)<br/>Also ICT is an umbrella that includes any communication device or application encompassing radio, television, cellular phones, computer and network hardware and software, satellite systems and so on, as well as the various services and applications associated with them such as video conferencing and distance learning.<br/>From these definitions, some of the application of ICT has become clear such as video conferencing and distance learning, both of which can be facilitated by the academic library. Other applications of the ICT specific to libraries could include access to online resources on the internet such as e-journals, e-books and e-magazines, e-publishing, using CD-ROM for literature searches, access to local or network data bases on LAN (local area network) or WAN (wide area network). The opportunities for the application of the ICT in an academic library especially in a developing nation like Nigeria seem endless.<br/>The application or sue of ICT in Nigeria academic library is justified in that it provides access to learning resources, information and knowledge until now inaccessible by reason of distance technology.<br/>However, since according to the European commission the importance of ICT lies in the technology itself in its ability to create greater access to information and communication.</p> <p><strong>1.2 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE CASE STUDY NNAMBDI AZIKIWE UNIVERSITY AWKA</strong><br/>Following the split of the former Anambra state into two states, Anambra and Enugu states the Awka and Nnewe campuses of the former Anambra state university of etchnology, were by the Anambra state Edict No 5 of November 26, 1991 constituted into Nnamdi Azikiwe University. The Edict up hold Awka and Nwewi as campuses of the university.<br/>The university was taken over by the federal government with effect from September 1, (1992, by Decree No 34 of July 15, 1992).<br/>The RT. Hon. Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the Owelle of Onitsha after whom the university is named was in the vanguard of the fight against colonialism in Africa and was the doyen of the independence struggle in Nigeria. Believing in the use of education was a veritable tool in the liberation struggle and in the enthronement of the dignity of man. He founded the autonomous Nigerian university. His choice of a name for that university the university of Nigeria, is an eloquent testimony to his belief in an commitment to Nigerian unity.<br/>The main campus of the university is located at Awka sited thirty-five kilometers to the South-West of Awka and the second campus is at Nnewi.<br/>The university has a population of twenty-four thousand seven hundred and six (24,706) for the full-time and twelve thousand, four hundred and seventy-six (12,476) students for the part-time programmes during the 2004/2005 academic year.<br/>THE UNIZIK DIGITAL LIBRARY<br/>“A GIGANTIC VISION”<br/>The UNIZIK Digital library has been described as the foremost and biggest on-line library in the country. UNIZIK bulletin crew was informed of this fact when they visited the Digital Librarian, Dr. Chinwe Anunobi, at her office on the 8th of February 2011.<br/>The Digital library is a unit of the university library. The library is located at the centre of the university called Prof. Festus Aghagbo Nwako library.<br/>The purpose of the visit was to find out how staff and students make use of the digital facility as well as the challenges facing it. Dr. Anunobi, who called the digital outfit “a gigantic vision” spoke volumes about the indispensable position of the library to modern scholarship and research in the life of any university that must reckon with the global challenges of the 21st century.</p> <p><strong>1.3 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>There are copious studies and opinion on the use of ICT facilities for library functions in general. In Nigerian university libraries, ICT facilities were primarily used fro serials functions and are still in use. However not much has be found in literature as regards the areas of functions they are used and the facilities is use. Hence the survey tends to address this gap by identifying the extent of ICT use in the academic libraries operations.</p> <p><strong>1.4 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>1) To find out the level of existence of ICT in Nnamdi Azikiwe university library.<br/>2) To ascertain the extent of use of ICT in Nnamdi Azikiwe university library. <br/>3) To find out the level of utilization of ICT in Nnamdi Azikiwe university library <br/>4) To show the advantages and benefits of the use of iCT in Nnamdi Azikiwe university library <br/>5) To identify the problems encountered in the use of ICT in Nnamdi Azikiwe university library</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTION</strong><br/>The following research questions will be used to guide the study.<br/>1) What are the ICT facilities available in the university library?<br/>2) What are the reasons for using the ICT resources by the students?<br/>3) What are the inhibiting factors against the usage of ICT resources?<br/>4) Which of the ICT facilities are used mostly by the students?<br/>5) Do the university staffs make use of ICT facilities?<br/>6) Does a student feel better in making use of the ICT facilities?</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This research topic is wide both in scope and study; therefore it cannot be adequately covered. Fro this reason the researcher will limit herself to the Nnamdi Azikiwe University digital library and the librarians, staffs, and students within the institution to gather their views on the use of ICT in academic library in Nigeria.<br/>The scope of study with advantage and befits on the use of ICT in their academic library. The researcher is also going to find out how staff ad students make use of the digital facility as well as the challenges facing the use of ICT in the university library.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The result of this survey will help academic libraries which do not apply ICT facilities in their library to know their importance in the use of ICT in the academic library. And the areas of the library in which ICT can be used, and the ICT they can use, with that they can strategize on their use.<br/>For libraries using ICT facilities for various operations, they will be acquainted with other areas ICT can be employed in the Library operation and the institutions applying such. Donor agencies will also be aware of the state of ICT facilities application in Nigerian university library operation and decide on the areas to assist such institutions.</p> <p><strong>1.8 OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>INFORMATION: The oxford advance learner’s dictionary 7th edition defines information as facts or details about somebody or something.<br/>COMMUNICATION: The oxford advance learners dictionary 7th edition defines communication as the activity or process of expressing ideas and feelings or of giving people information.<br/>TECHOLOGY: oxford advance learners dictionary 7th edition defines technology as scientific knowledge used in practical ways in industry for example in designing new machines.<br/>ACADEMIC LIBRARIES: Academic libraries are libraries attached to tertiary institutions such as universities, polytechnic institutions, colleges of education, colleges of agricultures, colleges of technology and also research institutes (Apkorhonour, 2005).</p>\n\nUSE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " USE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA", "id": 37}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This is a research on problems of acquisition of materials and services to users in special libraries in Nigeria.

But for the purpose of this frame topic, it is geared to the legislature via the library.<br/>Waiting in his introducing remarks oparaku (2011) professionally defines an ideas library therefore, is a collection or selection of books accompanied a machinery for their exploitation operated by people trained in the necessary techniques. He informed further that in modern times, a library must also be taken to include in its resources material other than books such as periodicals, illustrations, films, records, types etc. (AVM) in addition the library must indicate or provide methods of reaching resources of information which cannot be provided from any of the graphic or other recorded sources.<br/>Relatedly, library of congress located just east of the United States capital, is one of the largest and most valuable research libraries in the word. It has more than 12 million books and pamphlets and millions of charts manuscripts, maps, musical compositions, engravings, lithographs and other items. The world book encyclopedia of value 12,1976 inform that the library owns the united states collection of incunabula (books printed before 1501) they represent the earliest product of printing press, which are invented about three thousand (3000) of them, known as the vollber collection, were brought in 1930 at a cost of $ 11/2million.</p> <p><strong>1.2 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF IMO HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY</strong><br/>Imo State was on of the seven newly created states by the federal military government on February 3, 1976. The constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria, 1979, made provision for the establishment of a house of assembly in each state.<br/>The constitution also provided that a state house of assembly shall consist of democratically elected members three times the total number of seats which of representatives in compliance such stipulations, the Imo State house of assembly consist of 90 elected numbers in the second republic.<br/>In accordance with a proclamation by the federal military government the Imo State house of assembly as well as other state October 1999. Of the 90 pioneer members of the state house of assembly four resigned to take up other appointments in the executive arm of the state and the federal government while are died in active service thus creating five seats (house of assembly Imo State Nigeria brochure August 1980). <br/>Contemporarily, if is understandably therefore that when the military shoots into the control of government, being a non-representative government, if takes away the soul of democracy the legislature.<br/>Before 1985 and 1999, when the military, which is a dictatorship, kept a vice-like gripe an power in Nigeria, it scrapped the legislature in that period the legislative structure, tradition and practice atrophied and indeed were almost extinct from the fourth republic (Preface) cover 1999, if writers to assert to the return of democracy in 1999 was therefore a new beginning, a self rediscovery for the legislature in Nigeria.<br/>The house is headed by the speaker on the legislative arm while by the clerk/permanent secretary.</p> <p><strong>1.3 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>As I have definition-ally established earlier on in the course of the development of this project, modern library set up, especially the “special Library in which the legislature is best with some problem. Accordingly, Justifiably, these problem range from poor budgetary government funding, poor accommodation, unqualified and at times in sufficient staff, poor motivation, administrative and corporate interference and intervention, inordinate ambition of the library attendant to get rich quick by not passing through them poor information network, lack of communication and office fools, lack of innovation and inventiveness or creativity, lack of expansion, obsolete and outdated library stock, lack of training and refraining and library rules and regulation are known inhibiting problems for library and information services especially legislature of Imo State.</p> <p><strong>1.4 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>The study seeks to:<br/>1. Asses the Library and information services to the Imo State legislature.<br/>2. Determine the extend of government funding of the legislature.<br/>3. Examine roles played by the workers in the library and other departments on information services to the legislature.<br/>4. Determine or ascertain whether information rendered to the legislature is applied and used by the legislators.<br/>5. Proffer suggestion, solutions and accommodations why necessary.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS.HYPOTHESIS</strong><br/>At the end of literature review, the following hypothesis were for mutated and fasted, the mill hypothesis.<br/>i. Poor information services are caused by library and information services unit of the legislature.<br/>ii. Lack of consistent and organic platform of information dissemination brings about in effectiveness and inefficiency in the state legislation</p> <p><strong>1.6 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>In every sphere of human activities, these are bound to be some constraints which fend to militate against the achievement of a predetermined objectives and goals. Accordingly, the researcher was faced with problems of finance, in the course of writing this project. The time frame for the project was also a threatening one; it was too short, in view of the fact of final year preogramme.<br/>The issue of transport fares, as you are highly aware or the present cost and standard of living in the country because of distance for a student disturbed the project, but in any way, God saw us through of thro and fro to legislature (House of Assembly).</p> <p><strong>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The study emphasizes the legislature. The legislature process is a widened are that fouches all aspects of human endearours for purposes of simplicity and orderly presentation of the work in the study, the researcher will the whole legislature aim of government in Imo State, which is the cradle of law making process.</p> <p><strong>1.8 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>There is need for humorous working relationship between the workers and legislatures (in the Legislature) as a veritable tool for a fair legislature the state in order to realize the dividends of democracy.<br/>It is also significant that it will add to the existing literature on library and information services in the process of law making in Imo State in particular and Nigeria in general.<br/>Finally, much has been said on process of law making or conditions in which bills are presented and approved off.</p>\n\nPROBLEMS OF ACQUISITION OF MATERIAL AND SERVICES TO USERS IN SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS OF ACQUISITION OF MATERIAL AND SERVICES TO USERS IN SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA", "id": 38}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This research work is on the role of information and communication technology (ICT) in the provision of reference service in public library user in Nigeria.

Information revolution has brought about convergence of information and communication technologies (ICTS), which have remained at the nucleus of global social and economic transformation (Ajayi 2003). The information revolution and extra ordinary increase in the spread of knowledge has produced a new era-one of knowledge and information which affects directly economic, social, cultural and political activities of all regions of the world including Africa. Governments world wide have recognized the role that information and communication technologies (ICTS) could play in socio-economic development (Ogunsola 2005).<br/>As information procurement and dissemination organizations libraries all over the world have found themselves right in the middle of the ICT driven Global village” and in other to play active roles in the village, public libraries have no other choice than to boost their effectiveness. Libraries are becoming more aware that in order to play cartelistic roles in fostering access to information as the basis for the socio-economic development of their countries, they need to exploit ICTs to improve the range and quality of service to their clientele (Ajibola and Tiamiyu, 2000).<br/>Gilbert, (2000) defined information and communication technology as the acquisition, analysis manipulation storage and distribution of information and the design and provision of equipment and software. Oketunji (2004) stated that “Information and communication technology could be defined as an electronic means of capturing, processing, storing and communicating information”. He went on to say that ICT is defined as a convergence between computing and communication technologies. Furthermore, he said that one early exam0le of ICT convergence is the crossing of the photocopy machine and telephone, leading to creation of fax machine. But the most spectacular achievement in this area is the convergence of computer and telephone that resulted to the upsurge of the internet.<br/>Ajibero (2004) asserted that the role of ICT in the provision of references services to public library in Nigeria did not come over night. Libraries existed for many centuries without using ICTs. But as technology emerged in the world at large, public libraries embraced these tools as a means to avoid some of the menial tasks inherent in managing large collections. Online catalogues provide additional searching possibilities. Such system help in communicating with one another about which book are held in the libraries and use the computer to borrow various materials form any other library through various inter library loan systems. Public libraries can be transformed into a new information services unit, providing electronic cataloging, electronic online public access catalogued, electronic acquisition and serials controls, and electronic circulation functions and reference services. But it must be realized that most public libraries in Nigeria are yet to adopt modern ICT.<br/>However, because of the imperativeness of integrating ICTs in public library functions, Nigeria public libraries must seize this opportunity. Although it seems impossible presently because of the problems and inadequate facilities playing he Nation and her public libraries. This research work is therefore based on the role of ICT in the provision of reference services to public library use in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>This is an information age, the down of a new era where information flows before use with promise of new ways of thinking, living and working through the use role of ICTs and other information technologies. Unfortunately, despite the undoubted benefit/potentials of ICTs in public libraries, Nigeria public libraries are still far from integrations and equipping he invaluable resources of ICT facilities in her reference services most public libraries in Nigeria have not embraced these evolutional technologies in their references services. They still resort to the manual services and process of storing and retrieving information which is faced with number of problem that have brought frustrations on the public libraries reference services to the users like difficulties in having access to information, time wastage in searching and information management etc.<br/>Arising from the foregone, the study is therefore set out to access the role of ICT in the provision of references services to public libraries in Nigeria with a special focus on the Imo state library.</p> <p><strong>1.3 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>This research is set out to answer the following questions.<br/>1. What are the ICT infrastructures put in place to enhance its role in the provision of reference services in public library users in Nigeria?<br/>2. To what extent are public libraries funded in order to allow the role of ICT in reference services?<br/>3. To what extent are public library staff trained in order to meet these role soft ICT in reference services?<br/>4. What are the problems militating against the role of ICTs in reference services in public library users in Nigeria.<br/>5. What strategies can be adopted to over come these militating problems?</p> <p><strong>1.4 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The study aims at pointing out the importance and types of ICTs used in the provision of reference services in public libraries in Nigeria and the need to integrate them into public library functions.<br/>The objectives are to find out:<br/>1. the ICT infrastructures put in place in public libraries in Nigeria.<br/>2. If there is proper fund of ICT so as o meet it role of providing adequate reference service in public library users in Nigeria.<br/>3. The level of training given to public library staff on ICTs<br/>4. The problems/Factors militating against the role of ICT in the provision of reference services in public library users in Nigeria.<br/>5. Strategies that can be adopted to over come the problems.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study is significant because it finding will contribute to an understanding of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and its role to the provision of adequate reference services in public libraries of Nigeria.<br/>It will also help reference librarians to be aware of the problems hindering the role of ICT in their references services and work towards averting the problems. And finally help future researches who will carry out research related to this area of study.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The study focuses on the role of information and communication technology (ICT) in the provision of reference services to public library users to Nigeria. The Imo state library has been chosen to represent the numerous public libraries in Nigeria. This work is limited to computerized/automated library services.</p> <p><strong>1.7 OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>Public library: Is a library primary funded by tax revenues, where any person, without regard to race religion, or economic condition should be able to obtain free access to the recorded history, learning and knowledge of mankind.<br/>Information: It is a processed data or an organized data presented in context.<br/>Communication: It’s a process of transmitting or expressing ideas, symbols or information to people.<br/>Technology: Means the use of scientific knowledge to invent tools that assist human in their efforts to overcome environmental hazards and impediments.<br/>Reference Services: Means provision of information in response to requests.</p>\n\nROLE OF ICT IN THE OF REFERENCE SERVICES TO LIBRARY USERS IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ROLE OF ICT IN THE OF REFERENCE SERVICES TO LIBRARY USERS IN NIGERIA", "id": 39}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The topic is on staff development programmes in academic libraries which deals with the management of staff in academic libraries on how they can be motivated, taking care of and being treated well in the programme conducted for them in order to render good services to the users of academic libraries.<br/>The objectives of the study include: to identify staff development programmes that are carried out in Imo state polytechnic library and also to state polytechnic is effective and consistent. A method was designed and followed on this job, the method which include the research design, population of study, sample size and sample technique, instrument for data collection, the formal interview schedule, procedure for data collection and the method of data analysis. <br/>After the research, a findings came up on which o observed that if the staff of the Imo state polytechnic library should be taken care of, they will discharge their service very well on the library users.<br/>Based on the findings, I recommend that the management of academic libraries should endeavour to have proper auditing and analysis of the training.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>1.1 INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>The hallmark of every organization is its human factor. The effectiveness of academic libraries depends on the efficiency of their staff development programme.<br/>However, the term staff development covers a broad range of activities designed to provide staff with knowledge and skills that are directly related to their role and responsibilities in the library just as in state polytechnic, their staff undergo as a process of imparting the knowledge which they use, in carrying out the activities of the library effectively. In other words, the academic library requires competent staff that enable them to render services to the clientele.<br/>According to Corto (1986), training seeks to improve and develop the knowledge, skill and attribute of employees. More so, the aspect of the staff will also help in the development of the academic libraries for instance, in the case of Imo state polytechnic library it has been that the staff there are not active or have the knowledge on how to take care of the library or run the library, your will see that the students will be finding it boring to be making use of the library or if the staff running the library are not capable and they are the harsh type, you will see that the students in that school will be finding it difficult or not having the goal to make use of the library.<br/>In that case, you will see that the library will not develop up to the state it is now. In this, the staff development incorporate the skill development of the entire staff both the professional and non-professionals.<br/>Similarly, the now employee need some educational training that will help to implicate their power factor while the order staff required training to keep them alert to the demands of the clientele.<br/>Furthermore, it is necessary that the new employees that are employ in the library (i.e. the academic especially Imo state polytechnic library staff) should have intensive training on how to make use of the library and how to be police to the students so that it will be easy for them and the students to interact well and have a smooth work in the library.<br/>The essence of staff development in the academic libraries is to ensure that the maximum potentials are tapped from the employees. This yield specialization in a situation whereby the materials resources of the library are in abundance there is need to have capable staff to manage these resources effectively the achievement of the organizational goal of Imo state polytechnic library fundamentally depends on the effective development, training of staff and the proper use of its human resource. More so, human resources managers in Imo state polytechnic library must systematically identify the component required by library personnel in the information communication technology (ICT) age and plant according to it.<br/>Furthermore the introduction of information communication technologies becomes an indisputable tool in development of staff. It is indeed, an indisputable fact that libraries have metamorphosed from conventional libraries to electronic library (e-library). Therefore, all libraries are now embracing on how to apply information communication technology on daily basis.<br/>As well, balanced development programme formularize an employee with basic information and routines of the library operators, will prepare staff for the challenges of complex modern technology which requires an integration of activities, persons of diverse and specialized competence.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong><br/>The issue of staff development in academic libraries has been a major source of problem. Most academic libraries today have not recognized the importance of staff development. The inability of the academic library management of perceives the importance of staff development has led to low productivity among the staff.<br/>In other words staff from being competence. Inadequate funding seems to be a bane of staff development. This hamper management from conducting and organizing the programme and order staff from attending workshops, seminars and conferences.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBEJCTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>1 To identify staff development programme that are carried out in Imo state polytechnic library <br/>2 To investigate if staff development programme in Imo state polytechnic library is effective and consistent.<br/>3 To find out the strategies adopted by the academic library under study in improving their staff development programme.<br/>4 To find out factors affecting staff development programmesin academic libraries.<br/>5 To make recommendations on how staff development in Imo state polytechnic library can be improved.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>1. What is the rate effectiveness and consistence of staff development programmes?<br/>2. What are the strategies adopted in imparting staff development in academic library?<br/>3. How often the libraries undergo staff development?<br/>4. What are the measures taken to tackle the situation?</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study of staff development in academic libraries is important because the result of the research work till of immense benefit to the staff in academic libraries. It will enable the staff to understand the importance which tends to investigate the method of staff development in the academic library and suggesting ways to improve it. It will also be a guide to library administrators for proper management of human resource.<br/>In addition to the above, this work will go a long way to help other organizations like government parastatals in which development of their own staff hence staff development despite the area because there must be a similarities between Imo state polytechnic staff and those working in the ministry.<br/>In concluding out significance, scholars, researchers will be in position to consult this project when they are writing on a topic that a related to this.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The emphasis in this study is staff development in academic libraries with Abia state polytechnic library as the case study. A research work will cover the name and problems militating against staff development programmes. It also focuses on the importance affects overall performance of staff in the library.</p>\n\nSTAFF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME IN THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STAFF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME IN THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY IN NIGERIA", "id": 40}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>Schools, be it nursery, primary or secondary, are established with a view to achieve the following objectives.<br/>1) To improve positively on the civil life of the students <br/>2) To impart on the cognitive ability of the students<br/>3) To impart on the moral life of the student<br/>4) Affects the vocabulary building of the student<br/>5) To prepare each student for higher education<br/>Thus, schools establish libraries that partner them in the crusade to achieve the above objectives. This library referred to a school library.<br/>The school library therefore, is the library established, financed, maintained, management found in primary, secondary and teachers training schools.<br/>(TTC). It is expected to serve its community members like teachers. Pupils and student and win their patronage. As the life blood of its parent school, the school library plays certain indispensable roles in the educational up bringing of students.<br/>1) Makes the students indiscriminate readers of books<br/>2) Emancipates the children from learning by role<br/>3) Helps the teachers to prepare for classes<br/>The suffer in the following areas;<br/>I. Poor recognition from appropriate authorities.<br/>II. Lack of trained staff to organize resources <br/>III. Inadequate funding/budget allocation<br/>IV. Dearth and paucity of resources<br/>V. Lack of accommodation<br/>The situation has cumaxed in gross loss of patronage. Is it common knowledge that most schools (Public or private) do not have school libraries, even when they exist, they are nothing less than” small spaces with few books, scattered there and there”. At other times, o full fledged school library exist without enough space. It suffices to say that, most authorities that have the behave to run schools are yet to understand and appreciate the importance of school libraries in primary and secondary education. In the words of Michael Morgan 1998, Libraries serve humanity” and S.R. Ranganathan, “Books are for use”. School libraries, when established, should put into effective use. Just as the holy reads put it.<br/>How can they know<br/>Unless they are though<br/>The school teacher librarian should mobilize effort and mount campaign programs that would improve the image of the library, Sir up the reading interest in students that concomitantly draws attention to the library.<br/>According to Amadi in his course Audio visual resources in the libraries, children teens and adolescents, have attaint for what they sec.<br/>Onu quips that teems and children love questhetics, with these, the library staff should improve the library in the following areas:<br/>I.

It plays a very vital role by provision information resources to this seeking information. Resources are processed, acquired to make for easily location, retrieval and use.<br/>Pursuant to Nnadimele, 2005) a library is a collection of records of human culture in print and non-print book materials organized housed and interpreted by an information scientist or librarian to meet the broad varying needs of people for information.<br/>Pursuant to (Omuiko,2004) college libraries are those libraries found in polytechnic college of technology, college of education and college of agriculture. The nature of information materials stored in line with the nature of seeking. As it is in every library, this college library has many unit with heads which manages those resources.<br/>The resources are acquired to satisfy the information needs of the library clientele and to realize the parent institution goals. These resources are of two types: prints and non-print materials.<br/>Pursuant to (Obiora, 2004), the print materials are the reference books text book, mimeographs, monographs, these maps, conference, proceeding, journals and newspapers. Non-print materials include slides, files microfiche, and utrafiche etc.<br/>These resources are managed in the library thus management according to (Umunna, 2009), defined it as a team work, he further says that management interprets the policy made by the administration. Another scholar, (Onwubiko, 2004) sees management as the process of planning, organizing, co-ordinating and controlling the effect of organization and of using all other organization goals.<br/>Therefore, library resources has strategies for its effective management which are planning, organizing, directing, staffing controlling and co0ordinating not only that it involves taking care and preserving them against damages of any kind, checking the human (i.e.) the library users to that will not miss-manage vandalized these resources while using them.<br/>Another fantastic way is by financing these resources and also providing visible services like photocopying, binding, reference services etc. there are strategies for managing library resources these strategies are cataloguing and classification abstracting and indexing shelving and shelf-reading information repackaging and others.<br/>For a while now, there was problem of managing library resources in college libraries this is because of inadequate qualified professional’s non-provision of working tools.

Lastly, suggestion for further research study were made, include the usage of information communication technologies to the student academic record should cover the department.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Information revolution started a number of years ago and the role all the world has been good.<br/>This revolution has brought about convergence of information communication technologies (ICT), which have remained at the centre of global, social and economic transformation. The information revolution and extraordinary increase in the spread of knowledge and information which affects directly economic, social, cultural and political activities of all regions of the world including Africa. Information and communication technology (ITC) is defined as computer-based tools used by people to work with the information and communication processing needs of an organization, it encompasses the hardware and software, the network and several other devices (video audio, everalphy camera) that convert information (text) images, sounds motion and others into common digital form.<br/>ICT has made the shift from print to digital information possible which has created an impact on students’ academic records and information centres (Gbaje 2009).<br/>This has enable on-line access and file transfer possible, with networking and resource sharing. Islam and Islam (2006) says that ICT as the role and publication of computers, telecommunication and microelectronics in the acquisition, storage, retrieval transfer and dissemination of information in students, academic records.<br/>ICT is a significant development that provides effective took for managing the available of information generated in students, academic records. The prevalence and rapid development of ICT has transformed students’ information technology age to the knowledge.<br/>In modern ICT based on students the information professionals handle various types of activities in relation to the role of computers and other new information technologies. Before the advent of information and communication technology. (ICT) is students academic records were the sole custodies of information which was predominantly in print. Today students’ academic record is struggling to keep their place as the major source of inquiry in the face of emerging digital technology.<br/>In the modern world, the student’s academic record as information centres can hardly function today without computer and information technologies. <br/>In the overview, the role of information and communication technology (ICT) systems in student’s academic record and information centres in common place all over the world.<br/>This research work is therefore centered on the role of ICT as it enhanced the management of student’s academic record in Federal Polytechnic Nekede Owerri.</p> <p><strong>1.2 BRIEF HISTORY OF FEDERAL POLYTECHNIC NEKEDE OWERRI</strong><br/>The federal polytechnic Nekede Owerri was established in 1978. As a matter of fact, the school was then known as college of technology. It was then temporarily sited at the premises of government technical collage Owerri. The chief Librarian of the then college of technology was appointed in March 1978 and the school opened for its lasses on 15th December 1978. The school was later moved to its permanent site on November 1980 and was renamed on June 1988 from college of technology to the polytechnic. In line with federal government order on renaming of collages of technology, on 7th April 1993 the school finally taken over by the federal government and assumed polytechnic Nekede Owerri. The collection of the library in 1980 was house in one of the apartment of the school of engineering block and later was moved to the new classroom complex in January 1993. by then, the permanent site of the library has not been build until 1988 when the foundation stone was laid by the NBFE Chairman Dr. Adullahi.<br/>The library building was completed in 2000 and commerce users services in 2001 DRCL Osuoji was then acting as Rector in 1993 and later assumed office as the Rector in 1996 which lasted till 2000.<br/>Mr. Chukwuma Chukwu was appointed the acting registra, while Mr. J.U. Obasi was the acting librarian. Chief Uduma took over from Dr. Osuoji in 2000 as the, then acting handed over the month of rectorship to Eng. O.I.

With Imo state Judiciary library as a case study. It uses a survey research method with questionnaire as the instrument for data collection, conclusion and recommendations were made based on the findings of the study. The findings confined the existence of legal materials in the library under study as well as the problems effecting effective selection and acquisition of legal materials by the law libraries.<br/>The work is divided into five chapters for easy understanding. Chapter one centres on background of the study, with chapter two and three emphasizing on the literature review and research methodology respectively. While the data analysis was presented in chapter four with the summary of findings conclusion as well as recommendation in chapter five with the bibliography and appendix.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.1 INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>A good collection of books is the main activity of each library. In order to develop a good collection, documents of various types and in different physical forms are to be produced. Therefore, selection and acquisition of legal materials are two different functions/activities being carried out in order to improve the quantity and quality of materials available in the law library. Selection of materials involves deciding which materials are to be acquired for a library. Anieke (2004) quoting spiller (1991) opines that selection means “evaluating and choosing materials to add to the library stock” in other word, it involves deciding what books and non-book materials to be purchased. However, Eze and Eze (2006) in an attempt to differentiate selection from acquisition rightly observe that many persons assume that selection and acquisition work are one and the same process. They posite that even though they are related, that acquisition is the process by which the library physically secures (through bringing gifts or exchange) the items that selection personnel has identified as desirable additions to the collection.<br/>Apparently, the law library belongs to the category of special libraries. And Nnadozie (2007:86) observed that the collection of the special library reflects the subject interest of the sponsoring organization. He further asserts that the selection policies of special libraries are careful worded to ensure that the books and publications relating to the research preoccupation of the parent body are acquired.<br/>According to Oduagwu (2002:70) selection must precede acquisition. He explains that what to select depends on the type of library since each library is interested in serving primarily its clientele which could be homogenous or heterogeneous. The believed that selection as the most important function of the acquisition department should be performed in a systematic ways.<br/>Anyanwu, Zandet and Amadi (2006), sees acquisition as the process of obtaining library materials to satisfy the needs of the users. To the acquisition work as a means by which book and non-book materials are added to the library. They further explain that selection of library materials is important because literature explosion publication of many library materials as no library can purchase all the materials needed.<br/>Because the legal researcher usually need to have the most up-to date version of the law, as well as to be certain that an approved applicable case has not been overused by a higher court, or that a status has not been amended, repealed or found to be unconstitutional. Selections of legal materials or publications becomes a necessity and rely on variety of means for regular supplementation and up-dating.<br/>In selecting and acquiring of legal materials problems like poor communication service, poor management of the library vote, poor quality of locally published book, inarticulate collection development policy. etc. are encounters acquisition of legal materials, both primary source materials such as court reports, volumes of statutes, journals etc. and secondary sources of materials needs to be effectively and efficiently selected by qualified law librarians before procurement takes place.<br/>Historically, the law libraries are closely tied to the history of the judiciary system as well as to the history of the development of formal legal education. In the United States, the college of William and Mary lays claim to founding of the first professorship in law and the beginnings of a small collection of law books within the confines of the college library in 1779. The Harvard law library, now the largest law library in the United State, was established in 1817. Yet, until the primary focus for legal education moved in the late nineteenth century to the university from the law office, where aspiring lawyers and read the law under the tritelage of established practitioners, few law libraries (other than Harwards) compare in size and breadth of collection with Bar Association libraries of collection with rare developed to meet the needs of the practicing bar. However, the major concern in this piece of work is the problems of selection and acquisition of legal materials by law libraries in Nigeria with particular reference to Imo state Judiciary library (system) Owerri.</p> <p><strong>1.2 BACKGROUND INFORMATION OF THE IMO STATE JUDICIARY LIBRARY</strong><br/>The Imo state judiciary library was established in 1916 at the creation of Imo state. The library stared with few books inherited from the former high court, Owerri, Division of the then east central state of Nigeria.<br/>The judiciary library is situated within the High Court premises, judiciary headquarters along Orlu Road Owerri, about Onekilometre (1km) from the main post office, Owerri. Judiciary library is a special and one of the indispensable arms of the judiciary. The library is the workshop of judges, magistrates, legal practitioners, law students etc. it has collection of laws and statutes, law reports, encyclopedia and dictionaries official gazettes, periodical, law texts, newspapers, magazines etc.<br/>At present and in addition to the judicial central library, Owerri, there are two zonal libraries at Okigwe and Orlu, three directional libraries at Abon-Mbaise Mbano/Etiti and Oguta.<br/>Judicial library has a professional librarian, four Para-professionals, two library Assistants and other supporting staff.<br/>Judicial library when it started was housed in a (12.2x12.2) room before it was re-located to a library hall now in use. The library has a complete set of computers.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The primary aim of the study is to fulfill the requirement of obtaining the ordinary National Diploma (OND) certificate. It is also the belief of the writers, that this work will be useful to researcher who may which to carry out further research in the area. Besides, it will serve as a reference source in law libraries where selection and acquisition are not properly carried out.</p> <p><strong>1.4 OBEJCTUVE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The specific objectives of the study are as follows:<br/> To find out the problems encountered in selection and acquisition of legal materials by law libraries in Nigeria.<br/> To ascertain if legal materials are selected and acquired in the library under study<br/> To find out the type of legal materials being acquired.<br/> To identify the channels of acquisition of legal materials<br/> To find out the criteria’s used in selection and acquisition of legal materials<br/> To ascertain those involved in selection of legal materials.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The study will be of great value to researcher conducting their studies on selection and acquisition of legal materials in law libraries or on other closely related subjects.<br/>The study therefore is meant to provide the right perception of the relevance of selection and acquisition of legal materials in law libraries as a unique function. Above all, the research will serve as a reference documents for both theoretical and applied study is selection and acquisition of library materials.</p> <p><strong>1.6 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>In other to achieve the specified objectives of the study the research formulated the following research questions to serve as a guide in adhering to the focus of the study.<br/> What are the problems facing selection and acquisition of legal materials by law libraries in Nigeria?<br/> Are legal materials selected and acquired in your library?<br/> What types of legal materials are being acquired by your library?<br/> What are the tools used for selection and acquisition of legal materials?<br/> What are the channels for acquisition and acquisition of legal materials?<br/> What are the critical used in selection and acquisition of legal material? <br/> Who are people involved in selection of legal materials?</p> <p><strong>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This research work is centred on “The problems of selection and acquisition of legal materials by law libraries in Nigeria with special emphasis to Imo state judiciary library. However, the limitation of the study is that of time and finance.<br/>The time frame is not enough to allow for the generation of much data. Another is finance which is a major constraints as needed to travel often to be able to generate the facts needs to back up this study.</p>\n\nPROBLEMS OF SELECTION AND ACQUISITION OF LEGAL MATERIALS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS OF SELECTION AND ACQUISITION OF LEGAL MATERIALS", "id": 44}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This study was based on the Problems of Books Acquisition in Academic Library. A case study of Imo State University Owerri (IMSU). <br/>The study was also made to find out what roles money play in the acquisition of book in the academic libraries. It also determined the level to which students and lecturers are consulted during selection of books to be acquired in their library through the findings it is observed that academic libraries acquires books through purchases gifts, exchange and inter-library cooperation, while the major sources of acquisition include direct purchase, book vendors from publishers, importation from overseas and donations.<br/>Furthermore, inadequate financial provision to academic libraries has a negative effect on the two libraries studied.<br/>Finally, lecturers should be consulted adequately during selection of books to be acquired by their institutions libraries which will help in the smooth running of acquisition of materials.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Academic libraries are mainly libraries within institutions of higher learning including universities, polytechnics and colleges of education. They are billed to support the teaching, research and extension services of parent institutions.<br/>Large part of funding comes from government grant. Academic libraries start as far back as 16th and 17th century in Europe and America.<br/>Therefore, in this study, the researcher will consider book as reference books and non-fiction book.<br/>Reference Books: According to Harrods libraries glossary, reference books is a book such as dictionary, encyclopedia, gazettes, yearbooks, directories, atlases which are compiled to supply definite piece of information of varying extent and intended to be referred to rather than read through. Reference books are usually comprehensive within scope, condensed in treatment and systematically arranged to facilitate ease of use. They are not read chapter by chapter they are not borrowed for home use rather they are consulted by the librarian. <br/>Non-fiction Books: This is the prose writings that deal with facts (as distinct from novels, stories, etc, which deal with unreal people and events, it includes books in various sport areas. Donna Norton is of the view that one should start from who’s who to how to. Examples of reference books encyclopedia, dictionary and text books. <br/>The first three laws of library science by S.R. Ranaganathan emphasizes the importance of a book in the library. The first is that books are meant for use, second, to every reader his book and third to every book its reader, with this special emphasis and importance according to book, it is therefore necessary that books are acquired in any library. In academic libraries, the notion of book acquisition is of prime importance of greater importance too is the method and source through which books are acquired especially fro academic libraries. When the image are what the collection of the library is made up we will not address our minds to the fact that the bulk of this is the various volumes and title of books displayed conspicuously on the library’s shelves. In other words, the book is an essential and important constituent of the academic library to be precise. In academic libraries in Imo State, effective consideration is given to book materials. A lot of books are acquired in academic libraries through various methods and sources.<br/>Evans (1974) definition of acquisition incorporate some of these methods. According to Evans, acquisition is the process of securing materials for the library collection whether by purchase, as gifts or through exchange programme.<br/>There are other methods involved and the acquisition librarian must explore all these method and utilize sources that will be advantageous to him to acquire books for his library. This statement emphasizes the most obvious activity in academic libraries. This activity and its importance is summed up in Fatuji (1982) statement that to provide a plentiful supply of goods and useful books in the college library’s raison d’etre. <br/>Since the academic library feels all the social forces of education, research and services, it provides information materials necessary for aiding this activity by utilizing greatly all available methods and sources for its acquisition of books.</p> <p><strong>1.2 BACKGROUND HISTORY OF IMO STATE UNIVERSITY</strong><br/>The Imo State University in Uturu was established in 1981 following the bill passed by the late chief Mbakwe’s Administration on the 13th of April 1981. The school was officially opened in Etiti in 1981 with a second campus at Aba on temporary site. The school was later moved to Okigwe by the military administration major general Ike Nwachukwu (rtd).<br/>The establishment of the University grew out of the need for an academic institution of the highest status owned supported and managed by the state in order to attend to the academic vision of Imo indigenes in gaining admission into the university. The first phase of the permanent building for the university was later completed at Okigwe, with an ultra-modern university Okigwe in 1992 following the creation of new Abia State from the old Imo State.<br/>The present Imo State University at Owerri is relocated from the old Imo State University Okigwe. The old University was left to Abia State because of change of asset which resented to Imo State having no university of its own.<br/>The Imo State University now occupies the former temporary site of Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO) at Lake Nwaebere Campus, inheriting the physical facilities vacated by the Federal University of Technology Owerri as they move to their permanent site at Ihiagwa.<br/>The objective, philosophy and aspiration of the university includes to encourage the advancement of learning in Imo State and Nigeria in particular to give all person without discriminations of race, sex the opportunity to acquire higher education for the purpose of carrying the philosophy and objective. The university was then known as Evans Ewerem University and its vice chancellor was professor O.E. Nwebe from 2009-May 2011. The university is now known as the Imo State University.</p> <p><strong>1.3 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong><br/>The statement of the problems are the issues that make on go into the study for instance, in the olden days most academic libraries do not acquire books rather they depend on gifts, but some gifts given to them does not reflect the need of the institution.<br/>Moreover, most of the staff employed are not qualified librarians and thereby cannot carryout the smooth operation of acquisition and classification. <br/>Also, in some cases some acquisition librarians do not consult the entire library committee before acquiring books.<br/>Furthermore, books acquired from abroad take a long time to arrive and at times they are not useful to readers.<br/>This study is therefore to investigate the methods and sources of boo acquisition in academic libraries to un-earthen the difficulties.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SCOPE/LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The coverage of the study is restricted to the academic libraries in Imo State that is the Imo State University (IMSU). This study limits its scope only to the acquisition of books in the above mentioned academic libraries excluding periodicals, magazines, etc. which are not book materials.</p> <p><strong>1.5 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>The objectives of this study are listed ad follows:<br/>1. To identify the problems affecting acquisition in academic libraries.<br/>2. To find out the factors that are responsible for these problems.<br/>3. To examine the impacts of these problems on the services of the library under study.<br/>4. To suggest solutions to the problems of acquisition in academic libraries.</p> <p><strong>1.6 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>The following are the research questions:<br/>1. What are the problems affecting acquisition in academic libraries?<br/>2. What are the impacts of these problems on the services of the academic libraries?<br/>3. What are the impacts of these problems on the services of the academic libraries?<br/>4. How can the problems of acquisition can be solved in academic libraries?</p> <p><strong>1.8 SIGNIICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study is significant for the following reasons.<br/>i. It will highlight the inadequacy of the collection of Nigeria University libraries.<br/>ii. It will enable library users, especially the students and lecturers to beware of these problems.<br/>iii. It can make the financiers of Nigeria University libraries to understand the problems that confront these libraries in acquisition.<br/>iv. It will identify how to solve thee acquisition problems.<br/>v. The work will also add to the library science.</p> <p><strong>1.9 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>Book Acquisition: It is the process of obtaining materials to satisfy the need of the users. It is carried through purchases, gifts and exchange, it also building of collection in line with the objectives of the library.<br/>Academic libraries: These are libraries in the institution of higher learning which are devoted to academic institution. They support teaching, learning and research. They include universities, polytechnics and colleges of educations libraries. </p>\n\nPROBLEMS OF BOOK ACQUISITION IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS OF BOOK ACQUISITION IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES", "id": 45}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This work is on book acquisition in academic libraries sources and methods. A case study of Imo state Polytechnic Library Umuagwo. It emphasized the need for acquisition of library materials for its primary clientele 8 questionnaires forms were administered to the institution under study. It was formed out that the institution under study their library involves in acquisition of library materials. Chapter two reviews what the topic is talking about. Chapter three deals with the methods adopted in the research work, findings and discussion were outlined, it is observed from the finding that the library acquire their materials through gift exchange, purchase etc. Recommendations were made on how to improve and maintain the acquisition department. It also recommend on how to ensure effective and relevant materials to its users.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>The main objective of establishing any library is to satisfy the needs of its clientele by providing the aim of setting up a library in nay institution through its selection and acquisition of materials, adequate collection required by the users should be made available to them atg the right time.<br/>Selection as the process of choosing library materials to satisfy the needs for inclusion in a library with a view to providing a balanced increase to the stock. (Anyanwu, Amadi and Zander, 2006) according to Nwalo, (2003) Book selection is he art of choosing items to be acquired from a list of publication in every library of any university, there should be a specific policy with regard to selection of materials. This policy should specify the type and range of items to be selected and acquired and reflect the objectives of the parents institution.<br/>Acquisition can be define as the process of obtaining library materials to satisfy the needs of users, and its work, it’s a means by which books and non-books materials are added to the library.<br/>Moreover, the essence of selection and acquisition of library materials in academic libraries is to know the materials relevant to them. Selection of library materials is important because of literature explosion, reduction in library budget, reduction in income of library users. Good selectors should aim, at satisfying existing demand, anticipate future needs by users and ensure that good quality materials are provided, avoid bias in selection and ensure that the right kind of materials are provided at the right time.<br/>Eguaron (2002) identified processes involved in books selection by one person, selection meeting/selection committee and specialized group.<br/>In selecting/acquisition of materials for academic libraries you must consider the aims and objectives of the institution, the number of department and subject areas. The number of faculty member’s research and teaching needs and the nature of materials required in terms of books and non-book materials. In academic library, materials selected/acquired are meant to cater the support of the curriculum, which means the impute/attribute of the teaching staff is usually required in selecting appropriate materials for the students in most academic libraries the library committee carries out the selection of library materials.<br/>Furthermore, in acquisition, of times acquisition librarian is included in selection in acquisition, their responsibility is also in selection of library materials.<br/>However, in academic libraries the acquired materials are jointly done by members of faculty and the library in any case any of the users of the library can acquire materials for the consideration of library, perhaps this is the only contact a library users may have with this part of the library. The academic acquired their materials by gift direct purchase, exchange and professional association. This can be of books and other library materials, which include periodicals serials, government publication, pamphlets, technical and research reports, micro-forms and microfilms, audio-visual materials and also academic libraries source their supply of library books through publisher, jobbers/whole seller /exhibition.<br/>Oduagwu (2002) explains selection and acquisition of library materials depends on the kind of library since each library is interested in serving primary its clientele which could be homogenous or heterogonous. The most important function here is the systematic way, techniques in guiding against buying materials which deserve no spare on their shelves.<br/>Emanuel Anyanwu, Enyinnah Zander and Emmanuel Amadi (2006) identified the channels or methods of acquisition of library materials through, purchase, gift and exchange, legal deposit, professional associations.<br/>Finally Isaac , Nnadimele.O (2005) specified some of the problems facing our selected and acquired materials by some of the Nigerian vendors who may not supply libraries when the materials are in great demand. The main problem of acquisition is associated with the fact that vast major materials are produce out side the country. The procurement material is produced outside the country. The procurement of foreign books and other materials continually expose the procuring of library materials to foreign exchange problems in selection/acquisition untrained or in experienced staff can be problematic, which means, it needs one who knows much about the field of study.</p> <p><strong>1.2 HISTORY OF IMO POLYTECHNIC UMUAGWO</strong><br/>The Imo state polytechnic Umuagwo. Ohaji (formerly know as (Imo state of Agriculture) was established in the year 1978 by the Imo state government as an arm of the ministry of Agriculture and natural resources, with the responsibility of producing agriculturists of middle level cadre, for the prosecution of the states agricultural policies.<br/>The polytechnic became an autonomous institution with a governing council under edict No 11 of 1979 (Law) it metamorphosed to Michael Okpara of Agriculture and technology (Mocatech) Umuagwo in 2005 following the institution of an administrative panel by the government of chief Achike Udenwa in March 30th 2004 to review the curricular and the structure of the polytechnic with a view to improving its operational capabilities. The institution was established to provide courses of study, training and research as well as development of technique and skills in all branches of agriculture and technology of a standard leading to the award of National Diploma (ND) and Higher Diploma (HND) in addition. It provides courses in areas of pre-nd assonate certificates and other short course which are mounted periodically to improve the skills and techniques of agricultural personnel and farmers. It is on record that the institution was first of agriculture in Nigeria to have its programme accredited by the National Board of Technical Education (N.B.T.E) in 1983. the institution was finally up graded to a polytechnic status (Imo state polytechnic) in 2007 following the signing into law of bill passed by the Imo state house of assembly by his Excellency, former Executive Governor of Imo state polytechnic law. No 11 of 2007 amended the Edict No 11 of 1979 that established the institution has kept faith with its mandate of training highly skilled manpower for the development of the nations agricultural and technological sectors. About 60% of their Diplomats are self-employed while the remaining 40% are employed in the various establishments such as educational institutions. Ministries, Agricultural Development Programme (ADP) financial institutions oil companies, military and Para-military organizations among others. The polytechnic is located on 360 lectures of land, donated by the Umuagwo community in the Ohaji/Egbema/Oguta local government area of Imo state. It is sited at 26 killometres form the Owerri capital territory, on the Owerrij-port Harcourt road.<br/>Imo state polytechnic is recognized in the comity of polytechnics in Nigeria national and international agencies such as NBTE, Jamb, NYSC, federal scholarship board and ETF.<br/>The polytechnic status of the institution has brought about several structural and physical development as well as re-organization of coursed and the introduction of new academic programmes.</p> <p><strong>1.3 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong><br/>Sources and method acquisition of library materials are very essential in ensuring that users obtain the relevant materials they need. It is unfortunate that at times of the lecturer and students are not involved in the acquisition of library materials with the result that books that are not relevant to the needs of the users are selected/ acquired in the library.<br/>Also some libraries choose to acquire materials through book stores/retailers there by risking the originality of such materials which might be pirated materials in most cases the management of institution single handedly select and acquire library materials which sometimes might not be a quality materials.<br/><strong>1.4 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The objectives of this study are as follow<br/>1. To find the sources/method of acquisition in academic libraries<br/>2. To describe/Explain the meaning of selection and acquisition<br/>3. To identify the tools for selection and acquisition of library materials<br/>4. to find out factors that hinder selection and acquisition f library materials.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIUON </strong><br/>1. What is the meaning of selection and acquisition of library materials?<br/>2. What are the sources and method of acquisition of materials in academic libraries?<br/>3. What is the type of materials selected/acquired for the library users?<br/>4. Who are involved in selection/acquisition of library materials?<br/>5. What are the criteria’s for selection and acquisition of library materials in academic libraries?</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The significance of the study is well stated by Anyanwu Amadi and Zander (2006) when the said that the purpose of any scholarly institution library codification is through selection and acquisition of library materials, in order to satisfy the needs of it clientele.<br/>According to Nwalo (2003) he explained that there should be a specified type and range of items to be selected and acquired, their sources and method of acquisition, in other to reflect the objective of the parents institution. Thus the study is of a high, through its emphasis on the methods and sources of acquisition of library material in academic library. To a large extent the significance of the study is enormous in view that, the findings and recommendations from this study will facilitate in solving the libraries problem.</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>1. SELECTION: This is the act of choosing it materials to be acquired form a list publication.<br/>2. ACADEMIC LIBRARY: They are those libraries attached to institutions of higher learning e.g. universities, polytechnics colleges of education etc. it is established, maintained and administered by the institution if higher learning with the support of its parent institution.<br/>3. ACQUISITION: Is the art of bringing physical materials into the library either through purchase, gifts, inter-loan or exchange or through deposits. It can also be seen as the gaining of something for oneself or others.</p>\n\nBOOK ACQUISITION IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES SOURCES AND METHODS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " BOOK ACQUISITION IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES SOURCES AND METHODS", "id": 46}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>To understand the meaning and scope of preservation and conservation of library materials in public library, the definition of public library in digital age becomes relevant. That is for discussion to be intelligible; it must start with definition of terms.<br/>Therefore, library has defined by many writers and many Authors have attempted to define a library without success.

Johnson (1970) defines a library as a collection of graphic materials arranged for relatively easy use, carded for an individual familiar with that arrangement and available for use by at least a limited number of persons. Here is another satisfactory definition of the library by UNESCO, that a library is an organized collection of published books and periodical and of other reading and audio-visual materials, and the service of staff able to prove and interpreter such materials as are required to meet the informational research, educational or recreational needs of the user’s.<br/>Aguolu (1989) still go further to say that library can be described as a place where the dead may be said to be alive a place where the ideal of the knowledge of great men and women are fully documented and preserved, conducive to move the world at though those people may be no more. In order words, it is a place where the information seeker or knowledge seeker communicates with authors both living and dead.<br/>The world library is derived from the term “LIBER” a representation of ‘book’ this public library is major meant to serve the public there by increasing the literacy level of the people in that community by carrying out extension services.<br/>Further more the key term of this work are: preservation, conservation, library materials and to appreciate and understand this work better, the definition of the following terms becomes necessary.<br/>According to the world bank encyclopedia (1990) conservation means management, protection and wise use of the resources as library is noted as organized information resources through experts, store manage the resources, preserve, conserve them for effective use and easy access to use and easy access to users all kinds of level. World book dictionary (1996) still put conservation in a simplest term as an act of conserving, protecting from loss or being used up, avoidance of waste.<br/>Vol. 2 of World Bank Dictionary 91996) still go further to say that preservation is the act of preserving keeping safe. Still on preservation, is the restoration of the original nature of the materials that is keeping it in it’s original nature.<br/>Alegbeleye (1985) define conservation as a term that embraces several related idea such as (i) restoration which is the action taken to correct deterioration of all kind and also maintain the items in as near as possible in their original form (ii) substitution which has to do with the replacement of the original by microfilm digitalization for regular use.<br/>Mean while, restoring materials to it’s original nature is what we know as conservation and a way of using a materials by making an effort to see that materials are not made home use rather you make photocopy and return back for preservation.<br/>A distinction between preservation and conservation is a method of applying the physical or chemical treatment of library materials to sustain them in their original state.<br/>Considering preservation and conservation in a digital age, we consider about digital repository service to support not only day to day access to digital age challenge a libraries and archivist to create an appropriate organizational context for action. Digital technologist is erasing many of the distinction between custodians of articles libraries and other repository that traditionally have assumed responsibilities for preserving information face technical, legal and organizational challenges in responding to new demands of digital preservation. According to the Russell (1999) digital preservation in a simplest term means a process by which digital data is preserved in digital from in order to ensure the usability, durability and intellectual integrity of the information contained there in on that note, we have the following as a library services obligation towards preservation. To keep technical development in the conservation field under review to utilize those which are suitable and incorporate them into the strategy to provide added benefit and more effective operations? To do everything possible to minimize damage from use, promoting good practice in handling.<br/>To promote best practice amongst staff and readers in seeking to ensure the security of materials which has been selected for permanent preservation to maintain agreed standard of preservation through library services? Therefore it is highly imperative that materials acquired in the library should be taken care of.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>In the course of preservation and conservation of library materials in the digital age a good number of problems are been encourage like fragile storage media. Technology obsolesces, and we also have legal questions surrounding copying and access as one of the problems that militate against preservation and conservation of library materials. Under the fragile storage media:- most of digital materials are specially vulnerable to loss because they are stored on fragile magnetic media that deteriorate rapidly and can fail suddenly from exposure of heat, humidity etc. then under technology obsolesce. Digital materials becomes unreadable and unnecessary to retrieve information from the media becomes obsolete the information from machine to human readable from is no longer available above are the few problem encountered at course of preserving and conserving library materials.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</strong><br/>• To determine if there is need for preservation and conservation of library materials.<br/>• To find out whether the equipment for preserving and conserving library materials.<br/>• To find out problems that militates against the preservation and conservation of library materials.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>Are there needs for preservation and conservation of library materials? What are the techniques and methods for preserving and conserving of library materials.<br/>Are there equipments for preserving and conserving library materials what are the personnel need for preserving and conserving library materials what are the challenges confronting the preservation and conservation of library materials. Are there panacea to solve the problem of preservation and conservation of library materials?</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong><br/>The significance or preservation and conservation of library materials cannot be overemphasis because it enhance in keeping those materials for future purpose. Closely related to the above significance is that preservation and conservation of library materials ensure the life long span of those materials in the library.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This work covers preservation and conservation of library materials. The study is on Imo state public library, Board Owerri Imo state. And it equally focuses in the facilities and techniques involved in the conservation and preservation of library materials in public library.</p> <p><strong>1.7 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF IMO STATE PUBLIC LIBRARY</strong><br/>Imo state public library Owerri started as a building for divisional library services under the umbrella of East central library Board. The creation of Imo state out of the East central took place in the year 1976, the Imo state indigence’ in the former East central state library returned from Enugu to from the numbers of new library board operations.<br/>Furthermore, the state central library was established on 21th Nov. 1976. The assets and liabilities of the former board were shared prior to the movement to Owerri. As time goes on, the new library board began operation with budget of N546832,66 for the financial 1976/77 of the sum N246,832,66 was inherited from he central library board and N300,00 was financial provision by the Imo state Movement. Imo state and Anambra shared considerable quality of new books which had been processed and allocated to the creation of the state. Assets recovered from the sharing exercise include six catalogue cabinets and cards originally meant by Owerri division library. Some filling cabinets and few typewriters. The Imo state public library board was established by edict No 12 1977 which made provision for the composition of board not less than four but not more than six members the appointment of director and a secretary to the board function of the board include engagement of staff. Finding and auditing, legal deposit of publications land acquisition, authenticated of documents, powers to invest and pension benefits.<br/>To crown it all, Imo state library was initially under the ministry of education and information and on separation of education and information as ministry of their own, the library board was placed under the ministry of information culture, youth and sports where it is today.<br/>As earlier stated that the board was appointed on 10th November, 1976 It consist of Prof. A. O. Anya as Chairman and seven members namely, Prof. D.I. Nwogu, Dr. Eze Oqueri, Mrs. Gloria I. Ofo, Mazi F. Nwosu Ezi Mrs. R. Umelo, presently they have Chief C.D.B Williams as chairman, Mr. Jude, C.

Library helps an organizations to achieve this stated goals and its achievement is dependent I the adequate fund available to the library involved. Looking at one goal set out by public library to achieve and with the fact that less is achieved due to poor materials and infrastructural facilities in our present day societies, its discovered that inadequate funding is responsible. This project titles the effects of poor funding public libraries in Nigeria of Imo state library board was aimed at discovering the main sources of funding problems of public libraries and the reason why publications are often stared of fund. The issue pf funding in public libraries in Nigeria is as old as libraries themselves against this background, the state of funding as it affects ABLB and ISLB were reviewed with the aim of identifying the problem and suggesting ways of solving or improving of the libraries lots.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>The public library is a social institution which is tied to the political and social realities of the communities where it is situated. As the name implies, this is a library that serves the public.<br/>UNESCO (1966) defines public library as “Those which serve the population of the community or region free of change or for a nominal fee. It is a library designed to serve the generality of the people.<br/>According to Oduagwu (2002) public libraries that serve the public are supported by government subvention, local rates or charges. He went further to explain that public library is often regarded as a poor man’s university. Its clientele is heterogeneous devoid of race, status, rank, bias as to who would avail of its services. It stocks every conceivable item that would add knowledge, education, research, information and cultural needs of the society. In Nigeria today, each of the 36 states kin the country including Abuja has a public library board established under the public library act as united kingdom (UK), but here in Nigeria, library board of states is established by edict or laws made by the states legislators. <br/>Oparaku, Anyanwu, Madi, (2005) defined a public library as an institution that is set up by the government through enabling law, funded and mentioned are expected to meet the educational, informational and recreational needs of its community, public library funding refers to making money available for the day running of the library. Funding here deals with making money or funds available to public libraries.<br/>Finance is the life wire of any establishment including land, labour, capitals and entrepreneur and information. The capital here refers to finance which can be used to procure other factors of production there by making it more important than others. Fund is obviously the major element in every establishment. It is equally the working capital of an establishment.<br/>Public library funding generally means the various ways we derive the expected funds for capital and recurrent expenses. It involves the money available or allocation to library for running its day to day activities.<br/>However, the funding and financial allocations to public libraries have remained poor decades. Public libraries needs adequate resources to run their services pay and hire personal provides current information, arrange, organize and monitor both human and materials resources. Nigeria is a developing country and its society is not a reading society. Nigeria do not appreciate the importance and needs of public libraries and the services it offers and this problem reflect in the level of funds allocated to it by the government. State government subventions which constitute about 80% of public library fund is grossly inadequate. This inadequacy is because of the political instability and bad economy of the country. Ulu (1997) for instance, the Imo state library was the first in he country to start services to handicap. But due to lack of fund to train staff and carry out services, there services have been on glow progression.<br/>Late release of fund by the government is another problem, it means things can’t be done when required. All the plans of public library are hampsed by late release of fund. For instance, the public library’s plan is to establish community information services in Imo state did not take off due to late release of fund.<br/>Another problem is the existing infrastructural facilities in most public libraries are inadequate. Their reference materials are too old. There are no separate rooms for music library and audio-visual materials, and no rooms for serious readers especially those carrying out research works.<br/>Lack of appreciation by policy makers in government is one of the problems. This shows that the public libraries in the nation are not given due recognition they deserve and this is traceable not only to the non-quantifiable nature of library services but also the misconception given to libraries by government to get off these problems. There must be a re-orientation on the part of the policy makers in government to accord the public library the recognition it deserves.<br/>According to Egbulonu (2002), he said that these problems have adversely affected the public library services and its operations. The result of the impending global economic situation on the other hand has drastically affected the attainment or achievements of basic standards in funding the libraries.<br/>From the history of public libraries in Nigeria, the problem if funds has remained an intractable phenomenon. The Nigerian library association is worried by the poor funding of libraries generally but public libraries in particular. Therefore the Nigerian Library Association has organized several conferences that highlight the problems of poor funding of public libraries and need for improved funding. This conference suggested and recommended widering the sources of funding public libraries rather than depending on government funding only.<br/>The 1st floor contains one reference, circulation and adult lending section. The library began its operation with a financial provision of form N564, 837-66 for the financial year 1976/77.</p> <p><strong>1.1 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF IMO STATE LIBRARY BOARD, OWERRI.</strong><br/>Imo state library from the year 1976-2011. Imo state library board came out from eastern regional library board. It was later part of eastern central library. On 3rd February 1976, more state were created in Nigeria and Imo state was one of those states. It was carried out of the former eastern central state. As a result of this creation, the east central library board broke into Anambra and Imo state library board. However, it was only in September 976, that the indigenous Imo state staff in Enugu transferred to Owerri to establish the administrative headquarters of Imo state library board. The mobility was in part because printing binding and reprography staff was the last to move by the end of September, 1976 prior to the movement, the assets and liabilities of the former east central state library board were shared. The Anambra state library board retained the buildings and fixed assts whole fiscal cash and information resources were shared consequently, Owerri divisional library which was under completion was hurriedly finished and used as the headquarter.<br/>The new library was opened to the public on the 12th of November, 1976 by the military governor commander Godwin Ndubuisi Kanu. The building was constructed to accommodate 85,000 volumes. The sum of 35,904.84 was said to be spent on the building at that time of its opening. The building is also designed to house on the ground floor the children’s library, the acquisition and cataloguing departments, the information consultancy unit, the staff reading room and the reprographic unit as well as the auditoria housing. There is also the handicap section which was opened by the military governor of Imo state commander Amadi Ibekweghe on 1st November, 1989 and the exhibition which was taken over by the NTA.<br/>The 1st floor contains one references, circulation and adult lending section. The library began its operation with a financial provision of fome N564,837-66 for the financial year 1976/77.<br/>The sum was made up of N246,832.66 being financial inheritance from the east central state library board and N360,000 as financial addition, a sum of 500,000 was to cover its capital expenditure for the year 1877. Anambra and Imo state shared a considerable quality of new book which had not been allocated prior to the creation of the state. Other materials shared include catalogue cabinets and catalogues card originally ordered for Owerri, library, some materials filing cabinets and a few type writers. The library started its operation with a total of 150 staff and a stock of 1,350 volumes. At present the total staff is 108 December, 2006 and June 2007, the staff strength is 112.<br/>This history will be incomplete without mentioning the caring out of Abia state from Imo state, in September 1991. the resultant effect of this is emergence of Abia state library board. This led to the sharing of the assets and liabilities between the new Imo state library board and Abi state library board. This sharing was completed in November 1991. it is worthy of note that most of the divisional libraries and branch libraries want to Abia state out of 17 divisional and branch libraries, Imo state library board inherited only 7.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>In many public libraries, the budgetary allocation released as and when due, and this in turn delays the implementation of the programs of those libraries when funds are eventually released. There is inadequate funding of public libraries by the state government which provides about 80% of the funds required by the public libraries.<br/>Shortage of funds has resulted in shortage relevant text books as currently being experienced by students and researcher who are in need of the materials. Inadequate provision of funds has prevented the provision of current materials needs by the staff and clientele in public libraries. Also poor appreciation of the service of the library by those at the helm of affairs, low societal rating of the libraries in the public libraries in the Nigeria pose problem to funding of public libraries.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBEJCTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The objectives of this study are as follows<br/>I. To establish the state of funding in public libraries in Nigeria <br/>II. To find the major source of funding public libraries in Nigeria<br/>III. To find alternative source of funding public libraries in Nigeria.<br/>IV. To highlight problems associated with inadequate funding of public libraries.<br/>V. To make recommendation on how to over come inadequate funding of public libraries.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study will enable us to know the state to public libraries in Nigeria that is, the problems facing public libraries in Nigeria. It will also be of important to researcher or any other person who is interested in find out are the state of public libraries in Nigeria, especially Imo state library board Owerri. It will also help us to appreciate the public library as an agent of political, social and religious development of a community which can compel them into passing the right judgment and taking the right decision that affect their lives and existence. The study as expected will be an added literature in this branch of public librarianship.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The scope and literature of the study will enable us to know the funding of public libraries in Nigeria, especially Imo state library board. The investigation is limited to Nigeria only one type of library which is the public libraries. Only the staff and users of Imo state library board and other public libraries are to be consulted in the course of this investigation limitation encountered in this course of this investigation include time constraints, financial constraints, restricted access to information, that is, some relevant materials on net were not accessible only their abstracts also some people refused to fill the questionnaire.</p> <p><strong>1.6 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>1) What is the major source of fund for public library?<br/>2) Are the public libraries facing any problem?<br/>3) What are the problems faced by public libraries in Nigeria especially Imo state public library board Owerri?<br/>4) What are the other source of funds are available to these public libraries.</p>\n\nEFFECTS OF POOR FUNDING OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF POOR FUNDING OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA", "id": 48}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>IMPACT OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) ON STAFF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT IN JOHN HARRIS LIBRARY IN UNIVERSITY OF BENIN, EDO STATE, NIGERIA</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/> 1.1 Background of study</strong></p> <p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) refers to technologies that provide access to information through telecommunications. It is similar to Information Technology (IT), but focuses primarily on communication technologies. This includes the Internet, wireless networks, cell phones, and other communication mediums.</p> <p>In the past few decades, information and communication technologies have provided society with a vast array of new communication capabilities. For example, people can communicate in real-time with others in different countries using technologies such as instant messaging, voice over IP (VoIP), and video-conferencing. Modern information and communication technologies have created a \"global village,\" in which people can communicate with others across the world as if they were living next door. For this reason, ICT is often studied in the context of how modern communication technologies affect society.</p> <p>Training is teaching, or developing in oneself or others, any skills and knowledge that relate to specific usefulcompetencies. Training has specific goals of improving one's capability, capacity, productivity and performance. In addition to the basic training required for a trade, occupation or profession, observers of the labor-market recognizes the need to continue training beyond initial qualifications: to maintain, upgrade and update skills throughout working life. People within many professions and occupations may refer to this sort of training as professional development.</p> <p>Staff training and development is a broad term covering multiple kinds of employee learning. </p> <p>Training is a program that helps employees learn specific knowledge or skills to improve performance in their current roles. Development is more expansive and focuses on employee growth and future performance, rather than an immediate job role.</p> <p>In recent times, the development and training of human resources has been the focus in national development. This is due to the fact that, the growth of any nation depends on the extent human development. Hence, without adequate investment in developing the human resources of the educational sector especially on the use of ICT, the possibility of national growth might be hampered.  Okpala, (2006) stated that training and development is an instrument for social and economic mobility at personal level and instrument for transformation by society at national level.</p> <p>Training and development for libraries is a critical factor in a knowledge base economy where information and communication iskeyto national development. Knowledge has become the only reliable instrument of gaining competitive advantage and staff training and development has become the panacea for addressing these challenges. Currently, organizations are recognizing the need to use best training and development practices to achieve their goal. In the Boards of Alan, (2009), staffs are now seen not just as employees, but as the organizations greatest asset which when given development opportunities, will deliver services to meet the changing needs of customers. The implication of the above position is that for library staff, relevant training and development should not be underestimated.</p> <p>Training plays crucial role in the attainment of organizational goals through staff. There is a correlation between organizational success and investment due to relevant training and development. Hence staff training and development can also lead to organizational change and success, Sardar (2010). Besides, the value of staff training and development cannot be over emphasized for organizations. Effective training can boost the confident of library staff. The feedback from library users can also lead to job satisfaction and motivation. Organizations’ that invest in staff training and development usually benefits from an enriched working environment with higher level of staff retention as well as increased productivity and performance, Cobblah(2015).</p> <p>Due to rapid technological and organizational changes, libraries have also increased the scope of librarians` responsibilities. In order to meet the information needs of library users; the skills and services have also drastically change with staff development and continuing education (Callahan &amp; Watson, 1995). Staff training and development in libraries is therefore intended to strengthen the capabilities of libraries to perform functions effectively and efficiently in an information technology era. Staff training and development programs in libraries encourage the growth of both individual and library. This study focuses on the impact of information technology on staff training and development in John Harris Library in University of Benin, Edo State, Nigeria.</p> <p>The University of Benin, main library, the John Harris Library, was named after the pioneer university librarian, PROF. JOHN HARRIS, from New Zealand. The library began with the inception of the university in 1970 at the Ekehuan Road Campus. John Harris Library is an ultra-modern building with central air conditioning. The building is designed to seat about 700 readers. It provides photocopying, duplicating, laminating and binding services. The library has been computerized. Installation of other modern information technology facilities is ongoing.</p> <p>With the high increase in student population, the library has embarked on an expansion programme with the establishment of faculty libraries; the Ekehuan Road Campus Library, Medical Library, Law, Engineering and Pharmacy Library are functional. A John Harris Library extension is awaiting commissioning. The library participates in interlibrary co-operation among Nigerian academic libraries.</p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVE OF ESTABLISHMENT OF JOHN HARRIS LIBRARY:</strong></p> <p>The overall objective of establishing John Harris Library is defined as follows:</p> <p>To offer a current and up-to-date collection of print and non-print materials, research and teaching needs of all library users. This translates into the following more specific objectives:</p> <p>·                     Provision of current information to users in a quick and cost effective manner</p> <p>·                     Provision of balanced perspective on knowledge based issues</p> <p>·                     Provision of alternatives to formal learning in form of material support for continuing education</p> <p>·                     Provision of value services, which improves information delivery</p> <p>·                     Satisfying the information needs of the community</p> <p>·                     Locating and assisting in the development of relevant information or materials</p> <p>·                     Pairing information outreach with other activities in which the populations already engaged e.g. workshops, conferences, community events etc and</p> <p><strong>1.1        </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong></p> <p>Information Communication Technology (ICT) is changing the work of libraries and information centers. More than ever, university libraries need this technology. An increased number of users, a greater demand for library materials, an increase in the amount of material being published, new electronic formats and sources, and the development of new and cheaper computers are some of the reasons for the growing need for ICT in University Libraries. University libraries have not made equal progress in this area. Librarians, library patrons and supporters, and, above all, the government, must help develop ICT-based libraries to meet the changing demands of the users.</p> <p>Despite these importance, usefulness of ICT in libraries, it is observed that there is a problem of absence of ICT based information services delivery, even when there is evidence of ICT’s in John Harris Library that have resulted to computerized library system.</p> <p>Similarly, observation by the researcher also show that library staff in university of Benin are faced with the challenge of rapid technological advancement, increased demands from the university communities for innovative services and the University libraryis observed to be changing in response to changes in teaching, learning and research activities but it was observed that there is a dearth in staff training and development programs to keep the librarians abreast of new developments in librarianship for effective and efficient service delivery using ICT.  </p> <p>However,it has been revealed that studies relating to this area are very scanty and no similar study has been carried out in universities in Edo State, Nigeria to the best of knowledge of this researcher. Therefore, the problem of this study is to investigate the impact of ICT to staff training and development to improve provision of effective library and information services in John Harris Library in University of Benin, Edo State, Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objective of this study is to determine the impact of Information Technology on staff training and development in John Harris Library in University of Benin, Edo State, Nigeria. Specifically the study seeks to:</p> <p>1.       Determine availability of staff training and development programs in libraries.</p> <p>2.       Identify the types of staff training and development programs in John Harris Library, University of Benin.</p> <p>3.       To identify the benefits of staff training and development programs in John Harris Library, University of Benin.</p> <p>4.       Ascertain the effect of ICT on staff training and development programs on libraries.</p> <p>5.       Identify the challenges that affect staff training and development programs in John Harris Library, University of Benin.</p> <p><strong>1.4     RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>This study seeks answers to the following questions:</p> <p>1.  To what extent are staff training and development programs available in John Harris Library, University of Benin?</p> <p>2.  What are the types of staff training and development programsexisting in John Harris Library, University of Benin?</p> <p>3.  What are benefits to be derived from staff training and development programs for library staff in John Harris Library, University of Benin?</p> <p>4.  Does ICT use affect staff training and development programs?</p> <p>5.  What are the challenges that affect staff training and development programs in John Harris Library, University of Benin?</p> <p><strong>1.5     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is hoped that the findings of this study will be of benefits to librarians, researchers, university management, stakeholders, management of university libraries and library schools.Also, it is hoped that this study will assist librarians and library management to fill the gap that exists between staff training and development programs in University Libraries. Practically, it is hoped that the findings from this study will provide university libraries access to current and timely resources that will enhance effective discharge of services by librarians. </p> <p>It is expected that the findings of this study will be useful to practicing librarians by exposing them to the type of ICT competencies they need to possess in order to perform optimally in the profession. Similarly, it will also assist Curriculum Developers in the department of Library and Information Science to provide useful information about the type of professional training required by modern information workers. This will help them to plan a rich academic course content that will incorporate ICT competency training programmes. </p> <p><strong>1.6     SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study covers the types of staff training and development programs that are available, reasons, effect and challenges of staff training and development programs. This study is also limited to John Harris Library in University of Benin, Edo State, Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.7     OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>The following terms are hereby defined in the context in which they are used in this study:</p> <p><strong>Impact:</strong> in this study, refers the measure of the tangible and intangible effects (consequences) of entity's action or influence upon another.</p> <p><strong>Staff:</strong> in this study refers,a group of people who work for an organization, in this case, a university library.</p> <p><strong>Academic Library</strong>: in this study refers the library that is attached to a higher education institution which serves two complementary purposes to support the school's curriculum, and to support the research of the university faculty and students.</p> <p><strong>Staff Development:</strong> in this study, refers the process of assisting managerial library staff to perform non-routine jobs toimprove managerial, administrative and decision- making abilities and competence. </p> <p><strong>Training:</strong>in this study, refers teaching of lower-level or technical library staff on how to perform their jobs.</p> <p><strong>Information Communication Technology</strong>: in this study, refers the use of modern electronics to render library services.   </p>\n\nIMPACT OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) ON STAFF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT IN JOHN HARRIS LIBRARY IN UNIVERSITY OF BENIN, EDO STATE, NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) ON STAFF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT IN JOHN HARRIS LIBRARY IN UNIVERSITY OF BENIN, EDO STATE, NIGERIA", "id": 49}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p><em>The topic Impact on the information and communication Technology as a tool for Organization growth in First Bank Plc Ekwulobia in Anambra State.

Management should discourage any like hood that could bring about barrier to effective communication.</em></p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <ul><li>Background of The Study</li> </ul> <p>The world has become a global village and as such communication has become so fast efficient that one can communicate across the globe in a matter of seconds. This development in the communication industry, has made possible by the advent of computer, information and communication technology.</p> <p>Technology in the 21st century is dominated. Today’s technological advances are faster and more fundamental, with their cost decreasing rapidly. It covers all forms of computer and communications equipment and software used to create, design, store, transmit, interpret and manipulate information in its various formats. Personal computers, laptops, television and network technologies are just some examples of the diverse array of ICT tools.</p> <p>Information and communication technology is a general term that describes the process of creating, modifying, storage, transmission of information, between humans and machines alike globally, using several different electronic technologies to achieve an outcome. Organizations use information technology heavily to automate their work, making it easier and quicker to achieve their goals. Every business organization always wishes to attain a target profit a success. The attainment of the success depends largely on the adoption and management of information and communication technology in the marketing of goods and services. Modern day business literally abounds in several examples of organization and individual in different part of the world who made fortunes by seizing opportunities engendered by technological changes.</p> <p>Less sighted organization operation on the same technological environment lost their fortune and in some a result of their inability to anticipate and adopt strategies that would match change brought about by technology. As a  result of opportunities created by technological changes, information and communication technology in particular, forward looking organization such as banking industry have adopted different marketing strategies aimed at achieving organization objectives.</p> <p>Business operates in a world of technologies and gulping changes which create new problems, risks and opportunities which they mobilize resources to meet such changes and tap the opportunities presented for the overall success of the organization objectives, marketing strategy which will enable the business to continually adopt its operation to the realities of the market and consumers satisfaction in particulars, which is the corner stone of organizational growth.</p> <ol><li>Inadequate information flow in organization also affects organizational growth.</li> <li>A change in technology in banking industry also affects organizational productivity because the employers and employee need special training on the job. <ul><li>Statement of the Study</li> </ul></li> </ol> <p>Before the advent of technology, the tasks in most organizations have been performed manually. This involves the use of excessive human labour to perform them. The problem here was not whether these organizations achieved their goals with a specific period. The essences of these organizations to make profit for the owners within a period of time the adverts of the technologies are believed to give added impetus to organizational productivity. The question is whether the introduction of ICT to most organization has added significantly to the overall growth of these organizations.

It will also help to know the problems caused by the library clientele and profile solution toward the problems. This project work is design to know the functions of reference librarian and services to make prospect in the reference section of a library. Chapter one of this project works treats Background to the study, research questions, significance of the study, scope and limitation of the study, definition of some terms as it concerns to this work. Chapter two treats literature review which covers areas like Reference materials, staffing of the reference section, management of reference section, problem facing reference section. Chapter three treat methodology which comprises of research design, population of the study, sample and sampling technologies, research instrument, and method of data analysis. Chapter four treats data analysis, presentation of result and discussion of findings. While Chapter five treats summary of the work conclusion and recommendation for further study.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Background to the study</p> <p>Reference service is one of the essential services of the library. Meaning reference service is the activities, roles, functions and services rendered by the reference librarian constitute reference service. According to Prytherch, (2002) He states that: “reference service deal with the provision of reference work by library staff”.</p> <p>According to Ohio Library Council, (2005) Reference services is “A way for libraries to meet the needs of their user (clientele) communities”. Reference service involves instructing clients to operate independently and at own pace to uses electronic and print resources of the library, it also involved personal assistance given to the users to enable them meet their needs.</p> <p>James (2005) states that reference work started in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to respond to several forces and trends. In the next several decades from the 1930s through the 1950s, a new technology that provides, access to the library to a lager member and much wider variety of people was introduce. That technology is obviously, the telephone and the reference literature of the day speaks of its advantages but also its challenges. For example, having distinguished between “important questions coming in via the telephone those business men and involving important topics from less important” ones from club woman planning programs, context questions like should this service be centralized or dispersed? Should it be staffed differently from the desk? What information resources should be dedicated to it? And many more.</p> <p>According to (ALA RUSA, 2008) reference service includes reference transactions and other activities that involve the creation, management, and assessment of information or research resources, tools and services. Creation and management of information resources includes the development and maintenance of research collections, research guide, catalogues, database, web-sites, search engines etc that patrons can use independently, in-house or remotely to satisfy their information needs. Assessment activities include the measurement and evaluation of reference work, resources and services.</p> <p>According to Esharenana, (2008) sees reference section as that section of library which provide a variety of services and perform functions necessary to assist the users including provision of information service on demand and in providing institution in the use of library, selected of documents and organization of reference materials.</p> <p>According to Obiora, (2004) states that reference sources are publications – book and non-book materials consulted only within the library for specific facts or definite piece of information on a subject. There are two types of reference sources, general reference sources which include Encyclopedia, Directories, Dictionaries, Yearbooks and Handbook while special or subject reference sources are Mathematics, Biology, and Library Science.</p> <p>According to Esharenana, (2008) states that reference question is a sentence, phrase or word posed by a patron to the reference librarian asking for information or assistance in order to meet the need.</p> <p>According to Ramum (2003) reference policy is regarded as a kind of set of plan and as a kind of framework within which reference staff and clienteles work.</p> <p>Ahi Rusa, (2003) states that a reference librarians is person that provides reference service. He should posses a wide range of intellectual interest, desire to assist the patrons, flair for organizing documents ability to search literature and adequate knowledge of the library and external resources.</p> <p>According to Scott (2007) is pubic service counter where professional librarian provide library users with direction on how to make use of library materials, advise on library collection and services and expertise on multiple kinds of information from multiple sources.</p> <p>According to Anderson (2005) digital reference is a service and the reference transaction is a computer mediated communication.</p> <p>Statement of Problems</p> <p>The aim of this study is to critically analyze the problems and prospect towards the services in the reference section and equally to view the problems that have prevented it from executing effectively and efficiently the bibliographical functions in the library.</p> <p>One observes that the very rapid expansion of our reference sources have reached a stage of concern. One finds that the library does not tackle the problem of acquisition of up-to-date reference materials like journals to keep the clienteles (students and lecturers even the parent institution) abreast of the new trends in their various field of study.</p> <p>Development of the reference collection and organization which effect in the backbone of a reference eservice should also be looked into. A maximum attention would equally be paid to the relevance of the exiting services, to see how it meet the needs of the patrons, because the effective use of these materials depends on the services provided by the reference personnel or librarians.</p> <p>Purpose of Study</p> <p>The purpose of this study is to know the problems and prospect of reference services. Therefore the researcher will be able to find out the following purposes:</p> <ol><li>To know if the reference section of the academic library is well organized.</li> <li>To know if there reference services are being rendered in line with other reference services in other libraries.</li> <li>To identify the strength and weakness of the library’s reference collection because any effective reference service may not be feasible without an appropriate and adequate reference collection.</li> <li>To enable the researcher carry out the findings so that to make recommendation for effective reference services in the library.</li> <li>To take the library to another level through the reference services.</li> </ol> <p>Research Questions</p> <p>For the success of this study, this study demands an answer to the following questions:</p> <ol><li>Is the reference section of the academic library adequately organized to perform its functions?</li> <li>To what extent can the reference materials in the library said to be appropriate for the needs of the clientele?</li> </ol> <ul><li>Are the reference services being rendered in-line with other reference services in other libraries?</li> </ul> <ol><li>Does the library make available all the useful reference materials needed by the users for them?</li> <li>Does the library clientele find it easy with the reference librarian in terms of research?</li> </ol> <p>Significance of the Study</p> <ol><li>This study will lay on the reference services in academic library users.</li> <li>It will provide a useful information on how reference services are being searched by the users.</li> <li>It demonstrates to library staff the feelings of its clientele towards the type of reference materials they provide for them.</li> <li>The recommendation to the made will be the one that if implemented will enhance an effective reference information services of the library to its user.</li> <li>To enable adequate access to the materials be the library users.</li> </ol> <p>Scope of the Study</p> <p>This study is restricted to the university of Anambra State Uli Campus library. The reference services rendered to the users are deeply discussed.</p> <p>Reasonable conclusion and recommendation was made because of limited time and space placed on this research, make it impossible to evaluate in details everything about the problems and prospect of Anambra State University reference library section. Only activities performed in the library and the general overview of their statistical record and their reference materials have been look into.</p> <p>The quality of staff was also evaluated, the nature of their work and services towards their users.</p> <p>Definition of terms</p> <p>Reference Services:      According to Ala, (2008) reference service involves reference activities that includes the creation, management and assessment of information, research resources, tools and services. Creation and management of information resources include the development and maintenance of research collections, catalogues, research guides, databases, web-sites, search engines etc.</p> <p>So that patrons can use independently to satisfy their information needs. Therefore reference is sees to be an act of documenting important materials for future use while services is the ability to make sure that reference section is functioning effectively. It deals with provision of reference work by library staff.</p>\n\nTHE PROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF REFERENCE SERVICES IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF REFERENCE SERVICES IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES", "id": 51}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The study title “Assessment of Undergraduate degree Programmes of Library and Information Science available in the library schools in Northern states of Nigeria” was embarked upon in order to investigate Undergraduate degree programme of library and information science in selected University-base library schools in Northern states of Nigeria. Six research questions were formulated and answered. A survey research methodology was adopted .and documentary sources and semi-structured questionnaire were the instruments used to collect data. The responses from the sampled of the four library schools and their lecturers under study numbering 70 were studied and analyzed, using frequency tables and percentages and suggestions are made. The study discovered the degree programmes of library and information science available are, Bachelor of Library and Information Science (B. LIS), B- Tech. Library and Information Science (LIS) and B-Tech. Library and Information Technology (LIT) The requirement for admission into Bachelor‟s Degree programme are through UTME/post-UME and Direct-entry (DE). The finding showed that qualified lecturers and fund to acquire necessary and adequate facilities, such as internet connectivity, laboratory equipment for students are inadequate. The study therefore concluded that, differences in the programmes have no significant impact on the competency of librarians produced. In view of this numbers of recommendations were made with a view to improving the quality of the Library and Information Science Programmes in the library schools.</p> <p><strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Library science education and training programme in Nigeria is linked to the general social and political history of the country. The mode of library education and training in Nigeria during the colonial period up to 1960 was conducted through short courses organized for the staff of local reading rooms and the Native Authority libraries. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century‟s Library Science Education in many of the former British Colonies derived its educational and professional structures from the United Kingdom (UK) standard. Carroll (2011) reported that, the British model for library science education included training in the workplace in an apprenticeship mode and eventually involved examinations in both general and specialist knowledge set by the local professional association or Library Association (LA) of U K. However, the only method of becoming a librarian in Nigeria was by taking the Associate ship of the British Library Association (ALA), either by attending British library schools or by correspondence courses offered by the British Association of Assistant Librarians or by part-time study. This was the practice after the collapse of the regional library training institute established at Achimota Ganah in 1944, to help prepare the first corps of librarians for Nigeria and other Anglophone countries of West Africa. (Ahmed 2012) The ALA training was mostly foreign-oriented and the services in the existing libraries where the products worked were not customized towards meeting the increasing local demands for library services. As more libraries were established in Nigeria to provide information support to the users, the need was expressed for trained librarians to run the services. According to Otike, (2012) initially, the early libraries were manned by expatriate librarians educated in the west; therefore something had to be done to train librarians locally. Situation was made worse with the departure of expatriate librarians immediately after independence. 1.1.2 Concept of Library and Information Science The concept of Library and Information Science (LIS) has been explained by various scholars. Singh (2008) defined LIS as a profession concerned with the knowledge and skill by which records of human communication are collected organized and utilized, the librarian is a mediator between man and the graphic records that his and previous generations have produced and the goal of librarian is to maximize the social utility of these records for the benefit of humanity. Similarly, Ozioko and Nwabueze (2010) further lamented that, LIS as a discipline concerned with the study of the principles and skills required for systematic collection, organization and use of society‟s information resources in libraries. Library science programmes focus intensively on the organizational structures that contain.</p>\n\nASSESSMENT OF UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMME OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN SELECTED LIBRARY SCHOOLS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMME OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN SELECTED LIBRARY SCHOOLS", "id": 52}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>There are persons with physical challenges at all levels in every society. The physically challenged are those who are hindered or prevented from acting or living the way ordinary people do. Lawal-Solarin (2012), defines physical challenge as an inability to perform some or all the task of daily life, or a medically diagnosed condition that makes it difficult to engage in activities of daily life. In the view of Gobalakrishnan (2013) physically challenged could be described as those restricted, hindered or prevented to have equal opportunities with their contemporaries due to physical deformity, he said they include the visual, hearing, mobility, cognitive, language and speech impaired. Physically challenged persons can as well be described as those hindered either by physical or mental defect from receiving a normal education or even from pursuing normal vocation. The total number of people with disabilities in Nigeria according to the 2006 census were 3 253,169 and the percentage is approximately 2.32 percent of the total population of 140,431,790 in that year <em>(Umeh&amp;Adeola, 2013). The 2006 estimated figure notwithstanding, </em>extent of disabilities in Nigeria has not been ascertained. Evidence of what is claimed to be the figure as given by World Report on Disability in 2011, said about 25 million Nigerians had at least one disability, while 3.6 million of them had very significant difficulties in functioning (http://www.cbm.org/Nigeria-266847.php). Physical challenge has a substantial long-term adverse effect on one’s ability to carry out usual day to day activities. Majority of the physically challenged lives below poverty line due to years of neglect by the society, especially their lack of access to paid employment. The physically challenged is often misconceived as unwell, unable to work, read and in need of help persons and people that deserve pity. Okoli (2010) lamented that disabled people are living in an environment that is hostile to their yearnings and aspirations. Indeed, concerns about the challenges encountered by physically challenged individuals have been expressed by various authors such as Ejedafiru (2011), Ilayaraja and Manoharan (2012), Momodu (2013) and many others. Of particular interest, is the fact that individuals with disabilities encounter discrimination, isolation and rejection, which can lead to frustration in some cases, and can adversely degenerate to a level that an individual may not be able to actualize his aspirations.</p>\n\nAVAILABILITY AND UTILIZATION OF INFORMATION RESOURCES AND SERVICES IN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION CENTRE LIBRARIES <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AVAILABILITY AND UTILIZATION OF INFORMATION RESOURCES AND SERVICES IN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION CENTRE LIBRARIES ", "id": 53}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>EXAMINING THE INFLUENCE OF USE OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN PROMOTING READING CULTURE AMONG SECONDARY STUDENTS</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPETR ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p>1.1        Background of the study</p> <p>1.2        Statement of problem</p> <p>1.3        Objective of the study</p> <p>1.4        Research Hypotheses</p> <p>1.5        Significance of the study</p> <p>1.6        Scope and limitation of the study</p> <p>1.7       Definition of terms</p> <p>1.8       Organization of the study</p> <p><strong>CHAPETR TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>2.0   LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPETR THREE</strong></p> <p>3.0        Research methodology</p> <p>3.1    sources of data collection</p> <p>3.3        Population of the study</p> <p>3.4        Sampling and sampling distribution</p> <p>3.5        Validation of research instrument</p> <p>3.6        Method of data analysis</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></p> <p><strong>DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION</strong></p> <p>4.1 Introductions</p> <p>4.2 Data analysis</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></p> <p>5.1 Introduction</p> <p>5.2 Summary</p> <p>5.3 Conclusion</p> <p>5.4 Recommendation</p> <p>Appendix</p> <p><strong> Abstract</strong></p> <p>The function of reading in the development of human life and his society cannot be overemphasized as it adds quality to life and is a pathway to the future.

Simply put, reading is a basic building block for learning. It is a necessity for full participation in contemporary society. In effect, reading in its entirety and variety is necessary for being better informed. It stimulates imagination, widens views, expands horizons, encourages quick learning and helps in learning about different people and places. Generally, reading invokes curiosity and imagination that leads to skills for handling complex ideas and issues. In an age when browsing the net, playing with funky handsets and passing non-stop short message service (SMSs) seem to be the order of the day, reading a book in a peaceful corner of a library has become an archaic idea for most people. While technology is slowly taking a steady control over individual lives, the reading habit is fast vanishing into thin air. The achievement of quality basic education in all countries in Africa call for development of good reading habits of both children and adult. This will change the stigma already associated with Africa as a continent with a “Poor Reading Culture” (Tella and Akande, 2007). The art of reading can be an interesting experience for children and adolescents if they are properly guided. It is a common saying that students are the future leaders, invariably; every child is a potential leader. To this effect, it is noted that leaders are made and not just born. Ilogho (2015) argued that though most people may have the potentials to become effective leaders, it takes time to discover and develop these potentials. Until these potentials are discovered, the teachers must ensure that the students have good reading culture. Students training include teaching and helping them cultivate a good reading habit. Reading habit refers to the frequency of reading, and the average time spent on basis of growth and development. For the purpose of this study, the two terms “reading culture” and “reading habit” will be used interchangeably as they are mutually exclusive or inseparable. Nssien (2007) states that, reading culture is a process of building up positive reading attitude among students and children over time. Although, when an individual habitually and regularly read books and other information materials that are not necessarily required of him to advance in his/her profession or career, he or she is also said to have a reading culture. One interesting legacy to hand down to students is teaching them to become life-long learners through reading and love of books. Once this culture is inculcated in them, their ability to study independently and excel academically will increase. Also, they can surmount future challenges in life when they have good reading culture. To promote reading culture among students, a library is needed in secondary schools. A library is a place of information or a place of lending information resources that leads to acquisition of knowledge. It is essential for promotion of reading culture in students. The information resources (reading materials) available in the library unveil an opportunity for the students to find information or reading materials and read by themselves. For the purpose of this study, the library to be discussed is the school library. School libraries are those libraries in nursery, primary and secondary schools, and they are located in the school premises. Their primary aim is to support the learning activities of the school, and inculcate good reading habit in the students. No wonder why it is stipulated in the functions of school libraries that part of its role is to promote the development of reading skills and encourage long-term learning habits. Learning habits form the key to continuous success in school, as well as personal enrichment of the students/pupils. To enable the school library fulfill its role of promoting reading culture, it provides not only books but items such as motion pictures, video tapes, slides, educational materials, etc as library collections. It is also the culture or habit that enables one to imbibe reading and studying as a library include; fiction and non-fiction books and books on other subject matters. Books on current affairs keep them abreast of current happenings. The school library is the child’s first exposure to library use. The reason for establishing school libraries is for them to serve as a pivot for reading and promoting reading habit among school children. The school library brings together books and other formats of literacy materials and the readers under the expert guidance of a certified or professional librarian for the promotion of a sustainable reading culture. Apart from provision of reading materials, school libraries provide reading programmes that motivate students to read for pleasure. Reading programmes are reading activities school libraries provide to create awareness of the collections and motivate students to read for pleasure </p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>To enable the school library fulfill its role of promoting reading culture, it provides not only books but items such as motion pictures, video tapes, slides, educational materials, etc as library collections. It is also the culture or habit that enables one to imbibe reading and studying as a library include; fiction and non-fiction books and books on other subject matters. Books on current affairs keep them abreast of current happenings.

FESTUS AGHAGBONWAKO LIBRARY", "id": 56}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The school library is an important organ of the educational system, and without it no profitable or rewarding educational programme can go on in the school environment because all the academic activities depend on the school library and its facilities. It is a place where the collections of information materials that are acquired, organized, and stored are kept for use by students and teachers.  Umar (2013), defines the school library as that part of the school where a collection of books, periodicals, magazines, records of all types, computers etc. are housed for use by teachers and students for learning, recreational activities, personal interests and interpersonal relationships of children. Akanwa and Mbagwu (2016) also emphasize that the school library is a laboratory where many activities and experiments are carried out, and all these activities and experiments are geared towards the development of the child and the nation. The school library can be seen as an important appendage to any school programme, and without it, no profitable or rewarding educational activity can go on in the school environment. Morris (2004) defines the school library as an instructional media centre that supplies not only the basic necessary information materials but also provides the incentives, guidance and conducive environment for learning. Ahanene (1990) summarizes that the school library is an information service centre located in primary, post-primary or teacher training colleges whose objective is to provide information services in support of learning in the school.</p>\n\nMANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS AND STUDENTS’ SATISFACTION WITH LIBRARY SERVICES IN PUBLIC SECONDARY SCHOOLS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS AND STUDENTS’ SATISFACTION WITH LIBRARY SERVICES IN PUBLIC SECONDARY SCHOOLS", "id": 57}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study looks at the level of information overload and information Anxiety among undergraduates of Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka. The study sought to find out the major causes of information overload and anxiety and possible strategies to control them. The research was guided by four research questions and descriptive survey was used as the research design. Also, random sampling technique was used to select 200 students as the sample size from four faculties. Simple mean method  was used for data analysis. The study revealed that the level of information overload among undergraduates when studying for exams, receiving lectures, doing a research project or an assignment is high. Also that the level of information anxiety among undergraduates in prioritizing tasks, effectively managing information and receiving information from different sources were also high, however they have low anxiety when making decision based on the obtained information and accessing needed information. The study further revealed that the major causes of information overload and anxiety are lack of information literacy skills, kind of tasks and responsibilities of the users, internet and emails, nature and formats of information. And that the possible strategy to managing information anxiety and overload among undergraduates were to acquire information literacy skills, use satisficing model of decision making, employ information pruning strategy, planning and prioritizing tasks before information search and effective time management.</p>\n\nTHE LEVEL OF INFORMATION OVERLOAD AND ANXIETY AMONG UNDERGRADUATES<div

study investigated the digitalization of local collection and its impact on scholarship using the status of digitalization in some federal university libraries in South-Eastern Zone of Nigeria. Seven research questions guided the study. The research design adopted for this study is a descriptive survey. The total population for this study was three hundred and twenty-three (323) library staff, but sixty (60) rspondents that were directly involved in digitization were sampled. The major instruments for data collection are questionnaire and observation checklist. A total of sixty questionnaire were distributed to the respondents who comprised of the library staff from the university libraries under study. Fifty-five copies of the questionnaire were correctly filled and used for this study. Data were analyzed using percentage and mean scores. From the analysis, the findings revealed that improved library services, increased access, speedy retrieval of documents and effective preservation are the major impact of digitization of library local content collections. The result also shows that librarians have not yet acquired all the skills needed for digitization especially skills on creation and management of library website, database management skill, trouble-shooting, metadata creation of library local content collections, and web publishing. High cost of purchasing equipment, poor internet connectivity, preservation of digital resources, inadequate skilled personnel, lack of standards, and inadequate funding are some of the major problems militating against effective digitization project. Based on the findings, the study recommended alternative power supply, adequate funding, training of librarians to acquire digitization skills and proper selection of software packages as strategies for effective digitization. The study concluded that in order to remain relevant in the present digital environment, libraries especially in developing countries should make every effort to digitize their local content for preservation and easy access.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENT</p> <p>Title page</p> <p>Certification                                                                                                i </p> <p>Dedication                                                                                        ii</p> <p>Acknowledgement                                                                            iii</p> <p>Abstract                                                                                           iv</p> <p>Chapter One: </p> <p>1.0        Introduction                                                                        1</p> <p>1.1        Background Information                                                     1</p> <p>1.2        Problem Statement                                                              6</p> <p>1.3         Research Objectives                                                             7</p> <p>1.4       Hypothesis                                                                          8</p> <p>1.5        Significance of the Study                                                     9</p> <p>1.6        Scope of the Study                                                             10</p> <p>Chapter Two: </p> <p>2.0        Literature Review</p> <p>Chapter Three: </p> <p>3.0     Research Methodology                                         30</p> <p>3.1     Description of the Study Area                             30</p> <p>3.2    Research Design                                                            30</p> <p>3.3  Method of Data Collection                                            31</p> <p>3.4  Data Limitation                                                             31</p> <p>3.5  Method of Data Analysis                                               32</p> <p>3.5.1                   Summative Approaches                                       32</p> <p>3.5.2         Simple Percentage                                                33</p> <p>3.5.3         Incremental Averages                                           34</p> <p>3.6            Test of Hypothesis                                               34</p> <p>Chapter Four</p> <p>4.0 Presentation of Data, Analysis of Data and Discussion of Findings                                              36</p> <p>4.1  Data Presentation                                                          37</p> <p>4.2  Data Analysis                                                                39</p> <p>4.3  Discussion of Findings                                         41</p> <p>4.4   Test of Hypothesis                                                         45</p> <p>Chapter Five: </p> <p>5.0  Summary    of      Findings Conclusion and</p> <p>Recommendation                                              47</p> <p>5.1  Summary of Findings                                                     47</p> <p>5.2  Conclusion                                                       48</p> <p>5.3  Recommendation                                                 48</p> <p>References</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Background to the Study</p> <p>The University library can be seen as the central nervous system of its parent institution as they are primarily established to provide information resources to back up academic programmes. It is the principal instrument of the university in the conservation of knowledge. Proper fulfillment of this role provides a sound basis for the transmission and advancement of knowledge. The University library therefore collects materials, published and unpublished, print and non-print, in some depth and globally in almost all fields of knowledge (Aguolu and Aguolu, 2002). Thus the main purpose of the university library is to support the objective of the university which is to promote teaching, learning and research.</p> <p>Globally, Libraries are digitizing information resources and making them available and accessible to end users via electronic media such as the World Wide Web (WWW), the Internet, and CD-ROM. The present revolution in Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) and digitization initiatives are now critical issues that libraries, especially in the academic environment can no longer afford to fold their hands if they must continue to remain relevant in this digital age. Nwalo (2003) noted that “Libraries in Africa including Nigeria are gradually but steadily converting from manual process to computer-based library routines.” This is as a result of the changing need of library users.</p> <p>Obviously, the general library environment is gradually changing from analogue to digital and/or hybrid library, as a result of the present ICT revolution which has been the central driving force for digitization project. Hence, ICT is the gateway for library digitization; although these technologies have been in a very low supply in Nigerian universities and most African countries. The advent of ICTs and the present digitization projects are key developmental factors in the present day libraries especially in the academic environment. ICT according to Blurton (1999) is a diverse set of technological tools and resources used to communicate and to create, disseminate, store, and manage information. Anaeme (2006) pointed out that the emergence of fast growth of Information Communication Technologies (ICT) and their application in libraries, especially academic libraries, has continued to revolutionize the pattern and scope of library services. In the same vein, Campbell (2006) observed that “numerous creative and useful services have evolved within academic libraries in digital age: providing quality learning spaces, creating metadata, offering virtual reference services, teaching information literacy, choosing resources and managing resources licenses, collecting and digitizing archival materials, and maintaining digital repositories.</p> <p>Digitization is the process of converting the contents of a document from hardcopy into electronic or machine-readable form. It involves the selection of source materials of intellectual value, scanning them, and saving the scanned document into the computer to be accessed locally and remotely via the internet. According to Witten and Bridge (2003), digitization is “the process of taking traditional library materials that are in the form of books and papers and converting them to the electronic form where they can be stored and manipulated by a computer”. Fatoki (2005) defined digitization as “the conversion of analogue media to digital form”. In the same vein, Library and Archives, Canada in Akintude (2007) defined digitization as “the process of translating a piece of information such as sound recording, picture or video into bits”. Digitization therefore involves more than the conversion of analogue materials into digital format; it includes the organization of the digital content into a navigable format.</p> <p>Generally, digitization has a lot of invaluable benefits such as increasing the visibility of libraries globally, improved services to an expanding number of users, enhanced access to current and vast amount of information from remote sites as users can easily access library local content collections from different parts of the world no matter the distance; flexibility in information search and retrieval; it ensures better preservation of library local content collections by reduced handling of the original analogue surrogate materials and alleviating the problems normally associated with the traditional library environment such as mutilation of information resources, theft, space constraints, scarcity or limited number of copies, limited hour of operation, and poor storage environment normally associated with manual preservation; it is a veritable information source for e-learning and it offers a platform for collaboration and interoperability of libraries globally.</p> <p>Digitization has the potentials of making Africa global producers of indigenous information and preservation of our cultural heritage rather than being passive consumers of imported information. Hence, digitization paves way for the globalization of local content and the accessibility of global information resources locally. In Africa, there have been some digitization projects. Chisenga (2004) noted that while digital libraries and archives are being created around the world in order to preserve, store, catalogue, disseminate and share information resources, target scale digitization projects in Africa have not yet taken off, though there are notable efforts being made in some countries, but mainly in a small scale. Digitization enhances the visibility of a library globally as materials digitized can be easily accessed by other libraries and research institutions once there are compatible infrastructures such as relevant hardware, software, and internet connectivity. The immense importance of digitization is that it offers opportunities for collaboration among libraries worldwide. It enhances the visibility of a library globally as digitized materials can easily be accessed by other libraries and research institutions locally, nationally and internationally, once there is compatibility of infrastructures such as relevant hardware and software.</p> <p>Digitization has recently become a very popular term in libraries as there has been a global need for nations to preserve their cultural heritage and make them accessible in order to contribute positively to the global information and knowledge economy. The concept of a library as a physical place where one can visit to access information has dramatically changed to services which provide organized access to the intellectual records, wherever it resides whether in physical places or in scattered digital information spaces paving way to the present model of hybrid libraries (Carr, 2001)</p> <p>Digital libraries emerged largely in the 1990s because of the revolution in the ICTs and the need for enhanced access and preservation of cultural heritage materials. The term digital library was first made popular by the NSF/DARPA/NASA Digital Libraries Initiative in 1994, (Eyitayo, 2007). Digital libraries according to the Digital Library Federation (DLF, 1998) are “organizations that provide the resource, including the specialized staff, to select, structure, offer intellectual access to interpret, distribute, preserve the integrity of, and ensure the persistence over time of collections of digital works so that they are readily and economically available for use by a defined community or set of communities”. Digital libraries offer a brighter future for academic, research institutions, and digital information professionals. They offer access to and opportunities for use of online primary resources. The main purpose of digital libraries is to organize, distribute, and preserve information resources in a digital form. Digital libraries have the potential of improving and promoting information-related activities (Ojedokun, 2000). Digital libraries therefore are libraries in electronic form, with no physical location and contain digital information that could be accessed from any part of the world via the internet. It solves the problem of time and space.</p> <p>Digital collections usually comprise of local content and provide unlimited access to information materials that may not be readily accessible manually. Local content refers to what the community creates, owns or adapts in terms of knowledge (Ballantyne, 2002). Digital materials are stored, processed, accessed, and disseminated via digital devices and networks. Digital technologies offer a new preservation paradigm and the opportunity of preserving the original copy by providing access to the digital surrogate. With this new development, it has been universally recognized that digitization of libraries offer the opportunities of effective organization, storage, preservation, collaboration, interoperability, dissemination and greater access to information.</p> <p>The National Digital Library Programme (NDLP) provides remote access to unique collections of Americana held by the Library of Congress through Americanmemory. During the 1990s, the programme digitized materials from a wide variety of original sources, including pictorial and textual materials, audio, video, maps, atlases and sheet music. It was noted that the emphasis of the programme has been on enhancing access (Arms, 2000). Libraries such as the University of Oregon and University of Tennessee in the United States of American have digitized their libraries and allow access to their digital content by other libraries and institutions worldwide. The Image Services Centre of the University of Oregon for instance, was established in July 2002 to promote preservation and facilitate access to fragile materials. (www.dartmouth.edu/collab/facilities/digitallibrary.html)</p> <p>Several digitization initiatives have been going on in African countries in order to preserve and provide access to their local content on the Wide Area Network (WAN). It was on this platform that the Association of African Universities (AAU) funded the Database of African Theses and Dissertation (DATAD) project which aims at preserving African theses and dissertation in digital form and then providing electronic access to them. The project also aims at providing a database of citations and abstracts of the theses and dissertations and publishing them on the web; as well as providing CD-Rom services. Other digitization projects in Africa include the South African’s Bibliographic Network (SABINET), Ain Shams University Network (ASUNET) in Egypt, Digital Imaging Project in South Africa (DIPSA), African Virtual University (AVU) Library and so many others.</p> <p>The digital revolution offers Nigeria and other African countries the unique opportunity of actively participating in the world latest developmental revolution. (Ogunsola, 2005). As noted by Ochai (2007), some of the digital initiatives in Nigeria include: The Nigerian University library consortium which created the capacity for libraries to negotiate for reduced license for EBSCO host. This database contains about 8,000 academic journals in all fields. Also, the Nigerian virtual library initiative by the Nigerian Universities Commission which aims at bringing electronic information to Nigerian universities. Some Nigerian university libraries such as the University of Jos (UNIJOS), University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), University of Ibadan (UI), Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife, University of Port Harcourt (UNIPORT), Nnamdi Azikiwe University, (UNIZIK), Awka, Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO), etc have started digitization projects. Apparently, most African University libraries are digitizing their local contents and are at different levels facing various challenges of uploading their local content and cultural heritage on the internet in order to make a positive impact on the Global Information Infrastructure (GII). The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) indicated that surveys have shown that Africa generates only 0.4% of the global content (UNECA, 1999). In Nigeria, digitization project is still in its rudimentary stage and abysmally low; to some libraries, it is still a mirage. The result of the research carried out by Usman (2007) revealed that Nigerian universities are lagging behind in the pace of digitization of their question papers, theses and dissertations, mainly because the average Nigerian university libraries have not yet embaced the idea of electronic library in the digital age. It is against this background that this study is being conducted to assess the digitalization of local collection and its impact on sholarship four federal universities in the South-Eastern Zone of Nigeria.</p> <p>Statement of the Problem</p> <p>Over the years, libraries have been faced with the problems of space, accessibility and preservation of information materials. Various efforts are being made by university libraries in Nigeria to digitize their local contents such as projects, theses, dissertations, inaugural lectures, etc. This is as a result of the invaluable importance of library digitization such as speedy access, effective preservation of library local content collections, collaboration, improved library services, etc. The library materials if not digitized will hinder the library visibility, quick access to information resources and effective preservation of library local content collections. Unfortunately, most of these digitization initiatives have been at various stages facing different challenges.</p> <p>However, some Universities such as University of Jos (UNIJOS), Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife, University of Ibadan (UI), University of Port-Harcourt (UNIPORT), have embraced this laudable project, but are at various stages facing various challenges. Some studies have been carried out on related areas such as Usman (2007), Ugwu and Ekere (2010), but none of these works have covered the present digitalization of local collection and its impact on sholarship in federal university libraries in south-eastern zone of Nigeria. Notwithstanding all the efforts being made by different Nigerian university libraries towards digitization projects, it appears that very little progress has been made. These perceived problems could be attributed to a number of challenges. Knowledge of these challenges is essential for any university, whether federal, state or private to be aware of in the course of digitizing library local content collections. This shows that there is still a gap which needs to be filled in order to achieve effective digitization projects in Nigerian university libraries. Hence, the need for this study which is designed to assess the present digitalization of local collection and its impact on scholarship projects among federal university libraries in South-Eastern Zone of Nigeria.</p> <p>Purpose of the Study</p> <p>The general purpose of this study is to assess the digitalization of local collection and its impact on sholarship in federal university libraries in South-Eastern Zone of Nigeria. The specific objectives of this study are to:</p> <p>Ascertain the impact of digitizing the collection of local collections library materials in federal University libraries in South-Eastern Zone of Nigeria.</p> <p>Identify the facilities/resources employed in digitization of library materials.</p> <p>Ascertain the extent of digitization skills possessed by the library staff?</p> <p>Identify the type of resources being digitized in the libraries.</p> <p>Ascertain the extent of digitization in federal University Libraries.</p> <p>Identify the problems affecting the digitization of library local content collections.</p> <p>Identify the strategies for enhancing digitization in the libraries</p> <p>Research Questions</p> <p>This research is being conducted to find answers to the following research questions:</p> <p>What are the impact of digitizing library local collections?</p> <p>What are the available facilities/resources employed in digitization of library local content collections?</p> <p>What is the extent of digitization skills possessed by the library staff?</p> <p>What types of resources do libraries digitize?</p> <p>What is the extent of digitization of library local content collections in federal University Libraries?</p> <p>What are the problems affecting the digitization of library local content collections?</p> <p>What are the strategies for enhancing effective digitization project in university libraries in Nigeria?</p> <p>Significance of the Study</p> <p>The inherent values of digitization are the ability to preserve information resources and quick access to information in a digital format from local to remote areas for teaching, learning and research. In view of this, it is expected that the findings of this research work will be of benefit to the following groups of people: the library administrators, library system analysts and digital library management staff, the general library staff, library users and researchers.</p> <p>The findings of this study will help the library administration to adopt effective strategies that will help them enhance their digitization practices in libraries. On the other hand, the system analysts and the digital library management staff will also find this work useful. This is because, it is expected that the findings of this work will be useful in their programming, designs, and their formulation of strategies that could better enhance digitization.</p> <p>Moreover, the findings of this study will be useful to the entire library staff as it will help to reveal to them the extent of digitization project in their libraries.

Looking at the practice of today’s digital library portals we get the impression that the internet is almost non-existent in the academic resource discovery environment. What we find are online library catalogues, electronic journals and (sometimes) e-books, which are mainly digitally converted print materials that have traditionally been the focus of library acquisition policies. Also databases have been well known for a long time. Content is generally delivered through well-established service channels by publishers, book-houses or subscription agencies. The digitization of publishing and the advent of the World Wide Web have resulted in the proliferation of avast amount of content types and formats that include, but are not limited to, digitized collections, faculty and research groups’ websites, conference web servers, preprint/e-print servers and, increasingly, institutional repositories and archives, as well as a wide range of learning objects and courses.</p>                                                           \n\nADVANCES IN SEARCH ENGINE TECHNOLOGY AND THEIR IMPACTS ON LIBRARIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ADVANCES IN SEARCH ENGINE TECHNOLOGY AND THEIR IMPACTS ON LIBRARIES", "id": 65}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>How can a college or university best support the faculty in the process of rethinking courses and curricula to unleash the truly revolutionary potential for technology to enhance learning? This article presents four key strategies that have contributed to a growing campus culture at embrace the potential of technological tools to enable fundamental pedagogical changes. Specific examples of each strategy are provided and key success factors are identified.</p> <p>In recent years the potential of information technology to enhance teaching and learning has been demonstrated in virtually every subject matter discipline. At the same time, most faculty have become comfortable using word processing programs, e-mail, and the World Wide Web, and a wider range of user friendly software has become available. The 1998 National Survey of Desktop Computing and Information Technology in Higher Education revealed that the percentage of college classes using technology continues to increase, with 44.4 percent using e-mail and 36 percent using presentation handouts.1</p> <p>These fairly common uses of technology in the higher education classroom, however, still do not capitalize on the real power of technology to make available real-world situations, aid visualization, facilitate collaborative activity among students, support analysis and synthesis of information, simulate complex environments, and provide continual feedback.2 These “deeper” uses of technology require conceptualizing the teaching and learning process in a different way and envisioning new instructional approaches that might assist students in attaining course goals.</p> <p>Educational research reveals that new knowledge grows out of the process of relating new ideas to what we already know and exploring the interrelationships among ideas; new knowledge is not transmitted but is created by the learner. Also, knowledge is constructed by learners as they attempt to make sense out of their experiences and test their own understanding against that of others, notably those of teachers or more advanced peers.3 Technology can enhance learning by fostering the active processing and application of new ideas and by providing opportunities for students to engage in dialogue about ideas with their peers outside of class time.</p> <p>One of the obstacles to integrating technology into our courses in ways that maximize the impact on student learning is the tendency to look at technology as a way of enhancing our current instructional approaches rather than starting from the “ground up.” Instead, we need to look back to our fundamental student learning goals for a specific course and brainstorm ways to assist students to reach these goals, keeping in mind that active involvement and dialogue about ideas are powerful catalysts for learning. Most faculty members find this kind of thinking energizing since their primary interest is in teaching and learning rather than technology. The question is, “How can a college or university best support this process of rethinking courses and curricula to unleash the truly revolutionary potential for technology to enhance learning?”</p> <p>Certainly, adequate technology and support of its use is a necessary condition for success. No individual faculty member, department, or campus will be able to fully realize the potential of educational technology to enhance teaching and learning without a robust information technology infrastructure. Faculty access to hardware and software for development and use of educational applications, student access to PCs and the Internet both on and off campus, multimedia-capable classrooms with Internet access, training, and technical support are essential. However, these elements are not sufficient to create the desired revolution in teaching and learning.</p> <p>Jane Marcus of Information Technology Systems and Services at Stanford University provides a very useful conceptualization of the factors affecting individual adoption of technology. In Marcusï¿½s model, adoption is a function of available resources, the perceived value of the innovation, and communication with other adopters. Her dissertation research provides empirical evidence in support of the model, indicating that social/contextual variables are as important as resources in encouraging adoption of technology.4</p> <p>Subsequent research at also highlighted the importance of these factors. Faculty members on that campus were surveyed to identify factors that might influence the use of new instructional technologies. The most important factor identified was the need to be certain that technology would enhance student learning. Other important social/contextual factors were compatibility with the subject matter, advantages over traditional instruction, increased student interest, information on materials in the discipline, compatibility with existing course materials, and support from higher administration, chairpersons, and deans. Faculty were also asked to rate the importance of various incentives to use technology. Not surprisingly, released time, student and clerical support, and stipends were important incentives. In addition, however, faculty noted the importance of knowing that their efforts would contribute to promotion and tenure and would be recognized by the university community.</p> <p>Four Key Strategies to Help Faculty Rethink Pedagogy Using Technology</p> <p>This kind of research on learning and on adoption of technology can inform the design of campus programs to support faculty in rethinking pedagogy and using technology in ways that make a significant impact on student learning. For the past nine years, Duquesne University has been developing a comprehensive, campuswide program to reach this goal. The following sections describe four key strategies of Duquesneï¿½s program and the principles that underlie them, providing examples of ways the strategies have been implemented at Duquesne.</p> <p>Encourage faculty to learn about the successful use of educational technology by colleagues at their university and by colleagues within their discipline around the globe.</p> <p>Creating opportunities for faculty to learn about successful uses of educational technology on their own campus facilitates communication with adopters (a social variable identified by Marcus as important in promoting adoption of technology). Faculty can discuss the impact of technology on student learning and motivation, the amount of work required to develop and implement applications, and the perceived value. Faculty are often able to make the conceptual leap required to see how a colleagueï¿½s use of technology might apply in their own discipline (for example, a historian might easily envision how a philosopher colleagueï¿½s use of computer conferencing might be adapted). Clearly, however, there are disciplinary differences that make it difficult to see how particular uses of technology could be transferred (for example, a chemist might doubt that the philosopher colleagueï¿½s use of computer conferencing would be useful in learning physical chemistry). For this reason, it is quite helpful to create opportunities for faculty to learn about technology use by colleagues within their discipline at other institutions (for example, the chemist might easily be persuaded that a symbolic and numerical software program such as Mathcad would enhance learning in physical chemistry).</p> <p>During the past nine years, Duquesneï¿½s computing center and faculty development center have partnered to provide a wealth of opportunities for faculty to learn about the ways in which colleagues at Duquesne and elsewhere have used technology to improve student learning:</p> <p>Teaching with Technology Fairs. Five or six faculty members who are successfully using technology are asked to present at each fair. The goal is to have presenters from various disciplines, a wide range of educational uses, and projects representing various levels of sophistication. The format is similar to a poster session, with each presenter at a workstation demonstrating his or her work. Faculty who attend are free to converse with each presenter as long as they wish. Questions are often raised about the length of time needed to develop an application, the effect on student learning and motivation, and the amount of skill required.</p> <p>Lunch Bytes. These brown bag lunch sessions often feature individual faculty who have used technology in effective ways, ranging from visualization of earthquakes in geology to student projects requiring use of import/export rate databases in global economics to virtual cooperative learning groups and electronic portfolios in occupational therapy. Each of these sessions attracts a diverse group of faculty who are often able to see how the ideas presented might apply in their own discipline.</p> <p>Live Teleconferences. These satellite downlink programs, obtained from vendors enable Duquesne faculty to be aware of cutting-edge uses of educational technology. Immediately following such a downlink, participants discuss possible application of ideas presented during the program within the Duquesne University environment. Computing center and faculty development center staff serve as resources for this discussion.</p> <p>Teaching Workshops. The faculty development center regularly offers workshops on a wide range of topics such as critical thinking, cooperative learning, and problem-based learning. Whenever appropriate, the content of these workshops includes ways in which technology might be used to reach the desired instructional goal. For example, structured, threaded discussion can stimulate critical thinking; cooperative learning groups meeting via computer conferencing can transcend the bounds of time and space imposed by the traditional face-to-face classroom; and information garnered from online resources and dialogue among class members may facilitate problem solving. In addition to these workshops on general pedagogical topics that include ideas for using technology, occasional workshops explicitly focus on technology-enhanced pedagogy. An example of this was the workshop, “Teaching Online Using Computer Conferencing Software,” offered in the fall of 1996 by the first faculty member at Duquesne to teach a totally online course. In this workshop, she described her use of discussion, case studies, and small group work and showed evidence indicating that students had attained the goals of the course.</p> <p>Stimulate individual faculty and departments to think about their learning goals for students and how technology might be used to help students attain these goals.</p> <p>As noted earlier, the most common uses of technology such as e-mail and presentation software tend to be “add-ons” to current pedagogy and do not capitalize on the real power of technology to revolutionize the teaching/learning process. Encouraging faculty to identify their basic goals for a course, on the other hand, frees them to think more creatively. What do they wish students to be able to do at the end of the course? What are the “bottlenecks” (critical concepts that many students fail to master) in a particular course? What kind of experiences and assignments will help students to master course goals? These kinds of questions provide the basis for considering alternative, technology-based approaches to facilitating student attainment of course goals–perhaps drill-and-practice tutorials for basic skills, computer conferencing to develop critical thinking, or multimedia to enhance visualization of important concepts. Likewise, an academic department might consider its overall goals for graduates of its programs and how technology could be integrated into courses to ensure that students do, in fact, reach those goals. For example, students in journalism might need to develop skills in carrying out online research, evaluating credibility of sources, and creating Web pages. In what courses will these skills be developed and how will these competencies be verified?</p> <p>Duquesne University encourages this “ground up” rethinking of courses and possible uses of technology on the part of individual faculty as well as by schools and departments. When schools and departments pursue such thinking, there is the potential for significant curricular reform. What follows are a few ways that Duquesne has fostered rethinking of pedagogy.</p> <p>Schoolwide Integration of Technology into the Curriculum. Duquesne’s School of Music made a commitment to integrate the K-12 National Standards for Arts Education into the School of Music curriculum and to extend those standards to the collegiate level. The guidelines accompanying the standards indicate that “the curriculum should utilize current technology to individualize and expand music learning… However, technology should not be used for its own sake, but in order to achieve the goals of music education.”6 Accordingly, the School of Music has examined its courses, noting the goals and content of each course and the technologies that could be used to increase attainment of learning goals. A theory course, for example, does not inherently require the use of technology, but student learning might be enhanced by use of a synthesizer module, music notation software, and computer-assisted instruction to develop ear-training skills. Strategic use of technology throughout the school provided a focus for relevant faculty development opportunities and led to the creation of a required freshman course, “Computers for Musicians,” to familiarize students with the technology they would use in later courses.</p> <p>Online Course on Online Teaching and Learning. During the fall semester of 1998, Duquesne pilot tested a course on online teaching and learning. Seventeen faculty and administrators took part, with all coursework being carried out online using FirstClass computer conferencing software. This approach enabled faculty to experience the role of learner while, at the same time, reflecting on the teaching/learning process and designing their own course. In addition to reading the text,7 participants read “lectures” by the instructor as well as articles on the Web. They posted responses to questions such as: “What do you see as the role that you are likely to take as an online instructor?” “Do you see this as different from the role of an effective face-to-face teacher? Explain.” “What do you think will change for you in your teaching in the online environment?” Another assignment listed many instructional strategies that could be used in the online environment (for example, small group discussion, collaborative learning, problem-based learning, case studies, simulation, and project-based learning) and asked participants to identify ways they might be able to implement these strategies in one of their courses using technology. A separate “metacognition” conference provided a virtual class space within which participants could reflect on their own experience as learners. They might, for example, have noted how difficult it is to synthesize the comments of the 16 other participants or have speculated on why the degree of social interaction increased or decreased depending on the topic and the assignment.8</p> <p>Summer Institute on Teaching with Technology. For the past four summers Duquesne has offered a summer institute for faculty. Participation is competitive, based on applications that describe a project that the faculty member would like to undertake, using technology to enhance some aspect of student learning in one of his or her courses. Faculty who complete the five-day institute receive a $1,000 stipend for their participation and commit to demonstrating their work within their own school and also in a university-wide venue. During the first day of the institute, there is a session on instructional design and an overview of available technologies. As a result of these sessions, a high percentage of faculty change their instructional strategy, choice of technology, or both. What is important is that faculty come to the institute having identified their instructional goal; institute instructors can then assist faculty in clarifying the best means for reaching that goal.</p>                                                          \n\nCOMMON CULTURE CREATED/SUPPORTED/ENHANCED BY THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY ON CAMPUS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMMON CULTURE CREATED/SUPPORTED/ENHANCED BY THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY ON CAMPUS", "id": 66}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Abstract</p> <p>Major traditional libraries particularly the academic libraries turned to electronic or digital libraries and offered information services without boundaries.

In this context can we presume the argument that “better library and laboratory facilitate better education”? Of late the argument was modified as “better access to resources and well informed users are life long learners” and hence creates good academic environment.

In Thailand, information infrastructure is created as national infrastructure, optimized and deployed at university level to support all type of functional needs. The</p> <p>selection and deployment of infrastructure at enterprise level or the desktop applications is guided by requirements, standards, and recommendations of standard development organizations and accepted</p> <p>Development of Technology Infrastructure The major development of Information technology infrastructure in Thailand was started by the government in the year 1992 through National Information Technology Committee (NITC), with the mandate of planning, facilitating, and monitoring the implementation. The committee comprised of 22 members from leading public and private agencies chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of economic and social development. National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC), a government statutory agency under the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, was</p> <p>recognized as the secretariat of the committee. Major activities covered were human resource development, utilization of IT</p> <p>in public sector, research and development promotion, legal infrastructure, public awareness programme, software industry promotion, and electronic commerce. As computer networks were becoming more and more crucial to the development of science and technology, the Thai Social, Scientific, Academic and Research Network (ThaiSARN) was established in 1992 to meet the demand for new ways of learning and research activities. ThaiSARN was totally funded by the Thai government since its inception, and was successful in binging more than 50 sites of government agencies, national universities, their libraries and colleges all over Thailand and thus built a good foundation in information exchange for inter-organization as well as intra-organization communications including cross- database access for the participating parties.</p>                                                           \n\n ACQUISITION AND DEPLOYMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE LIBRARY ENVIRONMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  ACQUISITION AND DEPLOYMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE LIBRARY ENVIRONMENT", "id": 67}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Introduction</p> <p>Libraries in general and public libraries in particular, play an important role in all aspects of societal development especially when viewed against its users, which consist of all categories of people in the society. Public library has been defined variously. Many see it as a place built for the collection of books and other printed resources and the personnel to provide and interpret such resources as required to meet the information, research, educational, recreational, cultural and aesthetic needs of the varied users and it is usually financed with public funds. In line with the above, Gates (1976) defined a public library as “that authorized by law, supported from general public funds or special taxes voted for the purpose of administration, for the benefit of the citizens of the country, town, city or region which maintains it on the basis of equal access to all.” The idea of a public library system in Northern Nigeria started in the late 1940s with the Native Authority (N.A.) Reading Rooms. Prior to this period however, a collection of Islamic scriptures and manuscripts can be found with individual clerics scattered across the Region especially in Sokoto, Borno and Kano which are regarded as centers of commerce and Islamic civilization as a result of their contact with the Arab world through the Trans-Saharan Trade Routes. (Aguolu 1984). These “libraries” lacked all that can be said of a public library in terms of policies, organization, personnel and services.</p> <p>The first significant attention to public library was the commissioning of a study on library services in the region in 1963, by the government of the Northern Region under the distinguished leadership of the late Premier, Sir Ahmadu Bello. The study was conducted by F. A. Sharr under the Special Commonwealth African Assistance Plan and the report popularly known in the</p> <p>Nigerian Library Literature as “The Sharr Report”, praised the “foresight of the Government in seeking, at this early state to rationalize the development of all</p> <p>types of libraries and to avoid the waste and inefficiency which follows from uncoordinated endeavor” (Sharr 1963). Following his recommendation, there was a review of the existing structures and Public Library system evolved. The first functional Public Library was the Kaduna Lending Library which also doubled as the Regional Reference Library. The Library system was organized under a Director and was departmentalized according to the various functions in the Library. While a public library system is gradually taking shape, a major political shake-up of the Northern Region took place in 1967. The once famous “giant North” was broken into six (6) states. This development led to decentralization of the Regional Library System and consequently, the former Regional Library Headquarter in Kaduna had to split its resources and assets equally among the new States. Another milestone in the history of Library Development in Northern Nigeria was the commissioning of yet another study by Rober.</p>                                                           \n\nASSESSING THE IMPACT OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES ON THE LITERACY LEVEL OF NIGERIANS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES ON THE LITERACY LEVEL OF NIGERIANS", "id": 68}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE*</p> <p>*INTRODUCTION*</p> <p>With the invention of Information and Communication Technology, libraries now use various types of technologies to aid the services they render. Everyday new technological advances affect the way information is handled in libraries and information centers. The impacts of new technologies are felt by libraries in every aspect. Computing technology, communication technology and mass storagetechnology are some of the areas of continuous development that reshape the way that libraries access, retrieve, store, manipulate and disseminate information to users. The academic library has been from its inception an integral part of institutions of higher learning, rather than an appendix or adjunct.</p> <p>Oyedun (2007) defines academic libraries as those libraries that are mainly found in tertiary institutions, they are established to support learning, teaching and research processes. Over the past twenty seven years, academic libraries have been affected by changes in information and communication technology. The rate of changes is still accelerating in this area. The introduction of various information technology (ICT) trends has lead to reorganization, change in work patterns, and demand for new skills, job retraining and reclassification positions. Technological advancement of the past twenty five years, such as the electronic database, online services, CD-ROMs and introduction of internet has radically transformed access to information. Rana (2009) opines that ICT holds the key to the success of modernizing information services. Applications of ICT are numerous but mainly it is used in converting the existing paper-print records in the entire process of storage, retrieval and dissemination.</p> <p>ICT has impacted on every sphere of academic library activity especially in the form of the library collection development strategies, library building and consortia. ICT presents an opportunity to provide value-added information services and access to a wide variety of digital based information resources to their clients. Furthermore, academic libraries are also using modern ICTs to automate their core functions, implement efficient and effective library cooperation and resource sharing networks, implement management information systems, develop institutional repositories of digital local contents, and digital libraries: and initiate ICT based capacity building programmes for library users.</p> <p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has brought unprecedented changes and transformation to academic library and information services, conventional LIS such as OPAC, users services, reference services, bibliographic services, current awareness services, Document delivery, interlibrary loan, Audio visual services and customer relations can be provided more efficiently and effectively using ICT, as they offer convenient time, place, cost effectiveness, faster and most-up-to-date dissemination and end users involvement in the library and information services process. The impact of ICT characterized on information services by changes in format, contents and method of production and contents and method of production and delivery of information products. Emergence of internet as the largest repository of information and knowledge, changed role of library and information science professionals from intermediary to facilitator, new tools for dissemination of information and shift from physical to virtual services environment and extinction of some conventional information services and emergence of new and innovational web based.</p>                                                           \n\nTHE IMPACT OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY ON NIGERIAN PUBLIC ACADEMIC LIBRARIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY ON NIGERIAN PUBLIC ACADEMIC LIBRARIES", "id": 69}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>INTRODUCTION*</p> <p>Problems Of Acquisition Of Material And Services To Users In Special Libraries In Nigeria�</p> <p>You are reading project material titled: Problems Of Acquisition Of Material And Services To Users In Special Libraries In Nigeria</p> <p>Title Page<br/> Certification Page<br/> Dedication<br/> Acknowledgment<br/> Abstract<br/> Table Of Content</p> <p><strong><em>Chapter One</em></strong><strong><em><br/><strong>1.0 Introduction/ Background� </strong></em></strong><br/> 1.1 Statement� Of The Problem<br/> 1.2 Significance Of The Study<br/> 1.3 Objective Of The Study<br/> 1.4 Scope Of The Study</p> <p><strong><em>Chapter Two</em></strong><strong><em><br/><strong>2.0 Literature Review</strong></em></strong></p> <p>Chapter Three<br/> 3.0 Methodology</p> <p>Chapter Four<br/> 4.0 Findings And Discussion</p> <p>Chapter Five<br/> 5.0 Summary And Recommendations<br/> Bibliography<br/> Appendix<br/> Questionnaires</p>                                                           \n\nTHE CHALLENGES OF ACQUISITION OF LIBRARY MATERIAL AND SERVICES TO USERS IN SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE CHALLENGES OF ACQUISITION OF LIBRARY MATERIAL AND SERVICES TO USERS IN SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA", "id": 70}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The public library is a social institution which is tied to the political and social realities of the communities, where it is situated.

Libraries are very record-intensive: Not only is each title different but, for many purposes, the records needed for library operations must necessarily be concerned with individual copies of each title. A circulation system must know precisely which copy of which volume of which edition of which title was borrowed by precisely which borrower and when it is due back. Attributing the loan to some other borrower will not do; nor will substituting the return of some other document, even by the same borrower, be acceptable as a discharge of the loan. Acquisition records need to show precisely how many</p> <p>copies of a given work were ordered from which bookseller and which, if any, have so far been received. A library not knowing which titles it already has (and in how many copies) could not function efficiently. Serials records contain minute details of copies of issues, indexes, binding, and invoices in order to assure that each set is complete and properly acquired, bound, and paid for. Library records, then, must be specific to individual copies. In general it is desirable that library record-keeping be automated for three reasons:</p> <p>1. Much of the work involves the accurate updating of records in files. The tasks involved are generally tedious, repetitive, mechanical in nature, and lend themselves to computerization, even though the records may be complex and arranged in complicated ways.</p> <p>2. Automation is likely to improve cost-effective performance by increasing accuracy, by reducing the rate of increase in costs in labor-intensive activities, and by increasing effectiveness. It should become possible to do some tasks more thoroughly than levels of staffing</p> <p>usually permit with manual procedures, such as the regular claiming of unsupplied issues of periodicals, or by doing things that cannot in practice be done in paper files, notably searching for combinations of characteristics.</p>                                                           \n\nIMPACT OF AUTOMATION OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF AUTOMATION OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES", "id": 72}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Abstract</p> <p>Strategies For Combating Book Theft And Vandalism In Academic Libraries </p> <p>Chapter One</p> <p>1.0 Introduction </p> <p>1.1 Assumption/Background Of The Study</p> <p>1.2 Statement Of Problem</p> <p>1.3 Objective Of The Study</p> <p>1.4 Research Question</p> <p>1.5 Scope Of The Study</p> <p>Chapter Two</p> <p>2.0 Literature Review </p> <p>2.1 Vandalism And Mutilation</p> <p>2.2 Causes Of Vandalism</p> <p>2.3 Protection Of Library Resources</p> <p>2.4 Summary</p> <p>Chapter Three</p> <p>3.0 Research Methodology </p> <p>3.1 Data Collection Instrument</p> <p>3.2 Population Of The Study</p> <p>3.3 Method Of Data Collection</p> <p>3.4 Method Of Data Analysis</p> <p>Chapter Four</p> <p>4.0 Data Presentation And Analysis </p> <p>4.1 Problem Of Vandalism In Academic Library</p> <p>4.2 Magnitude Of Vandal Problems</p> <p>Chapter Five</p> <p>5.0 Summary Of Findings, Conclusion And Recommendation </p> <p>5.1 Summary And Finding</p> <p>5.2 Recommendation</p> <p>5.3 Conclusion</p> <p>Bibliography</p> <p>Appendix</p> <p>Questionnaire</p>                                                          \n\nA COMPARATIVE STUDY ON STRATEGIES FOR COMBATING BOOK THEFT IN PUBLIC ACADEMIC LIBRARIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A COMPARATIVE STUDY ON STRATEGIES FOR COMBATING BOOK THEFT IN PUBLIC ACADEMIC LIBRARIES", "id": 73}]
