Depending on which discipline you address, the owner, the designer or the contractor there will be a common understanding surrounded by varied conclusions, \"a mistake.\" From the basic definitions of \"design\" and \"error\" we conclude that a design error is a deviation from a drawing or specification, also including omissions and ambiguities. It is the seriousness of this error that must be considered to determine its consequences on the overall outcome of the project One of the most important challenges facing management today is controlling the all too frequent cost and schedule overruns that effect the construction industry (Diekmann and Thrush, 1986). One of the major issues to control growth in project costs and time is the reduction of design errors.<br/>The owner, designer and contractor all have different interests in, or uses for the design of a facility. But what they do share is the commitment to complete the project safely and within a given budget and completion time. There are many initiatives being conducted to control the growth of cost and schedule within the construction industry.<br/>The major issue is \"accuracy of the drawings,\" or the number of design errors, omissions and ambiguities within the plans and specifications that affect the quality of the facility. Inadequacies in the plans and specifications are the major causes of changes to the contract So much emphasis is placed on the issue of time and cost that quality takes a back seat The quality of the project depends on the conformance of the objectives and requirements from the owner. An informative quality management technique will provide an agreement to procedures and definitions among the principle parties for the project. Since design errors have an impact on the outcome of the effectiveness of the contractor's effort on the project it is essential that all parties determine what the definition of a design error should be. When asked to define design error, not all disciplines in the construction process agree on a common definition. From the basic definition of design and error it can be determined that a design error is a deviation from a drawing or specification. It is the seriousness of this error that must be considered to determine its consequences on the overall outcome of the project</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>Design errors indicate the total design in-effectiveness of a project. Major design quality problems occur during construction when errors, omissions and ambiguities in plans and specifications become evident (Davis and Ledbetter, 1987). This statement directs that the inadequacies in the plans and specifications are the major causes of changes to the contract. There have been extreme examples of design errors such as numerous building collapse in Nigeria - projects that have wrought disaster after the construction are completed. These are examples of design errors that escaped the close scrutiny of all parties. One or two major errors that can be corrected with only cost considerations and little effect on the schedule can impact projects. The projects that really suffer are those with many small errors (design, rework or change of scope) which when finally added up cause major impacts on the cost and schedule growth. Through Davis and Ledbetters research it was determined that \"accuracy of the design documents\" was the most critical of the criteria used in the initial evaluation of design effectiveness. This accuracy was further described as the concern for the frequency and impact of errors in the specifications and drawings. This is due to the fact that the drawings and specifications are the most \"readily identifiable outputs of the design process.\" It is evermore important that the quality control of designs be addressed during the planning phase and closely monitored during the construction phase.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The main aim of the study is to investigate how design errors can affect the initial cost of a project. The specific objectives are:</p> <div> <ul><li>To determine what constitutes a design error.</li> <li>To examine the contributing factors to design errors in Nigeria.</li> <li>To examine how these factors can affect initial cost and growth of a project.</li> </ul><p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <ul><li>What makes or contributes to a design error?</li> <li>What are the factors that lead to design errors?</li> <li>What effect can design errors have on initial cost and growth of a project?</li> </ul></div> <p><strong>1.5 HYPOTHESIS FORMULATION</strong><br/>Hi: There is no significant relationship between design error and initial project cost.<br/>Ho: There is significant relationship between design error and initial project cost.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study gives a clear insight into the various ways in which contractors in the construction companies in Nigeria can maximise profits and reduce initial cost through effective and efficient contract planning and management. The study also gives a clear insight into the various effects of design errors on the cost of a project. The findings and recommendations of the researcher will help in building a strong and better project management guideline for contractors in Nigeria.<br/><br/><strong>1.7 SCOPE OF STUDY</strong><br/>This research focuses mainly on the investigation of design errors on initial cost of a project. Results and recommendations may not be used to generalise other construction companies in Nigeria, as the researcher could not cover a wider scope due to financial and time constraints.<br/>Based on the findings of this study other possible researchable areas may include studies on the various effects of other aspects of contracts such as contract laws in Nigeria and contract management and control.</p> <p><strong>1.8 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The only limitation faced by the researcher in the course of carrying out this study was the delay in getting data from the various respondents. Most respondents were reluctant in filling questionnaires administered to them due to their busy schedules and nature of their work. The researcher found it difficult to collect responses from the various respondents, and this almost hampered the success of this study.</p> <p><strong>1.9 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <div> <ul><li><strong>Design</strong>: The basic definition of design, according to Webster, is \"the making of drawings or plans to plan and fashion the form and structure of an object to have intentions or purposes.\" The quality of planning and design is one of the primary factors of success in any project endeavor (Chalabi, Beaudin and Salazar, 1987). The design includes every aspect of the facility construction including operation and maintenance. The design incorporates a set of specifications to guide the contractor in developing his means and methods of construction. Figure 2-1 shows the traditional flow diagram of a design/construction method.</li> <li><strong>Error</strong>: An error is defined, according to Webster, as \"a deviation from accuracy or correctness; a mistake, as in action or procedure; an inaccuracy, as in speaking or writing.\" There are basically three types of errors: imperfections, non-conformance and omissions. Imperfections are deviations in details that have no affect on the assembly or facility (Davis and Ledbetter, 1987).</li> <li><strong>Design Error</strong>: From the evaluation above a simple definition of design error is \"a deviation from the plans and specifications.\" It is not the intention of this definition to include any cost or schedule growth or insinuate its root causes or legal responsibility. It is the responsibility of the owner, designer and contractor to establish the criteria in order to make a reasonable determination for responsibility. The survey shows a common theme, that of a mistake or error in the design. The survey also indicates several reasons why design errors exist and who cause them. This provides evidence that there is not a concise definition within the construction industry.</li> <li><strong>Contract:  </strong>Erikson (2002) defined Contract as an agreement that creates an obligation binding upon the parties thereto. The essentials of a contract are as follows: (1) mutual assent; (2) a legal consideration, which in most instances need not be pecuniary; (3) parties who have legal capacity to make a contract; (4) absence of fraud or duress; and (5) a subject matter that is not illegal or against public policy.</li> <li><strong>Contract Planning: </strong>According to Simmons (2007),Contract planning is the process of systematically and efficiently managing contract creation, execution and analysis for maximising operational and financial performance and minimising risk.</li> <li><strong>Contractor: </strong>General contractor, organization or individual that contracts with another organization or individual (the owner) for the construction of a building, road or other facility.</li> <li><strong>Profit:  </strong>Tucy (2008) defined profit as the difference between the purchase price and the costs of bringing to market</li> <li><strong>Initial Cost: Initial costs</strong> are fixed, one-time expenses incurred on the purchase of land, buildings, construction, and equipment used in the production of goods or in the rendering of services. Put simply, it is the total cost needed to bring a project to a commercially operable status. Whether a particular cost is capital or not depend on many factors such as accounting, tax laws, and materiality.</li> </ul></div>\n\nAN INVESTIGATION INTO DESIGN ERRORS AND IT'S IMPACT ON INITIAL COST OF A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN INVESTIGATION INTO DESIGN ERRORS AND IT'S IMPACT ON INITIAL COST OF A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT", "id": 3}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>It is a known fact that the Nigerian construction industry continues to occupy an important position in the nation's economy even though it contributes less than the manufacturing or other service industries, (Aibinu and Jagboro, 2002). The contribution of the construction industry to national economic growth necessitates improved efficiency in the industry by means of cost effectiveness and timeliness, and would certainly contribute to cost savings for the country as a whole. It is also common knowledge that the implementation of the construction project in the industry is usually accompanied with time delay and cost increase as well as owner dissatisfaction (Hafez, 2001).</p> <p>In general most (if not all), construction projects experience time delays and cost overruns during their implementation phase (Koushki and Kartam,2004). Numerous researchers, both in the developed and developing nations have also examined and identified the causes of time and cost overrun in the construction industry. Mansfield, Ugwu and Doran (1994), for example performed a comprehensive analysis of most important factors responsible for project delays and cost overrun in Nigerian construction projects. This analysis indicated poor contract management, financing and payment of completed works, change in site conditions, shortages of materials, design changes, subcontractors and nominated suppliers, other factors were price fluctuation inaccurate estimates, delays and additional works as factors responsible for project delays and cost overrun.</p> <p>A comprehensive classification of causes of construction delays has also been determined by Henesy (1993). The classification system included materials, labour, equipment and financial constraints, as the main contributory variable to causes of construction time overrun. The list of major factors causing construction delay in Thailand by Ogunlana and Proumkunting (1996) included the inadequacy of resources supplies, client and consultant shortcomings and incompetence. Koushki and Kartan (2004) studied the impact of construction materials on project time and cost in Kuwait and identified the project related variable affecting the on time delivery of materials as material selection, time, type of materials and their availability in the local market.<br/>Time impacts are inevitable on construction projects, primarily because of the uniqueness of each project and the limited resources of time and money that can be spent on planning, executing and delivering the project. <br/>Time factors are inherent in all of project construction's undertakings. Construction projects have long been recognized as particularly cost, time and risk-laden. Some of the time and cost factors associated with the construction process are fairly predictable or identifiable; others may be totally unforeseen. The constructed project may not perform as anticipated because the owner may have unrealistic expectations regarding the delivery time of construction forcing contractors into unrealistic gambles, corner-cutting or commitments that may not be realistic (Frimpong 2003). <br/>Project success can be defined as meeting goals and objectives as prescribed in the project plan. A successful project means that the project has accomplished its technical performance, maintained its schedule, and remained within budgetary costs. Project management tools and techniques play an important role in the effective management of a project. Therefore, a good project management lies in the management tools and techniques used to manage the project. Project management involves managing the resources\"”workers, machines, money, materials and methods used. Some projects are effectively and efficiently managed while others are mismanaged, incurring much delay and cost overruns and negatively affecting the economy (Frimpong 2003). <br/>Assessing construction projects' delivery time is critical in today's market-driven economy.</p> <p><strong>1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong><br/>Construction can be considered as a dynamic industry which is constantly facing uncertainties. These uncertainties and the many stakeholders in these kinds of projects, make the management of costs difficult which consequently causes cost overruns. Therefore, cost overruns are considered one of the most critical issues during the execution of construction projects (Chan<em>, et al.</em>, 2004; Doloi, 2011). <br/>As mentioned by Van Der Westhuizen and Fitzgerald (2005), the presence of cost overruns can be a reason for project delays or possible project failures. However this idea has been refuted by many authors who considered that project success depends on many other factors that should be assessed to conclude the success or failure of a project (Chan<em>, et al.</em>, 2004). Moreover, there have been many studies that suggest that the success of a project depends on the presence of certain critical factors which can also change depending on the objective to be met (Iyer and Jha, 2005). In other words, some authors ascertained that there are some critical success factors that help to improve cost performance and prevent cost overruns.<br/><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The main aim of the study is to examine various cost control techniques used in construction projects and the impact they have on project delivery. Specific objectives of the study are:</p> <div> <ul><li>To identify cost control technique frequently used by contractors in construction projects.</li> <li>To examine problems encountered by contractors in managing construction project cost.</li> <li>To determine the impact of costcontrol techniques on the duration of construction projects.</li> </ul></div> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>In-order to guide the study and achieve the above stated research objectives; the following research questions were formulated:</p> <div> <ul><li>What cost control techniques are frequently used by contractors in construction projects?</li> <li>What are the problems faced by contractors in controlling cost in the construction project process?</li> <li>What impact does cost controlling techniques have on the duration of construction projects?<ul><li><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Ho:</strong> Cost control problems lead to project delivery failures.</li> </ul></div> <p><strong>       Hi:</strong> Cost control problems do not lead to project delivery <br/>failures.</p> <div> <ul><li><strong>Ho: </strong>Cost Control techniques lead to construction delivery failures</li> </ul></div> <p><strong>        Hi: </strong>Cost Control techniques do not lead to construction <br/>delivery failures</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study will be of importance to building professionals and the general public because it would not only clarify but also create awareness of the extent to which inadequacies in cost control techniques can adversely affect project performance. The study will also help contractors, clients, consultants and all parties involved in construction projects about ways of improving their current method of cost management and control. <br/>The study will also be of great benefit for other student researchers' who may want to venture into the same subject matter. Having gotten results-both empirically and theoretically, the study will serve as a foundation for future research studies.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The study will cover some selected quantity surveyors from Owerri. All findings and recommendations from the study may not reflect the true view of the traditional roles and changing roles of quantity surveyors as the researcher could not cover a wider area due to financial and time constraints.</p> <p><strong>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <div> <ul><li><strong>Construction:</strong> In the fields of architecture and civil engineering, construction is a process that consists of the building or assembling of infrastructure. Far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking. Normally, the job is managed by a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.</li> </ul><ul><li><strong>Deliverable</strong>: Deliverable is a term used in project management to describe a tangible or intangible object produced as a result of the project that is intended to be delivered to a customer (either internal or external). A deliverable could be a report, a document, a server upgrade or any other building block of an overall project.</li> <li><strong>Project management:</strong> this is the discipline of planning, organizing, motivating, and controlling resources to achieve specific goals. A project is a temporary endeavour with a defined beginning and end (usually time-constrained, and often constrained by funding or deliverables), undertaken to meet unique goals and objectives, typically to bring about beneficial change or added value.</li> <li><strong>Time: </strong>This is a dimension in which events can be ordered from the past through the presentinto the future, and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them.</li> <li><strong>Cost</strong>: A cost is the value of money that has been used up to produce something, and hence is not available for use anymore. In business, the cost may be one of acquisition, in which case the amount of money expended to acquire it is counted as cost.</li> <li><strong>Cost overrun</strong>: occurs when the final cost of the project exceeds the original contract value at the time of completion.</li> <li><strong>Good cost performance project: </strong>Project in which the cost overrun of the project does not exceed 10 percent of the initial budget.</li> <li><strong>Poor cost performance project: </strong>Project in which the cost overrun of the project exceeds 10 percent of the initial budget.</li> </ul></div> <p><strong>REFERENCES</strong><br/>Aibinu A.A and Jagboro G.O (2002): <em>\"The Effects of Construction </em><br/><em>Delays on Projects Delivery in Nigeria Construction Industry\".</em> International Journal of Project Management, 20, 593-599.<br/>Chan, A.P.C., Scott, D. and Chan, A.P.L.

The research work is to investigate into current cost estimation practices of contractors in Akwa Ibom state. The objectives were to identify the techniques used in cost estimating by the construction contractors, identify the causes of inaccuracy in construction contractors cost estimates and determine cost estimating risks influencing construction project estimates. Relevant literature on current cost estimating practices of construction contractors were reviewed and an exploratory field survey was undertaken to examine the objectives of the study. A total of 159 questionnaires were distributed to construction contractors, of which 127 completed questionnaires were returned, representing a 81.41% response rate. The data obtained from field survey was analysed using mean item score. The study shows that group decision making, expert judgment and reserve analysis are the most frequently used technique of construction cost estimating employed by contractor. The major causes of inaccuracy in cost estimating are unforeseen change in prices of materials, Lack of experience on similar project and instability of market condition. The result also shows that the major risk factors in construction cost estimating include variations in labour productivity data, estimator’s deficiency and error in design and specification. The study recommends that construction contractors and estimators should ensure that a frequent market survey are done for material and labour before estimating is done.</p>\n\nA SURVEY OF COST ESTIMATING PRACTICES OF CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A SURVEY OF COST ESTIMATING PRACTICES OF CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS ", "id": 6}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>The construction industry is an established industry: the sector regarded as a catalyst for growth while its performance serves as a nation's economy (Aibinu, &amp; Jagboro, 2002). It comprises of building, civil and engineering works. Oliver (2005) affirm the industry to be a prime motivator of any economy, while in Akwa Ibom State, it represents sixty (60) percent of the capital investment.</p> <p>According to Esty (2004) there has been a new wave of global interest in project finance as a tool for economic investment. Project financing is not a new financing method. It has been used to finance industrial projects such as mines, pipelines, power stations and oil fields (Finnerty1996; Esty, 2004). In today's low-yield environment, insurers and asset managers are particularly eager to invest in developmental projects such as infrastructure (Wilkins, 2015).</p> <p>According to Fight (2006) project finance is generally used to refer to a non-recourse or limited recourse financing structure in which debt, equity and credit enhancement are combined for the construction and operation, or refinancing of a particular facility in a capital-intensive industry. Project Finance refers to the financing of long-term infrastructure, industrial projects and public services based upon a non-recourse or limited recourse financial structure where projects are paid back from the cash flow generated by the project (Prasana, 2013). Project Finance is used by the private sector companies as a means of funding major projects off balance sheet. The attractiveness of project financing is the ability to fund project in the off balance sheet with limited or non-recourse to the equity investors; i.e if a project fails, the project leaders’ recourse is to ownership of the actual project and they are unable to pursue the equity investors for debt (Graham, 2010). For this reason, lenders focus on the importance of projects cash flow as the main source for repaying project debt. Project financing is being used throughout the world and across a wide range of industries and sectors. This funding technique is growing in popularity as governments seek to involve the private sector in the funding and operation of public infrastructure (Prasana, 2013; Graham, 2010).</p> <p>As a virtue of fact, the role played by project finance scheme in most economies is very significant to their development especially the emerging economies (Esty, 2004). The Nigerian construction industry as experienced various methods of construction project finance from traditional (Direct Labour, Open Tendering, and Selective Tendering) to Modern methods (Design and Build, Turnkey Project, Contract Management, Public-Private Partnership etc), and despite the failure of Public-Private Partnership (PPP)) in the finance of project in Nigeria (for example, Lagos-Ibadan express way, Guto-Bagana in Nasarawa and Kogi state and Macvis concession projects in all International Airport in Nigeria), the federal government as signified intention to concession two more bridges for private-investors' development. These bridges are the second Niger bridge between Onitsha and Asaba and River Niger brigde in Nupeko, Niger state (Oyedele, 2013).</p> <p>Akwa Ibom State infrastructural development has taken a central place in the various development plans or programmes with the ultimate goal of breaking down the vicious cycle of poverty and under development (Punch, 2016). This study discusses the challenges of project financing of construction projects in Akwa Ibom State, it is therefore observed that there are various challenges that hinders construction project financing, thereby making it a major problem in the construction industry as a whole and an adequate process must be involved because contractors, government and shareholders in the construction industry are faced with the consequence of not overcoming these challenges.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Project delivery process has no stage specifically labeled \"funding\" yet funding challenges affect each stage of the process which may lead to delay in project delivery or project abandonment. Abandoned projects range from road projects, real estate, water projects and housing projects, which are the basic amenities which any government should provide for its citizens. (Akhanolu, Ekpefan, Ailemen &amp; Chibuzo, 2016). Most of the survey results (Frimpong &amp; Oluwoge, 2003) shows that financial constrain is one of the main causes of delays and project abandonment.</p> <p>The financing methods have placed Nigerian infrastructure in horrible states across the country and there is yet no harmony in the method of project financing in Nigeria (Oyedele, 2013). The sourcing of funds for investment in project development poses a great deal due to economic instability and stringent measures imposed by most financial institutions. This is compounded by the fact that the Interest rate structure had had an unfavorable impact on funding the development of project financing (Akhanolu, Ikpafan, Ailemen &amp; Chibuzor, 2016). The current infrastructural funding mechanism in Nigeria lack appropriate performance standards. This deficiency brings about cost overrun, lack of ability to complete project over specified contract periods, the associated sharp and corrupt practices within the awarding agencies and the contract officials (Vanguard, 2011). In most cases, personal interest of Nigerian leaders overrides public interest in the financing and management of construction projects (Oyedele, 2013).</p> <p>According to Ika (2012) with the increase in oil revenue and other natural resources, Akwa Ibom State was viewed to have reached the turning point and set forth in the path to economic growth and industrial development but contrary to expectation, the State is apparently lagging behind its contemporaries. There seems to be missing links in the path to infrastructural development, attempts have been made to explain the rather paradox; one key factor seems to be recurring and to which the backwardness in infrastructural development in the state have been attributed to: this of course is due to lack of sufficient capital. It is this short of negative situation inspite of abundant natural and human resource and this have warrant the investigation into the challenges of project financing in the state, in other to advise contractors, the government and other stakeholders in the construction industry on the ways and means of financing construction projects, particularly in Akwa Ibom State.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Research Questions</strong></p> <p>    1. What are the sources of project finance?</p> <p>    2. What are the challenges facing project financing in Akwa Ibom State?</p> <p>     3. What are the possible ways of mitigating the challenges facing project financing      in Akwa Ibom State?</p> <p><strong>1.4       Aim and Objectives</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to investigate the challenges of project financing on construction projects in Akwa Ibom state and to examine ways of mitigating project financing in Akwa Ibom State. The specific objective includes:</p> <p>   1. To identify the sources of project finance.</p> <p>   2. To investigate the challenges of project financing in Akwa Ibom State.</p> <p>   3. To examine various ways of mitigating the challenges of project financing in Akwa Ibom State.</p> <p><strong>1.5       Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The scope of the study is confined to identifying the challenges of project financing in Akwa Ibom State and the way forward. The study is limited to Akwa Ibom State. Target respondents for this study are the professionals in the construction industry which include: Architects, Quantity Surveyors, Engineers and Builders.</p> <p><strong>1.6     Significant of the Study</strong></p> <p>According to UKCG (2009) the construction industry is a driver of growth in other sector due to its heavy reliance on an extended and varied supply chain. All other sector of the economy like manufacturing, education, health, sport etc, depends on the construction industry for performance.</p> <p>The significance of this study to the construction industry is quite much in terms of improving the performance of project execution and delivery without abandonment. The study will be utilized by the government at both Federal and the state levels in the area of providing sustainable source of funding for government construction projects at all levels. Government will be guided on the various challenges facing project financing which often leads to delay or abandonment of construction projects.</p> <p>The study will be of great importance to the construction industry by helping the investors, developers, clients, contractors and stakeholders to source for a more sustainable funding option and to avoid the various challenges facing construction project financing in the construction industry. The construction industry will derive benefits from the outcome of this study in the sense that there will be a timely delivery of projects within the contract duration and the pervasiveness of project delay and abandonment will be overcome.</p> <p>Furthermore, the undergraduates will find the study as a useful tool to further learning and research and to other researchers whom may want to venture into the same subject matter. Finally, it will serve as an additional contribution to the existing body of knowledge which will be of immense and great improvement to construction project execution and delivery in the construction industry.</p>\n\nPROJECT FINANCING: CHALLENGES AND THE WAY FORWARD<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROJECT FINANCING: CHALLENGES AND THE WAY FORWARD", "id": 7}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  ABSTRACT </p> <p>The main aim of this research work is to compare the factors affecting cost of industrialized building and conventional building system in Nigeria. The research method used in collecting data was through the use of questionnaire administered to construction professionals in Nigerian construction industry. Seventy questionnaires were administered and fifty five were returned with response rate of 73%. The instrument used in analyzing data collected was relative importance index (RI!) to rank the factors affecting the two systems in Nigeria. From the analysis it was discovered that the major factors affecting cost of industrialized building and conventional building system in Nigeria were unstable government policy, inadequate manufacturing facilities, high cost of overhead, availability of expertise, scope of work, suitable construction environment, bureaucracy, materials waste, high cost of construction, availability of land with relative importance index of 0.82, 0.8, 0.79, 0.78, 0.77, 0.76 respectively. It was recommended that government should help in reducing the cost of building components, materials, plants and equipment and they should also set an example of patronizing the industrialized building system just as conventional building system and they should not be too strict in policy making. In conclusion the major factors affecting cost of industrialized building and conventional building system in Nigeria were unstable government policy, inadequate manufacturing facilities, high cost of overhead, availability of expertise, scope of work, suitable construction environment, high cost of construction, availability of land respectively.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Construction system is undergoing a translational change from a construction industry employing conventional construction to a more modernized and advanced system. Like a pre-fabricated component system, steel framing system, block work and mould system and timber framing system in all such system is known as industrialized building system (IBS).In this new technique of construction in order to increase the productivity of construction and improve quality of work. The system can be used good construction, equipment, materials and better project planning. This study is present and defined actual difference between conventional and industrialized building system, which can provide the necessary information on the building cost comparison between the two systems. This study also addresses the building cost comparison, more advantages and effective in between the two systems. Such provides the details building cost indicates which of the two are cheaper.</p> <p>Conventional building method is defined as components of the building that are pre-fabricated on site through the processes or timber/plywood formwork installation, steel reinforcement and cast institute. Conventional building is mostly built of reinforced concrete frames. The traditional construction method uses wooden formwork. It is much more costly for construction which includes labour, raw material, transportation and low speed of construction time.</p> <p>Industrialized building system is an advancement of the new construction technology in the Nigerian construction industry of today. It is an alternative of construction that can change many aspects in building construction. The industrialized building system is a construction system that is built using prefabricated components and is systematically done using machine, formworks and other forms of mechanical equipment. The components are manufactured offsite and once completed will be delivered to construction sites for assembly and erection. It is also can be interpreted as a system which components is manufactured in factory and then installed on site based on the size and dimension of the component required. Furthermore, systems in which concrete components prefabricated at site or in factory are assemble to form the structure with minimum in situ concrete.</p> <p>Currently, the industrialized building and conventional building system in Nigeria has gradually widely used as a modern method of construction. As an example, the industrialized building system (IBS) and conventional building system has been applied in several projects such as Coca-Cola industry in FCT Abuja, Benue brewery industry in Benue state and Benue Cement Company in Yandev Gboko Federal Housing Authority Lugbe, Mass Housing Construction FCT Abuja, and residential building in FCT Abuja etc. The implementation of industrialized building system (IBS) and conventional building system in Nigeria is reducing the entrance of foreign labour and to expedite the progress of the construction.</p> <p>The common types of industrialized building system which are generally used in construction are pre-cast concrete framing, panel and box systems, steel formwork system, steel framing system, prefabricated timber framing system, and block work system.</p> <p>Industrialized building system (IBS) has proven that it can contribute many advantages in construction project. The industrialized building system (IBS) can reduce the number of unskilled and foreign workers on site. The presence of them can increase cost and wastage in construction industry.</p> <p><strong>1.2      Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>ABDULAZIZ (2002) stated that the cost of industrialized building system for medium and most low rise housing has been higher than that of traditional /conventional built dwelling though the shells were erected more quickly. Hence there is higher cost in industrialized building compared with conventional buildings it becomes comparative that the factor affecting the two building system must be accessed to proffer solution for the cost of industrialized building and conventional building system.</p> <p><strong>1.3      The need for the research</strong></p> <p>The need for this research is to critically compare and accessed the factors which directly or indirectly affect the cost of industrialized building system, and conventional building system and see if they could be controlled or avoided completely.</p> <p><strong>1.4      Aim and Objective</strong></p> <p><strong>1.4.1 Aim</strong></p> <p>This research aims at assessing the factors affecting the cost of industrialized building and conventional building system and to identify ways in which these factors can be controlled.</p> <p><strong>1.4.2 Objectives</strong></p> <ol><li>To identify the factors affecting cost of industrialized building and conventional building system in Nigeria.</li> <li>To evaluate factors affecting the cost of industrialized building and conventional building system in Nigeria.</li> <li>To establish the most important factors affecting cost of industrialized building and conventional building system in Nigeria.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5      Scope and Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p><strong>1.5.1 Scope</strong></p> <p>The scope of this project work is based on the comparative assessment of factors affecting cost of industrialized building and conventional building system in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.5.2 Limitation</strong></p> <p>It has not been possible to conduct this research nationwide due to the limited time but the research only carried out in Federal capital territory Abuja and Benue state.</p>\n\nCOMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT OF FACTORS AFFECTING COST OF INDUSTRIALIZED BUILDING AND CONVENTIONAL BUILDING SYSTEM IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT OF FACTORS AFFECTING COST OF INDUSTRIALIZED BUILDING AND CONVENTIONAL BUILDING SYSTEM IN NIGERIA", "id": 8}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  <strong><em>ABSTRACT</em></strong> </p> <p>The complex nature of the construction project and the unstable nature of Nigerian economy result in cost escalation of construction materials and equipments and untimely completion of project make it necessary to employ the use of project management practices Nigeria. Investigations were carried out through administration of questionnaire and data were collected from professionals firms, such as quantity surveyor, architects and engineers. The statistical tools used in analyzing the data include tables and simple percentages. The findings obtained after analysis of the data from the questionnaire, shows that there is a standard practice of project management in Nigeria. Problems such as clients not stating their requirements to the project manager, late appointment of manager and denial of project manager proper authority to execute their function which causes most of the problems associated with project management services. And suggestions were made in an attempt to find solution to the problems which include advice offered to the client to employ project managers at the inception and state the requirement clearly to them, so that they can state the requirement clearly to them, so that they can execute their functions to achieve project objectives.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The management of construction projects requires knowledge of modem management as well as an understanding of the design and construction process (http://www.cecmu.ed). According to David (2006) a project is define as a temporary endeavour undertaken to create a unique project or services. Temporary means that every project has a definite beginning and a definite end. Unique means that the product or services is different in some distinguishing way from all similar product Or services. Dannis 2007 define project as capital investment to develop facilities to provide goods and services. From the above definitions of project, all projects require management and management has been given a number of definitions among which are: Martin defines management as “the planning, organizing, directing and controlling of activities of business enterprise”. Martin (2002) defined management as the coordination of all resources of an organization through the process of planning, organizing, budgeting and controlling in order to achieve organization objectives.</p> <p>Martin (2002) defined management as the coordination of all resources of an organization through the process of planning, organizing, budgeting and controlling in order to achieve organization objectives.</p> <p>The management of project adhesive known as project management according to (CIOB 2002) project management as the overall planning coordination and control of a project from inception to completion, aimed at meeting a clients requirement in order to produce a functionally and financially viable project that will be completed on time within authorized cost and to the required quality standards.</p> <p>Adoptability is defines as the acceptance of a particular method or policy in order to achieve certain objectives (Oxford advance Dictionary, 6th edition).</p> <p>Adoption of project management was often more accepted, placing the project manager functional manager and project professionals in indigenous roles trying to support project needs, Lock (2007).</p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>In Nigeria, the implementation of modern project management tools methods and techniques is still not well established in public sector, this result into failure of public institutions and their contractor in performing their duties concerning the budget, specification and deadlines in project delivery and lack of financial support as barriers to successful project planning and execution in Nigeria public sector, Idoro and Ajayi (2009). The difficult nature of construction project, resulting to cost overshoot of construction materials and equipment, also affect delay in project completion makes it pertinent in adopting the application of project management.</p> <p><strong>1.3     NEED OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The growing need for a better understanding of the clients requirement in terms of functionality, financial control, time and a very much better clearer coordination of the work of consultants and contractors have all contributed to the need for project management. The complex nature of Nigeria economy, resulting in cost escalation of construction materials and equipments and untimely completion of projects making it necessary to employ the use of project management. Clients are becoming more certain in their requirement, they demand for timely completion of the project as well as keeping the project cost within budget so as to obtain good value for their money.

This research is aimed at examining the factors affecting accuracy of pre-lender cost estimate in Abuja, with a view to improving the predictive ability of clients, consultants, and contractors for better estimating. 84 questionnaires were sent out, 28 to con tractors, 28 to clients, and 28 were sent to the consultant firms respectively. 25 questionnaires were received from each of the respondent categories, representing 89% using the simple random sampling technique The collected data were analyzed using the Relative importance Index. The study found out that a statistically significant relationship existed between the clients, consultants, and contractor on the essential factors affecting accuracy of pre-tender cost estimate. It was concluded that: Experience and skill level of the consultants ranked f’ with overall Ru of 0.9, project teams experience on the construction type 0.87, clear and detail drawings and specification, completeness of cost information, accuracy and reliability of cost information are the most significant factors affecting accuracy of pre-tender cost estimate were other paramount factors. The most appropriate cost estimating method at the design stage according to the respondents ranking is subjective estimating with Ru of 0.78 and parametric estimating 0.46 and synthetic estimating 0.52. It was recommended that Clients should always engage the services of skilled quantity surveyors to undertake the consultancy services in cost estimating process.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Construction estimate is the amount envisages to finish a construction work. It is the probable amount that is computed to complete a construction work. It is the prediction of the amount of a project based on available data at the time of prediction.</p> <p>Cost estimate was defined by business dictionary (2013) as an “approximation of the probable cost of a product, program, or project, computed on the basis of available information. So the more information is provided on a project, the more the estimate tends to accuracy. It is important in many ways. According to business dictionary (2013), “four common types of cost estimates are: Planning estimate is a rough approximation of cost within a reasonable range of values, prepared for information purposes only, budget estimate an approximation based on well-defined ground rules, firm estimate a figure based on cost data that is renewable enough for entering into a binding concrete, not-to- exceed/Not-less-than estimate the maximum or minimum amount required to accomplish a given task, based on firm cost estimate. There are more benefits in estimating the cost of a potential construction Job that is not estimating before commencement. Cost estimate, to a client, is necessary in cash flow management. To an investor, it is necessary to support evaluation of project feasibility and to assess the scope of work. To a consultant, construction cost estimate can serve as a basis for job performance measurement (Baccarini 2004), in contract or selection, as an exhibit in construction contract disagreement, and in post work evaluation of completed jobs (work audit), and to a contractor, it is the determinant ofjob procurement (in bidding for construction jobs).</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The demand for more construction of all type coupled with tight monetary supply has provided the construction industry with, a big challenge on how to estimate the cost of construction project.</p> <p>The problem of late involvement of quantity surveyor, inadequate details in the contract document, poor communication between the design team, inaccurate drawing and specification, inadequate data, unavailability of current rates of construction resources, inflation and charming in technology, finally consequent loss of project has brought about loss of client confidence in consultants, added investment risk, inability to deliver value to clients and disinvestment in the construction industry. As a result of this, it is found necessary to create solution to such problems through this research as to improve on the quality of the factors that affect the preparation of the cost estimate at the design stage.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Aim and Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p><strong>1.3.1 Aim</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research is to assess the factors that mitigate the effective preparation of cost estimate at the design stage.</p> <p><strong>1.3.2 Objectives</strong></p> <p>The specific objective of this research are:</p> <ol><li>To examine the  factors that mitigates the accuracy of pre-lender preparation or cost estimate at tne design stage.</li> <li>To determine the appropriate method of cost estimating at the design stage</li> <li>To access the factors that mitigates the effective preparation of cost estimate at the design stage.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4 Significance of the Stud</strong>y</p> <p>The significance of this research is to promote good estimating to sustained profit as errors and carelessness can be costly in terms of loss of profit and project abandonment,</p> <p><strong>1.5 Scope</strong></p> <p>This research focused on the cost estimate at the design stage of public building project within Federal Capital Territory Abuja.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Limitation</strong></p> <p>In this process of this research project, there were various forms of setbacks which had a great effect on the process of this research project.</p> <p>One of such set back is the inability to get the appropriate and reliable information and it book found from librarian visited, also the high cost of transportation to the various information centers visited and place where the questionnaire where given out, as well the reluctance shown by these whom the questionnaires were given to.</p> <p>Despite all this, a reasonable amount of work was achieved based on the research topic.</p>\n\nASSESSMENT OF TUE FACTORS MITIGATING THE EFFECTIVE PREPARATION OF COST ESTIMATE AT TILE DESIGN STAGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF TUE FACTORS MITIGATING THE EFFECTIVE PREPARATION OF COST ESTIMATE AT TILE DESIGN STAGE", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p> <p>The aim of this research is to analyzed and compare the life cycle cost of alternative root covering materials, Zink coat roofing sheet materials, corrugated Asbestos cement roofing materials, concrete decked roof materials, and long span aluminum roofing materials were considered in this research work with the objectives to determine the initial cost and 4fecycle cost of each roofing materials, to establish the relationship between the dfferent roof covering materials on the basis of their lfe cycle cost implications. The need for this research is to help the client on making decision on type of roofing material to be used in building construction project on the basis of maintenance cost economy as a whole. The composition of building construction cost are made up of materials, labour, plant cost, and general overhead and profit. The procedure for data collection was well structured questionnaire administered to the personnel, of the various organisation (Construction companies). Quantity Surveying Firms were visited to obtained the cost data of those roof covering materials. The instrument for data analyzing is the use of the present value formular of Ni for the techniques of appraisal under initial rate and the cost in use of alternative roof covering materials. The summary of finding revealed that sink coat steel roof materials has the Initial cost of N69 75 which can be maintained at N33. 613.92 and has overall cost of N52066.28. Corrugated asbestos cement roof materials has the initial cost of N6975 which can be maintained at N33.613.92 and has overall cost of N11983.89.

Long span aluminum roof materials has initial cost of N1812.50 which can be maintained at N9435.33 and replace at N1778 and has overall cost of N13025.83. From the table of the cost in use of the various roofing materials shown in the work it is observed that the corrugated asbestos roofing sheet material has the cheapest initial cost This is followed by long span aluminum, concrete decked and zink cost roof in ascending order. The cost in use information also revealed that the long span aluminum roofing material has the lowest total cost. Cost in use and this is followed by corrugated, asbestos cement roofing sheet, concrete decked and Zink coat steel in order to magnitude. From this research, it is recommended among other that the initial cost of roof covering materials should not be the only reason for it selection.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>According to Barry (1996) Roofing materials are materials which provide thermal insulation, reduces noise provide surface for decoration diffuse light covers services pipe work used for conduct electrical wiring and also provide surface insulation from of electrical fittings, such as lamps fan alarm etc. Various materials are used for the construction of roofing materials nation world wide, for the purpose of this research life cycle cost implication of using alternative roofing materials. Materials are said to be substances from which something else can be made, the implication of using any material in construction of roofmg material is very important of cost is being considered. Apart from economical (cost) point of view there are several other factors which comple to choose a particular type of roofing material, these include aesthetic durability, low maintenance cost, thermal insulation etc. Recently advancement in technology which lead to growth of modern construction material has also compelled people into try to blend with technological advancement in roofing materials without conceding the cost implication of such materials. It has also increase in the industrial advancement in roofing materials and the need to give a client real value for his money which promotes the quantity surveyors into comparing the cost implication of using different types of roofing materials from the economic point of view. Cost implication of different types of roofing materials from the economic point of view simple mean the consequences of using an alternative roofing materials for producing a roof. The types of roof to be compared are</p> <p>1n corrugated Abestos cement roofing sheet, concrete decked roof, long span aluminum roofing sheet and zinc coating steel root sheet. They all offer to a building the same function, they only differ in strength cost of construction, method of fixing and maintenance cost The result of this research will aid in making decisions on the type of roofing materials to choose for a construction of a project.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Research has it that there has being a steady increase in the cost implication of using alternative roofing materials. The research pose the following problems. What is the relationship that exist between the various alternative materials for roofing on the basis of their life cycle cost?</p> <p><strong>1.3 Aims of the Study</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research is carry out a comparative study of a life cycle cost</p> <p>implication of using an alternative roofing materials.</p> <p><strong>Objectives</strong></p> <ol><li>To establish the initial cost of the alternative roof covering</li> <li>To establish life cycle cost of various roof materials.</li> <li>To compare the initial and the lifecycle cost of the alternative roof covering material</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4 The Need for the Research</strong></p> <p>The result of these research will help the client in making a decision on the type of roofing materials to be used in construction of any further project having consider their economic factors durability maintenance cost and aesthetic.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Scope of Study</strong></p> <p>The scope of this project work is based on the selected roofmg materials which include corrugated Asbestos cement roofing sheet, concrete decked roof, long span aluminum roofing sheet coverings and zinc coating steel roofing sheet</p> <p><strong>1.6 Assumption</strong></p> <p>While carryout this research, it was assumed that the total area covered does not affect the cost of the roofing materials. All economic factors capable of influencing the cost of roofing materials are kept at constant. Expected life of a building is 60 years.</p> <p><strong>CHAFE ER TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p><strong>2.1 Composition of Construction Cost</strong></p> <p>The cost of building construction is made up of various component such as materials. labour, plant financing cost, general overhead site overhead and profit, Collier (1984) noted that one of the best places to find clarification of construction cost is the typical standard form of the cost plus fees contract. His opinion is that it is the best kind of contract that the owner pays the cost as they are incurred.</p>\n\nCOMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF LIFE CYCLE COSTING OF ALTERNATIVE ROOF COVERING MATERIALS IN RESIDENTIAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF LIFE CYCLE COSTING OF ALTERNATIVE ROOF COVERING MATERIALS IN RESIDENTIAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION", "id": 12}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  </p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>The main Aim of this research is to investigate the Adoption of knowledge management in the Nigeria construction industry. The research examined the area of the construction industry that will improve as a result of the contribution of knowledge management. Data for the analysis were collected through questionnaire Administration on construction professionals. 60questionnaires where administered, 50 were retrieved and analysed using simple percentile and relative Important index. The study revealed that the knowledge management adoption is being hindered the most in Nigeria by some major barriers which include funding with relative important index of 0.83, lack of cooperation among professionals with relative important index of 0.81, difficulty in generalizing and sharing knowledge with relative important index of 0.81 and the least barrier being difficulty in locating knowledge which have index value of 0.65.As there is no Adequate fund to carry it out in construction organization in conclusion it was observe that colleagues experience is the major source of knowledge available to construction professionals in Nigeria as most construction professionals in Nigeria don’t read much and not exposed to other methods of acquiring knowledge within the organization and fund is also the major problem hindering the adoption of knowledge management among professionals. It was recommended that project managers, Architects, Quantity surveyors supervisors, contractors and engineers should improve in the level at which they transfer and share knowledge with other  construction professionals and that the federal government of Nigeria should inject more fund to the construction industry of the country as this is a very productive sector of the economy. </em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0       Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>According to Botha, D.F (2004) knowledge management is a process of systematic management of vital knowledge and its associated process of creating, gathering, organizing diffusion, use and exploitation. It requires turning personal knowledge into corporate knowledge that can be widely shared throughout the organisation. Projects are typically delivered by a temporary organisation comprising designers, consultants, contractors, supplier and others. The need for knowledge management (KM) is particularly relevant to the construction industry which now faces many challenges. These include economic swings, new markets emerging in the global economy, increasing competition, the impact of technology, new and increasing demands from clients, customers and society, and the requirement to maintain a highly skilled workforce at all levels (Egbu and Robinson 2005). Contracting firms are becoming increasingly involved in challenging and complex, knowledge-intensive procurement routes such as management contracting, design and build, joint ventures, public private partnerships as well as the traditional procurement route. According to Quintas (2005) there are two potentially conflicting objectives of Knowledge Management, to build knowledge bases cumulatively and to learn from past experience; and to ensure learning beyond core areas, generating the capability to assimilate new knowledge in order to be able to respond to change. In a study of American contractors, Fisher et al. (1998) identified a number of reasons for implementing Knowledge Management practices as: high staff turnover leading to loss of experience; and large size of organisations make sharing knowledge difficult. Construction organisations have garnered much attention in terms of the potential benefits of knowledge management, with little evidence of how to actually manage knowledge in practice.</p> <p>A lack of understanding of both knowledge and its subsequent management within the industry indicates the need for further empirical research in the field (Robinson et al. 2005). The types of organisation which shall be given consideration in this research are main contractors.</p> <p>Traditionally, these organisations were labour-intensive employing a full workforce of labourers and tradesmen to execute the construction phase of a project on a building site. Many of these companies have now moved from being a ‘building company’ towards directly employing a core professional and management team to lead teams of outsourced contractors. The nature of the industry requires them to establish temporary organisational structures at dispersed geographical locations, frequently at a distance from central management (Raiden and Dainty 2006). Against the backdrop of an industry which is highly competitive and exhibits low levels of research, the purpose of this, is to present ongoing research into knowledge management within the leading Nigerian construction industries. Commencing with a background to the Nigerian construction industry this research shall also present a review of literature related to Knowledge Management in construction, progress in the research to-date, the proposed research methodology and future research activities.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>The construction industry is recognized as being poor at learning on a consistent basis and improving performance and is notoriously slow in adapting to progressive change. Two categories requiring knowledge management in the construction industry have been identified; within projects across temporary, multi-discipline project organizations; and within individual firms. It is accepted that there may be much greater potential for knowledge management within individual companies. Despite the recognized need to adopt knowledge management, it is considered to in its infancy in the construction industry and is soon as a recent and evolving practice for construction organizations.</p> <p>The lack of a working definition of knowledge within construction organization and awareness of the importance of potential advantages of knowledge management reflects a casual approach, and indicates the need for further exploration of knowledge and knowledge management related issues.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Aim</strong></p> <p>The principal aim is to investigate the adoption of knowledge management in the Nigeria construction industry.</p> <p><strong>1.4       Objectives</strong></p> <ol><li>To identify methods managing knowledge within the Nigerian construction industry.</li> <li>To identify the key barriers in the adoption of knowledge management in the nigeria construction industry.</li> <li>To evaluate the existing approaches to managing knowledge. .</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5       Scope</strong></p> <p>This research is focusing on obtaining the responses among professionals in the Nigerian construction industry on the adoption of knowledge management in Nigerian construction industry. The area covered throughout the research period is Abuja, and Kaduna.</p> <p><strong> 1.6     Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>It’s not rare that researcher experience difficulties in the course of carrying out research work. It is worth noticing that researcher encountered difficulty in obtaining relevant information needed in producing a research that is well comprehensive, it was also very difficult in obtaining data as some materials are considered confidential.</p> <p><strong>1.7       The Need of the Study</strong></p> <p>The construction industry is recognized as being poor at learning on a consistent basis and improving performance and is notoriously slow in adapting to progressive change. The Nigerian construction industry has to queue into these innovative ideas as knowledge management has been promoted as a means of harnessing and utilizing intellectual resources to address these challenges, in addition to improving innovation, business performance and client satisfaction. Two categories requiring knowledge management in the construction industry have been identified; within projects, across temporary, multi-discipline project organization, and within individual firms. It is accepted that there may be much greater potential for knowledge management within individual companies. Despite the recognized need to adopt knowledge management, it is considered to be in its infancy in the construction industry and is seen as a recent and evolving practice for construction organizations.</p> <p>The lack of a working definition of knowledge within construction organizations and awareness of the importance and potential advantages of knowledge management reflects a casual approach, and indicates the need for further exploration of knowledge and knowledge management related issues.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p><strong>2.1    History</strong></p> <p>Knowledge management emerged as a discipline since in the early 1990s Mclnerney and Claire (2002). It was initially supported by individual practitioners, when Skandia hired Leif Edvinsion of Sweden as the worlds first chief knowledge officer (CKO), Kent state university (2008). Hubert Santonge started investigating knowledge management long before that, Bhavani (2002). The objectives of chief knowledge officers is to manage and maximize the intangible assets of their organizations, Bhavani (2002). Gradually, chief knowledge officers became interested in practical and theoretical aspects of knowledge management and the research field was formed.</p>\n\nINVESTIGATION INTO THE ADOPTION OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT (KM) IN THE NIGERIAN INDUSTRY CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INVESTIGATION INTO THE ADOPTION OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT (KM) IN THE NIGERIAN INDUSTRY CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY", "id": 13}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0   INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>As-built survey has been an essential element in the development of the human environment since the beginning of recorded history.

It is now evident that the adoption of Information Technology can enhance construction productivity and improve communications for effective decision-making and coordination among construction participants. The ability of the industry to avail itself of technology depends on the level of usage by construction participants including the Quantity Surveyor (QS) who plays a major role in the management of project success determinants, such as cost, time and quality. </p> <p>It is apparent that we live in a dynamic world characterized by incessant technology change. The explosive growth of information and communication technology (ICT) otherwise shortened as information technology (IT) has had unquantifiable impact on business systems and processes (Rivard et al., 2004). Advancement in information technology has made possible fundamental changes in the method of practice in all businesses and industries although at different levels (Li, 2000). The global acceptance and widespread adoption has accelerated the dimensions of competition not only among organizations globally but among professions locally (Hampson and Tatum, 1994). </p> <p>The construction industry with the aim of leveling their colleagues in other industries have embraced the use of information technology such as internet, computing, telephoning, satellite communication and electronic mailing to perform most, if not all of their activities (Ibidapo, 2000). The quantity surveyors’ ability to avail themselves of these emerging opportunities provided by the advent of information technology depends on the adoption of new technologies (Castle, 2002). There is quite a lot of development in all areas of computer application to the industry. Of note are the expert systems, artificial intelligence, knowledge-base systems (KBS), artificial neural networking (ANN), robotics and computer aided design (Arif and Karam, 2001). Rivard et al. (2004) opined that the evolution of information technology will have a profound impact on how organizations in the architectural, engineering and construction industry operate in the way other industries such as manufacturing and banking have adopted and benefited from long ago. He noted that this is already the case in many of the developed countries around the world. In lieu of this, Honey (1998) reported that the turn of the last century has seen a reduction in paper-based operation in quantity surveying (QS) offices in UK while electronic led-processes are leading to less dependence on taking-off sheets and other ancillary stationery. The quantity surveying profession in Nigeria has experienced significant changes over the past decade in terms of the scope and type of services provided within the construction industry (Oladapo, 2006). These changes have occurred primarily in response to changing industry/client demands, information technology developments, increased levels of competition for services and the vital role of the quantity surveying in achieving improved service delivery. Moreover, given the increasingly global nature of construction industry obstinate by extremely high levels of domestic competition and resultant low profit margin levels, there is no doubt that the construction industry has to improve its information flow and project delivery mechanism (Wager, 1998). Thus, as information flow increasingly become electronic, quantity surveying computing facilities, software and databases will need to develop in a compatible manner. Nigerian quantity surveyors will need to adapt to changes in work patterns to improve their efficiency and develop new markets to maintain competitive advantage and enhance profitability through the adoption of IT. In summary, the Nigeria construction industry in general and the quantity surveying profession in particular are facing the challenges of effectively utilizing the rapid expanding technological environment in which it operates to its full advantage (Oyediran and Odusami, 2004). </p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>It is a known fact that advancement in technology and evolution of information technology as dramatically change the way business is conducted by various professionals. It has reduced the cost of services, reduces labour and saves time.

Fu and Drew (2002) suggest that competitive tendering is the most common method used for contractor selection. In competitive tendering process, a client selects a numbers of contractors to tender for the proposed project. The selected contractors must to decide whether to tender or not tender. The contractors need to submit an estimated cost to execute the project at hand, if they intend to tender. The client would select the contractor who submitted the best cost for executing the project. (Shash 1993, p.111). Therefore the decision to tender is the first step that contractors need to consider. <br/>There are various factors that need to be considered by the contractors in order to make the decision to tender or not. The decision is highly related to the specific project and macro environment. It is hard to make a decision in a limited time by the management team. The decision generally is made on the basis of experience, intuition and guesses. (Egemen and Mohamed 2007, p.1373) <br/>There are many researchers that have discovered the factors that affect the tender/ no tender process. Unfortunately, there has not been any similar research projects carried out in Nigeria. Furthermore, during the global economic recession, construction related activities are decreased significantly. Construction contractors\"Ÿ original tender/ no tender decision making criteria may be changed.</p> <p><strong>1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong><br/>Designing and implementing an effective tender is a huge challenge for most contractors who seek government contracts in Nigeria. A study conducted by Obuji (2003) in some West African countries including Nigeria, revealed that some small scale contractors are not favoured during a tendering process by prospective clients because, they neglect various factors that affect the success and failures of submitting a tender for a contract. Some contractors do not structure and draft their tenders in an appropriate manner; hence their chance of being contracted is reduced.<br/>Construction industry has complexity in its nature because it contains large number of parties as clients, contractors, consultants, stakeholders, shareholders, regulators and others. Construction projects in Nigeria suffer from many problems and complex issues in performance because of many reasons and factors. This project is very important to identify and to evaluate the main factors affecting contractors' tenders in construction projects in Nigeria. The practices concerning with Tenders such as time, cost, project owner satisfaction and safety checklists will be analyzed in order to know the main practical problems of contractors who do not win tenders as well as practical solutions to help enhance the chances of our indigenous contractors in Imo state in winning Federal government and foreign contracts.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The aim of this research is to analyze and assess the local factors that account for the success or failure of tenders submitted by contractors when applying for a construction project in Imo State. The aim of this research can be broken down into the following objectives:</p> <div> <ul><li>To identify the challenges faced by contractors when applying for contracts in Nigeria</li> <li>To assess the factors that affect contractors tender for construction project.</li> </ul></div> <div><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong> <ul><li>What challenges do contractors in Nigeria face when submitting tenders for projects/contracts?</li> <li>What are the factors that affect contractors tender for construction projects?</li> </ul></div> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This research will help contractors become aware of what the factors which need to be considered when they intend to submit tenders for different projects. This research will also provide the information that would be used by any contractor to create a competitive bidding strategy.</p> <p>This study will also give a clear insight into the various ways in which profit and efficiency from contracts and contracting can be increased and how the challenges facing contract tendering can be properly tackled. The study also gives a clear insight into the various factors affecting tenders and their effects on contractor's efficiency and chances of winning a contract in Nigeria. The findings and recommendations of the researcher will help in building a strong and better contract policy and tendering guideline for contractors, especially small scale contractors in Imo State other construction companies in Nigeria.</p> <div><strong>HYPOTHESIS FORMULATION</strong></div> <p>Statements of Hypothesis for the study are:<br/>Ho: There is no significant relationship between factors that affect contractor tender and contractor chances in winning a construction project.<br/>Hi: There is a significant relationship between factors that affect contractor tender and contractor chances in winning a construction project.</p> <div><strong>SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></div> <p>This research focuses mainly on the assessment of the factors that affect tenders for construction projects, using construction companies and private contractors in Imo State as case study. Results and recommendations may not be used to generalise other construction companies or contractors in other parts of Nigeria, as the researcher could not cover a wider scope due to financial and time constraints.<br/>Based on the findings of this study other possible researchable areas may include studies on the various effects of other aspects of contracts such as contract laws in Nigeria and contract management and control.</p> <p><strong>1.8 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The only limitation faced by the researcher in the course of carrying out this study was the delay in getting data from the various respondents. Most respondents were reluctant in filling questionnaires administered to them due to their busy schedules and nature of their work. The researcher found it difficult to collect responses from the various respondents, and this almost hampered the success of this study.</p> <p><strong>1.9 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <div> <ul><li><strong>Tender: </strong>According to Simmons (2002), a tender refers to an offer (usually by a contractor or a vendor) to undertake a job or supply goods.</li> <li><strong>Contract:  </strong>Erikson (2002) defined Contract as an agreement that creates an obligation binding upon the parties thereto.

Construction projects have long been recognized as particularly cost, time and risk-laden. Some of the time and cost factors associated with the construction process are fairly predictable or identifiable; others may be totally unforeseen. The constructed project may not perform as anticipated because the owner may have unrealistic expectations regarding the delivery time of construction forcing contractors into unrealistic gambles, corner-cutting or commitments that may not be realistic (Frimpong 2003). <br/>Project success can be defined as meeting goals and objectives as prescribed in the project plan. A successful project means that the project has accomplished its technical performance, maintained its schedule, and remained within budgetary costs. Project management tools and techniques play an important role in the effective management of a project. Therefore, a good project management lies in the management tools and techniques used to manage the project. Project management involves managing the resources\"”workers, machines, money, materials and methods used. Some projects are effectively and efficiently managed while others are mismanaged, incurring much delay and cost overruns and negatively affecting the economy (Frimpong 2003). <br/>Assessing construction projects' delivery time is critical in today's market-driven economy. <br/>To improve the economy and maximize long-term return on this public investment, government agencies have recently started utilizing new types of contracting methods that are designed to achieve multiple project objectives, including minimizing construction cost and duration, while maximizing its quality. <br/>In recent years, many departments of transportation, in various states have started to apply new highway contracting methods, including: Bidding on time i.e., to encourage competition among contractors to minimize project duration (Holt et al 2000), Incentive/ disincentive contract clauses that provide financial incentives to reduce construction duration, Night time construction that seeks to cut service disruption and project time by requiring contractors to work during off-peak night time hours, Warranty contracting that attempts to improve construction quality by making contractors liable for the performance of the facility after project completion. These new and emerging contracts place an increasing pressure on decision makers in the construction industry to search for an optimal/near-optimal resource utilization plan that minimizes construction time while maximizing its quality. This creates new and pressing needs for advanced resource utilization models that are capable of optimizing the multiple and conflicting objectives of construction time, cost, and quality. <br/>Significant research advancements have been made in the area of optimizing construction resource utilization. This led to a number of optimization models. These models can be classified according to their optimization objectives into models that attempted to: <br/>\"¢ <em>Minimize project time and/or improve resource utilization</em>; <br/>\"¢ <em>minimize time and cost for non-repetitive construction using time-cost trade-off analysis </em><br/>\"¢ <em>minimize time and/or cost for repetitive construction</em></p> <p>While the above research study seeks to provide significant contributions to the area of optimizing construction resource utilization, there has been little or no reported research focusing on multi objective models for optimizing construction time, cost, and quality.</p> <p><strong>1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong><br/>Misallocation and misperception of time factor in construction projects have resulted in the government of Nigeria paying more than necessary for many projects. Improper time assessment can also cause additional costs in the form of delays which result in poor utilization, increasing social and economic costs. Are contractors using the most appropriate resources to execute projects in Nigeria? Do they mobilize the needed resources within the approved time frame allotted to their contracts? What effects do short time periods and/ or extended time periods have on their project costs? Are there remedies to these situations? <br/>These are some of the situations that have prompted the researcher to go deep into the assessment of the cost and time impacts of public sector construction projects in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The study had the main objective of assessing the effects of timely delivery of construction projects on the economy of Nigeria, but specifically it had the following objectives.</p> <div> <ol><li>To establish the extent to which time factors have impacted on construction of projects in the public sector in Nigeria.</li> <li>To find out the change in the perception of contractors on time effects on public sector construction in Nigeria.</li> <li>To find out the relationship between timely delivery of construction projects and the economic development of Nigeria.</li> </ol></div> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>In order to achieve the objectives of the study, the following research questions were used by the researcher:</p> <div> <ol><li>What effects do time factors have on construction of projects in Nigeria?</li> <li>Has the perception of contractors on time factors in projects construction changed in recent years?</li> <li>What relationship exists between timely delivery of construction projects and economic development in Nigeria?</li> </ol></div> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong><br/>Ho: There is no significant relationship between timely delivery of construction projects and economic development of Nigeria.</p> <p>Hi: There is a significant relationship between timely delivery of construction projects and economic development of Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>All construction contracts allocate time between owners and contractors. Hence the significance of this study would better inform improved project relationships and communications and enhance construction administration practices between owners and contractors. <br/>The findings would also enhance and broaden time of wide range of risks that could materialize during the design, and construction phases of a project which would subsequently result in better and more prudent designs specifications.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The researcher will limit the study to the effects of timely delivery of construction projects on the economy of Nigeria, using the Fly Over 2 project constructed by Julius Berger in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State as a case study. Findings and recommendations by the researcher may not be used for general analysis as the researcher could not assess numerous construction projects due to time and financial constraints.</p> <p><strong>1.8 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Construction of projects in the public sector has assumed significant functions, hence the need for assessment on the cost and time impacts of construction of projects in order to achieve overall project objectives. Historical project schedule and duration data is treated as confidential by Julius Berger Nigeria Plc hence getting data for this study was very difficult. Data collection and analysis was therefore limited to the data received from project supervisors in the field of project construction.</p> <div> <ol><li><ol><li><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></li> </ol></li><li><strong>Economy:</strong> An economy consists of the economic system in a certain region, comprising the production, distribution or trade, and consumption of goods and services in that region or country.

The effective management of human resource is the key towards achieving the higher construction workforce productivity thus accomplishing the construction projects within their predefined limits. The bond between motivation and productivity is widely accepted and of high significance as well. The relationship between motivation and productivity can be summarized as that productivity is directly linked to motivation, and motivation is, in turn, dependent on productivity. Suitable motivation of labour can be hypothesized as a key contributor to maximizing workers' productivity Kazaz et al (2008. Workers need motivation just as equipments need fuel and operators. Motivation is a process which activates productivity. In order to effectively manage the human resources and to make sure that workforce is productive enough; it is necessary to understand those factors which have edge over others for motivating the construction workforce. In this study, the potential of organizational and economic factors will be studied for motivating employees.<br/>There were several studies which explored the relationship between motivational factors and construction workforce productivity around the globe but there was a scarcity of this work in the local environment of Nigeria. The construction industry plays an important role in the development of the economy of the country. Construction industry is an area influenced by many different factors such as labour, material, equipment and construction methods etc. Among these factors, human resources come first without which, other resources would not be utilized or transformed into productive use. Any improvement in labour productivity would contribute a great deal to the improvement of the overall productivity as identified by Hashim (1995). The motivation concept is generally defined as a composition of powers and mechanisms which help to direct human behavior in a desired manner, or with a more specific context it is described as the all convincing and encouraging actions which help workers fulfill their tasks willingly and to come closer to project objectives. Motivation of the labour force is of paramount importance because the quality of human performance at the workplace depends largely upon motivation. That is, higher motivation brings higher productivity which is suggested by Kazaz et al (2008). According to most researchers there is a positive relationship between motivation and productivity. This means that when motivation increases, a rise in productivity is also expected. This reflects the belief that an increased motivation level causes an increase in productivity. Achieving the results demands that an adequate quality of inputs is provided in this first place and improved construction workforce productivity means a better input and this it will help contractors to be more competent and profitable whilst executing their jobs.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>Construction companies exist for the purpose of rendering some services. For the organization to meet its objectives, people are employed in the organization in order to help the organization meet its objectives. Thus, in order to ensure that people employed in the organization perform optimally towards the realization of organizational goals, they need to be motivated to work.</p> <p>Motivating people to work entails meting their needs. There is a great controversy over the issue of motivating people. <br/>Some people are of the view that such extrinsic factors like money, praise, and quality of supervision and company's policy can motivate people to work, while others are of the view that such extrinsic factors like advancement quality of the job done by person, recognition and growth can motivate workers to productivity.<br/>It is in view of these controversies that this study wants to look at the motivation of employees in the organization by using Marlum Construction Company as a case study; and in doing this, the following questions arise:</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY.</strong><br/>This research work hopes to achieve the following objectives:</p> <div> <ol><li>To examine the factors which motivate employees to perform in the organization</li> <li>To look at various techniques of motivating people to performance in the construction industry</li> <li>To ascertain the effect of motivation of labour, cost and productivity on workers in the construction industry of Nigeria.</li> <li>To identify the problems associated with the motivation of workers in the construction industry of Nigeria.</li> <li>To suggest the solutions to such problems, if any.</li> <li>Finally, to improve people's knowledge in this area of organizational behaviour.</li> </ol></div> <p>  <br/><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS </strong><br/>It is in view of the above problems that the following questions arise:</p> <div> <ul><li>What are the factors that motivate employees to perform in the construction industry of Nigeria?</li> <li>What are the available techniques of motivating employees for higher productivity?</li> <li>Do motivation of labour, and cost actually steer employees productive capacity?</li> <li>What are the problems militating against employees motivation, and</li> <li>How can these problems of employees' motivation be addressed in order to improve productivity in the construction sector of Nigeria?</li> </ul></div> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong><br/>The following hypotheses will be tested in this study:</p> <div> <ul><li>Ho: The quality of supervision will not motivate workers productivity.</li> </ul></div> <p>Hi: The quality of supervision will motivate workers productivity.</p> <div> <ul><li>Ho: A worker's perception of what obtained in his organizational will not motivate him to greater productivity.</li> </ul></div> <p>Hi: A worker's perception of what obtained in his organizational will motivate him to greater productivity.</p> <div> <ul><li>Ho: A worker's perception of organizational appraisal policy will motivate him to greater productivity.</li> </ul></div> <p>Hi: A worker's perception of organizational appraisal policy will not motivate him to greater productivity.</p> <div> <ul><li>Ho: The worker's satisfaction with its fringe benefits will not motivate him to greater productivity.</li> </ul></div> <p>Hi: The worker's satisfaction with its fringe benefits will motivate him to greater productivity.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>This study will educate the management of the organization (especially construction companies in Nigeria) on how to motivate their workers to productivity.<br/>The findings of this study will generate people's interest in researching into other areas of motivation in the organization will enrich the literature on motivation as a phenomenon.<br/>Finally, the study hopes to enrich people's knowledge in this area of organizational behaviour and management of people in the organization.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>This study is on effect of motivation of labour, cost and productivity on the construction industry of Nigeria.

The Nigerian construction industry is faced with uncertainties. With construction targets not being met and high rate of abandoned construction projects, there is great need for proper risk assessment and implementation. Managing risks in construction projects have been recognized as a very important process in order to achieve project objectives in terms of time, cost, quality, safety and environmental sustainability (Mills, 2001). Project risk management is an iterative process: the process is beneficial when is implemented in a systematic manner throughout the lifecycle of a construction project, from the planning stage to completion.</p> <p>Risk management has become an integral process in managing construction projects. Construction project activities are to be well calculated in-order for the deliverable to be of great use and benefit to its stakeholders. To complete most construction projects on time, minimizing cost and wastages proper risk management techniques must be employed (Tchankova, 2002). According to Mills (2001), systematic risk management is expecting the unexpected or in other words it is a tool which helps control risks in construction projects and its objective is to introduce a simple, practical method of identifying, assessing, monitoring and managing risk in an informed and structured way. <br/>Normally, in risk management process, the first steps will involves risk identification process which includes the prioritization process in order to identify and rank the risk based on its impact and seriousness. Risk that will have a greater impact on a project normally will be handled first and low impact risk will be handled later. <br/>Construction project team consist of professional such as the architect, engineer, and the quantity surveyor that will help to assist and advice the client in order to meet all the project objectives in term of time, quality and cost. Awareness and knowledge on risk management is very crucial so that they will deal with the risk properly which will directly leads to project success. Due to this scenario, this research aims to identify the level of awareness of construction professional specifically Nigerian quantity surveyors towards risk management. Apart from that, it will also aim to identify how risk management being implemented in the Nigerian construction industry and also the potential barrier and challengers in the implementation of risk management specifically from the quantity surveyor's point of view.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>Embarking on a construction project involves taking risks, as the Nigerian construction industry is not risk-free. No matter how small or simple is the project it is still can go wrong as soon as the two parties, the employer and the contractor signed a contract they have taken onboard the risk (Sawczuk, 1996). The individual in the construction industries that undertake various activities are heterogeneous since client, consultant and contractors have different roles and objectives (flanagan, 1995). Risk management in Nigerian construction industry is actually not widely being practiced. <br/>According to Burchett (2009), Risk in construction, however cannot be eliminated, but it can be minimized, transferred or retained. However, the industry has a very poor reputation for managing risk, with many projects failing to meet deadlines and cost argents (Mills, 2001). In practice, normally in order to deal with the unexpected event, there will be an allocation about 10 percent from the estimated cost of the proposed construction project as a contingency sum. Earlier observation shows that the risk management process is not widely being implemented in Nigerian construction industry. For this reason, this research seeks to identify the barriers and challenges for the implementation of risk management in the Nigerian construction industry.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong> <br/>The aim of this research is to investigate the practice of risk management amongst the construction practitioners specifically the quantity surveyor in the Nigerian construction industry.<br/>In order to achieve the aim of the study, specific objectives for the study are:</p> <div> <ol><li>To evaluate the quantity surveyor's level of awareness and acceptance on Risk Management practice.</li> <li>To identify the current practice of risk management amongst Quantity Surveyors’.</li> <li>To examine the barriers and challenges to the implementation of risk management in construction project from the quantity surveyor's point of view.</li> </ol></div> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <div> <ol><li>What is the quantity surveyor's level of awareness and acceptance on Risk Management practice?</li> <li>What is the current practice of risk management amongst Quantity Surveyors’?</li> <li>What barriers and challenges face the implementation of risk management in construction project from the quantity surveyor's point of view?</li> </ol></div> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <div> <ol><li>Ho: Awareness and acceptance of risk management practices do not aid quantity surveyors in attaining contruction project objectives</li> <li>Hi: Awareness and acceptance of risk management practices aid quantity surveyors in attaining construction project objectives</li> </ol></div> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong> <br/>Findings of this study will aid Nigerian quantity surveyors in appreciating the importance of adopting proper risk management techniques in their daily jobs. Since risk management is not widely being adopted in Nigerian construction industry, this research will help to promote the practice of risk management among the industry's players.<br/>In addition to this, being an inter-discipline type of research, both the consultants and contractors and also the industry as a whole may benefit from the outcome of the research and have better understanding on risk management.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong> <br/>This research study will focus on risk management practices adopted by quantity surveyors in Uyo Local Government area of Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. All findings and recommendations from the study are limited to findings and recommendations based on the chosen sample size.<br/>In carrying out this study, the researcher was faced with time and finance constraints, as lectures did not give room for more time to extend the research time frame.

It largely been ignored by other participants in the development process, particularly planners, architects and construction specialists. This is now changing. Close attention is now paid to the feasibility and viability (and profitability) of development proposals as government and other stakeholders seek to extract developer and/or landowner contributions to affordable housing, public services and infrastructure. Consequently the theory, application and outputs from development appraisal are under intense scrutiny from a wide range of users. Since Circular 05/05 proposed the submission of financial information‟ to provide a basis for negotiations between developers and local planning authorities about viable levels of affordable housing, tests of the financial viability of development projects have become an integral part of the planning process, both at the forward planning and development control stages. At the large-scale, macro-level Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessments require proposed plans to be achievable. However, the timeframe for development can be decades rather than years and, as a result, generating detailed and reliable cost and revenue projections can be impractical. At the other end of the scale, viability appraisals are carried out to inform negotiations about affordable housing levels for a scheme about which there may be a high level of information on permitted development and expected costs over a relatively short timeframe.</p> <p>In terms of critical evaluation from the real estate academic community, development appraisal has remained something of a backwater. In contrast, often linked to market traumas, over the last four decades methods of appraising standing investment properties have been the subject of widespread academic and professional debate. Whilst the RICS monitors variance and accuracy of investment valuations, there is no comparative institutional evaluation of the performance of development appraisals. Nevertheless, conventional development viability models have been subject to some criticism, particularly their simplified composition, failure to mirror reality and theoretical weaknesses.</p> <p><strong>1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong><br/>The general low usage of formal feasibility and viability appraisal techniques by contractors and developers globally often culminates into project failures, incessant claims for variations, huge financial losses and sometimes brings discomfort for people who came to enjoy themselves at these recreational centres. (Allan et al, 2007). This situation is more prevalent in redevelopment projects due to the inevitable problems of unexpected additional work, excessive requirements and scope management issues, project funding not aligned with project plans, delay, structural failure, cost overrun, etc (Naaranoja and Uden, 2007). These problems or uncertainties, among others, increase the project risk and make their management crucial if success is desired.</p> <p>Some construction projects in Owerri Urban have been abandoned due to poor or no feasibility and viability appraisal on them, while some recreational developments Owerri Golf Club, Silver Bird Cinema etc have stood the test of time, due to proper planning and forecasting. This huge expenditure and apparent failure in the primary objectives of the project led to complaints, probe panels and subsequent abandonment of the project.<br/>Research has shown that financial, political and physical risks are the most significant to Nigerian Contractors (Dada, 2010). However, of the different levels of risk (country, market or project), there is shortage of research as to how Contractors approach project planning at organisational level.</p> <p><strong>1.3 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <div> <ol><li>To explore feasibility and viability appraisal techniques used by Contractors of capital projects in Owerri Urban.</li> <li>To assess awareness and usage of formal feasibility and viability appraisal techniques by Contractors in Owerri Urban.</li> <li>To examine the success or failure of the feasibility and viability appraisal methods by Contractors in Owerri urban.</li> <li>To evaluate the impact of feasibility and viability appraisals on the development of capital projects in Owerri Urban.</li> </ol></div> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUSTIONS</strong></p> <div> <ol><li>What feasibility and viability appraisal techniques are used by capital project contractors in Owerri Urban?</li> <li>How do you gather information about newer feasibility and viability appraisal techniques and strategies to be applied in your on-going projects?</li> <li>What are the impacts of feasibility and viability appraisal on the development of capital projects?</li> </ol></div> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong><br/><strong>Ho: </strong>There is no significant relationship between feasibility study and the performance of contractors.<br/><strong>Hi</strong>: There is a significant relationship between feasibility study and the performance of contractors.<br/><strong>Ho</strong>: Feasibility study does not enhance quality deliverable in capital projects.<br/><strong>Hi</strong>: Feasibility study enhances quality deliverable in capital projects.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study gives a clear insight into the various ways in which Capital Project developers and owners in Owerri can maximise efficiency and profits through effective and efficient application of feasibility and viability appraisal methods and techniques. The study also gives a clear insight into the various impacts of feasibility and viability appraisal methods on the development of recreation properties in Owerri. The findings and recommendations of the researcher will help in building a strong and better appraisal technique and strategies for Capital Project developers in Owerri state. The impact of feasibility and viability on Capital Project development in Owerri Urban are outlined in-order for drastic measures to be taken to tackle any challenge property owners and developers may face when developing recreational centres in Owerri state.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE OF STUDY</strong><br/>This research focuses mainly on the impact of feasibility and viability appraisal on the development of capital projects in Owerri urban. Results and recommendations may not be used to generalise other Cities in Nigeria, as the researcher could not cover a wider scope due to financial and time constraints.<br/>Based on the findings of this study other possible researchable areas may include studies on the various effects of other aspects of recreational development such as property laws in Nigeria and property management and control.</p> <p><strong>1.7 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The only limitation faced by the researcher in the course of carrying out this study was the delay in getting data from the various respondents. Most respondents were reluctant in filling questionnaires administered to them due to their busy schedules and nature of their work. The researcher found it difficult to collect responses from the various respondents, and this almost hampered the success of this study.</p> <p><strong>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>Definitions of terms serve as the dictionary of this research.  The terms are defined to enable the reader understand the research more clearly.<br/><strong>Feasibility:  </strong>Erikson (2002) defined feasibility as an evaluation and analysis of the potential of the proposed project which is based on extensive investigation and research to give full comfort to the decisions makers. <br/><strong>Viability: </strong>According to Simmons (2007),Viable or viability is the ability of a thing (a living organism, an artificial system, an idea, etc.) to maintain itself or recover its potentialities.</p> <p><strong>Capital Project:</strong> this refers to long term investment requiring relatively large sums to acquire, develop, improve, and to maintain.</p> <p><strong>REFERENCES</strong></p> <div> <ul><li>Allan et al, 2007 Techniques for Effective property management  (<em>A John Wiley &amp; </em>Sons, Inc., Publication Hoboken, New Jersey.

India is one of the worst flood-affected countries, being second in the world after Bangladesh and accounts for one fifth of global death count due to floods. Nigeria is not an exception and indeed the study area as series of flooding have affected inhabitants and disrupted socioeconomic activities. Flood management and control are necessary not only because floods impose a curse on the society, but the optimal exploitation of the land and proper management and control of water resources are of vital importance for bringing prosperity in the predominantly agricultural based economy of this diversely populated country. This cannot become technically feasible without effective flood hazard maps (Pradan, 2004)  </p> <p>Flood hazard mapping and flood inundation modeling are the vital components in flood mitigation measures and land use planning. Advances in geospatial technologies (GPS, Remote sensing and GIS) has enabled the acquisition of data and analysis of the river basin for flood mitigation projects (either structural or non-structural) in a faster and more accurate manner. GIS facilitates integration of spatial and non-spatial geographical data such as rainfall and stream flows. Other information such as flood maps, infrastructures and land use, social and economic information can be inventorized for future use. Flood maps prepared using satellite images of real flood events and information from the ground are useful for flood damage assessment, future flood mitigation planning. Flood vulnerability maps produced using GIS enabled effective tools for land use planning, flood management and development control. Therefore, an attempt has been made to apply modern techniques like Geographical Information System (GIS) for the management of flood in Port Harcourt, the study area, as it has been proved that the use of Geoinformatics to manage the databases, maps, and photos improves the ease of the analysis (Wisner et al., 2004; Noson, 2002).</p><p>   1.2       Statement of Problem </p> <p>Floods are among the most destructive acts of nature. World-wide, flood damages to agriculture, houses and public utilities amount to billions of dollars each year in addition to the loss of precious human and cattle lives (R.K.Khanna, 1989). In majority of cases, ‘flooding’ is caused by a river over-spilling its banks. This can be due to excessive precipitation, combined with inadequate channel capacity. Over-spilling can also occur due to obstruction in or aggradation of the river bed.</p> <p>Flooding can also result from inadequate water way at rail and road crossings, or when there are encroachments in the flood plain. Flooding can also occur at confluences of streams when the main river is in high stage and backs up into the tributaries and areas there about. <br/>Flood risk is among the most severe risks on human lives and properties, and has become more frequent and severe along with local economic development. As the watershed becomes more developed, it also becomes more hydrological active, changing the flood volume, runoff components as well as the origin of stream flow. In turn, floods that once occurred infrequently during predevelopment periods have now become more frequent and more severe due to the transformation of the watershed from rural to urban land uses. The forecast and simulation of floods is therefore essential for planning and operation of civil protection measures and for early flood warning. The effects of Global warming has also accelerated the melting of ice, which in turn increased the water level and resulting in the occurrence of flooding. Flooding causes a lot of damage, which is usually, characterize by loss of properties and even leaving families homeless. </p> <p>The 2012 Nigeria floods began in early July 2012, and have killed 363 people and displaced over 2,100,000 people as of 5th November, 2012. From May to September, Nigeria has a rainy season and suffers from seasonal flash floods. These flash foods are sometimes lethal, especially in the rural areas or overcrowded slums, where drainage is poor or does not exist at all. On 2 July 2012, many Nigerian coastal and inland cities experienced heavy rains, and residents of Lagos were \"gasping for breath\" due to the flooding. In addition, there was a gridlock on major roads, causing people to cancel or postpone appointments they may have had. Thousands of stranded commuters had to pay increased fares for the few bus drivers who were willing to risk travelling on the roads, and construction of work by the Nigerian government on the inner Oke-Afa Road took a \"heavy toll.\"</p> <p>In mid-July 2012, flooding in the Ibadan metropolis caused some residents at Challenge, Oke-Ayo, and Eleyele to flee from their residences and save their lives. The flooding also prevented some Christians from attending churches in the morning, while a few bridges caved in. In late July 2012, at least 39 people were killed due to flooding in the central Nigerian Plateau state. Heavy rainfall caused the Lamingo dam to overflow near Jos, sweeping across a number of neighborhoods in Jos, and approximately 200 homes were submerged or destroyed. In addition, at least 35 people were missing, while Manasie Phampe, the head of the Red Cross in the state, announced that relief efforts were ongoing. The floods left 3,000 people homeless, many of whom are taking refugee in government buildings in Jos. In mid-August, flooding killed at least 33 people in central Nigeria's Plateau state. Over 12,000 people were affected by the flooding in six districts of the state, while hundreds were rendered homeless (Wikipedia). <br/>Port Harcourt was not an exception, as  a heavy rainfall weekend wreaked havoc in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, destroying property and rendering families homeless (The Vanguard Nigeria). The perennial flooding has caused a lot of damage and untold hardship to the inhabitants of the study area. The study therefore seeks to assess the vulnerability of the study area to flooding using Geoinformatics techniques.</p><p>   </p> <p><strong>1.3       Aim and Objectives</strong><br/>The aim of this research is to employ Geoinformatics (Geographical Information System (GIS), remote sensing and cartographic) techniques to generate flood vulnerability map showing buildings and roads that are  susceptible to flooding in the study area of Port Harcourt at different buffer distances. <br/>The following specific objectives were pursued in order to achieve the above aim:</p> <div> <ol><li>Conversion of existing analogue map to digital format by digitizing (creating spatial database).</li> <li>Creating a suitable attribute database for the study area.</li> <li>Link both spatial and attribute database.</li> <li>To generate buildings in the study area to ascertain those that are vulnerable to flooding.</li> <li>To produce vulnerability maps of the study area.</li> </ol><ul><li>To identify the impact which floods will have on the socio-economic livelihoods of the people.</li> </ul><ol><li>Make recommendations based on the findings.</li> </ol></div> <p><strong>1.4       Significance of the Study</strong><br/>The recent flooding that occurred in various part of Nigeria makes this research expedient, to allow for action to prevent such disaster from occurring. The significance of this research work cannot be overemphasized as it has tremendous importance and positve impact on almost all sectors of the economy, government departments and the society at large. These significance include;</p> <div> <ul><li>The research work provides information on the flood vulnerability of infrastructures in the study area.</li> <li>The work provides satellite derived data of the study area for further studies and research.</li> <li>The research work increases and add to the knowledge of the study area.</li> <li>It further exposes and prove the potentiality, accuracy and efficiecy of Geoinformatics as a technology for the study of flood hazard management.</li> </ul></div> <p><strong>1.5       Scope of the Study</strong> <br/>The scope of the study is limited to Port Harcourt which is the study area and its immediate environment. The study only took into consideration buildings that are vulnerable to flooding at selected buffer distances of 20 meters, 30 meters and 50 meters; and roads that are susceptible to flooding at selected buffer distances of 60 meters, 80 meters and 100 meters.</p> <p><strong>1.6       Study Area</strong><br/><strong>1.6.1    Location</strong><br/>Port Harcourt (Igbo: <em>Diobu</em>, <em>Iguocha</em> or <em>Ugwuocha</em>; Pidgin: \"Po-ta-kot\") is the capital of Rivers State, Nigeria. It is situated in ObioAkp, Rivers, Nigeria, its geographical coordinates are Latitude 4° 47' 21\" North, and Longitude 6° 59' 55\" East and its original name (with diacritics) is Port Harcourt. It lies along the Bonny River and is located in the Niger Delta. According to the 2006 Nigerian census Port Harcourt has a population of 1,382,592.</p> <p><strong>1.6.2    Climate</strong><br/>Port Harcourt features a tropical monsoon climate with lengthy and heavy rainy seasons and very short dry seasons. Only the months of December and January truly qualifies as dry season months in the city. The harmattan, which climatically influences many cities in West Africa, is less pronounced in Port Harcourt. Port Harcourt's heaviest precipitation occurs during September with an average of 370 mm of rain. December on average is the driest month of the year, with an average rainfall of 20 mm. Temperatures throughout the year in the city are relatively constant, showing little variation throughout the course of the year. Average temperatures are typically between 25°C-28°C in the city.</p> <p><strong>1.6.3    Geology/ Soil</strong><br/>Port Harcourt lies on the recent coastal plain of the eastern Niger Delta. Its surface geology consists of fluvial sediments. This includes the recent sediments transported by Niger River distributaries and other rivers, such as Andoni, Bonny and New Calabar. These materials deposited as regolith overburden of 30m thickness are clays, peat, silts, sands and gravels. The depositional sequence exhibits massive continental sand stones overlying an alternation of sandstones and clays of marginally marine origin, but eventually grading downwards into marine clays. Sands, by far, form the largest group of rock types in Rivers State, while mud constitutes all the polluted brackish waters of the riverine areas. However, peat constitutes the various vegetal and animal remains that lie in bogs and shallow pits. The gravel and pebbles form the last unit of the subsurface rock type, and are usually found at the base of the river channels. There are three major soil groups in Rivers State, namely: the marine and fluvial marine sediments; the mangrove swamp alluvial soils; and freshwater brown loams and sandy loams. The marine and fluvial marine sediments are found in the wet coastal region. The soils are organic in nature and essentially sandy in texture. Some consist of mud mixed with decayed organic matter. The mangrove swamp alluvial soils are found in the northern part of the coastal sediments zone. They are brownish on the surface, sometimes with an unpleasant and offensive odour. The soils of the swamps are rich in organic matter in the top layer, but contain too much salt especially in the dry season. The third soil group, the brown loams and sandy loams are found in the fresh water zone of the delta. The levees which form the common land forms of this zone are made up of rich loams at their crests, changing to more acidic and more clayed soils along their slopes.</p> <p><strong>1.6.4    Vegetation</strong><br/>The \"upland\" area was originally occupied by rainforest which has been drastically modified by human activities. In most places, economic trees, particularly oil palm, have been preserved and thus the sobriquet for this vegetation as \"oil palm bush.\" The riverine area is divisible into three main hydro-vegetation zones namely, the beach ridge zone, the saltwater zone and the freshwater zone.  The beach ridge zone is vegetated mainly by fresh water swamp trees, palms and shrubs on the sandy ridges and mangroves in the intervening valleys or tidal flats. The saltwater zone is the tidal flat or swamps vegetated by the red stilts rooted mangrove (Flhizophora racemosa) and two other species of mangrove. The outliers of raised alluvial ground or coastal plain terrace within the swamps are vegetated by tall forest tree species and oil palm. The freshwater zone is mainly the Upper and Lower Delta floodplains of the Niger, having fresh water forest trees which are the edaphic variants of the rainforest. The Abura tree, oil palm, raffia palm, shrubs, lianas, ferns and floating grasses and reeds are the typical vegetation.</p> <p><strong>1.6.5    Hydrology</strong><br/>Rainfall in Port Harcourt is seasonal, variable, and heavy. Port Harcourt is a city of physical difficulties, such as low lying terrain riddled with an intricate system of natural water channels; too much surface water and a high rainfall; uninhabitable mangrove swamps and some parts of the state suffer from inaccessibility due to seasonal flooding.</p> <p><strong>1.6.6    Socio-economics activities</strong><br/>Port Harcourt is the heart of Nigeria’s Oil industry with virtually all major multi-national oil companies being represented there until recently owing to security threats from Niger Delta militants and Cultists. The economic activities of Port Harcourt include manufacturing such as food processing, car assembly, manufacture of paper products, paints, petroleum products refinery and road construction, metal works and cement making, enamelware, bicycles, furniture, and soap making. Services include legal services, hospitality, medical, Educational and engineering services. Extractive industries also exist such as mining of coal, tin and petroleum, oil and gas liquefaction. Also agricultural and agro based businesses exist in the city some of which are logging and timber processing, tobacco processing and cigarette making, plastic moulding and the manufacture of rubber based products like tyres, bands and tube and glass making. Imports are mainly automobiles, electronics, textiles and processed food. Sometimes rice, millet and meat and other agricultural produce are imported as well. Then numerous small scale enterprises like consumer retailing, artisanship and transportation businesses also thrive in the city. Various government organs such as the Nigerian Ports Authority, NNPC and the customs play various regulatory roles in the local economy.  The main industrial area of the city is Trans Amadi. Residential areas include Port Harcourt Township known locally as \"Town\", G.R.A phases 1-5, Abuloma, Amadi-ama, Amadi Flats, and Borokiri.  <br/>Crime rate in Port Harcourt Nigeria is one of the highest. The worst cases so far have been crimes committed by criminal gangs disguising their illegality as freedom struggles for the marginalized locals of the oil rich Niger Delta Region. Other than these and congestion, Port Harcourt Nigeria is largely a peaceful and sociable city. With many recreational and fun spots, Port Harcourt can boast of a number of 5 star hotels such as the Meridien Hotel, Presidential Hotel among others. Also newly open entertainment centres with cinemas, night clubs, bars and restaurants can be found in the city.</p> <p><strong>1.7       Limitations of the Study</strong><br/>This research work was not without some limitations. The major limitations of this study was that the study area was very wide and so difficult to get all the attributes for roads and buildings with available map  not providing all the names of the roads and rivers; and the usage of buildings.</p> <div>These limitations however were overcame by proper digitization of the satellite imagery, giving code names to roads and rivers were the names were not known and generalizing buildings.</div>\n\nAPPLICATION OF GEOINFORMATICS TECHNIQUES IN CONTROLLING FLOODING IN VULNERABLE ROADS AND BUILDINGS IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " APPLICATION OF GEOINFORMATICS TECHNIQUES IN CONTROLLING FLOODING IN VULNERABLE ROADS AND BUILDINGS IN NIGERIA", "id": 21}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong><br/><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>It is a paradox that Nigeria is a rich country inhabited by the poor. Her poverty profile in statistical figures according to a recent study indicates that Nigeria is poverty endemic. Poverty incidence increased between 1980 and 1985 and between 1992 and 1996. The trend also shows that there has been appreciable decrease in poverty rates between 1985 and 1992 and 1996 and 2004. In 2004, growth in population almost equals growth in poverty since 1980.</p> <p>Poverty has predominated in the rural area than in the urban area by 63.3% and 43.2% respectively. The trends in poverty levels by zones show that in the northern part of the country, the North-East zone has a higher incidence of poverty followed by North-West and North-Central.<br/>Out of over 160 million population at 3.2% population growth rate, 5.3% unemployment rate, real GDP growth rate of 5.7%, oil sector growth rate of 4.31%, non-oil sector growth rate of 8.93%, inflation rate of 8.50%, about half of the total population (68.7million) live below poverty line (Ladan, 2002).</p> <p>Corruption in the management of public procurement and finance is a veritable area for corrupt practices. Every state must at various times procure goods and services. This calls for request for contract practices, is that public officials disclose to those with interest in the bid, the position of things, this unfairness leads to a situation in which honest bidders are outmaneuvered by smart allies. The bidding process favors those who lest disposed to perform and the end-product suffers from mediocre handling. Very often, the favored bidders later ask for contract price adjustment upwards. The eventual consequence is that the buildings cost more and are often poorly executed.</p> <p>Transparency and objective criteria should guide government procurements, contract awards and other financial management of public finance.<br/>All information about a tender or contract must be widely disseminate for all those who have an interest to prepare their tenders, consults with their tenders, consults with their financiers, architects, structural engineers and other consultants in order to enable them make informed bids. Time, being of essence, must be adequate. Many prospective bidders have been cut by shortage of the time allowed for preparations and have been stampeded into hasty evaluations leading to their inability to perform the contracts or evaluations leading to their inability to perform the contracts or poor performance or even abandonment of work on site. This is very common in developing states. The terrain is littered with uncompleted projects resulting from the initial rush to bid. This is full disclosure of all material facts in order to facilitate the contracts award process, which would eliminate insider informants, insider trading and other malignant practices.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>Corruption in public procurement of goods and services and management of government contracts have marred every efforts put by the federal government in establishing the procurement act 2007. This problem of corruption starts right from the invitation for contractors to summit tenders for government contracts (Eziokwu , 2008).</p> <p>Legal assessment (through the ministerial tender board units) of contracts which is a mandatory process every contractor biding for a government contract must pass through is not as effective as it ought to be. Despite the legal assessment on contractors and contracts, we still have cases of abandoned projects, elephant projects and poorly delivered projects. All these problems indicate a loophole hole in our legal systems and high rate of nepotism and favoritism in our procurement systems.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The main aim of this study is to examine the role legal assessment has played with respect to contract and tenders for contracts in Nigeria. Specific objectiveof the study are:</p> <div> <ol><li>To examine challenges militating against the effective assessment of contracts and tender for contracts in Nigeria.</li> <li>To identify the role the ministerial tender board unit (MTB) has played in promoting transparent and efficient contract tender system for contracts in Nigeria.</li> <li>To evaluate the impact of legal assessment on contracts and tenders for contracts in Nigeria.</li> </ol></div> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>In-order to achieve the above objectives, the researcher formulated the following research questions:</p> <div> <ol><li>What are the challenges faced by the ministerial tender board in the assessment of contracts and tenders for contracts in Nigeria?</li> <li>What specific roles have the ministerial tender board (MTB) played in promoting transparent and efficient tender system in Nigeria?</li> <li>What impact has legal assessment on contracts and tenders for contracts had on the outcome of the project?</li> </ol></div> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong><br/>The following null and alternate hypotheses were formulated for the study:</p> <div> <ol><li>Ho: The Ministerial Tender board (MTB) has not effectively carried out their task due to government interference and favoritism.</li> </ol></div> <p>Hi: The ministerial Tender Board (MTB) has effectively carried out their task without government interference and favoritism.</p> <div> <ol><li>Ho: Shortfall in the legal assessment process of contract tenders is responsible for low quality construction projects in Nigeria.</li> </ol></div> <p>Hi: Shortfall in the legal assessment process of contract tenders is responsible for low quality construction projects in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The study will give insights into the various challenges faced by contractors in the tendering/bidding process for government contracts. These heighted challenges will enable the government and other stakeholders to help develop a leveled playground that will enable both small and medium scale contractors to be able to bid for contracts effectively without fear. The study will also go a long way in recommending some policies that will enable the government to implement policies that will make our contract tendering process more transparent and effective.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The study will cover the role of legal assessment in contract tenders for companies in Nigeria, using the Ministerial Tender Board (MTB) unit of the Federal Ministry of Interior, Abuja as a case study.</p> <p><strong>1.8 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Some of the people felt reluctant to answer the questionnaire also few who answered did not comprehend how to answer the questionnaire properly. Certain vital questions relating improvement have being massively ignored.<br/>The researcher was not able to see all the teachers, non-academic staff and students to share thoughts on the topic, due to busy schedules of the populations</p> <p><strong>1.9 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>1. Legal: Allowable or enforceable by being in conformity with the law of the land and the public policy; not condemned as illegal. See also lawful and legitimate.<br/>2. Law: Law is a term which does not have a universally accepted definition, but one definition is that law is a system of rules and guidelines which are enforced through social institutions to govern behavior. Laws are made by governments, specifically by their legislatures. <br/>3. Finance: This is the study of how people allocate their assets over time under conditions of certainty and uncertainty. A key point in finance, which affects decisions, is the time value of money, which states that a unit of currency today is worth more than the same unit of currency tomorrow. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level, and expected rate of return. Finance can be broken into three different sub categories: public finance, corporate finance and personal finance.<br/>4. Tender: A tender is a formal, structured invitation to suppliers to bid to supply products or services. In the public sector, such a process may be required and determined in detail by law to ensure that such competition for the use of public money is open, fair and free from bribery and nepotism.<br/>5. Project management is the discipline of planning, organizing, motivating, and controlling resources to achieve specific goals. A project is a temporary endeavour with a defined beginning and end (usually time-constrained, and often constrained by funding or deliverables), undertaken to meet unique goals and objectives, typically to bring about beneficial change or added value. The temporary nature of projects stands in contrast with business as usual (or operations), which are repetitive, permanent, or semi-permanent functional activities to produce products or services. In practice, the management of these two systems is often quite different, and as such requires the development of distinct technical skills and management strategies.<br/>5. Contract:  Erikson (2002) defined Contract as an agreement that creates an obligation binding upon the parties thereto. The essentials of a contract are as follows: (1) mutual assent; (2) a legal consideration, which in most instances need not be pecuniary; (3) parties who have legal capacity to make a contract; (4) absence of fraud or duress; and (5) a subject matter that is not illegal or against public policy.<br/>6. Contract Planning: According to Simmons (2007), Contract planning is the process of systematically and efficiently managing contract creation, execution and analysis for maximising operational and financial performance and minimising risk.</p> <p>7. Cost: Hudson (1999) defined cost as the value of money that has been used up to produce something, and hence is not available for use anymore. In business, the cost may be one of acquisition, in which case the amount of money expended to acquire it is counted as cost. In this case, money is the input that is gone in order to acquire the thing. This acquisition cost may be the sum of the cost of production as incurred by the original producer, and further costs of transaction as incurred by the acquirer over and above the price paid to the producer. Usually, the price also includes a mark-up for profit over the cost of production.</p> <p>8. General contractor, organization or individual that contracts with another organization or individual (the owner) for the construction of a building, road or other facility.</p> <p><strong>REFERENCES:</strong></p> <div> <ul><li>Eziokwu S.A., Good Governance: - Theory and Practice (2008): - The Regent Publishing Co.

The cultural paradigm comprises various beliefs, values, rituals and symbols that govern the operating style of the people within a company. Corporate culture binds the workforce together and provides a direction for the company. In times of change, the biggest challenge for any organization may be to change its culture, as the employees are already accustomed to a certain way of doing things (Ojo, 2008).</p> <p>The dominant culture in organizations depends on the environment in which the company operates the organization’s objectives, the belief system of the employees and the company’s management style. Therefore, there are many organizational cultures. For example, highly bureaucratic and well-structured organizations typically follow a culture with extensive controls. Employees follow standard procedures with a strict adherence to hierarchy and well-defined individual roles and responsibilities. Those in competitive environments, such as sales, may forgo strict hierarchies and follow a competitive culture where the focus is on maintaining strong relationships with external parties. In this instance, the strategy is to attain competitive advantages over the competition. The collaborative culture is yet another organizational way of life. This culture presents a decentralized workforce with integrated units working together to find solutions to problems (Cascio, 2006).</p> <p>Strong corporate cultures indicate that employees are like-minded and hold similar beliefs and ethical values. When these beliefs and ethical values align with business objectives, they can prove to be effective in building teams because rapport and trust quickly ensues. The bonds that the teams build help them avoid conflicts and focus on task completion. Strong corporate cultures ease communication of roles and responsibilities to all individuals. Employees know what is expected of them, how management assesses their performance and what forms of rewards are available.</p> <p>Organizational cultures can have varying impacts on organizational performance and motivation levels of employee. Oftentimes, employees work harder to achieve organizational goals if they consider themselves to be part of the corporate culture. Different cultures operating in one company can also impact performance. For example, if the organization maintains a reserved “talk when necessary” culture, employees may work accordingly; however, if the organization allows one area, say the sales team, to be outspoken and socially active, the organization may experience rivalries among areas. Thus, allowing an area to set up their own culture can affect the performance of the employees deployed elsewhere in the company (Schein, 2004).</p> <p>However, organizations must structure their recruitment processes to attract and engage incumbents with the same beliefs and values that constitute the organization’s culture. This ensures the new employee’s assimilation to the company and further strengthens corporate culture. Companies should also ensure that they align corporate culture with performance management systems. When culture and management systems are not aligned, management must redirect them so that employee behavior results in the achievement of organizational goals.<br/>Organizational culture comprises the unwritten customs, behaviors and beliefs that determine the \"rules of the game\" for decision-making, structure and power. It's based on the shared history and traditions of the organization combined with current leadership values. In effect, culture dictates the way we do business here and the organizational survival tactics that facilitate assimilation and personal success (Dave and Urich, 2011). With a strong organizational culture, employees do things because they believe it's the right thing to do and feel they'll be rewarded for their actions.</p> <p>However, if the leadership team lacks integrity or squelches diversity, powerful cultures can morph into cults, cliques, castes and insider clubs. Organizational culture can be treated as a series of distinctive characteristics of a specific organization. Some modern definitions of organizational culture are dynamic, directed at creativity, innovations and entrepreneurship. Organizational culture includes; a system of ideas and concepts, customs, traditions, procedures and habits for functioning in a specific macro culture» (Harris, 1981). Organizational culture is a series of values, standards and beliefs (Handy, 1986). Organizational culture is implicit, invisible, intrinsic and informal awareness of the organization which directs behaviour of individuals and which results from their behaviour (Scholz, 1987).</p> <p>In understanding organizational culture it is very important to know all its elements. Authors are not unanimous about what are the elements of the organizational culture. According to Armstrong (Žugaj, Cingula, 1992) there are four important elements of organizational culture. These are; organization value, organization climate, Leadership style, work processes and system. The culture of an organization refers to the behaviour patterns and standards that bind it together Schein (2004). A company's culture tells the people who work for it what is right and wrong, what to believe, what not to believe, how to react and how to feel. And its actions speak louder than its words. However, the researcher seeks to assess the effect of organizational culture on the performance of quantity surveying firms in Nigeria. </p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>Generally, behaviour patterns of employee towards organizational performance are most strongly influenced by the leaders of the organization. The words and actions of the quality control and production managers reflect the values and beliefs of senior management. Performance management is the process of creating a work environment or setting in which people are enabled to perform to the best of their abilities. </p> <p>According to Cascio (2006) performance is the degree of an achievement to which an employee's fulfill the organizational mission at workplace. He continues to say that the job of an employee is build up by degree of achievement of a particular target or mission that defines boundaries of performance. According to Ojo  (2008) despite the plethora of studies on organizational culture in the last few decades, the empirical evidences emerging from various studies about the effect of organizational culture on performance have so far yielded mixed results that are inconclusive and contradictory. He further states that researchers concur on the fact that there is no agreement on the precise nature of the relationship between organizational culture and performance.<br/>Because of these results the question of whether organizational culture affects employee performance is however worthy of a further research. Hence, this study seeks to analyze the effect of organizational culture on the performance of quantity surveying firms in Nigeria. </p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The general objective of this study is to analyze the effect of organizational culture on the performance of quantity surveying firms in Nigeria and the following are the specific objectives:</p> <div> <ol><li>To examine the effect of organizational culture on the performance of quantity surveying firms in Nigeria</li> <li>To identify the type of organizational culture that existed among the quantity surveying firms in Nigeria</li> <li>To identify factors hindering the performance of quantity surveying firms in Nigeria.</li> </ol></div> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <div> <ol><li>What is the effect of organizational culture on the performance of quantity surveying firms in Nigeria?</li> <li>What are the types of organizational culture that existed among the quantity surveying firms in Nigeria?</li> <li>What are factors hindering the performance of quantity surveying firms in Nigeria?</li> </ol></div> <p><strong>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</strong><br/>HO: There is no significant relationship between the organizational culture and the performance of quantity surveying firms in Nigeria<br/>HA: There is significant relationship between the organizational culture and the performance of quantity surveying firms in Nigeria<br/><strong>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study on the effect of organizational culture on the performance of quantity surveying firms in Nigeria is significant in the following ways:</p> <div> <ol><li>It will enlighten quantity surveyors and other stakeholders in Nigeria on the need for better organizational culture as the result from this study will guide them in selecting and adopting better organizational culture in the organization for better performance.</li> <li>This research will be a contribution to the body of literature in the area of the effect of organizational culture on the performance of quantity surveying firms in Nigeria, thereby constituting the empirical literature for future research in the subject area.</li> </ol></div> <p><strong>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study on the effect of organizational culture on the performance of quantity surveying firms in Nigeria covers all the quantity surveying firms in Nigeria by carefully examining their organizational culture and its effect on organizational performance.

It is now evident that the adoption of Information Technology can enhance construction productivity and improve communications for effective decision-making and coordination among construction participants. The ability of the industry to avail itself of technology depends on the level of usage by construction participants including the Quantity Surveyor (QS) who plays a major role in the management of project success determinants, such as cost, time and quality. </p> <p>It is apparent that we live in a dynamic world characterized by incessant technology change. The explosive growth of information and communication technology (ICT) otherwise shortened as information technology (IT) has had unquantifiable impact on business systems and processes (Rivard et al., 2004). Advancement in information technology has made possible fundamental changes in the method of practice in all businesses and industries although at different levels (Li, 2000). The global acceptance and widespread adoption has accelerated the dimensions of competition not only among organizations globally but among professions locally (Hampson and Tatum, 1994). </p> <p>The construction industry with the aim of leveling their colleagues in other industries have embraced the use of information technology such as internet, computing, telephoning, satellite communication and electronic mailing to perform most, if not all of their activities (Ibidapo, 2000). The quantity surveyors’ ability to avail themselves of these emerging opportunities provided by the advent of information technology depends on the adoption of new technologies (Castle, 2002). There is quite a lot of development in all areas of computer application to the industry. Of note are the expert systems, artificial intelligence, knowledge-base systems (KBS), artificial neural networking (ANN), robotics and computer aided design (Arif and Karam, 2001). Rivard et al. (2004) opined that the evolution of information technology will have a profound impact on how organizations in the architectural, engineering and construction industry operate in the way other industries such as manufacturing and banking have adopted and benefited from long ago. He noted that this is already the case in many of the developed countries around the world. In lieu of this, Honey (1998) reported that the turn of the last century has seen a reduction in paper-based operation in quantity surveying (QS) offices in UK while electronic led-processes are leading to less dependence on taking-off sheets and other ancillary stationery. The quantity surveying profession in Nigeria has experienced significant changes over the past decade in terms of the scope and type of services provided within the construction industry (Oladapo, 2006). These changes have occurred primarily in response to changing industry/client demands, information technology developments, increased levels of competition for services and the vital role of the quantity surveying in achieving improved service delivery. Moreover, given the increasingly global nature of construction industry obstinate by extremely high levels of domestic competition and resultant low profit margin levels, there is no doubt that the construction industry has to improve its information flow and project delivery mechanism (Wager, 1998). Thus, as information flow increasingly become electronic, quantity surveying computing facilities, software and databases will need to develop in a compatible manner. Nigerian quantity surveyors will need to adapt to changes in work patterns to improve their efficiency and develop new markets to maintain competitive advantage and enhance profitability through the adoption of IT. In summary, the Nigeria construction industry in general and the quantity surveying profession in particular are facing the challenges of effectively utilizing the rapid expanding technological environment in which it operates to its full advantage (Oyediran and Odusami, 2004). </p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>It is a known fact that advancement in technology and evolution of information technology as dramatically change the way business is conducted by various professionals. It has reduced the cost of services, reduces labour and saves time.

A case study in Aba urban of Abia state. It is a comprehensive research on the course of population growth problems, and benefits of the growth on land development. There is no doubt that at present, there is link between development and population growth. However, the fact that the two opinion are related to each other in many cases, it is the main negative relationship between population and growth and the level of land development as said in the study is that programmes for controlling the rate of population growth should be encouraged. Therefore, it is common practices among countries to have a population census every ten years to know the number of people in that country such as males, females, age and occupational groups. The main point of this write-up is emphasizes on the physical components of environment because population growth has effected buildings, roads, landuse and development which makes up the urban areas. </p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>CONTENTS                                                                                                  PAGES</p> <p>TITLE PAGE</p> <p>APPROVAL PAGE                                                                                                  i</p> <p>DEDICTION                                                                                                             ii</p> <p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT                                                                                       iii</p> <p>ABSTRACT                                                                                                               iv</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS                                                                                          v</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>INTRODUCTION                                                                                                    1</p> <p>AIMS AND OBJECTIVE                                                                                         2          </p> <p>THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY                                                                                4</p> <p>ORGANIZATION  OF THE STUDY                                                                     4</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p>THE STUDY AREA                                                                                                 6          </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p> <p>DATA METHODOLOGY                                                                                       8</p> <p>DATA ANALYSIS AND FINDING                                                                       8</p> <p>SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS                                             9</p> <p>CAUSES OF POPULATION GROWTH                                                               10</p> <p>THE EFFECT OF POPULATION                                                                          12</p> <p>EFFECTS OF TRANSPORTATION                                                                      12</p> <p>EFFECTS ON HOUSING AND ACCOMMODATION                          13</p> <p>EFFECTS ON WATER AND ELECTRICITY                                                       14        </p> <p>EFFECTS ON THE IMPROVEMENT  ON    LAND                                          14        </p> <p>EFFECTS ON DEMAND FOR FOOD                                                                  15</p> <p>EFFECTS ON  URBAN LAND USE                                                                      15        </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></p> <p>THE CONCEPT OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT                                                  17        </p> <p>POPULATION                                                                                                         18        </p> <p>EDUCATION                                                                                                            20</p> <p>URBAN LAND USE CONTROL                                                                           20        </p> <p>HOUSING                                                                                                                 21        </p> <p>TRANSPORTATION                                                                                              22        </p> <p>RECREATION                                                                                                          22        </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></p> <p>RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSION                                                   24        </p> <p>RECOMMENDATION                                                                                           24        </p> <p>CONCLUSION                                                                                                         27        </p> <p>REFERENCE            S                                                                                                          29</p> <p>QUESTIONNAIRES<strong>                                                                                                31        </strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p>The common problem facing most state in Nigeria today is how to improve the standard of living of the vast majority of their people.</p> <p>          Consequently, most state like Abia is involved in a variety of programmes designed to speed up the process of socio-economic and physical development. Development planners in different parts of Abia have realized in relent time that understanding of the population in the development process of Abia is important. </p> <p>          This is due to the fact that population has big impact on the economic, social and physical development of Abia state. It is therefore, certain that the population factor can do much to either promote or frustrate a state’s uppermost development objective. </p> <p>          This study on population impact on land development at this time the state population increased with inadequate economic and physical growth of the state that needs a study to fight against its contents future occurrence. Information has been shown that this state population has reached the four million and if measure are not taken quickly, the situation could lead to HUNGER, POVERTY, DISEASE, OVERCROWDING and can no longer be allowed in both the developed and undeveloped state. All these consequence of increasing in number of people will have a general effect on land development, the identified effects like overcrowding and poverty is what the study will aim at finding solution to its improvements. </p> <p><strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>1.                 To find out the effect of population growth on land development in Aba. </p> <p>2.                 To identity the problems associated with the effect and ways of solving them in other to better the life of the growing population. </p> <p>3.                 To find ways of minimizing the population growth in Aba. </p> <p>4.                 In other to achieve the already state objective, the main facts and figures used in this study were gathered through personal efforts and various approaches were also adopted. This includes:</p> <p>1        <strong>Field survey: </strong>In other to get some of the information already </p> <p>stated, field survey method was adopted which covered areas like Obioma Ngwa, Osisioma Ngwa, Isiala Ngwa, Isiala Ngwa South, Aba South and Aba North. </p> <p>2.       Information population census residence at Aba. </p> <p>3.       Personal interviews were held with individual and government parastatals. </p> <p>4.       Sources from Aba Local Government Authority.</p> <p>5.       Reference to journal, Newspaper and books for relevant. </p> <p>6.       Survey were conduced in several areas within the Estate Surveyors and valuers forms in Aba metropolis which help to compile and analysed to five the result presented in this study. </p> <p><strong>THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is concerned with the causes and the general problems of population growth in Aba metropolis.

The aim of this study is to examine the impact of the due process policy on construction projects delivery in Nigeria. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire distributed to 52 random selections of constructing, consulting and public organizations operating in Lagos Nigeria. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. The result shows that due process policy has a very positive impact in Niger’s procurement terrain. Adherence to due process proceedings had highest impact on cost savings, prequalification of contractors and detailed project design, quality of project delivery, and project duration. The study serve as a feedback to the construction stakeholders in Nigeria and contains useable information for optimizing the existing due process mechanism to enhance not only probity, accountability, transparency and competition in public contract awards, but also the policy’s resultant effects on quality of executed projects, delivery-on-budget and time considerations.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>Title page</p> <p>Approval ……………………………………………………………………………i</p> <p>Dedication  …………………………………………………………..……………iii</p> <p>Acknowledgment  …………………………………………………………………iv</p> <p>Abstract  ……………………………………………………………………………v</p> <p>Table of contents  …………………………………………………………………vi</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.0     Introduction  ……………………………………………………………...…1</p> <p>1.1     Background to the study …………………………………………………….1</p> <p>1.2     Statement of problem ………………………………………………….……3</p> <p>1.3     Research question</p> <p>1.4     Purpose of study …………………………………………………………….4</p> <p>1.5     Significance of the study ……………………………………………………5</p> <p>1.6     Scope of the study …………………………………………………..………6</p> <p>1.7     Definition of terms  …………………………………………………………6</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p>2.0     Review of Related Literature  ………………………………………………8</p> <p>2.1     The concept of cash flow</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p> <p>3.0   Research methodology</p> <p>3.1   Research design</p> <p>3.2   Description of population</p> <p>3.3   Method of data collection</p> <p>3.4   Sample  size</p> <p>3.5   instrument for Data collection</p> <p>3.6   Validation of the instrument</p> <p>3.7   Distribution and Retrieva</p> <p>3.8   Method of Data analysis</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER  FOUR</strong></p> <p>Presentation of data and Analysis</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER 5</strong></p> <p>5.0   Discussion of findings, conclusion and</p> <p>5.1   Summary of findings</p> <p>5.2   Conclusion</p> <p>5.3   Recommendation</p> <p>5.4   Limitation of the study</p> <p>5.5   Suggestion for further research</p> <p>        References</p> <p>        Appendix</p> <p>        Questionnaire</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0      </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>BRIEF HISTORY OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Project success is basically to gain the research on public procurement act in the execution project Shash(1993) explains that a  construction company can either negotiate with the client or use a competitive tendering process to obtain a contract. F.U. and Drew (2002) suggest that competitive tendering is the most common method use for contractor selection.</p> <p>In competitive tendering process, a client selects a numbers of constructor to tender or not tender. The contractor need to submit an estimated cost to execute the project at hand, if they intend to tender. The client would select the contractor who submitted the best cost for executing the project (Shash 1993, P. 111). Therefore the decision to tender is the first step that contractors need to consider. The are various factors that need to be considered by the contractor in order to make a decision to tender. The decision is highly related to the specific project and macro environment. It is hard to make a decision in a limited time by the management team. The decision generally is made on the basic experience, intuition and guesses. (Egemen and Mohamed 2007, therefore are many researchers that have discovered the factors that affect the tender / no tender process unfortunately, there has not been any similar research project global economic recession, construction related activities are decreased significantly.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The statement of the study are the research design and procurement effect of tendering is a huge challenge in Act for most contractors who seek government contracts in Nigeria. A study conducted by Obuji (2003) in some West African countries, including Nigeria, revealed that some small scale contractor are not favoured during a tendering process by prospective client because, they neglect various factor that affect the success and failures of submitting a tender for a contract. Some contractors do not structure and draft their tenders in an appropriate manner, hence their chance of being contacted is reduced. Construction industry has complexity in its nature because it contains large number of parties as client contractor, consultants, stakeholders, shareholder, regulators and others contraction project in Nigeria suffer from many problem and complex issues in performance because of many reasons and factor. This project is very important to identify and to evaluate the main factor affecting, contractors tenders in construction project in Nigeria. The practices concerning with tenders such as time, cost, project owner satisfaction and safety checklists will be analyzed in order to know the main practical problem of contractors who do not win tenders as well practical solution.

The aim of this research can be broken down into the following objectives.</p> <p>1.     To assess the factor that affect contractors tenders for construction project.</p> <p>2.     To identify the challenges faced by contractors when applying for contracts in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research will help contactors become aware of what the factor which need to be considered when they intend to submit tenders for different projects. This research will also provide the information that could be used by any contractor to create a competitive bidding strategy.</p> <p>        This study will also give a dear insight into the various ways in which profit and efficiency from contracts and contracting can be increased and how the challenges facing contract tendering can be properly tackled. The study also give a clear insight into the various factors affecting tenders and their effects on contractor efficiency and chance of winning a contact in Nigeria.</p> <p>        The findings and recommendations of the researcher will help in building a strong and better contract policy and tendering guideline for contractors especially small scale contractors in Imo State other construction companies in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6   SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research focuses mainly on the assessment of the factors that affect tender for construction project, using construction companies and private contractors in Imo State as case study. Results and recommendations may not be used to generalize other construction companies or contractors in other parts of Nigeria as the researcher could not cover a wider scoped due to financial and time constraints. Based on the finding of this study other possible researchable areas may include studies on the various effect of other aspects of contracts such as contract laws in Nigeria and contract management and control.</p> <p><strong>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The only limitation faced by the researcher in the course of carrying out this study was the delay in getting data from the various respondents.</p> <p>        Most respondents were reluctant in filling questionnaires administered to them due to their busy schedules and nature of their work.

Fundamental to the provision of adequate housing in qualitative terms is the availability of housing finance. According to Olutuah (2001) housing quality in Nigeria is indeed poor; this can be glanced form he high rate of urbanization in the country which he described as social economically handicapped urbanization. The high rate of urbanization resulting form rural urban migration and high rate of population increase is without corresponding commensuration in the rate of economic development, social change and technological advancement. Urban poverty is thus concomitant of such development which finds ready expression in a high incidence of housing poverty. </p> <p>As Muoghalu (1987) observed, housing poverty is determined by the mobility to afford standard housing thus, the provision of adequate housing is hinged on the accessibility of housing finance. In Nigeria, the problems of housing are enormous and complex but the private sector had contributed immensely to its provision in the country. Onibokun (1990) opined that the private sector provides a preponderate proportion of residential building in the country. The rapid rate of urbanization, high rate of inflation and instable economy have given to increase in cost of housing which is often beyond the capacity of the medium / low income groups. </p> <p>As parts of the efforts in addressing housing problems in Nigeria, government has institute mortgage institutions to provide low cost housing loans that are accessible even to low income earners. </p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMNT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The basic problem of mortgage institutions could be viewed from the following </p> <p>·                    Increase in capital requirement </p> <p>·                    High interest rate</p> <p>·                    Management adequacies. </p> <p><strong>1.3     AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF HE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of the study is to access the effect of mortgage institutions in the provision of affordable and sustainable houses in Nigeria.</p> <p>The objectives of this study are:</p> <p>1)                To identify the various functional / operational mortgage institution in Nigeria. </p> <p>2)                To identify and evaluate the effect of mortgage institutions in the provision of affordable and sustainable housing in Nigeria. </p> <p>3)                To identify the hindrances facing mortgage institutions in Nigeria </p> <p><strong>1.4     RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>i)       Does mortgage institutions helps in provision of affordable and sustainable houses in Nigeria?</p> <p>ii)      Does mortgage institutions contribute in financing construction industry?</p> <p>iii)     Does mortgage institutions helps in carrying out housing estate in Nigeria. ?</p> <p><strong>1.5     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study was carried out with participant in the housing sector especially developers in mind that they will find this work useful to reduce difficulties involves in obtaining finance for housing development.

In the conduct of economic activities, the construction sector is always used by government as the stimulus for the buoyancy of the economy (Akindoyemi, 2011). The construction industry is therefore a critical factor or variable of progress in the drive for economic advancement of nations, especially Less Developed Countries (LDCs) such as Nigeria. Nigeria no doubt requires substantial amounts of foreign investment in the construction sector to speed up her economic growth most especially in the area of building and construction infrastructure/facilities investment and to promote development, which will in turn boost GDP. The significance of foreign capital for the provision of infrastructure development for both macroeconomic and microeconomic activities of the society, cannot therefore, be overemphasized Todero (2001) described infrastructure as the pillar of growth in Africa and it is generally inadequate and of poor quality when compared to developed nations of the world. Foreign capital has long been accepted as an inevitable input in the development process, given the fact that no country is an “island” with self sufficiency on her in terms of needed resources, to stimulate economic growth and development (Orji, 2004). This is a continuation from experience of some countries in South East Asia notably, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong (Ayo, 2008).</p>\n\nAN ANALYSIS OF THE TRENDS OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT INFLOWS IN THE NIGERIAN CONSTRUCTION SECTOR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ANALYSIS OF THE TRENDS OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT INFLOWS IN THE NIGERIAN CONSTRUCTION SECTOR", "id": 29}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Several studies on construction craft skills have identified a number of problems including ineffective training as responsible for shortages of craftsmen in the construction industry. In Nigeria, the problem of training craftsmen has been attributed to lack of a harmonised training framework. This research therefore examined existing training frameworks in craft skills training institutions and assessed the performance of the products of those institutions with a view to developing a harmonised framework for delivering effective training in Nigeria. Largely qualitative approach was adopted in conducting the research. Detailed literature review on training of craftsmen led to the development of a semi-structured interview guide which was used in conducting interviews in technical training institutions and construction organisations. In the technical institutions, senior management staff that specialised in technical training were interviewed while in the construction organisations, both management staff and craftsmen were interviewed. A total of six (6) training institutions were identified from a list of accredited technical training institutions published by the National Board for Technical Education and interviews conducted. For the construction organisations, nine (9) large construction firms were selected using purposive sampling and interviews were done with a management staff and three (3) craftsmen in each firm. Data obtained from the interviews were subjected to conceptual content analysis. The results showed the existence of different frameworks in each training institution with similarities, strengths and weaknesses. Other findings include the absence of direct collaboration between institutions and industry in delivering training; industrial training is poorly organised, supervised and the duration is inadequate; lack of prearrangement for the conduct of industrial training; training delivery is generic in most institutions regardless of the specific requirement of industries. Consequently, from the findings of the study, a harmonised framework for training construction craftsmen was developed which takes advantage of the strengths of the existing frameworks while minimising their weaknesses. The developed framework was validated using construction industry stakeholders. The study concludes that training of construction craftsmen can be delivered in a collaborative manner with all stakeholders in the construction industry performing roles based on their strategic advantage. It is recommended that sector specific technical training approach should be adopted and implemented in a collaborative manner for effective training; the developed framework for training of construction craftsmen should be adopted and implemented.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>The Construction Industry produces sky scrapers, roads, airports, ship yards, and several other structures. The production of these relies heavily on human and material resources. In terms of importance, Khalil and Lees (2006) ranked human resources higher than natural (material) and capital resources in both production and services process of an organisation. Additionally, Muya <em>et al. </em>(2006) argued that the quality of services offered by construction firms depend largely onthe quality of their workforce. Furthermore, of the workforce in the construction industry, the craft skills constitute the majority and execute most of the jobs because the industry is still manual labour intensive (Fellows <em>et al.,</em> 2002). Regrettably, this class of human resource required by construction firms are in short supply in UK, Canada, USA, Asia and Africa (Agapiou <em>et al.</em>, 1995a; Agapiou, 1998; Gann and Senker, 1998; Mckenzie, <em>et al</em>., 2000, Forde and MacKenzie, 2004; Datoegoem, 2006; Issam, 2006; McGuinness and Bannett, 2006; Muya <em>et</em> <em>al.</em>, 2006; Chan and Dainty, 2007; Smith, 2009; Abdullahi, 2010; Kikwasi, 2011; Medugu<em> et al.,</em></div> <div>2011).</div> <p>In order to make up for the shortfall in craft skills required in the construction industry, construction firms import craft skills from other countries or poach them from rival companies to improve their performance and out-play their competitors instead of training new ones (Agapiou <em>et al.</em>, 1995a; Muya<em> et al</em>., 2006).</p>\n\nDEVELOPING A HARMONISED FRAMEWORK FOR CONSTRUCTION CRAFT SKILLS TRAINING IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DEVELOPING A HARMONISED FRAMEWORK FOR CONSTRUCTION CRAFT SKILLS TRAINING IN NIGERIA", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div><em>Th</em><em>e</em><em> source and nature of output constants used for preparation of construction estimates should be accurate and reliable for the client to have confidence on the prepared estimates.

The inferential tools adopted were T-test and ANOVA statistics to assess and examine the influence of some selected labour productivity factors on the outputs of the workers observed. The inferential test revealed the following; period of observation, shape of the building and mode of employment significantly affected outputs on the ten work items. The results of the analysis carried out established mean output values per day for: 150mm thick block in foundation (<strong>12.85m</strong></em><strong><em>2</em></strong><em>); 150mm thick block in superstructure (<strong>13.22 m</strong></em><strong><em>2</em></strong><em>); 150mm thick block in superstructure overhand (<strong>12.47m</strong></em><strong><em>2</em></strong><em>); 225mm thick block in foundation (<strong>8.90m</strong></em><strong><em>2</em></strong><em>); 225mm thick block in superstructure (<strong>11.17m</strong></em><strong><em>2</em></strong><em>); 225mm thick block in superstructure overhand (<strong>9.16m</strong></em><strong><em>2</em></strong><em>); 225mm thick block isolated piers in superstructure (<strong>5.00m</strong></em><strong><em>2</em></strong><em>); 225mm thick block piers in superstructure overhand (<strong>4.57m</strong></em><strong><em>2</em></strong><em>); 225mm thick block in pit bottom plan &gt; 4 m</em><em>2</em></div> <div><em>(<strong>7.85m</strong></em><strong><em>2</em></strong><em>); 225mm thick block in bottom plan &lt; 4 m</em><em>2</em><em> (<strong>7.13m</strong></em><strong><em>2</em></strong><em>).

The research recommended that in compliance to BESMM3, the NIQS in collaboration with NJIC to sponsor a research on determination of labour outputs in all trades as a way to ensure uniformity in output constants. The study therefore finally concludes that SMM takes cognizance of productivity impact associated with labour and it is imperative for reliability and accuracy in block work estimate to empirically determine labour outputs on the basis of work items as stated in BESMM3.</em></div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>1           </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1          </strong><strong>Background of the Study</strong></div> <div>In Nigeria, like most developing countries, the construction industry plays a dominant role in the economic activities of the country.The efficiency of the construction industry has been established to heavily rely on its level of productivity. Construction productivity is constantly declining over a decade due to the lack of standard productivity data base system and ignorance of impact of various factors influencing labour productivity (Muqeem<em>et al</em>., 2011).The accuracy of the project cost estimates depend largely on the degree of accuracy of cost information obtained on the key components of an estimate (i.e. labour, plant, material, and profit and overhead) (Abdullahi, 2009), while the use of Standard Methods of Measurement (SMM) for the preparation of BOQ gives the quality and standard of the extent of work to be done, it also takes precedence of the cost significances of every classes of operations within a trade.</div> <div>The common method of generating cost estimates for construction projects involves the multiplication of unit rate by the measured quantities in the bill of quantities (Ashworth, 2002).The unit rate is a component of labour rate (obtained from the multiplication of labour constant by all-in rate) plus cost of material and percentage allowance for profit and overhead, while the measured quantities are obtained from drawings and specifications for the works rules specified by Building and Engineering Standard Methods of Measurement (BESMM3).</div> <div> RISK IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT IN HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS USING ANALYTICAL HIERARCHICAL PROCESS </div>\n\nEMPIRICAL DETERMINATION OF LABOUR OUTPUTS FOR BLOCK LAYING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EMPIRICAL DETERMINATION OF LABOUR OUTPUTS FOR BLOCK LAYING", "id": 31}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0              </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>The Construction industry in Nigeria, although generally accepted as very active, is relatively small contributing only about 1.8% to 3% to the Nigeria‟s Gross Domestic Product (NBS, 2013). The industry provides employment opportunity to teeming millions of the country‟s workforce and produce wide variety of products ranging from housing; public facilities such as hospitals, schools, offices and other institutional buildings etc. in addition to other infrastructural, industrial and engineering fabrications. Massive demand for buildings and housing, in particular, across all sectors of the economy and the refocusing by the government on infrastructural development are some of the factors attributed to the growth in the construction and property sector. In recent years, there has been an increasing emphasis on the housing subsector by different tiers of government to ensuring adequate provision of decent houses to the teeming population, yet the adequate provision of this basic need is becoming more challenging to the construction industry. It is estimated that Nigeria‟s housing deficit falls around 18-20million Housing Units (HU) with the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, alone having close to 3 million HU deficits (FMLHUD, 2006). The reaction of the construction industry to this finding is of mix feeling. The industry view it as an opportunity for a brighter feature for, at least, the housing subsector and also as a challenge for the industry to brace up, by equipping itself, for the handling of not only this present demand but also feature demands for more houses in the country.</div> <p>The housing subsector accounts for virtually 30-40% of the construction industry‟s performance at the moment.

The traditional approach to performance measurement has been criticised severally resulting to an evolution that brought about contemporary performance measurement frameworks. These frameworks have been adopted by several construction industry especially in the UK, US, Chile and Brazil. However, most organisations within the Nigerian Construction industry mostly present their financial reports (which are mainly financial measures) to portray their performance and there are no available research that presents elaborate information on the industry‟s performance measurement practice.</div> <div>The Nigerian Construction Industry is faced with several problems bordering on poor performance.The study appraised the performance measurement practice of construction firms in Nigeria. A survey questionnaire was conducted on a randomly selected 50 small and medium sized construction firms in Abuja, Nigeria. Data were analysed using the descriptive statistics method including tabulation, percentages and charts. The results of the study revealed that most construction firms are interested in how they perform and do measure their performance. The study also shows that most of the construction firms still rely on financial measures (which has been highly criticised).Findings from the study also indicate a low awareness/implementation of performance measurement and performance measurement concepts. Findings also revealed that the most adopted performance measurement framework is the Balanced Scorecard.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></div> <div>The construction industry is a fundamental economic sector that permeates most of the other sectors as it transforms various resources into physical, economic and social infrastructure necessary for socio-economic development (Ministry of Works, 2003). In Nigeria, the industry occupies an important position in the economy and has great potentials of becoming one of the biggest construction markets on the planet yet, it contributes less than other industries (Aibinu and Jagboro, 2002; Construction Overview, 2011). The Nigerian Construction Industry (NCI) is growing fast and has outgrown most sectors of the economy yet, its contribution of only 3.2% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is very low (Dantata, 2008; Construction Overview, 2011).</div> <div>The performance of the construction industry has considerable impact on the economy (Bon-Gang and Fan, 2010). The industry, globally, has been under tremendous pressure to improve its performance and several calls have been made in this regard (Kulatunga et al., 2005).In Nigeria, the NCI is faced with problems such as construction delays, time and cost overruns, abandonment of projects at various stages of completion, lack of skilled local labour, power shortage, unavailability of materials, corruption, unethical practices and lack of capacity to deliver (Aibinu and Jagboro, 2002; Dantata, 2008; Kolo and Ibrahim, 2010; Ayodele et al., 2011; Oyewobi et al., 2011). The industry suffers the problems of inefficient policies and practices, weak institutions and adverse business environment, alongside complex social and cultural practices (Aniekwu and Audu, 2010). The performance of the industry has been a concern to its stakeholders</div>\n\nAN APPRAISAL OF PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PRACTICE OF CONSTRUCTION FIRMS IN ANIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN APPRAISAL OF PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PRACTICE OF CONSTRUCTION FIRMS IN ANIGERIA", "id": 33}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Government at all levels are forced to prioritise and restrict public expenditures due to budget deficits and the inefficient management of large infrastructure projects. Due to the shortage of resources for healthcare delivery leading to decline in the quality of care, there is considerable interest in PPP initiatives for the provision of finance and management of health care to ordinary people. The PPP option due to its complexities has led to some projects failure leading to wastage of huge resources and time. Studies have shown that majority of these project failures are as a result of public opposition leading to outright cancellation of the projects. Due to the lack of empirical studies on user satisfaction with PPP projects in Nigeria, this study assessed the satisfaction of users of PPP projects from both employees and patients' perspectives of two university teaching hospitals in Nigeria. A total of 580 questionnaires were distributed to Employees and Patients of University College Hospital, Ibadan (Oyo state) and Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Lagos (Lagos state). The data received from these respondents were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics with the aid of SPSS to determine their levels of satisfaction with the facilities and services provided. It was observed that the patients were more satisfied with the projects than the employees. The patients rated the staff members the highest implying that they were quite confident in the healthcare providers‟ reliability and expertise. The employees were most satisfied with the reliability of the facilities in maintaining confidentiality. The study also observed that there is a positive significant relationship between quality parameters and overall satisfaction. The study therefore concluded that necessary improvement adjustments need to be done in all areas of quality performance especially the facilities to increase the satisfaction of the users of these projects.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0  </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1   </strong><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></div> <div>Endemic budget deficits and the inefficient management of large infrastructure projects and services within the public sector are a few reasons why the traditional procurement method of governments funding infrastructure projects through fiscal budgets is increasingly considered unviable (Alitheia, 2010).</div> <div>In the past few decades, developed economies (e.g. the United Kingdom) have modelled a variety of public private partnerships (PPPs) for the delivery of infrastructure, public utilities and large services projects, achieving significant successes from harnessing the competences and expertise from both sectors. Emerging markets such as India and South Africa are also recording successes using tried and tested PPP templates to create, expand and modernise infrastructure (Workshop Report, 2008). It is apparent that these dynamic partnerships between the public and private sectors have become inevitable across the globe.</div> <div>Nigeria's infrastructure challenge is huge. Reports suggest that the country requires between US$12 billion to $15 billion annually for the next six years to meet the infrastructure requirements (Izuwah, 2010). The World Bank estimates that every 1% of (government) funds invested in infrastructure leads to an equivalent 1% increase in gross domestic product (GDP). Nigeria has not had a consistent history of investment in infrastructure; however, government agenda show that infrastructure development is gaining momentum. In the past 10 years, over 25 major infrastructure projects have been rolled out through PPPs.

A total of 46 gang sizes of tilers for wall tiles 400mm x 300mm x 5mm, width &gt; 300mm long side horizontal,32 gang sizes of tilers for wall skirting 400mm x 50mm high and Riser 400mm x 150mm high were observed within Kaduna state and Abuja. Physical observations and measurement of work outputs were conducted through work study approach. The data collected were analyzed using inferential data analysis techniques. The inferential tools made use of analysis of variance (ANOVA) for multiple comparison, paired sample t-test to compare two groups that are related and independent t-test to compare two group that are not related due each activities to assess and examine the influence of the various labour productivity factors on the outputs of the workers observed..

Research has shown that the cost of building a house is high and principally depends on cost of labour and materials (Maloney, 1983, Omange, 2000).</div> <div>Mohammed <em>et al</em> (2011) stated that the construction industry lagged due to insufficient research in the area of productivity. Methods for improving construction productivity to assist managers in identifying productivity barriers and offer solutions were limited. In contrast, there are few studies of enhanced productivity in the construction industry. In reality, increasing productivity benefits the stakeholders’ in several ways: Projects are completed more quickly; Project cost is lowered; the contractor can submit more competitive bids; and the project can be more profitable.</div> <div>The construction of a house is capital intensive and seems to discourage some people from building personal houses. Government concerted effort at housing provision since independence in 1960 through the various national development plans seems not successful. Labour force in the building construction industry fall into skilled and unskilled. The financial implication of using any of the trades contribute to the cost of construction. The utilization of labour force in the construction industry accounts for a significant proportion of the cost of buildings (Udegbe, 2007).</div>\n\nAN EMPIRICAL DETERMINATION OF LABOUR OUTPUT FOR WALL TILES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN EMPIRICAL DETERMINATION OF LABOUR OUTPUT FOR WALL TILES", "id": 35}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Knowledge Management (KM) capabilities provide the supportive structure required to share knowledge within the context in which it is required in an organizations. Previous researches have shown that at least more than half of failed KM initiatives and the problem of ineffective KM occur as a result of firms not assessing their capabilities before implementing KM program. This research was aimed at assessing the KM capabilities of Nigerian Quantity Surveying firms in view of adopting and implementing KM concept. A quantitative research approach was undertaken in this study. 78 Structured questionnaires had been administered to the professionals in the practicing Quantity Surveying firms to obtain the required data for the purpose of this study. Our assessment furnished us with the extent of KM capabilities of the Nigerian Quantity Surveying firms and also provides us with the grey areas such as motivation that should be improved in order to adopt and implement KM effectively. The study reveals that Quantity Surveyors have positive perception toward the KM concept and most of them are in the view that Knowledge is a key resource to any firm that owns it and they also have the opinion that adopting and implementing KM in the Nigerian Quantity Surveying firms would enhance their ability in carrying out their cost management services.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong></div> <div>In the last decade, the importance of knowledge has been highlighted by both academics and practitioners (Wu &amp; Lin, 2009). Nowadays, knowledge is the fundamental basis of competition (Zack, 1999; Grant, 1996). Particularly tacit knowledge can be a source of competitive advantage because it is unique, imperfectly mobile, imperfectly imitable and non-substitutable. However, the mere act of processing knowledge itself does not guarantee strategic advantage. Instead, knowledge has to be managed (Zack 1999).</div> <div>During the formative age of KM, Scarborough &amp; Swan (1999) advanced that, firms that create new knowledge and apply it effectively and efficiently will be successful at creating competitive advantages. From a practice perspective, Zack (1999) further supported this view by stating that, firms are noticing the importance of managing knowledge if they want to remain competitive while Salojurvi, <em>et al</em>, (2002) advance the state by adding survival and growth. These realizations among organizations have seen companies everywhere begin to actively manage their knowledge and intellectual capital (DeTienne, <em>et al</em>, 2004).</div> <div>Within the research community, three major factors are emphasized for successful implementation of KM thus; capabilities, processes and organizational performance</div> <div>(Bechman, 1999; O’Dell &amp; Grayson, 1999; Demarest, 1997). Nonaka (1995) opined that KM capabilities are organizational mechanisms for generating knowledge continuously. Stonehouse &amp; Pemberton, (1999) added that, they can encourage acquiring knowledge, protecting knowledge and facilitating knowledge sharing in an organization. However, KM processes can be thought of as a structured coordination for managing knowledge effectively or the tasks and activities that are implemented to manage knowledge (Gold <em>et al</em>, 2001).</div>\n\nASSESSMENT OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES OF THE NIGERIAN QUANTITY SURVEYING FIRMS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES OF THE NIGERIAN QUANTITY SURVEYING FIRMS", "id": 36}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Several researches have been carried out in order to develop frameworks for determining performance of construction projects which were mostly based on Traditional criteria (i.e. cost, time and quality) only. And researches have highly criticized the use of traditional criteria only while determining construction project performance due to its inadequacy. However, literature has never developed framework for determining performance of Construction Projects using the emerging/non-traditional criteria since they also influence performance. This study developed a framework using the emerging construction projects performance criteria in the Northern Nigeria which was achieved through the following objectives; the identification of emerging criteria for determining performance of construction projects, assessment of the level of importance of the emerging criteria and development of framework for determining performance of construction projects using the emerging criteria. A total of 285 questionnaires were distributed to some construction industry stakeholders (i.e. Consultants, Contractors, Clients and End-users) were asked to assess the level of importance of the emerging criteria. A total of 147 valid questionnaires were retrieved which represents 51.58% of valid response rate and subsequently analysed using descriptive analysis with the aid of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software. The most important criteria ranked by the respondents are; client satisfaction on outcome, effective risk management, client satisfaction on cost, client satisfaction on time etc. Most important criteria ranked by respondents are client oriented base. Using the emerging criteria for determining performance of construction projects as ranked by respondents in descending of priority will help the parties of the construction industry to understand how important those criteria are. Furthermore, it was also found that most important criteria as key areas of activity which favorable results are absolutely necessary for a goal to be achieved. Additionally, using the framework developed in this study for determining performance of construction projects will help in the monitoring of performance and redirect organisational action when necessary. Lastly, it can also help the contractors’ and other key stakeholders of the construction industry particularly the clients and consultants to monitor and evaluate projects more accurately towards achieving project objectives.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>Background to the study</strong></div> <div>The construction industry is dynamic in nature due to the increasing uncertainties in technology, budgets, and development processes (Chan, Scott and Ada, 2004). They further reported that, building projects are becoming much more complex and difficult, and facing unprecedented changes. Those uncertainties, along with many other documented problems, are the root causes of project delays and decline in construction projects performance (Ofori, 1991; Ogunlana, Promkuntong and Jearkirm, 1996).</div> <div>The improvement of performance has become more critical to the success of construction projects which have been the subject of considerable amount of research and attention over the past two decades (Al-Otaibi, Omani and Price, 2013).</div> <div>Studies have shown decline in construction projects performance both locally and internationally (Ogunlana, Li and Sukhera, 2003; Komolafe, Kingsley and Muhammad<em>,</em> 2014).</div> <div>A number of authors have worked significantly on ways to improve performance from the view point of traditional criteria (i.e. cost, time and quality) (Neely <em>et al</em>., 1994; Idrus and Sodangi, 2010; Barkley and Saylor, 1994). Furthermore, in response to the decline of projects performance, several studies have developed and advocated the use of frameworks for assessing construction projects with a view to improve their performance (Cocca and Alberti, 2009; Kagioglou, Cooper and Ghassan, 2001; Belassi and Tukel, 2006). But the frameworks developed by several researches were mostly based on the traditional criteria that have been highly criticized (Paul, 2014). </div>\n\nFRAMEWORK FOR DETERMINING PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN NORTHERN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FRAMEWORK FOR DETERMINING PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN NORTHERN NIGERIA", "id": 37}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Following widespread acceptance by researchers that the effects of qualitative/managerial construction time-influencing factors need to be considered in project scope-based construction time predicting models, several multivariate models combining project scope and qualitative/managerial factors have been developed. However, it has been shown in literature that the applicability of these models is clearly limited to the regions/countries where they were developed. This study was therefore aimed at developing a multivariate construction time predicting model that will be applicable to the Nigeria construction industry. A self-administered questionnaire survey was used to source information on the quantitative (project scope) factors considered in the study as well as to assess the extent of influence of the qualitative factors on construction time. Principal component regression was used for the data analysis and model development, using SPSS 16.0 for windows. Following a non-normal distribution of errors and a low R2 value obtained when multiple linear regression analysis was first conducted, the study’s data set was double log transformed and then partitioned/reclassified to account for public and private sector projects. Three models were developed following the multiple linear regression analysis repeated after transforming and partitioning/reclassifying the study’s data set. Two of these models (the public sector model and the private sector model) had high R2 values and were found after testing and validation, to be suitable for predicting construction time, while one of the models (the all projects model) had a low R2 value and was consequently found to be unsuitable for predicting construction time. The models with high R2 values serve as a useful</div> <div>tool to project managers and contractors for predicting construction time, thereby facilitating effective planning.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER 1</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1 Background to the study</strong></div> <div>The importance of ensuring accuracy and reliability of construction time estimates at the tendering stage cannot be overemphasized. Accurate early estimates of construction time typically provides clients and contractors with a basis for evaluating the success of a project and the efficiency of the project organisation (Nkado, 1995). They also provide them with a basis for ascertaining logistical and cash flow implications for feasibility, budgeting, planning, monitoring and even litigation purposes (Skitmore and Ng, 2003). Furthermore, they serve as a criteria in determining the best combination when performing time-cost optimization (Que, 2002). It is therefore clear that construction time has become a vital tool used by clients and contractors to ensure the success of construction projects. This success will however, only be achieved when construction time is accurately predicted.</div> <div>Construction time/periods are often calculated on the basis of the planner’s own previous experience on similar projects (Choudhury and Phatak, 2004). However, as pointed out by Skitmore and Ng (2003), the need to reduce the problem of subjectivity associated with the planner’s experience and judgement to correctly interpret project and site information and make the best possible decisions, has long resulted in the development of construction time predicting models.</div> <div>The development of construction time predicting models commenced with the use of project scope factors. Project scope is a measure of project size, which can be described as construction cost, project duration, gross floor area, number of storey, building type and procurement method (Walker, 1995).</div>\n\nMODELLING BUILDING CONSTRUCTION DURATIONS IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MODELLING BUILDING CONSTRUCTION DURATIONS IN NIGERIA", "id": 38}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <p>Existing studies have established that the physical characteristics of buildings have significant influence on occupants’ satisfaction. However, studies has shown that the conventional ways that public hospital buildings in Nigeria are designed have contributed to stress, depression and anxieties because of loss of privacy, control over eating and sleeping times, and noise. And in addition contributed to dangers, allergies and other acquired infections called Hospital Acquired Infections (HAI) to patients and staff. This study assessed the performance of Primary Healthcare Centre (PHC) buildings which is identified to be the appropriate settings to tackle over 90% of the major causes of morbidity and mortality due to its proximity to about two-thirds of Nigerians. The objectives of this study were to; identify those standard performance criteria of healthcare buildings that aids healing of patients and positively influence users of PHC buildings; evaluate the perception of users on the performance of PHC buildings and outline appropriate steps to remedy the identified gaps to match up with the global standards. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in six PHC buildings across the six area councils of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Nigeria. A purposive sampling technique was used to select a total of 334 samples (patients, medical staff and visitors’) from the target population. Data were collected with the aid of an adapted version of - <em>Achieving Excellence Design Evaluation Toolkit (AEDET)</em> questionnaires. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used to present simple mean, standard deviation and test for statistical significance of the results. Ten criterion, categorized into three criteria namely; functionality, build quality and impact were identified as the required standards for healthcare building performance. They aid in the healing of patients, improve the productivity of medical staff and attract patronage from visitors. The results show that users’ perception on the <em>functionality</em> and <em>build quality</em> of the PHC buildings which concerns the extent to which it facilitates or inhibits the activities of the medical staff who carry out the functions inside and around the building was poor. Also, the staff and patient environment which was addressed by<em>impact</em> was assessed to be poor. In view of these, patients in PHC buildings do not have privacy during their stay for treatment and cannot be alone with others to have private discussions because of the multiple bed system that is currently run. The toilets, bathrooms and other facilities for the use of staff, patients and visitor are not befitting and dignified enough to attract patronage. The study recommends that the National Primary Healthcare<br/><br/></p> <div>Development Agency’s (NPHCDA) Minimum Standards for Primary Healthcare and the Ward Minimum Healthcare Package upon which the design of PHC buildings in Nigeria is based should be updated and reviewed to reflect modern trends in healthcare architecture.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1 Background</strong></div> <div>A completed building with its facilities and services must be fit for the purpose. Meaning that it should be able to perform its functions in the manner that will ensure satisfaction to its occupants (Ilesanmi, 2010; Hinde, 2012). Although buildings are constructed for different purposes (housing, school, health, etc.), their performance either excellent or poor can be seen from the eyes of its users (Ilesanmi, 2010; Jiboye, 2012). The design quality of a building have been found to influence its functions (Haciric, 2008; Ibrahim, 2011; Jiboye, 2012). For example, a well-designed school has shown to improve the teaching and learning process of teachers and students thereby improved educational achievements (Khan and Kotharkar, 2012; Khalila, Kamaruzzamanb, Baharumb, and Husina, 2015). Also, a well-designed hospital has shown to help in quick patients’ recovery, have positive impact on medical staff and visitors (Abbas and Ghazali, 2010; Ibrahim, 2011; Dandajeh, 2011).</div> <div>A number of reasons have been provided on why buildings perform poorly in meeting users’ needs and expectations. The major reason was lack of adequate knowledge of users’ changing needs and preferences by architects and other professionals who design, construct and maintain these buildings. And the panacea to improve the overall performance of buildings is to explore and understand users’ needs, expectations and aspirations through regular performance evaluation by means of Building Performance Evaluation (BPE) or Post Occupancy Evaluation (POE) (Natasha &amp; Abdul Hadi, 2008; Ibema, Opoko, Adeboye, and Amole, 2013).</div>\n\nPERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF PRIMARY HEALTH CARE (PHC) BUILDINGS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF PRIMARY HEALTH CARE (PHC) BUILDINGS", "id": 39}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The increased complexity of the society and high level of competition in the construction industry has made it imperative for contractors, project managers and construction companies to carry out serious planning in order to ensure project success and profits. This work examined project planning impact on a contractor’s profitability. The objectives were to identify project planning techniques and tools used by contractors in construction project delivery, determine factors affecting project planning practices of contractors, and to evaluate the impact of proper project planning on contractor’s profitability. The research approach involved survey design using structured questionnaire administered to 50 respondents in Owerri, Imo State, Nigeria. Spearman Ranked Correlation, Chi Square and other descriptive statistical methods were adopted for data analysis. The findings of the study revealed that Gantt chart with a mean score of 4.83 was the most commonly used tool used by contractors in project planning, and project funding not aligning with project plans with a mean score of 4.70 is the most common factor affecting project planning effectiveness. The hypothesis tests between level of use of project planning practices and contractors’ profitability using Spearman Ranked Correlation test indicated significant positive relationship between effective project planning and contractors’ profitability. The study concludes that project planning efforts influences contractor profitability in construction project delivery. The recommendations put forward were that project management teams should expose contractors to the relevance of project planning and its benefits. Clients should properly define their brief and contractor to avoid purchasing materials that won’t be used immediately in cases of installation of lifts that require heavy machinery and store houses.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Projects are used in all economic and non-economic fields as mean of organizing the activity, aiming the achievement of desired objectives. There is a direct relationship between projects, projects portfolio, programs and the organizational strategy. Projects, as the main way of creating and dealing with change (Cleland, Gareis, 2006), are used to implement strategies. Meskendahl (2010) refers to projects as the central building block used in implementing strategies, therefore business success is determined by the success of the projects. A project is an individual or collaborative enterprise, possibly involving research or design that is carefully planned, usually by a project team, to achieve a particular aim New York Time (2009). A project is also temporary because it has a defined beginning, end time, and defined scope and resources (Cathy, 2009). A project is unique because it is not a routine operation, but a specific set of operations designed to accomplish a singular goal. Based on these characteristics, carefully it is imperative to plan to achieve targeted outcome. Thus; Project planning can be defined as a part or branch of project management, which relates to the use of schedules to plan and subsequently report progress within the project environment.</p> <p>Dubois and Gadde (2002) described the construction industry as decoupled and McKinsey (2017) confirmed that it is still true. The lack of coupling is present both between the construction project and its subcontractors as well as between the project and the parent company and other projects. This hampers the possibility to have a successful coordination of resources on a portfolio level within the contractor, as resources are in many cases utilised from a common resource pool (Engwall and Jerbrant 2003).The construction industry therefore embraces a wide range of loosely integrated organizations that collectively construct, alter and repair a wide range of different building and civil engineering projects. Individuals, organizations and government need to carry out some form of project planning for building and civil engineering project before embarking on whatever activity they are engaged to do. According to Lock (2002), the principal identifying characteristics of a project is its novelty, it’s a step unknown fraught with risk and uncertainty. No two projects are ever exactly alike and even a repeated project will differ from its predecessor in one or more commercial, administrative and physical aspect.</p> <p>Construction is also characterized by time and cost intensive production processes which make it prone to project risks and failure, mainly in terms of time and cost. In practice, this means, that the performance of construction projects is usually low. In particular, construction projects are very often delayed and over budget. This is not just due to problems faced during project scheduling, but also during related processes.</p>\n\nASSESSMENT OF PROJECT PLANNING PRACTICES AND ITS IMPACT ON CONTRACTORS PROFITABILITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF PROJECT PLANNING PRACTICES AND ITS IMPACT ON CONTRACTORS PROFITABILITY", "id": 40}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The nature of construction business is risk versed. Most forms of construction contract recognized the use of insurance as risk management tool. Few studies however, evaluates its effectiveness as risk management tool. This study investigated the efficacy of insurance in curbing risks in construction project delivery. The objectives were to identify insurable risks in construction project delivery, identify prevalent insurance policies in the construction industry, and to determine their level of use. Survey questionnaire were administered to 220 targets in the clients, contractors, and consultants organisations and insurance companies in Akwa Ibom state. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics and Relative Important Index. The findings revealed the five most significant insurable risks in the construction industry as injury to person, injury to property and heavy rain, fire, poor construction method and poor site management practices. Further findings revealed the most significant insurance policies in the construction industry are bid bond, contractors all risks insurance, performance bond, motor insurance and third party insurance. The level of use of these insurance policies is however very low and their effectiveness deemed adequate to address construction risks. To promote increased adoption of insurance in construction risk management, awareness of the benefits must be propagated to the common domain.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1                Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>No construction project is risk free. Every construction project, large or small, involves risks with varying impact. The construction industry is subject to more risk and uncertainty than many other industries (Flanagan and Norman, 1993). The process of taking a project from initial investment appraisal to completion, and into use, is complex. It requires a multitude of people with different skills and interests and the co-ordination of a wide range of disparate, yet interrelated activities. Such complexity moreover, is compounded by many external, uncontrollable factors. Risk may hinder the successful completion of a project by causing time and budget over-run, and/or quality default.</p> <p>Construction insurance is used as a collective term to describe various types of policies to protect construction works, erection and operation of machinery. Traditionally, it is assumed to be only limited to the construction stage. However, the project is a whole life process, which includes a feasibility study, a call for tender and evaluation of tenders, an award of contract, construction and erection phases, and a take-over and maintenance period. Many researchers (Palmer, 1996; Bunni, 2003) discussed all possible insurance policies during the whole project process to build an overall picture of construction insurance.</p> <p>The Oxford Advanced Learner‟s Dictionary (1995) defines risk as the “chance of failure or the possibility of meeting danger or of suffering harm or loss”. In construction projects, a risk may be defined as the likelihood of a detrimental event occurring to the project. Since the objectives of construction projects are usually stated as targets established for function, cost, time and quality, the most important risk in construction is failure to meet these targets. Within the scope of management and decision theory, research in construction and project risk management began in 1960‟s (Guilin, 2004). Risk management is defined as a set of methods and activities designed to reduce the disturbances occurring during project delivery (Skorupka, 2003). It can also be defined as the structured set of processes aimed at identifying, analyzing and responding to project risks. It includes maximizing the results of positive events and minimizing the consequences of negative events (PMBOK Guide, 2000). According to Gray (2000), risk management is a proactive approach rather than reactive. It is preventive process designed to ensure that surprises are reduced and negative consequences associated with the undesirable events are minimized. Successful management of project risk gives the project manager better control over the future and can significantly improve chances of reaching project objectives on time, within budget and meeting required technical (functional) performance.</p> <p>Insurance is a risk transfer technique of passing the responsibility of risks to another party. Risks can be transfer either through contracting or by insurance which changes an uncertain exposure to certain cost. Transferring risk does not necessarily reduce the effect the risk would have or the likelihood of its occurrence but only passes the responsibility to another party. From the legal viewpoint, insurance allocates the risks to which the project is exposed, between the parties. Dickson (1983) highlighted insurance as a risk transfer mechanism that the insured transfer from a state of uncertainty to a state of certainty at the certain cost of the insurance premium. It is a cost-smoothing mechanism, in which contractors exchange a regular known annual premium for an unknown potential loss. This study investigates the appropriateness of insurance as a risk management tool in the construction industry.</p> <p>Construction insurance is a practice of exchanging a contingent claim for a fixed payment to protect the interests of parties involved in a construction project. Construction insurance is a major method of managing risks in the construction industry. Its primary function is to transfer certain risks from clients, contractors, subcontractors and other parties involved in the construction project to insurers to provide contingent funding in time of difficulty. Construction insurance plays an increasingly important role in guaranteeing the success of projects, with insurers sharing losses resulting from natural disasters and other contingencies. Insurance is, of course, only one means of managing risks associated with projects. It needs to be put into context and understood that not every risk can be insured against, insured against adequately or insured for a price that is acceptable. As stated in the statement of problem, construction insurance does not receive the attention it deserves as a result of lack of proper risks management practices in the construction industry. The research sought to identify insurable risks and the types of insurance typically involved in the Nigerian construction industry. The study is expected to contribute in raising the awareness of the insurable risks and policies which project participants are exposed to, in construction contracts. It provides a tool for decision-making in contract formation especially in insurance policies.</p> <p>1.2  <strong>     Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The provision of insurance is generally considered important and indeed in the event of a major loss, the insurance may be the only viable means of repaying financiers or ensuring that the Project is back on track. However paradoxically, rarely does insurance receive the attention it deserves, either within the overall context of the deal or in the detail of the interrelationship between the drafting of the construction contracts. Also practitioners sometimes do not have a clear understanding of risk allocation and the strategy of risk management through insurance. This can result in claim difficulties which can consequently affect the project in diverse ways, such as increase in project cost, completion time of the project as well as quality.</p> <p>It is important to understand the extent of the insurance contract before contractual terms are finalized to avoid circumstances where risks have been assumed based on the wrong assumptions of a party's ability to obtain particular insurance at a commercially acceptable price (or at all). This is of particular concern in the current climate where insurance premiums are higher; policies contain many limitations and exclusions.</p> <p>1.3  <strong>      Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions are set-out to guide the study:</p> <p>·         What are the insurable risks in construction project delivery?</p> <p>·         What types of insurance policies can be used in the construction industry for effective risks management?</p> <p>·         What is the level of use of identified insurance policies in the construction industry?</p> <p><strong>1.4          Aim and Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main aim of the research was to conduct an investigation into how insurance is used as a risk transfer tool in the Nigerian construction industry with a view to improving insurance uptake. The objectives of the study include to:</p> <p>·         identify the most insurable risks typically involved in the construction project delivery;</p> <p>·          assess the types of insurance policies commonly used in the construction industry;</p> <p>·         determine the level of use of identified insurance policies in the construction industry</p> <p><strong>1.7            Scope of the Research</strong></p> <p>The study focused on insurance as a risk management tool for the construction industry in Akwa Ibom State. The construction industry in Akwa Ibom State have witnessed various complex high risk projects in the last Six years including Pile Jack Underground Drainage Systems and many other five star projects. It is limited to insurance companies, contractors within the state capital and public sector clients mainly Ministry of Works and Ministry of Housing and Urban Renewal. </p> <p><strong>1.8              Organisation of the Research</strong></p> <p>The research was organised in Five (5) Chapters. Chapter one provided the introduction and background to the problem. This was followed by a review of literature on risk management and construction insurance in the second chapters. The third chapter highlighted the research methodology and data collection method. Analysis of the research results was discussed in chapter four while conclusions and recommendations were captured in chapter five.</p>\n\nINVESTIGATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INSURANCE AS RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL IN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INSURANCE AS RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL IN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY", "id": 41}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The construction industry is inherently hazardous. Thus, there is a need to make the construction site a safe place to work although the poor safety record remains a concern. The determination of the aggregate costs of health and safety programmes is considered a leap for achieving construction safety in construction project delivery. This study evaluated the costs of health and safety programmes in building project delivery. The study determined among others, cost-related factors affecting health and safety programmes, significant cost elements of health and safety programmes and determined the size of contractors’ expenditure on health and safety programmes. The finding of the study revealed that external monitoring and control requirements, level of education and training, and scope of work-related hazards are significant cost-related factors inhibiting contractors’ health and safety programmes.  The overall costs of health and safety programmes included in tender for building work generally amount to 0.31%. This implies medium and large contractors’ in Eket allow 0.31% of the total project costs for health and safety programmes in building contracts. The study concludes that budgetary provisions for health and safety programmes in building projects requires significant improvement in order to improve health and safety performance in building project delivery.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1              Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Construction Industry is indisputable for its overt position in the economy of any nation. However, the poor safety performance of the construction industry has continued to give international cause for concern staring challenge in its effort to tackle the developmental initiative of many nations including Nigeria. Workplace Health and Safety on its own is a global challenge to the sustainable development of our society and civilization. According to the International Labor Office (ILO), work related accidents and illness contribute 3.9 percent of all deaths and 25 percent of the world’s population suffers a minor/major occupational accident or work related disease in any one year (Smallwood, 2004). Other than the moral concerns, the economic cost is huge, this undermines the industry’s efforts towards sustainable construction and development.</p> <p>Health and safety programmes were first introduced in Nigeria during the time of the British Colony (Onyejeji, 2011). These programmes ensured that occupational health workers were dispatched to industrial plants and other commercial undertakings, including plans for monitoring. The initiative led to legislation that produced the Labour Act of 1974, the factories Act of 1987, and the Workman’s Compensations Act 1987.Other relevant acts to occupational health and safety in Nigeria are Labour Acts 1990, and Workman’s Compensation Act 2004. Theoretically, the goal of regulatory policies is to isolate incidents where misinformation about health risks leads people to make non-optimal decisions in order to internalize the situations, where health and safety risks are not already realized in the market decision. Policy needs to strike a balance between the costs of prevention, borne by employers, and the costs of injuries and ill health which fall upon the individual and society.</p> <p>Despite being among the countries that signed the occupational health and safety law in the Geneva Convention of 1981, the pathetic health and safety situation in Nigeria construction industry made Idoro (2008; 2011), to conclude that the contractors’ management efforts on occupational health and safety, do not reflect in their scope of operations and the accident and injury rates of the Nigerian construction industry are high, as there are many collapse building and structures everywhere, workers falling off height, because they didn’t wear their body harness, etc.</p> <p>One factors stand-out clear about the low level of safety performance in the Nigerian construction industry, that is, cost related concern (Okoye, 2013). Construction organizations increasingly argued that safety concerns are not well prioritized in the building sector compared to oil and gas industry (Onyejeji, 2011).</p> <p> Now, with increased awareness and re-emerging interest to improve safety performance in the building sector (Idoro, 2011; Okoye, 2013), it is requisite to understand the cost implications of implementing safety practices in the Nigerian construction industry. According to Idoro (2011), a better approach to improve safety is to focus on proactive efforts dealing with the cost of mitigation. Against this backdrop, this study is targeted at improving state of existing knowledge about the magnitude of contractor’s cost on safety management programme.</p> <p><strong>1.2              Statement of Research Problem</strong></p> <p>There is a high rate of accidents on construction sites across the globe but the developing countries have peculiar situation that calls for immediate attention. According to Adade-Boateng, Fuhar and Adinyira (2016), the construction industry continues to record high occupational accidents worldwide. The industry employs about 7% of the world's population and yet accounts for 30-40% of global occupational accidents (ILO 2005). In many developing countries, accurate statistics of injuries and fatalities in the construction industry are virtually non-existent due to poor recording and notification systems (Adade-Boateng, Fuhar and Adinyira, 2016). Ha¨ma¨la¨inen et al, (2006) argued that in spite of this, figures obtained are still used as a \"baseline for occupational safety work\". Available data would suggest that accident rates in developing countries are 3–6 times greater than in the developed countries (Jason, 2008).  Idoro (2011) observed that contractor’s management efforts on occupational Health and Safety does not reflect the scope of operation. Some organisations don’t give the protection of their workforce the priority it deserves. This is due to the lack of knowledge, skills and motivation, or limited staff resources (Chapman and Ward, 2003). Previous research also stated that cost is also an important factor responsible for the poor Health and Safety Performance in the construction (Smallwood, 2004). Cost is a critical criterion determining contractor’s decision to invest. </p>\n\nCOSTS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT IN BUILDING SITES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COSTS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT IN BUILDING SITES", "id": 42}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The knowledge and understanding of value management concept is critical in achieving project goal and objectives in terms of time, cost, quality, safety, and functionality. Previous studies have found that has been emerging as a concept that is needed to be integrated into Nigerian construction industry projects. The study seeks to assess the use of VM concept as a project management technique by construction stakeholders in south-south Nigeria with a view to ensuring a sustainable and vibrant VM process in the construction industry. The objectives were to assess the level of awareness of value management concept for construction projects in Akwa Ibom and Rivers States, examine the level of implementation of value management practices by stakeholders, evaluate key drivers influencing the practice of value management practices and assess factors inhibiting the smooth implementation of VM practices for construction projects in the study area. Related literatures were reviewed to achieve the objectives. A cross-sectional survey approach was used for the study. One hundred and seventy-seven (177) questionnaires were retrieved from the respondent which included: 77 contractors and 100 consultants who applied the understudied value management concept for construction projects delivery. Data collected were analysed using mean item score, relative importance index and Mann Whitney U-test was used to test the hypotheses. Findings indicate value management practice is very low in the south-south Nigerian construction projects, even though the study shows that, there is knowledge of value management among stakeholders in the implementation of this concept in the region. Improved products and services, Work towards arriving at a more effective design, Seek to obtain maximum efficiency ratio, Create a clearer focus on the project objectives, Higher efficiency can be achieved due to the multidisciplinary and multi-task teamwork, and Clearer project brief and decision making were discovered to be the key drivers influencing the practices of value management for construction projects in the study area while Lack of awareness, Absence of formal guidelines, Passive behavior among VM practitioners and Ineffective procurement issues were the factors inhibiting the smooth implementation of value management for construction projects in the study area. Findings suggest that professional bodies and academic institutions organize a sensitization programs and also synergize with relevant government institutions to get a legislation that would enforce value management in Nigerian construction industry. Proper guidelines should be published as well as Procurement Act should also be reviewed to include value management practice for construction projects in south-south region.     </p>\n\nASSESSMENT OF FACTORS AFFECTING BUILDING CONTRACTORS’ SELECTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF FACTORS AFFECTING BUILDING CONTRACTORS’ SELECTION", "id": 43}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Ever since the dawn of civilization, man has indulged in some form of construction activity. Even in ancient times, man created architectural Marvels which came to be regarded as wonders of the world including the pyramids of Egypt, the Great Wall of China, and the tower of Babel among others. </p> <p>Estimates for engineering construction and building project are extremely important for the financier. The primary function of this process is to produce a forecast of the probable cost of a proposed project before the detailed design and contract particulars are prepared (Onwusonye, 2006; Pratt, 2011). Prospective clients require budget estimate at the early stage of the project to manage and forecast their intended financial commitment before extensive work on the design is done. A feasibility estimate is therefore an important document that helps the client in carrying out a detailed study on the viability of his proposed project with a view to determining whether the investment is worthwhile.</p> <p>Estimating therefore describes the technical process of predicting the probable costs of the project based of specified information (Akintoye, 2000). The estimating process is broadly divided into two types namely: feasibility and tender estimating depending on mainly on the stage of the project and amount and quality of available information (Pott, 2008). However, the use of one approach precedes the other in the project development life cycle thereby making the context of predictive accuracy an important discourse in cost management literatures.</p> <p>The feasibility estimating has gained more interest based on its level of important to the overall cost performance of the project. Feasibility estimating is there probable assessment of the probable cost of project at the early stage of the project when the design is not fully developed. However, lack of theories on construction price forecasting is a major factor that has restricted empirical progress in cost forecasting (Akintoye, 2000).</p> <p>One of the major problems facing the Nigerian construction industry and in the global perspective is the fact that most projects are completed at sums higher than their initial contract sum (Achuenu, 1994; Gundiri, 1998). As a result, initial contract sum is rarely relied upon for decision making. The contract price obtained at the pre-contract stage of construction projects form the contract sum; and it is the amount established for the project. The expectations are that this sum should not be exceeded. Despite the veracity of this fact in practice and research, building construction projects are rarely completed within the estimated cost (Chindo, Okoli, Fadason and Gandu, 2012). Studies by Elinwa &amp; Buba (1993) cited in Chindo, Okoli, Fadason and Gandu (2012) established cost variances between 8 to 133%; and an earlier study by Giwa (1988) pegged cost variability at 113% between the feasibility estimate and final cost of the project.</p> <p>The research space has largely developed towards the study of variance between contract sum and final account. The trend has left a significant gap in determining the events in the procurement process between feasibility phase and contract sum. This study argues that, the contract sum is developed from a comprehensive design information than feasibility estimate; hence the need to evaluate the relationship between the later estimate and the former. This study therefore seeks to examine the effect of effect feasibility estimate of final account.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The feasibility of construction projects as decision tool is received with optimistic expectations, first that it may never be adequate; and second, that it may never be exhausted (Tate &amp; Flanagan, 1997). This pessimism originates the spates of project cost performance failure over the decades. Construction projects across the globe are bedeviled by cost deviation and overruns. Flyvjerg (2005) found that construction projects are completed at about 28% above budget. Mahamid (2013) reports 16.73% cost deviation, the mean cost overrun of 7.9% is reported in Odeck (2004), and Cantarelli et al. (2012) reports cost deviation of 11%. Scarcity of world’s economic resources informs the increasing important to reconsider the controversial disposition of cost overrun. The wide infrastructure gap in many places are alarmingly high including Nigeria.</p> <p>Cost differential is therefore perceived as endemic (Odeyinka, 2015) and the stakeholders in the construction sector are burdened to mitigate cost overrun. For the construction professionals to have credibility before the client, Mbachu (2012); Larkin et al.(2012); Odeyinka et al. (2012a,b)and Odeyinka (2015) suggested that as an obligation and the basis for reward, clients, contractors, financiers, and other stakeholders should carefully consider the expanding variance between feasibility and final account.</p> <p>Other wide range implications of cost deviations are prominent. First the perception of the stakeholders in a project is affected (Hobbs, 2010). Project financing is difficult and possible abandonment is imminent. The most prevalent impact of cost deviation is delay and disruption. The effects and causes of delay and disruption is widely studied across geographical spread but the implications lean towards similar results (Aibinu and Jagboro, 2002; Sambasivan and Soon, 2007; and Haseeb<em>et al. </em>(2011). These include time overrun, dispute, arbitration, total abandonment and litigations (Kikwasi, 2012). This study therefore seeks to determine the contribution of estimating to overall cost discrepancy between budget and final account.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following are constructed to achieve the aim of the study:</p> <p>-      What are the factors affecting the accuracy of feasibility estimating?</p> <p>-      What are the preferred tools, level of use and level of accuracy feasible estimating?</p> <p>-      What is the relationship between feasibility estimate and final account of building projects?</p> <p><strong>1.4       Aim and Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The aim of the study is evaluate the effect of feasibility estimate on the final account of building projects with a view to enhance efficiency. The objectives of the study include the following:</p> <p>·         Identify factors affecting the accuracy of feasibility estimates for building works;</p> <p>·         Evaluate stakeholders’ preference, level of use and the accuracy of feasibility estimating techniques; and</p> <p>·         Determine the effect of feasibility estimate on final account sum of building projects.</p> <p><strong>1.5       Research Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>The following hypotheses were constructed to achieve the aim of the study:</p> <p><strong>Ho1:</strong> There is no significant relationship between feasibility           estimate and final account.</p> <p>1.6       <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study has been necessitated by the fact that the first step towards solving a problem is to identify it. Therefore, if the idea behind the generation of feasibility estimate is well known and its effects on final account are identified and possible remedies proffered and implemented, it will reduce the anxiety being faced by clients in going into infrastructural project development due to high level of uncertainty of their financial commitment, thereby encouraging the growth of infrastructural development. It will also significantly reduce the incidences of project cost overrun.</p> <p>Contractors and clients will benefit from this work since they are in no wining position when there is a fall in the level of infrastructural projects development. First, the evaluation will enhance improved project delivery and overall realisation of the project targets. Second, it will facilitate stakeholders’ assessment of their level of effort towards the realisation of projects’ set objectives across the various stages of the project. Third, the outcome will improve procurement in option used and the projects procured amidst enhanced effective assessment management of cost overruns.</p> <p><strong>1.7       Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>There are construction industries in every state of the country; the study was restricted to construction industries and projects in Akwa Ibom State. This research has been limited by constraints such as time, money and related literature on the topic. The limited financial resource of the researcher is a major limitation and thereby resulted in limiting the study to Akwa Ibom State only. Due to hard time, cost of research materials are high, certain materials which could be useful may not be affordable.</p> <p>The reluctance of professionals/consultants to give information to research students is clearly known, it becomes hard as potential respondent will always believe that the information might expose the firm or company.</p> <p><strong>1.8       Organisation of the Work</strong></p> <p>The project is divided into five chapters. Chapter one is the introduction. Chapter two is literature review. Chapter three is the research methodology where all the technique, procedure and tools of analysis of data would be presented. Chapter four is the data presentation and analysis. Chapter five is the summary, conclusion and recommendation. </p>\n\nEFFECTS OF PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE ON FINAL ACCOUNT OF BUILDING PROJECTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE ON FINAL ACCOUNT OF BUILDING PROJECTS", "id": 44}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Variation is one of the most severe problems in the construction industry. This variation occurs in every construction project and the magnitude of these variations varies considerably from project to project. As such, the client had to spend more than what was initially estimated in most cases, sometimes, disputes and unnecessary delays occur due to variations. This study focused to investigate causes and effects of design variation in road construction project in Akwa Ibom State. The objectives were to examine the causes of design variation, to investigate the effects of design variation in road construction projects and examine measures to minimizing its occurrence. Relevant literature review on causes and effects of design variation in road construction projects were carried out and an elaborate field survey was undertaken to verify the objectives of this study. A total of 62 questionnaires were collected against 68 questionnaires distributed among professionals in the construction industry, representing 91% response rate. The data collected through a structured questionnaire administered to the professionals were analysed using simple random sampling technique. The results revealed that change in client’s opinions was the most predominant cause of variation. Others are consultant and contractors’ factors were also seen as the severe causes. The results also revealed that the most common effects of design variation on construction projects were increase in project cost, delays in completion and disputes among stakeholders. The study pointed early interaction between the design team and the client to ensure that client’s requirements are clarified and communicated effectively into the design to reduce variations. The study recommends team work spirit amongst stakeholders involved in the project and respect to original design by the client as the key ingredients for a successful project delivery.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>The complexity of the construction industry due to different stakeholders’ involvement makes it differ from other industries. This complexity leads to unwanted situations like variations with their associated effects. And presently, it is almost becoming a rare thing for a construction project not to have variation. Most contracts these days must make provisions for possible variations given the nature of road construction project (Finsen et al., 1999). (Uff, 2005) further pointed out that a clause permitting variation of works is an essential feature of any construction contract because without it the contractor is not bound to execute additional work or to make omissions or changes. In line with these, the nature and approach to the conception, planning and subsequent actualization of construction projects are dynamic, complex, sophisticated and capital intensive in recent times. In consequence, these projects are subjected to adequate appraisals by the sponsors on the basis of political, social, projects relatives’ benefits, externalities, etcetera, with a view of ascertaining the values of money (Onwusoye, 2005). The certification for the realization of this objection through various techniques and other implied factors by the potential owner of the projects leads to the eventual take off of a construction project. Therefore, design variation need to be critically addressed as this continue to be a frequent problem that gets worse often in construction project. Though of recent, it is a common phenomenon for design variation to occur on construction project. But under normal circumstance, it is possible for a complex set of drawings and specification to be available for preparation of fully described and accurate bill of quantities for tendering purposes. These would deplete further charges as a result of design changes during the construction stage.</p> <p>According to the J.C.T. 80, design variation in road construction refers to a change in the works initiated by the engineers, consultants, employer or other factors as the case may be which involves the alteration of any kind or standard of materials to be used in the work. A design change is regarded as any change in the design or construction of a project after the contract is awarded and signed, and such changes are related not only to matters in accordance with the provision of the contract but also changes to the work conditions. Akinsola et al (1997) also noted that these changes as any additions, omission or adjustment to the contract price or contract time, and it occurs regularly on construction projects. Park (2002) defined design variation as a change to the work state,  processes or methods that differ from the original construction plan or specification and usually resulted from different in work quality and condition, scope changes or uncertainties that make construction dynamic and unstable. Affirmed that design variations are inevitable on major construction projects particularly on road construction where the project is complex, the ground conditions variables or the employer desire to incorporate the latest technology into the project. And the more design changes on a project, the greater effect which become time consuming and costly in construction projects (Mohamed, 2001). It is therefore of greater concern regarding the adverse effects of the design changes in both public and private construction in Akwa Ibom State.</p> <p>According to Arian and Pheng (2005), design variation on road construction project resulted into a substantial increment in amount of funding budgeted for the work, hence caused the inability to complete and handover the work as agreed initially at the commencement of the work. As a result of this, it is extremely noticeable that time and cost overrun occurs due to variation in many construction projects especially road construction. Similarly, variation order which contains a set of instructions that allows changes or modifications to be made to as earlier agreement in terms of volume or nature of task to be carried out, (O’Brien, 1998). These changes are however occur after the award of the initial contract or after work might have commenced at the construction sites. The changes may be due to various reasons such as the modification of original design and scope, schedule, costs and methods.</p> <p>Variation from the original project design is seen as the major causes of project failure, though project monitoring and control could cause corrective actions to bring deviation during construction but failed to take  cognizance of identifying and analyzing the root cause of such variation  (Ubani, Nwanchukwu and Nwukonkwo, 2010). The performance objectives defect due to variation of many completed and ongoing road projects resulted in employer’s dissatisfaction, project time extension and cost overrun, low quality and substandard outputs, project conflicting between the contractors and employers arising from variation in contract sum. And the unusual thing about it is the extent of such differences as well as the frequency occurrence. The causes and cost implication of variation needs to be assessed and analysed at the onset of the project, and it is on this background that the study was carried out.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>All road construction projects undergo various degrees of design variations throughout the project life cycle. Changes in construction projects are inevitable particularly when the actual work commences to correct or modify original design or scope of work (Alnuaimi et al., 2010). The research study by Naoum (1997) highlighted the lack of time and effective communication, lack of integration, uncertainty, a changing environment and increasing project complexity as the drivers of design changes.</p> <p>According to a study by Ogunlana, Promkuntong and Jearkjirm (2000), construction owners are the major causes of design variations due to changing plans in line with the changing economic climate to meet customer demands or for making marketing reasons. Design variation need to be constantly monitored to avoid escalation (Olawale and Sun, 2010). </p>\n\nCAUSES AND EFFECTS OF DESIGN VARIATION IN ROAD CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF DESIGN VARIATION IN ROAD CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS", "id": 45}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      Background to the study</strong></p> <p>The construction industry plays an important role in a nation’s economy and its activities are also vital to the achievement of national socio-economic development goals of providing shelter, infrastructure and employment. According to Aibinu and Jagboro (2002) the construction industry continues to occupy an important position in the nation’s economy even though it contributes less than the manufacturing or other service industries. Ayodele and Alabi (2011) opined that a healthy economy usually experiences an increase in construction activities. Saka and Lowe (2010) stated that the importance of construction to economic growth and development can never be overstressed as construction makes significant contribution to the GDP, capital formation and employment etc. The construction industry as a whole has a significant relationship to the economy, in that a change in economic output of an economy can result in a proportionate change in demand and, as a result, a change in the output of the construction industry (Richardson, Nwankwo, and Richardson (2003). The follow-on effect of this change is that firms within the industry have to dramatically adapt to the changing economic climate (Green, Larsen, and Kao, 2008).</p> <p>Research have shown that employees in the construction industry form a very large workforce constituting one-half of the gross capital, and three to eight percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in most countries (Arditi and Mokhtar, 2000; Mee-Edowe and Andawei, 2000). The construction industry is responsible for employing approximately 20% of the Nigeria’s workforce, making it perhaps the largest employer of construction labor in Africa (National Bureau of Statistics, 2006). The industry accounts for about 69% of the nations fixed capital formation which implies that 70% of the net capital investment in the country goes into the construction industry (Business Monitor International (BMI), 2007). The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) (2014) presentation of preliminary results of the rebased nominal gross domestic product (GDP) estimates for Nigeria 2010 to 2013 reported that the NCI records an average of 3.4% contribution to the GDP within the considered years. This contribution though small yet exerts both direct and indirect impact on the national economy as it stimulates the growth of other sectors through a complex system of linkages (Alabi, 2010).</p> <p>Nigeria is one of the largest African countries but sadly have been facing decline in economic output. This economic recession has led to so many construction companies adopting several survival practices in order to remain in business. According Musso and Schiavo (2007) to survival practice of any construction company is defined as their ability to run or manage a small business with little resources to keep track of nation and regional, economic indicators that might affect the construction industry and the companies’ operations. This is in line to the findings of Geroski, Mata, and Portugal (2003) which states that for a conation firm to survive in a recessed economy, they must be aggressive and imaginative in operations. this means that the company should innovate ideas to gain market share by taking it away from competitors unable to adjust to shifting market conditions, maintain a strong cash stream throughout the downturn, in contrast to other construction companies that may have liquidity problems, become a leaner, more effective and more efficient operation, better positioned to do well when the market improves. With this constrain, Madhoushi and Ghaedi (2013) was of the opinion that construction firms who survive and even prosper during hard times most be able to look beyond the present to overcome the constraint of tradition to see the firm from a new perspective and to do business differently.</p> <p>Through the construction industry, the Government is able to provide adequate public infrastructures for its citizens. According to Oluba (2008) public infrastructure touches on a wide range of basic amenities, which enhance the capacity of economic agents to conveniently engage in productive activities with reduced stress levels. However, in the delivery of these public infrastructures, several participants are brought together. According to Alintal-Abel and Nnadi (2015) there are diverse interests in the construction industry with the principal actors being the client, the consultant and contractors. In the realization of a construction project, consultants and contractor are brought together to satisfy the desire of the client. According to Munns (1996) construction project involves three groups of people who are brought together for a temporary period in which they are expected to work together towards a mutual goal. This group includes the client, the consultants and construction contractors. The role of the Client is to instigate the project set goals, determine the constraint to work within, and provide the required financial recourses to ensure the projects goals. The Contractor is responsible for converting the plan into final reality while the Consultant is expected to convert the client requirement into a proposal that can be achieved within any constraint set by the client (Salami and Mustapha, 2015).</p> <p>One of such consultants whose role in the delivery of construction projects cannot be over emphasized is the Quantity Surveyor. Ashworth and Hogg (2000) described a Quantity Surveyor as a person that cost designs and produce procurement and construction documents. Ojo (2011a) further stated that a Quantity Surveyor estimate and manage the cost of construction projects. A practicing Quantity Surveyor is mostly found in Quantity Surveying Firms (QSFs) which are service based firms providing consultancy, financial and allied management services to their clients (Abidin, Yusof, Hassan and Adros, 2011). Oyediran (2011) views QSFs as knowledge based firm because quantity surveyors sell knowledge and not physical product when in operation. It is noteworthy that this knowledge is transformed into  service  that  gets  delivered  to  clients  eventually.</p> <p>Thus, with the present downturn in the Nigeria economy which is as a result of the decline in the price of crude oil and other associated factors (Sanusi, 2010; Eboh, 2015; National Bureau of Statistics 2015), which is bound to have a negative effect on the construction industry (Ogbu, 2017) it is necessary to assess the survival practices of Quantity Surveying firms whose role in the construction industry is crucial. This shall be done with a view to identifying possible ways to help Quantity Surveying Firms survive in times of recession</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>       <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Eboh (2015) observed that the Nigerian economy currently faces difficulties due to the decline in crude oil prices in the international market. Added to this is the huge burden of payment of subsidies to petroleum products importers mounting to billions of Naira and to make things worse, there have been a constant political drift away from the due process were construction contact allocation is awarded only to  political and government agent thereby back beating professionals such as the Quantity Surveyors and as such driving these professionals / construction firms into adopting other measures of survival in order to remain in business. In 2014 alone, N971.1 billion ($4.88 billion) was budgeted for subsidy payments. The repercussions of these have been the sharp decline in revenues accruing to the federation. Up to 8.97% of Nigeria’s GDP is accounted for by proceeds from oil and gas industry activities, and crude oil earns more than 90% of Nigeria’s foreign exchange (Sanusi 2010; National Bureau of Statistics 2015). As a result, fluctuations in revenues from this source have grave implications for the survival of construction practitioners in Nigeria as the government remains the biggest client of the construction industry in Nigeria (Aniekwu, Anthony, Kehinde, 2014). Not only that, private sector clients of the construction industry are equally linked to government expenditure; thus, a decline in Nigeria’s national income has both direct and indirect effects on the survival of construction practitioners (Quantity surveyors inclusive) and this could influence their mortality rate (Ogbu, 2017).</p> <p>Olatunji, Oke, Aghimien and Ogunwoye (2016) opined that with the challenging economy in Nigeria, it is not uncommon to see construction professionals acting in manners that go against the ethics of their profession during the course of carrying out their professional duties just to make ends meet. Murdoch and Hughes (2008) stated that Quantity Surveyors as construction cost managers are the cynosure of all eyes both within the construction industry and the country at large. Bearing in mind that construction professionals operate in a highly fragmented industry which includes different skills and professions, and where relationships and boundaries are not always clear, Quantity Surveyors are expected to display a high level of professional competence founded on genuine ethical conduct. </p> <p>It has been observed that the primary aim of every profession is to serve the public. This commitment means that true professional places the public good before mere financial reward. Acting in such a manner may on occasion conflict with an individual or client’s interest. This concept is embodied in many of the profession’s codes of conduct (Murdoch and Hughes, 2008; Olatunji <em>et al.,</em> 2016). Seeley (1997) assert that upholding professional ethics underpins the primary objectives of professional codes of practice. Providing a professional service may therefore be viewed as delivering technical skills competently and in a way society expects of professionals.</p> <p>Bearing the economic recession facing the country in mind and the need for Quantity Surveyors to demonstrate high ethical standards, this research therefore set out to assess the survival practices employed by Quantity surveying firms in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Aim and Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research is to assess the survival practice of Quantity Surveying firms in a recessed economy with a view to identifying possible ways to help Quantity Surveying Firms survive in times of recession. The objectives stated out for achieving this aim are to:</p> <p>•                     identify the factors affecting the survival practices of Quantity Surveying Firms in            a recessed economy in Imo State;</p> <p>•                     assess the level of these survival strategies by Quantity Surveying Firms in Imo     State;</p> <p>•                     evaluate the impact of these survival practices on the survival of Quantity Surveying Firms in Imo State </p> <p><strong>1.4       Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following Research Questions were formulated to guide the study:</p> <p>•                     What are the survival strategies available for Quantity Surveying Firms in a           recessed economy in Imo State?</p> <p>•                     What is the level of adoption of these survival strategies by Quantity Surveying     Firms in Imo State?</p> <p>•                     What is the impact of these survival practices on the survival of Quantity   Surveying Firms in Imo State?</p> <p><strong>1.5       Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The hypotheses set for this research are as follows:</p> <p>(1) Ho: There is no significant difference in the view of the various categories of Quantity Surveyors as to the survival strategies available for   Quantity Surveying Firms in Imo State.</p> <p>    HA: There is a significant difference in the view of the various categories of Quantity Surveyors as to the survival strategies available for Quantity Surveying Firms in Imo State.</p> <p>(2) Ho: There is no significant difference in the view of the various categories of Quantity Surveyors as to the level of adoption of various survival strategies by Quantity Surveying Firms in Imo State.</p> <p>  HA: There is a significant difference in the view of the various categories   of Quantity Surveyors as to the level of adoption of various survival strategies by Quantity Surveying Firms in Imo State.</p> <p>(3) Ho: There is no significant difference in the view of the various categories of Quantity Surveyors as to the impact of the various survival strategies on the survival of Quantity Surveying Firms in Imo State.</p> <p>HA: There is a significant difference in the view of the various categories of Quantity Surveyors as to the impact of the various survival strategies on the survival of Quantity Surveying Firms in Imo State</p> <p><strong>1.6       Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>Several researches have been conducted on survival practices within and outside the construction industry (Ajayi, Pearce and Mafimidiwo, 2012; Madhoushi and Ghaedi 2013; Ogbu, 2017; etc.). Ayopo (2011) revealed that firm location is related to firm survival, for firms in different sectors of the Nigerian economies, respectively. Ajayi <em>et al.,</em> (2012) sought the opinion of construction professionals on the survival practices of construction firms in Lagos, Nigeria. Furthermore, Ogbu (2017) focused on the opinion of indigenous construction firms. This was done out of the assumption that as business entities, indigenous construction firms are affected by the dynamics of the economic environment; therefore, they deploy survival practices in order to survive.</p> <p>While several studies on survival in the construction industry are available, not much has surfaced on the survival practices of Quantity surveying firms in Nigeria. This gap is what this research sets out to fill. With this economic downturn, Quantity surveying firms will need to develop new survival strategies to help the stay afloat and survive this recession period. Thus, assessing these survival practices of Quantity surveying firms will go a long way in assisting the management of these firms in making critical decisions that will help in the survival of the present recession within the country. This study will enable Quantity Surveyors within the country as it hopes to bring to light other possible areas of diversification that will help them survive in terms of recession.</p> <p><strong>1.7       Scope of Study</strong></p> <p>This research sets out to assess the survival practices of Quantity Surveying Firms in a recessed economy. The research shall be restricted to Quantity Surveying Firms in Imo State Nigeria. Although this research sets out to assess the survival practices of Quantity Surveying Firms in a recessed economy, as a result of limited available finance for the execution of this project, coupled with the associated time constraints, using every single Quantity Surveying Firm within the country will prove impossible.</p>\n\nASSESSMENT OF THE SURVIVAL PRACTICES OF QUANTITY SURVEYING FIRMS IN A RECESSED ECONOMY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF THE SURVIVAL PRACTICES OF QUANTITY SURVEYING FIRMS IN A RECESSED ECONOMY", "id": 46}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study examines contract planning on construction projects from clients’ perspective and its effects on performance. The objectives are to determine the contract planning practices applied in the Nigerian construction industry, assess the awareness and usage of contract planning tools and techniques applied by clients on construction projects, evaluate factors affecting contract planning practices on construction projects and determine its effects on performance of construction projects. A questionnaire survey administered to a sample of 120 construction professionals and client representatives selected by stratified random sampling from the population of clients in Owerri construction industry is used and analyzed using inferential and descriptive statistics, and finally spearman ranked correlation test was use to evaluate the results. The findings of this study reveals that only about eight (8) of the evaluated contract planning tools and techniques are mostly used by clients, which are; work breakdown structure, site layout, plan, risk management plan, human resource plan, method statement, cost management plan, plant schedule, material schedule, and labour schedule. However, it also reveals their level of use and the factors affecting contract panning practices, finally the results shows that contract planning from clients’ perspective has a significant effect on construction project performance in terms of cost savings, project delivery time, quality, scope of the project and clients satisfaction. The study recommends contract planning practices as a means for maximizing and improving the performance of construction projects.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Ashworth, Hogg, and Higgs (2013) described the construction industry as one of the most important sectors of the economy, which integrates a wide variety of skilled and unskilled professionals. These professionals engage in the provision of goods and services ranging from construction, alteration, refurbishment to repairs of building and civil engineering structures. All these professionals work together under various types of contractual agreements to actualize the client’s brief and deliver the project. Each construction project is unique and has its main objectives are outlined by the client based on project circumstances. Amongst the most common objectives of any successful project are deliveries at the right time, within authorized cost and meeting the envisaged quality standards (Love 1998). Construction projects, like all others, are not risks free and thereby can result to financial loss. Construction risks are events that generally influence any or all of the project objectives. Risk events could either be positive in terms of opportunities or negative in terms of threats to either or the entire project objectives (Hillson 2002).</p> <p> Significant proportions of factors impeding project performance in the construction industry are traceable to actions and inaction of principal stakeholders in the sectors. One aspect where stakeholders have failed in its responsibilities relates to contract planning. Contract planning According to Simmons (2007), refers to the process of systematically and efficiently managing contract creation, execution and analysis for maximizing operational and financial performance and minimizing risk. Contract planning processes are the activities/steps taken during contract planning, this is divided into two (2) phases PMT (2006) which are the pre-contract planning and post-contract planning on clients perspective and contractors perspective, but in the cause of this project we will be looking at the clients perspective, The research literatures in construction project management is replete with concerns about poor or ineffective contract planning (Idoro, 2009; Idoro, 2012; &amp; Dalibi, 2016). Most countries in the Middle-East and some part of Africa do not utilize project planning and management techniques in the delivery of construction projects (Sayegh, 2008; Laryea &amp; Hughes, 2009).   Ashworth (2007) reported that the use of formal contract planning and management techniques in the UK construction industry is low. The result culminates in project failures, incessant claims for variations, huge financial losses and sometimes results in bankruptcy of Clients and Contractors Ashworth (2007).</p> <p>Several academic and professional literatures have developed in the field of effective contract planning and management within construction contexts. The degree of application of contract planning and management techniques by contractors especially, was found to differ in various construction industries across the globe (2008). Against this literature gap therefore, this study is conducted to evaluate the effect of construction contract planning on project performance in Imo State.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Problem Statement</strong></p> <p>Contract planning in construction projects is bedeviled with chronic inefficiencies that influence the performance of project delivery. These protracted outcomes are a result of two possible concern, low awareness and usage, and exogenous and endogenous factors influencing contract planning. Ashworth (2007) reported that the use of formal contract planning and management techniques in the UK construction industry is low. The result culminates in project failures, incessant claims for variations, huge financial losses and sometimes results in bankruptcy of Contractors Ashworth (2007). This situation is more prevalent in redevelopment projects due to the inevitable problems of unexpected additional work, excessive requirements and scope management issues, project funding not aligned with project plans, delay, structural failure, cost overrun, etc. (Naaranoja &amp; Uden, 2007). These problems or uncertainties, among others, increase the project risk and make their management crucial if success is desired. Several projects in the housing and road sub-sectors across Nigeria have witnessed huge investment of public and private funds without commensurate result expended. This huge expenditure and apparent failure in the primary objectives of the project led to complaints, probe panels and subsequent abandonment of the project. According to Obi (2014), the rate at which project delays, failures, cost overruns and abandonment are experienced on many projects handled by indigenous building contractors and clients in Imo State Nigeria is quite alarming.</p> <p>A successful project is a project that has been completed on schedule, within budget, scope and satisfied the required quality (Allan 1991, 2004; Hatush &amp; Skitmore 1997; Doloi 2007). Projects that do not deliver the required value they promise and of course do not realize their original objectives are all failed projects, in other words for a project to fail one or all of these component time, cost and quality have failed (Frank 2011).</p> <p><strong>1.3       Research Questions</strong></p> <p>1.      What are the contract planning practices applied in the construction industry?</p> <p>2.      What is the level of awareness and usage of contract planning practices in the construction industry?</p> <p>3.      What are the factors affecting contract planning practices on construction projects?</p> <p>4.      What are the effects of contract planning practices to construction projects performance?</p> <p><strong>1.4       Aim and Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of contract planning on construction project performance, and the objectives are:</p> <p>1.      To determine contract planning practices applied in the construction industry.</p> <p>2.      To assess awareness and usage of contract planning practices in the construction industry.</p> <p>3.      To examine the factors affecting contract planning practices</p> <p>4.      To evaluate the effect of contract planning practices to construction project performance.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF CONTRACT PLANNING ON CONSTRUCTION PROJECT PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF CONTRACT PLANNING ON CONSTRUCTION PROJECT PERFORMANCE", "id": 47}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study determined the influence of estimating practice on cost performance of building projects. The objectives were to identify the estimating practices used by cost consultants, appraise the critical factors influencing estimating practice used, and to determine the influence of estimating practice on cost performance. The study involved survey design administered to engineers, builders and quantity surveyors in Akwa Ibom state, Nigeria. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics and Spearman Ranked correlation test. The findings of the study revealed the critical factors influencing estimating practice as complexity of design and construction, scale and scope of construction, method of construction and construction technique, tender period and market condition, and site constraints (access and storage limitation. The test of hypothesis indicated non-relatedness of estimating practice with cost deviation. There is therefore no significant correlation between estimating practices and the performance building works estimate for all category of buildings studied. The implication is that, estimating practice (method) adopted in budget estimation cannot influence the cost performance of building projects.</p>\n\nINFLUENCE OF ESTIMATING PRACTICE ON COST PERFORMANCE OF BUILDING PROJECTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INFLUENCE OF ESTIMATING PRACTICE ON COST PERFORMANCE OF BUILDING PROJECTS", "id": 48}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The world over, a vast number of developing countries are trying to achieve sustainable economic growth in every sector and more equitable distribution of the benefits of growth.
