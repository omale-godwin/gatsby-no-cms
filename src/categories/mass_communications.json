The fact remains obvious that such projects only serve as a conduit pipe to siphon funds into private pockets.\n\nZeroing in on the situation in Imo state which incidentally is the subject of this study, the situation there is quite akin to what obtains elsewhere in the country, as most developmental projects are concentrated in the city, to the exclusion of the rural areas.\n\nIt is against the backdrop of the obvious disregard of the rural communities in the scheme of development projects in Imo state that this research work has embarked upon to among others, highlight the role of the media (in the context of newspapers in the coverage of rural and urban problems in Imo state.\n\nThe choice of the newspaper in this enterprise is informed by the fact that the mass media as vehicle for information, agenda setting and mass mobilization, possess a unique potential in reversing this unpleasant status quo\n\nThe Daily Champion, The Sun and Vanguard were thus chosen to reflect this in balance in the coverage or rural/urban problems in Imo state.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n     INTRODUCTION\n\n BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nFrom a global perspective, third-word countries which are mostly found in the continent of Africa have been conspicuously backward in terms of development vis-à-vis their western counterparts where a day hardly passes without the celebration of one scientific or technological feat or another. These indicates of underdevelopment and backwardness that characterize the content include, poverty, illiteracy, disease, intertribal conflict, corruption, absence of infrastructural amenities and general mal-administration.\n\nWhen one looks at the situation in Nigeria, generally, with particular reference to the state of Imo state in South-Eastern part of the country, it is obvious and regrettable that successive governments in the country as well as the state (with the exception of the first civilian government in Imo state (1979-83) had paid lip service towards ameliorating the plight of especially rural and urban dwellers in these states who constitutes over 70% of the population of about 120 million Nigerians (based on projections from the 1991 national census).\n\nThe situation is further exacerbated by the infinitesimally low coverage given to rural and urban problems by our national media.\n\nThe national media are expected to give full coverage to events in all sections of the society. The extent of coverage should range from the affluent to the poor, from the urban to the hinterland, but this, however, is not so with our national dailies.\n\nIndeed, the development of both the rural and urban communities must be given priority attention in the scheme of things. Otherwise, the goal of the national development will be elusive. Be that as it may. It must be pointed out, here, that the goal of community development through an affective newspaper coverage is not without certain constraints.\n\nThe constraint include\n\n(a) Shortage of staff;\n\n(b) Limited     equipment,       transportation facilities,   communication gadgets; (c) Limited funds, and \n\n(d) Poor editorial planning\n\nThe print media, as has been observed, rarely cover the rural areas in comparison to cities. In fact, very limited time is allotted to these coverage, which are not enough considering the scope of the activities going on there. Granted that some national media have allotted pages to community news and vents, or even supplements for the local areas where each local government area is focused upon, unfortunately, these are not in-depth. Only peripheral issues are covered. Discussion and serious analysis are missing it all boils down to window dressing.\n\nThe news media with a target local can cover such a community effectively. This is because there is time for planning and implementation. But in our case here, the general assessment of the coverage by these media is mediocre. This mediocrity in the manner and extent of reportage of rural and urban problems in the society is due largely to the following loopholes identified in the operations of the news media.\n\n(a)         No target area: This is obvious. Targeting an are means picking on specific area within a zone and covering them. These media must regularly highlight development projects, culture, professions, arts and craft, a well as need and deprivations of these areas.\n\n(b)         Lack of no-the spot coverage. Those on the scene of event and incidents tend to write authoritatively about them. So, the reporter must investigate in order to be credible. Where a reporter is kilometers away, the study might go stale by the time he gets there.\n\n(c)          Coverage is general not specific. The coverage given to issues is often superficial. It does not go into detailed issues.\n\nAs the filler of the communication gap between the government and the rural dwellers on the one hand, and the urban and rural populace on the other hand, the mass media are an important player in this enterprise of community development. This is in view of the fact that information provided by these media is a tool for mobilization, galvanization, sensitization and transformation of the rural communities.\n\nThe newspaper, for instance, localizes and interpret state and national news for the consumption of the people. Although there is scarcely any community newspaper in Nigeria today, this void can be filled by national and state newspapers through improved coverage of community activities.\n\nAware of the ability newspaper to give objective, thorough, sound and fair coverage of community development projects, this research work therefore, is an imperative. Besides, the coverage so given by the newspapers can help by redirecting change agents on the priority of the local populations to avoid embarking  on unrealistic projects.\n\nIt is against the foregoing background that the researcher embarked on this study – a comparative study of newspaper reporting of rural and urban problems in Imo state. A contents analysis of the Sun, Vanguard and Daily Champion over a period of one month, to determine their roles in rural development.\n\n STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS\n\nThis study is strictly concerned with concerned with determining the extent of coverage and prominence accorded development problems by Nigerian newspapers with a view to identifying the level of commitment of the nation’s press towards rural transformation and emancipation from economic, social and political bondage. Among the indices of\n\nunderdevelopment are poverty, low standard of living, high cost of living, illiteracy, poor infrastructural facilities, unemployment and disease.\n\nThe study sets out to find the reasons for the low coverage of rural news by Nigeria newspapers.\n\nThis research work is also pre-occupied with the task of ascertaining whether the amount and quality of rural news carried by the national media are sufficient and capable enough to bring about the desired positive change in the rural communities.\n\nThe problems emanating from the low coverage of rural community problems by the Nigerian newspaper equally engage the attention of this study.\n\n THEORETICAL ORIENTATION\n\nThis research work is based on two major theories, the development media theory and the Democratic participant media theory. Both theories emerge out of the realization that the original four classical theories viz, the authoritarian, Libertarian, social responsibility and Soviet-communist theories, do not apply strictly to developing countries or where they can be applied, have limited potential benefits because of some peculiar characteristics of the developing countries.\n\nThe development media theory is predicated on the premise that the state has a right to intervene in or restrict media operations in the interest of development needs. In this way, devices of censorship, subsidy and direct control can be\n\njustified.\n\nRemarkably, this theory emanated from the Sean McBride report of the United Nations (UNESCO) International Commission for the study of communication problems.\n\nThe second theory is germane to this work is the\n\ndemocratic participant media theory. This is the latest addition to the normative theory and Dennis McQuail stands out as a major proponent of this theory.\n\nThe theory emphasizes the right to relevant information, the right to feedback, the right to use the means of communication for interaction in small scale setting of community, interest group and subculture. Tersely put, it emphasizes what contemporary development communication\n\nscholar term “Participatory”.\n\n OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\n                                The     relevance     of     communication     in      community\n\ndevelopment, especially in a state like Imo can not be overemphasize in view of the benefits derivable from such an exercise. The rural areas constitute an integral part of every country from where the development levels of such countries are measure. Over the years, there has been a noticeable neglect of the rural areas. Thus giving rise to urban migration, which leads to loss of manpower, economic hardship and abject povert in the hinterland. In contra-distinction, there is the provision of certain amenities, though not with the best of intentions, like pipe-borne water, electricity, white collar jobs health facilities libraries, etc in the cites.\n\nAt one time or another, certain programmes had been introduced to better the lots of rural dwellers, though they  eventually came to naught due to poor implementation and misappropriation of funds. These include the government sponsored  farmers co-operative societies, operation feed the nation (OFN) The Green Revolution, the people Bank, Bettter life for Rural women programme and family support programme.\n\nThough the above programmes were targets at rural empowerment, city dwellers ended up the major beneficiaries. Perhaps, the only national programme that has obviously benefited the rural dwellers is the National programme\n\nImmunization, NPI.\n\nTherefore, by content-analysis the coverage of rural and urban problems in Imo state by three national dailies, this study aims at finding the extent to which the mass media, in this context the newspapers, have succeeded or failed in discharging their community development functions.\n\nIn addition, it aims at determining which of the three newspapers is more oriented towards community development through the nature of rural news publishes.\n\nAnother objective is to rekindle the desire for the coverage of community development activities by national dailies with a view to improving the standard of living of rural dwellers in Imo state.\n\n SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study offers the readers the opportunity to assess the level of commitment of these newspapers in furthering the cause of community development through adequate coverage of rural and urban problems.\n\nIt also highlights the place of newspapers in the mobilization, education and sensitization of rural dwellers with a view to bettering their life.\n\nWith this study, newspaper editors will see the need for the use of community development news as lead stories rather than as ‘fillers’ in the inside pages.\n\nThis work is also a guide to media properties in terms of designing a suitable editorial policy that will give their newspapers freedom to give adequate attention to rural development problems.\n\nThe study, apart from helping government fashion out an effective rural-oriented communication policy, may also help in\n\n        broadening the knowledge of the role, place and importance of the mass media, especially the newspapers in community development.\n\n RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\nTo keep the research focused, the following questions are asked. (a) To what extent does the location of a newspaper affect its coverage of rural and urban problems?\n\n(b)         Is there any relationship between newspaper ownership and coverage of rural and urban problems?\n\n(c)          Is there any correlation between a newspapers editorial policy and its placement as well as treatment of rural development news?\n\n(d)         Does the readership size of a newspaper influence its coverage of rural and urban problems?\n\n LIMITATION\n\nGathering the various issues of the three newspapers as well as scutinizing them was no means task. Besides, the formulation of an appropriate coding scheme was partially most laborious and Herculean.\n\nThe economic down turn in the country with the attendance hike in transport fares made the gathering of the newspapers as well as visit to libraries and newspaper houses, an expensive enterprise.\n\nThe aforementioned difficulties notwithstanding, the researcher took adequate steps to contend with those limitations.\n\n DELIMITATION\n\nThe scope of this study is restricted to three Nigerian daily newspapers, viz, The Sun, Vanguard and Daily Champion.\n\nThe study spans a period of one month and the focus is on rural and urban problems. The work is not designed to test literacy level of rural dwellers in terms of their newspaper reading habits.\n\n DEFINITION OF TERMS \n\nRURAL COMMUNITY: A Pamphlet of the Anambra state\n\ndevelopment authority “Focus” defined it as “a unified body of inherited  cultural affinity and common socio-economic and\n\npolitical interest”.\n\nRURAL DEVELOPMENT: it is the improvement of the lifestyle, as well as making available those non-existing facilities in a rural environment, for the good of the inhabitants. These facilities range from good water, electricity, mortorable roads, health-care, schools, and recreational facilities to judicial and other institutions. Thus, it is all embracing.\n\nAccording to Akonobi (former military Governor, old Anambra State), Rural Development is strategy designed to improve the economic and social conditions of a specific group of people’.\n\nCOMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT: According to former Tanzanian president, late Julius Nyerere, community Development is the “Participation of people in a mutual living experience involving themselves, their local resources, external agents and outside resources.”\n\nURBAN PROBLEMS: These are the developmental projects that must be carried out to ensure the well-being and improvement in the standard of living of urban dwellers.\n\nRural problems: These are the developmental projects, efforts or enterprises which are lacking in the hinterland, thus making life unbearable for the inhabitants.\n\nCOMPARATIVE STUDY: A comparative study is a type of scientific enquiry, which attempts to establish causes of or contributory factors to a problem by comparing two or more group, some having the problems and some not having it.\n\nNEWSPAPERS: A German scholar, Otto Growth, in 1928\n\ndeveloped a set of five standards that modern scholars generally hold as acceptable criteria for determining a true newspaper.\n\ni)   A newspapers must be published periodically at intervals not less than once a week.\n\nii) Mechanical production must be employed iii) Anyone who can pay the cover price must have access to the publication. iv) It must vary in content and include every thing of public interest to everyone.\n\nv)      Newspapers publication must be timely some continuity of organization.\n\nA newspapers can also be defined as a wholesome package of news, event and views of a day, in a given area of circulation or leadership.\n\nAccording to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) English Dictionary, a newspaper is a number of large sheets of folders paper on which news, articles, advertisements, and other information are printed. \n\nNewspapers, generally. Can come in the form of Tabloids or Broadsheets.\n\nREPORTING: The British Broadcasting corporation (BBC) English Dictionary defines Reporting as the or presenting of newspapers or radio or television.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nBittner, J.R.

        "content": "MASS MEDIA ADVERTISING IN NIGERIA: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn this study, an attempt was made to evaluate the problems and prospects of\nmass media advertising\nin Nigeria. We talk of the media mix and the multi-media approach to public relations and advertising, but we seem to be uncertain which particular medium is more success-oriented in carrying out advertising functions --- radio and television on the one side and newspapers, magazines and books, on the other.\n\nThis researcher put forward four hypotheses:\n\nHA:\n\nTelevision is better in carrying quality advertisements than the other \n\nmedia.\n\nHO: \n\nTelevision is not better in  carrying quality advertisements than the other media. \n\nHA: \n\nMass media advertising contributes to national development.\n\nHO: \n\nMass media advertising does not contribute to national development.\n\nHA: \n\nBroadcast commercial messages have more credibility than print media messages.\n\nHO: \n\nBroadcast commercial messages do not have more credibility than print media messages.\n\nHA: \n\nThe influence of advertising on the audience depends on the medium carrying it. \n\nHO: \n\nThe influence of advertising on the audience does not depend on the medium carrying it.\n\nThe survey research technique was used to gather data through the\n\nquestionnaire distributed to media audience in  Enugu  State.\n\n At the end of the research, this researcher tested the four hypotheses and found out that they were all positive. Other findings were that an advertiser judges an advertising medium according to exposure opportunity, the number of people who might see the advertisement, and message opportunity, which is the way in which a particular medium carries  the advertisement . \n\n In conclusion, it can be deduced from the findings that media characteristics govern the choice of media in advertising. \n\n This researcher recommends that for advertising to bring about national development, its messages should, apart from selling goods, services and products, should be in line with some well known development-oriented media theories such as the Social Responsibility,\n\nDemocratic-Participant, and Development Media theories.        \n\nCHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION   1.1  PREAMBLE \n\n         The mass media of communication are divided into two--print and electronic. According to Okunna (1999:66), the electronic media of radio and television are distinct from other electronic media because they make use of transmission technology through which their signals are scattered far and wide. Hence, of all the electronic media of communication only radio and television are referred to as broadcast media.\n\n Okunna (1999:66) goes further to say that this technology involves the use of a transmitter which generates waves (electromagnetic impulses) that carry voice transmissions or messages which make up radio and television programmes. Radio waves travel through the air, carrying the programmes to homes and other locations where they are received through radio and television sets. There are no wires connecting the transmitter to these receiving sets, hence communication through the broadcast media is also known as wireless communication or wireless transmission (see appendix II of this work).\n\n Radio and television carry different types of messages called programmes. One of such messages is advertising. Advertising is defined by the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON) as communication in the media paid for by an identifiable sponsor and directed “at a target audience with the aim of imparting information about a product, service, idea or cause.”\n\n The thrust of this research is to find out whether the broadcast media of radio and television are more efficient media of advertising than other media of communication – print and electronic.\n\n Books, newspapers and magazines are part of the print media while  the other media like ultra-wave billboards, recordings, films, cinema, slides and telephones belong in the electronic media.\n\n This researcher set out to investigate, in an empirical way, whether the 1 broadcast media are the best media or tools to carry advertising in Nigeria, knowing the potentials, limitations and characteristics of both print and electronic media of communication.\n\n Whereas the print media are known for their possession of certain characteristics such as permanence and special mental demand, the broadcast media are known to possess characteristics such as transience, limited airtime and limited mental demand.\n\n When we write for the print media, we are writing information that will be taken in through the eye. On the other hand, information written for the broadcast media is taken in primarily through the ear.\n\n This researcher set out to find out how far these basic differences between the print  media and the electronic media would influence consumer behavior.\n\n1.2  THE RESEARCH PROBLEM\n\n Eminent scholars in the field of Mass communication like Festinger (1957), Schramm (1976), Rosengren (1985), Tan and Tan (1986) McQuail (1987:4), Bittner (1989:376) and Okunna (1999:176) have carried out mass media effects studies which have come out with revelations that give us an insight into what effects mass media messages could have on the audience. However, studies of effects of mass media advertising on the audience are quite different from studies of which media are best to be used for advertising campaigns.\n\n In Nigeria, so many media of communication are involved in the competitive bid to advertise products, goods and services. Little is known as to which of them is most appropriate and more rewarding to be used as  a medium or media of advertising. It is necessary to find out the most suitable medium or media of advertising so as to know which of them is most likely to make a more lasting impact on the mass media audience.\n\n Advertisement rates are exorbitant and the financial means with which to advertise goods, products and services  is not easy to come by. If the identifiable  sponsors of advertisement must pay heavily for the advertised commodities, is it not wise then that they choose the most efficient media or tool to do the job of advertising?  A British historian and essayist, Thomas B. Macaulay, once said, “Advertising is to business what steam is to industry----the sole propelling force. Nothing except the mint can make money without advertising.”\n\n Many scholars and academics, including professionals and proprietors in the field of broadcasting, share Macaulay’s point of view. De Fleur and Dennis (1994:318),  for instance, agree that “almost without exception, Macaulay’s principle holds true for businesses today, and is especially true for the mass media.”\n\n Macaulay’s view is generally true for advertising, but there is still a need to determine which of the media is best for carrying advertising messages. This is particularly necessary in view of the distinctions in the characteristics of the different media--print and broadcast.\n\n1.3 STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM\n\n As stated earlier, print media messages are in a permanent form and so the reader of these messages has the privilege of visiting and revisiting the message as often as he likes. If he forgets a message or a point in a message, he could still get a copy of the message. In the broadcast media, once a message is given, within a few seconds, the audience forgets it. If the broadcast media have reach and glamour,  do these attributes place them at an advantage over the print media? \n\nConstant power cuts in Nigeria is a veritable source of worry and frustration to many a consumer of broadcast media messages. Once there is electric power outage, media consumers are forced to look for alternative power sources. \n\n The audience has no such worry if he is a print media consumer. Messages are waiting for him in a permanent, printed form whether there is power cut or not. In the case of broadcast media, messages can never wait. As the media audiences look for alternative power sources, the messages keep going and very soon get to the end. Which of the mass media of communication then is the best to be used as a tool for advertising in Nigeria? Where do the media audience get more benefits from advertising? From which medium or media?\n\nIt was the aim of this researcher to delve into this area of study with the hope of coming out with empirical findings.\n\n1.4  OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe objectives of this research are as outlined below:\n\n1.           To find out the various reasons given by the mass media audience as to which medium is better in carrying  quality advert messages than the others.\n\n2.           To determine the extent to which mass media advertising contributes to national development.\n\n3.           To determine whether broadcast advert messages have more credibility than the print media advert messages.\n\n4.           To find out whether the influence of advertising on the audience depends on the medium carrying it.\n\n5.           To offer useful suggestions and recommendations in this area of study.\n\n1.5  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study is significant in that it aims to find out the problems and prospects of mass media advertising in Nigeria and the suitability of various mass media of communication for advertising. If the broadcast media, for instance, are preferred by the audience, what are the likely reasons for the preference?\n\nThis research will enable the researcher to break a new ground in a relatively new field of study in mass communication. It is envisaged that the knowledge acquired in the course of this study will help in no small measure in encouraging other researchers who may be interested in replicating this study.\n\nManagers of the print and electronic media, advertisers and advertising agencies, governments as well as private individuals stand to gain from this study.\n\n1.6 RESEARCH  QUESTIONS\n\nFor the purpose of this study, answers were sought to the following questions:\n\n1.         Are the broadcast media of communication better tools for advertising than the other media of communication or are the latter better than the broadcast media?\n\n2.         Which of the media of mass communication has more credibility than others? \n\n3.         Does advertising influence the media audience more when carried by the broadcast media than it does when carried by the print media?\n\n4.         Which medium is preferred more for the purpose of advertising?\n\n1.7  HYPOTHESES\n\nFor the purpose of this project, this researcher put forward four hypotheses:\n\nHA: Television is better in carrying quality adverts/commercials than other media.\n\nHO: Television is not better of carrying quality adverts/commercials than other media. \n\nHA:  Mass media advertising contributes to national development.\n\nHO: Mass media advertising does not contribute to national development.\n\nHA:   Broadcast commercial messages have more credibility than print media messages.\n\nHO: Broadcast commercial messages do not have more credibility than print media messages.\n\nHA: The influence of advertising on the audience depends on the medium carrying\n\nit. \n\nHO: The influence of advertising on the audience does not depend on the medium carrying it.\n\n1.8 DEFINITION OF VARIABLES 1.8.1 CONCEPTUAL DEFINITIONS\n\n*             Mass media is defined as media used for communicating to a mass of people simultaneously. \n\n*             Broadcasting is defined as the dissemination of information, ideas, opinions, messages using the radio or television as channels.\n\n*             Tool is defined  as an implement used in performing a  task.\n\n*             Credibility is defined as the amount of confidence or trust reposed on something or someone by another.\n\n*             Advertising is the selling of goods, products and services by creating awareness on them in the potential consumer. \n\n1.8.2 OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS\n\n*             Mass media, operationally, is defined as radio, television, newspaper and magazine. \n\n*             Broadcasting for the purpose of this research refers to the use of radio and /or television to transmit advertising messages.\n\n*             Tool, in this study, is used as synonym for medium or a channel. \n\n*             Credibility is defined as the belief the media user has in the advertising message.\n\n*             Advertising is that portion of the media occupied by a message intended to sell goods, services and products. \n\n1.9  ASSUMPTIONS\n\n         The assumption of this research work was that the mass media consumers who will constitute the respondents of this researcher are active users of the print and broadcast media of communication. \n\n1.10  SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study was limited to media consumers in Enugu State. This purposeful decision to confine the study to Enugu was made because a study such as this is concerned with respondents who have access to the mass media; such people still live mainly in urban areas. This study in no way attempted to study everything that is concerned with the problems and prospects of mass media advertising in Nigeria. This decision  therefore necessitated the use of sampling as explained in chapter three of this work.",

        "content": "THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON NATIONAL SECURITY - NIGERIA’S PERSPECTIVE\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nWhen the Arab Spring erupted in 2010, one of the first things people noticed was the very visible role\nsocial media\nseemed to play.  Many began to call the series of political uprisings “Twitter Revolutions” and a lively debate broke out about the importance of the new technology.\n\nThe Egypt revolution started in December 2010; unprecedented mass demonstrations against poverty, corruption, and political repression broke out in several Arab countries, challenging the authority of some of the most entrenched regimes in the Middle East and North Africa. Such was the case in Egypt, where in 2011 a popular uprising forced one of the region‟s longest-serving and most influential leaders, President Hosni Mubarak from power.\n\n The first demonstrations occurred in Tunisia in December 2010, triggered by the selfimmolation of a young man frustrated by Tunisia‟s high unemployment rate and rampant police corruption. Rallies calling for President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali to step down spread throughout the country, with policeoften resorting to violence to control the crowds. As clashes between police and protesters escalated, Ben Ali announced a series of economic and political reforms in an unsuccessful attempt to end the unrest. Demonstrations continued, forcing Ben Ali to flee the country. The apparent success of the popular uprising in Tunisia, by then dubbed the Jasmine Revolution, inspired similar movements in other countries, including Egypt, Yemen, and Libya.\n\n In Egypt, demonstrations organized by youth groups, largely independent of Egypt‟s established opposition parties, took hold in the capital and in cities around the country. Protesters called for Mubārak to step down immediately, clearing the way for free elections and democracy.\n\nAs the demonstrations gathered strength, the Mubārak regime resortead to increasingly violent tactics against protesters, resulting in hundreds of injuries and deaths. Mubārak‟s attempts to placate the protesters with concessions, including a pledge to step down at the end of his term in\n\n2011 and naming Omar Suleiman as vice president, the first person to serve as such in Mubārak‟s nearly three-decade presidency did little to quell the unrest. After almost three weeks of mass protests in Egypt, Mubārak stepped down as president, leaving the Egyptian military in control of the country.\n\nAlthough protesters in Egypt focused most of their anger on domestic issues such as poverty and government oppression, many observers noted that political change in Egypt could impact the country‟s foreign affairs, affecting long-standing policies. Central elements of Egypt‟s foreign policy under Mubārak and his predecessor as president, Anwar el-Sādāt, such as Egypt‟s political-military alignment with the United States and the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty, embraced by Egypt‟s leaders but unpopular with the Egyptian public, could be weakened or rejected under a new regime.\n\n International reactions to the 2011 Egyptian revolution refer to external responses to the events that took place in Egypt between 25 January and 10 February 2011, as well as some of the events after the collapse of the government of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, such as Mubarak's trial. The reactions have generally been either measured or supportive of the Egyptian people, with most governments and organizations calling for non-violent responses on both sides and peaceful moves towards reform. Whilst the protesters called for Mubarak to step down immediately, most foreign governments stopped short of this demand, at least during the early phases of the protests, due to real politik concerns about the consequences of a power vacuum on the stability of Egypt specifically and to the wider Middle East as a whole. Some Middle Eastern leaders expressed support for Mubarak. Meanwhile many governments issued travel advisories and evacuated their citizens from the country.\n\nThe protests captured worldwide attention in part due to the increasing use of Twitter, Face book, YouTube, and other social-media platforms, which empowered activists and onlookers to communicate, coordinate, and document the events as they occur. Many countries experienced their own solidarity protests in support of the Egyptians. As the levels of meta-publicity increased, the Egyptian government stepped up efforts to limit Internet access, especially to social media. In response there has been hacktivism, with global groups attempting to provide alternative communication methods for the Egyptians.\n\n1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nThere is no doubt that that social media has impacted in the social and political mobilization in around the world, in the Middle East, in Africa, and other regions.  \n\nSince the Arab revolution came about in the first half of 2011, social media has been referred to as a key factor in political and social mobilization. Social media has served as a powerful to revolutionary movements in different parts of the world, mainly in Africa and in third world countries. There have been several debates on the impacts of social media on political and social\n\nmobilization, in view of these debates, this study seeks to determine whether social media has impacted on political and social mobilization.\n\nThe main thrust of this study is to take an objective view assessing the impact of social media on the political and social mobilization in Africa using the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 as a case study. \n\n1.3 OBJECTIVE OF RESEARCH\n\n The broad objective of this study is to assess the impact of social media on the political and social mobilization in Africa. \n\nThe specific objectives are to: \n\n1.      Identify the history and role of social media in the political and social mobilization of the African people;\n\n2.      Determine the extent to which social media has impacted on political and social mobilization of Egyptians and other sympathizers towards the revolution;\n\n3.      Analyze the social and political implications of social media in the Egyptian revolution of 2011; and \n\n4.      Identify whether social media as a factor was a major contributor to the political and social mobilization in the Egyptian revolution.\n\n1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\nThe following research questions are drawn mainly from the objectives and would guide the conduct of this work.\n\n•      What role did social media play in Africa before the Egyptian Revolution of 2011?\n\n•      To what extent was social media used to advance individual and collective interests in the\n\nEgyptian Revolution of 2011?\n\n•      Did social media impact positively or otherwise on the Egyptian Revolution of 2011?\n\n•      How important was the social media to the political and social mobilization in the\n\nEgyptian revolution of 2011?\n\n1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\n The main purpose of this research is to determine the impacts of social media on the political and social mobilization in Africa. This research would also help to analyze how important social media is to the mobilization of Africa; both socially and politically.\n\nAnother major significance of this research is to show how social media impacted on the\n\nEgyptian Revolution of 2011 and how it further affected political and social mobilization across Africa.\n\nIn addition to this, this study will serve as reference point to the other students and researchers that are to carry out a research on this subject matter and will also serve as a contribution to knowledge to non-academic persons as they can read it and have better understanding of what the subject matter is.\n\n1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\n The scope of this study will focus on the impact of social media on the political and social mobilization in Africa; a case study of the Egyptian revolution of 2011. \n\nFurthermore, this study will adopt Egypt as its main setting in assessing the impacts of social media on the political and social mobilization in Africa, focusing on the 2011, being period in which the Revolution took place.\n\n1.7 ORGANISATION OF THE STUDY\n\nThis research study is organized into five chapters. \n\n The first chapter includes the introduction to the study, a background to the study, the statement of problem and the objectives of the study. This chapter also entails the research question, the research hypothesis, the significance of the study, the scope as well as the research methodology and the operational definition of terms.\n\n Chapter two comprises of the review of literature, theoretical frameworks as well as the conceptual clarification of terms\n\n The following section, chapter three discusses the methodology employed for the\n\ngathering of data, both primary and secondary source of data collection; while the fourth chapter focuses on the analysis of the data obtained for the study of this research. Finally, chapter five focuses on the findings, conclusions and recommendations of this study\n\n1.8 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\n A combination of secondary and primary was employed.

        "content": "THE PERCEPTION OF FEDERAL RADIO CORPORATION OF NIGERIA (FRCN) NETWORK NEWS (A CASE STUDY OF IBADAN TOWN RESIDENTIALS)\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.0         Background to the Study\n\nAccording to Ude (1998) in his book, Introduction to Reporting and News Writing, he defines news as “the timely report of facts or opinions that hold interests or importance or both for a considerable number of people”. Ukozor (2003) sees news “as something new and unusual. While Kamath (1980: 33), says news “is any event, ideas or opinions that is timely, interests, or affects a large number of people in a community and that is capable of being understood by them”. News moves through many different media, based on word of mouth, printing, postal systems, broadcasting, and electronic\ncommunication\n. Having access to current events and up-todate information has value in the modern world because of the constantly changing nature of the world. Without regular access to news, most people would be unaware of the various events taking place, both locally and around the world that has an impact on their lives. The news media plays an important role in society.  It sets the stage for political news, manages their agenda, sources, and controls the information.  It functions as a window to the outside world, and possesses the ability to shape public knowledge, attitudes, and voting behavior.\n\nWhile not everything that happens has an impact on all people equally, news organizations generally tailor their content to a specific individual. Events happening in a distant location can impact economies and various commodities over the long term. This means that having access to this information can help investors to better understand what is affecting their investments and allow them react accordingly. A drought in a foreign country can cause grain prices to rise in other regions as the afflicted population begins calling for aid from allies. Finally, political tides turn far too quickly, and without being informed, it is difficult for people who are affected by it to be prepared for the results. Further, this is why many of the stories that are broadcast on nightly news programs are far-reaching and varied. A term which has entered common parlance to differentiate cable news from traditional news broadcast is “Network News”.\n\n The standardized criteria for judging news value as discussed by Ukozor (2003) are as follows: consequences / impact, prominence, timeliness, novelty and Human interest.\n\n1.      Consequence: is the most important criterion in determining news value. It has to do with news events that affect the lives of the largest number of people. It should be considered at every level, both for good news and bad. It is the grater effects. \n\n2.      Prominence: deals on the well-known people (important personalities), institutions in the society etc. proximity bothers on the events that happened within the locality of the audience. \n\n3.      Timeliness: means that news should be reported to the public which it is fresh e as soon as it unfolds lest it become stale news. \n\n4.      Novelty: means the unusual or odd issues that happened in the society (oddity). \n\n5.      Human interest has to do with stories that most often touch human feelings.\n\nThe term radio news is similar to television news but is transmitted through the medium of radio; it is based on the audio aspect rather than the visual aspect. Sound bites are captured through various reporters and played back through the radio. News updates occur more often on the radio than on the television, usually about once or twice an hour. Newscasts, also known as bulletins or news programs, differ in content, tone and presentation style depending on the format of the channel on which they are broadcast, and their timeslot. \n\nRadio news can range from as little as a minute to as much as the stations entire schedule, such as the case of all news radio or talk radio. Radio news can be a mix of local, national and international news, as well as entertainment, weather and traffic, or they may be incorporated into separate bulletins. In view of this, the study would attempt to examine the perception of Ibadan residents of Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN) network news.\n\nIn 1951, the Nigerian Broadcasting Services (NBS) was established with the intention to indigenizing broadcasting. Incidentally, the radio station established at Ibadan happened to be the first broadcasting station to be established in any of the British controlled territories, while it runs an independent station it got technical supports from the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C). The voice of Nigeria (VON) went on air January 1, 1962 as part of the NBC. The corporation was a parastatal of the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture, the corporation later became the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN). The Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN) was established by a decree on February 28, 1979. The corporation is charged with the responsibility of radio broadcasting on short wave or powerful Medium Wave for effective simultaneous reception in more than one state of the federation at any point in time.   \n\nIbadan is the capital city of Oyo State and the third largest metropolitan area, by population, in Nigeria, after Lagos and Kano, with a population of over 3 million Ibadan is also the largest metropolitan geographical area. At Nigerian independence, Ibadan was the largest and most populous city in the country and the third in Africa after Cairo and Johannesburg. Ibadan is located in south-western Nigeria, 128 km inland northeast of Lagos and 530 km southwest of Abuja, the federal capital, and is a prominent transit point between the coastal region and the areas to the north. Ibadan had been the center of administration of the old Western Region since the days of the British colonial rule, and parts of the city's ancient protective walls still stand to this day. The principal inhabitants of the city are the Yoruba‟s. Ibadan, surrounded by seven hills, is the second largest city in Nigeria. It came into existence when bands of Yoruba renegades following the collapse of the Yoruba Oyo Empire, began settling in the area towards the end of the 18th century; attracted by its strategic location between the forests and the plains.\n\n1.1 Statement of the Problem\n\nFRCN is widely perceived as pro-government in its news delivery because there are national burning issues that the station suppresses, manipulates or kills which some privately-owned stations would freely report. As a result of this, people seem to have largely lost public trust and confidence in the station‟s network news. Therefore, the study would try to examine critically how the Ibadan residents perceive FRCN network news.\n\n1.2 Objective of the Study\n\nThe following were the objectives of the study:\n\nI.                  To find out how often the residents listen to FRCN network.\n\nII.               To ascertain whether the residents like listening to FRCN network news.\n\nIII.            To determine the resident‟s perception of FRCN network news.\n\n1.3 Research Questions\n\nThe following were the research questions which guided the study:\n\nI.                  How often do the residents listen to FRCN network news?\n\nII.               Do the residents like listening to FRCN network news?\n\nIII.            How do the residents perceive FRCN network news?\n\n1.4 Significance of the Study\n\nThe following were the significance of the study:\n\n1.      It would enable FRCN to know how effective its network news is and what the audience think about it; the findings of the study would help the network station to adjust where necessary and ultimately lead to effective news dissemination.\n\n2.      It would also add to the body of literature in the area of media audience.\n\n1.5 Scope of the Study\n\nThe study was limited to the residents of Ibadan town, Oyo State.\n\n1.6 Organization of the Study\n\nThe content of the research project was arranged thus: Chapter One gives an introduction of the study, Chapter Two will attempt to review literature as regards this study, Chapter three will look at methodology, and Chapter four will look to analyze data while Chapter five will deal with the summary and conclusion. \n\n1.7          Operational Definition of Terms\n\nThe following are the meanings of terms as used in the context of the study:\n\nAudience: refers to the people who listen to the station‟s news broadcast.\n\nPerception: refers to the way in which something is regarded, understood or interpreted.\n\nNetwork News: refers to news received simultaneously by the audience in the nooks and crannies of the country.\n\nNews: refers to any event, idea, or opinion that is timely, that interests or affects a large number of people in a community, and that is capable of being understood by them.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAreola, O.

        "content": "THE ROLE OF MEDIA IN CURBING THE SPREAD OF CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC IN NIGERIA\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1.   Background to the study\n\nMedia and society are closely related to each other. The extensive impact of media on society can easily be seen these days. Media reflects our society, how it works and what it constitutes. With the advancement in technological area, our society has also observed the expansion in the thoughts and ideas of people. Every single invention starting from the printing press to the latest smartphones our society has accepted it. Earlier people used to communicate things with               the help of sketch and print forms but as time passes the medium became more advanced.  Today people are just a click away from any and every information that is available on the internet. There are various forms of media that help to inform, educate and entertain our society. Media can be in print form that is through newspapers, books, magazines etc. Media includes an electronic form for spreading information which is one of the most used media of mass communication. With the help of radio and TV, listeners and viewers not only get updated but it also creates an understanding of current happenings. Radio being an audio medium helps in disseminating information to every nook and corner of our country. Radio has also played a vital role in creating a platform for imagination. The reach of this audio medium is not only limited to urban areas but it has covered a wide range even to the remote areas of our country. The people living in rural parts of the country are getting more benefits from the audio medium of mass communication. The programs  on  radio  cater  the  interest  of  rural  section  which  constitutes  small-scale  industries,  farming,  forestry etc.\n\nAlthough the first reported case of Corona Virus 2019 was in December, 2019 with very little information passed concerning the outbreak that killed a total of 2000 people in China by Febrary 21, 2020 and On March 23 2020, Italy reported 602 new deaths, bringing the total to 6,077. There were other outbreaks of Corona Virus occurring as a result of different strains  SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV NL63 in 2004, HKU1 in 2005, MERS-CoV in 2012.\n\nThe most protracted and complicated Pandemic of Corona Virus Disease (COVID) to date and the first globally started with 40 cases in Wuhan, China on December 2019 and this majorly and rapidly spread to other European countries such as Italy and Spain which recorded the largest amounts of deaths per day\n\nIn Nigeria, the first known case of Corona Virus came from an Italian immigrant who was already exposed in Italy. He arrived Nigeria on 22nd February 2020, The Italian, who is a consultant with Lafarge, reportedly spent the night at an undisclosed hotel near Lagos airport and moved to the company’s facility in Ewekoro, Ogun state, the next morning. He was said to have spent the night at Lafarge’s facility when he fell sick and was taken to the company’s medical Centre where preliminary diagnosis began. After testing positive for the disease, he was subsequently quarantined at the Infectious Disease Centre in Yaba, Lagos state.\n\nThe symptoms of the disease include fever (greater than 38.6°C), severe headache, weakness, diarrhea (rare cases), difficulty breathing (severe cases), lack of appetite, cough, sore throat, chest pain, difficulty in breathing, difficulty swallowing, impaired kidney, liver and Lung infection\n\n Occasionally the country’s airwaves are greeted with the sad news of traditionally and culturally unfamiliar news of suicide. Whenever these odd stories greet our news headlines the country’s cyberspace (Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram) are a-washed with sober feelings of utter shock, disappointment and despondency and pity. The country is seen coming together for once and rising above political sentiments to sympathizing with the victims of these despicable acts. The reactions are not surprising as the acts of suicide are something that is yet quite uncharacteristically familiar with the Nigerian/African culture that holds life as a premium value that is divine (Alake, 2018).\n\nThe news reportage of the cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria and its possible attendant cause; death, Ill-health, Socio-economic paralysis, anxiety and fear (which could be caused by many Nigerian unique factors) has been severally reported with different truth variants and phases which begs the question of the truth of the fact.  Research on this issue has shown profoundly that there is a direct and indirect correlation between the media reportage of COVID-19\n\nAccording to McQuail (1979) when looking at influence of mass media ones focus should rather be on comparing media reality and social reality in certain situations since the diatribe of influences stream from source of media content, consumers of media contents to shape of media contents. For example, according to Sampei and Aoyagi-Usui (2009) increased awareness and concern of climate change amongst the populace was as result of increased media coverage of global warming from January 1998 to July 2007.\n\nA sample of the four major newspapers sampled showed that the stories on Corona Virus ranged from current information as it pertains to Nigeria with follow up on the occurrences in West Africa as well as globally made the rounds in the stories reported. A new dimension to the Corona Virus story came from the belief by people that were told to hot lemon so as to prevent the corona virus infection also was reported in the newspapers .The intervention of the government as well as media helped in curbing the spread of this false rumours on the Corona virus cases. The early reports on Corona virus were on closure of schools, large social and religious gatherings and late resumption of schools due to the Corona virus outbreak nationwide until some necessary measures were put in place to adequately ensure that the outbreak does not spread in schools as well as other mass gathering in the nation. The aim of the study was to assess the role of media in the Corona virus reportage and its implication in creating awareness and stopping the spread amongst the populace.\n\n1.2.    Statement of the problem\n\nEvidence shows that an outbreak of Corona virus disease recently occurred in Nigeria, involving many states and fatalities. The mass media can play a positive role in combating the corona virus pandemic and its attendant fatality in Nigeria. The mass media encompasses print and non-print methods of disseminating information (including magazines, newspapers, radio, and television) toa large number of people. One of the advantages of the mass media in health promotion activities and/or health intervention is that it can be used to reach very high numbers of people to engage in activities related to health behavior changes (Bala, Strzeszynski and Topor-Madry, 2017). Several authors have noted signiﬁcant positive roles of the mass media in health interventions and positive impacts in the promotion of health behavior changes among people with communicable and non-communicable diseases, reduction of mental health-related stigma, and improvement in health service utilization (Carson, Ameer, and Sayehmiri, 2017). Based on the roles the mass media can play in health intervention, authors have described the mass media as an educator, supporter, and promoter.  Thus, the mass media can be utilized as an independent type of intervention for educating people and supporting lifestyle changes (Clement, Lassman, and Barley, 2013). In addition, the mass media can be utilized as a complementary form of intervention for promoting or supplementing the efficacies other interventions aimed at health promotion. Proper execution of mass media campaigns can help complement the efforts of clinicians toward the prevention of diseases (Stern, 2015). Therefore, the aim of this paper is to highlight the role of media in curbing the spread of coronavirus pandemic in Nigeria.\n\n1.2    Statements of Problems\n\nEvidence shows that an outbreak of Corona virus disease recently occurred in Nigeria, involving many states and fatalities.

Therefore, the aim of this paper is to highlight the role of media in curbing the spread of coronavirus pandemic in Nigeria.\n\n1.3   Objectives of the study\n\nThe general objective of this research is to determine the role of media in curbing the spread of coronavirus pandemic in Nigeria.\n\nThe specific objective of the research is to determine the following:\n\n1.      The frequency of reports on media in curbing the spread of coronavirus pandemic in Nigeria.\n\n2.      The nature of the coverage on Corona Virus by the media\n\n3.      The positioning of the media report on corona virus disease\n\n4.      The direction of coverage on corona virus in the media\n\n1.4    Research Questions\n\nThe following research questions will guide the study;\n\n1.      What is the frequency of reports on media in curbing the spread of coronavirus pandemic in Nigeria?\n\n2.      What is the nature of the coverage on Corona Virus by the media?\n\n3.      What is the positioning of the media report on corona virus disease?\n\n4.      What is the direction of coverage on corona virus in the media?\n\n1.5   Significance of the Study\n\nAs the rate of spread of corona virus increases in the country, there is an urgent need for extensive research to be conducted in the area. Granted that for most the issue of suicide could be delineated to the field of clinical sciences, and research, however, research and information gotten from the field of mass communication could be of value to the general body of knowledge in bringing solutions to the rising problem of infectious diseases in the country.\n\nAccording to the Bryant and Miron (2004), the high-frequency consumption of media content makes people susceptible to the views projected in the media content they take in.  If the assumptions are anything to go by then the need to investigate on the reportage of corona virus (one of the rising cases of cause death in the country) will be a move in the right direction.\n\nThis study will be of great help to media publishing houses who cover stories on related topics in order to help them shape their contents to be favorable to the health and psychology of their audience.\n\nThe research will add to the body of knowledge on the issue of Corona virus for scholars and research to build upon for further research.\n\n1.6   Scope of the Study\n\nThis study focuses on the newspapers reports on Corona virus disease. Since every research has its time and limit, the scope of this study is the newspaper reportage or coverage of depression and suicide between February and December, 2020. The scope of this study is delimited to coverage of depression and suicide on only selected media publishing companies, Only issues surrounding the Corona virus disease will be the main interest of the study\n\n1.7   Theoretical Framework\n\n            The theoretical framework for this research is built around the agenda setting theory and the social responsibility theory of communication.\n\n1.7.1   Agenda Setting Theory\n\n            The agenda setting theory is a theory of mass communication that provides explanation on how the media through its programmes and contents consciously and unconsciously list, plan or outline things, events or issues to be considered. The media according to the postulations of this theory set agenda for the public to follow through their coverage of issues, events or things in the society. The mass media achieve this by focusing attention or highlighting silent issues in the society through their coverage thereby making people to think along that line. The mass media according to the postulations of the theory of agenda setting play their drums and in the process the members of the society begin to dance to the tune of the music played by the media. The mass media in acting as agenda setters to the members of the society, the mass media may not tell the members of the society what to think about but what to think about.”\n\nConsidering this, McQuail (2010), posits that the term “agenda setting” was a coinage of McCombs and Shaw in 1972, in describing a phenomenon which had been noticed and studied in the context to the role the mass media played during electioneering campaigns. The main thrust of the theory holds that the news media through it coverage to issues, events and things in the society indicate to the public who are members of the society what the main issues of the day are and as such it is reflected in what the public perceives as the main issues. Trenaman and McQuail (1961) as cited by McQuail (2010) argues that “the agenda setting theory strongly suggest assumptions that members of the society think what they are told but at no time or level do they think what they are told.” Findings of studies on the agenda setting theory over the years after the development of the theory indicated that there is a correspondence between the order of importance given in the media to ‘issues’ and the order of significance attached to the same issues by members of the society and government officials.\n\n            The assumptions of the theory revolve around how the media play an active role in giving importance to issues which they highlight as important to the society. Nwabueze (2006), added that the media frequent coverage and highlighting or emphasizing prominence to issues in the media, members of the society attached importance to those issues the media have giving prominence to more than others.\n\n            Newspapers reports, or coverage on the Corona Virus disease highlight the importance it attached to the issues in the society. Governments and Nigerians began to pay serious attentions and attach importance to the disease as result of the consistent reportage of incidences by mass media channels such as the newspapers. Newspapers coverage on issues and events surrounding Corona Virus disease indicates to Nigerians what the main issues relating to health areas reflected in pages of the newspapers. \n\nThe agenda setting theory neglected the possible effects on what people think concerning who is important, where important things happen and why things are important. In it assumptions, the agenda setting theory did not give credence to who is important in the coverage of the media that makes the individual important for the media coverage, the location the importance things happen and why are the things or issues highlighted by media coverage are important to the members of the society. All these are not considerations to the postulations of the theory.\n\n            Another point of concern not reflected in the assumptions of the theory is the definition of what the agenda portrayed by the media is, are the issues reflected on the media coverage the agenda or priorities of the media, those of the public who are members of the society or those of the policy? In a way, was the coverage or highlight or prominence accorded to reports on depression and suicide, the priorities or interest of the media, members of the society or policy of the government?\n\n            The other theory that supported the theoretical framework of this study is the social responsibility theory.\n\n1.7.2    Social Responsibility Media Theory\n\n            The social responsibility media theory is a development of the libertarian theory of the press. Okunna (1999) cited in Asemah (2011) described the theory as a modern theory which was developed in the mid-20th century. The thrust of the theory, was developed from the growing concern and awareness that in some important respects, the free market idea in the media popularise by the libertarian theory has failed to fulfil the promises of the media and deliver expected benefits to the members of the society.\n\n            Asemah (2011) argues that the social responsibility media theory is anchored on the notion of a free press acting responsibly to the society. This indicates that the media which enjoys considerable freedom from the government is obliged to be responsible to the communication needs in contemporary society.\n\n            Ojobor (2002) cited in Okujeni (2013) opines that the theory postulates that the operations and activities of the mass media practitioners and the media as institutions in the society can only be guarantee when the society is safe for all. Therefore, the mass media must consciously assist the society to achieve considerable safer environment for all its members.\n\n            In addition, the thrust of the theory indicates that the mass media in appreciation for enjoying considerable freedom in disseminating information to the members of the society must be accountable and responsible to the social needs of the society.\n\n            McQuail (2010, p.147) argues that a social responsible media should ‘provide a full, truthful, comprehensive and intelligent account of the day’s events in a context which gives them meaning’. It should ‘serve as a forum for the exchange of comment and criticism’ and be a ‘common carrier of the public expression’. The media should also give a ‘representative picture of constituent groups in society’ and also present and clarify the ‘goals and values of society’.\n\n            McQuail (2010) however, highlighted the principles of the social responsibility media theory to include the following:\n\n1. The media have obligations to society, and media ownership is a public trust.\n\n2. News media should be truthful, accurate, fair, objective and relevant\n\n3. The media should be free, but self-regulated\n\n4. The media should follow agreed codes of ethics and professional conduct.\n\n5. Under some circumstances, government may need to intervene to safeguard the public interest.\n\n            The incidences of health and infectious diseases in Nigeria has continued to assume worrisome dimensions. It threatens the survival of the society and the value for human lives in the country.\n\nHowever, the thrust of this theory emphasizes the responsibility of the newspaper’s channels of communication in the society with strong influence in the society. It can influence the de-escalation of incidences of infectious diseases within the society as it enlightens people on the need for social distancing and precautionary measures to limit the spread of the disease as well as protect themselves from impending danger. Newspapers like other channels of the mass media are expected to be socially responsible and accountable to the sustenance the sanctity of human lives in society. Since most newspapers in Nigeria enjoy considerable freedom from the control of government, it is therefore, expected and obliged to be responsible in communicating meaningful information that would protect the populace against the corona Virus disease.\n\n1.8    Definition of terms\n\nNewspapers: Newspapers are written publications containing published news and information on issues periodically published daily. It refers to the newspapers that covered and reported about the issues relating to depression and suicide  in Nigeria.\n\nCommunication: This is the process of sharing of information which includes five basic factors: an initiator; a recipient; a vehicle or channel; a message and an effect. The initiator designs or encodes the message and transfer the message through the vehicle with the intent of stimulating an effect.\n\nPrint media: The print media refers to the channels of communication that present information on paper, published, printed medium such as newspapers and magazines as opposed to the broadcast media.\n\nCoverage: Coverage refers to the amount or totality of news and information provided by the newspapers on issues through its contents over a specific period. It can also be defined as the way the Nigerian newspapers reported or gave account of issues pertaining to depression and suicide.\n\nSuicide: The Cambridge dictionary defines suicide as the act of killing yourself intentionally or a person who has done this.\n\nVirus: A virus is a small infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea\n\nPandemic: A pandemic is a disease epidemic that has spread across a large region, for instance multiple continents, or worldwide. A widespread endemic disease with a stable number of infected people is not a pandemic. Further, flu pandemics generally exclude recurrences of seasonal flu.\n\nEpidemic: An epidemic is the rapid spread of disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time. For example, in meningococcal infections, an attack rate in excess of 15 cases per 100,000 people for two consecutive weeks is considered an epidemic\n\nCOVID-19: Corona Virus Disease 2019\n\nPolymerase Chain Reaction: Polymerase chain reaction is a medical test widely used in molecular biology to rapidly make millions to billions of copies of a specific DNA sample allowing scientists to take a very small sample of DNA and amplify it to a large enough amount to study in detail",

BACKGROUND OF STUDY\n\nHuman existence would have been meaningless without Information and Communication. Ideas, values, policies and every aspect of socio-cultural, political and economic obligation within the human environments would have been difficult to achieve without adequate dose of information and communication. As a result, information acts as grease for lubricating the entire society. However, the invention of modern means communication with the help of civilization made possible the advancement of science and technology the world has become a global village.\n\nEkwelie and Okonkwo (1983:16-62) recorded that “at one time, man depended on iron and wooden gong, the town crier for the exchange, transmission and dissemination of information and vital news,” but after the second (II) world war, a great leap was made from this tasking mode of information dissemination to a more advanced, mechanized method of transmitting message or news.\n\nBroadcasting came to Nigeria in stages, one of which was the introduction of wired broadcasting more popularly known as radio distribution or re-diffusion in 1939 by the colonial government of British Broadcast Co-operation (BBC) to redistribute its programme by means of wires connected to loudspeakers installed in various homes of subscribers. It was developed in the United Kingdom (UK) in the 1920’s and exported to their colonies. However, its introduction to Nigeria was on the initiative of the engineers of the post of telegraph department in Lagos who had been involved in monitoring the transmission of the BBC on short wave. Since then, the Nigerian mass media industry has witnessed a phenomenal growth since the establishment of Nigeria Broadcasting Service in 1957 and the country’s first television station, set up by the then government of the former western region in 1959. The establishment of western Nigerian Broadcasting Service combined Radio and African first Television service triggered a race by the other two regions to setup theirs. The information and Communication as a loose term in describing ways in which people, machines and communication system can work together to make jobs quicker, more efficient and more accurate.\n\nSiegfried Mandel (1962:22) stated that the world crossed into “information superhighway”, and it is this information superhighway that has tremendously changed the role of communication and information dissemination in the society. Today, with the help of great innovation and scientific inventions, mass communication has been revolutionized with the help of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). Now we talk about satellite transmission and communication, computer communication, digital broadcasting system, computer, internet information and Communication, digital cellular phones (like GSM), fibre optics, microwave technologies, radio visual systems, robots enterprise software among others.\n\nInformation and Communication Technologies has made it possible for dissemination of information evenly and to a wide range of audience especially with the advent of GSM in Nigeria, both the literate, illiterate, urban and rural dwellers alike are kept abreast of vital issues, thereby closing up communication gap or information. Therefore, in realization of this views, it interests the researchers to assess the application of Information and Communication Technologies in the Enugu State Broadcasting Service (ESBS) station.\n\nWhen Marshal McLuhan talked about the global village  many years ago, people at that time thought he was a joker. The new communication technologies have made people become increasingly involved in one another’s life. As Baran, (1999:51) observes, technologies not itself a medium but a social force bringing changes to the media world. Therefore, communication is any artifacts manipulated by man to aid him communicate interpersonally or massively.\n\nThe impact of the information technology on media industry has been improved. Information can reach people around the world within seconds, for instance, digital technology has placed us at a point of a new significant way of development in the history of human communication often called “the Information society” and has transformed the way many men and women work in the media industry (Ilo 2002:22) information can be sent all around the world within seconds with the new technologies, and news can reach people when it happens.\n\n1.2.   Statement of the Research Problem\n\nThe new information and communication technologies have been envisaged by some by some people as the threshold of globalizing the world. Information Technology acts as a great facilitator in globalizing, uniting the disintegrated world and enabling people to gain access to knowledge and services. There is no doubt that the world is becoming homogenous and differences between people are distinguishing. So, there is need for the Nigeria media to live up to the challenges.\n\nThere are many opinions that ESBS station cannot compete well with the rest of its counterparts in Nigeria because of so many teething problems such as lack of facilities, obsolete equipment, inadequate training, poor finance and government interference. As a result, this research will investigate these assertions to ascertain the truth of the matter. Moreover, it will go further to find out whether the application of information and communication technologies has impacted or enhanced the Broadcast media organization in Nigeria by adding value, importance or quality to it.\n\n1.3.    Objectives of the Study\n\nThe overall objective of this study was to assess the use of ICTs in the performance of Nigerian broadcast media. However, the specific objectives include:\n\n1.           To ascertain the level of application of ICTs in Enugu State Broadcasting Service\n\n2.           To identify the factors responsible for that level of  performance Enugu State Broadcasting Service with the use of ICT\n\n3.           To assess the implication of the present level of ICTs performance in Enugu State Broadcasting Service\n\n4.           To recommend ways of improving the adoption and enhanced performance of \n\nEnugu State Broadcasting Service with the use of ICT.\n\n1.4.     Significance of the Study\n\nThe value, importance or quality of ICTs in media development cannot be over emphasized; It is one thing for a medium to adopt the use of ICTs for reliability and efficiency while another which neglects it cannot meet the pace of globalization trend, but it will be an immerse benefit to media outfits who adopt it and make use to it in their operations.\n\n1.5.     Research Questions\n\n        In the course of the study, attempts were made to provide answers to the            following questions which served as a guide in the entire process.\n\n1.   What is the assessment level of ICTs in the performance of Enugu State Broadcasting Service\n\n2.   Why is Enugu State Broadcasting Service still operating at that level of ICTs    for performance?\n\n3. What implication does the present level of ICTs performance have on Enugu State Broadcasting Service?\n\n\nNEED URGENT HELP WITH THIS PROJECT?\n",

It specifically tackles the impact of western TV. programmes on Nigerian university students.  The research posits that the current trends in cultural behaviour of youths in Nigeria as observed among ESUT students Enugu is significantly associated with their perception of Western culture and exposure to western TV. programmes.\n\n          The assumption that foreign media content has direct powerful effects is shared by optimistic modernization theory Lerner 1962, Rovers 1964, Schramm 1964) and the later critical perspective of cultural and media imperialism (MCphail 1981, Pltschull  1984, Garbner 1977.\n\n          Previous studies by Payne and Peake (1977), Barnette Mcphail (1980) Skinner (1984) have all  found western television especially U.S TV. as having levels of influence on the cultural values of viewers in less Developed countries.\n\n          The research applies the theory of Acculturation, along  with the cultivation of enculturation hypothesis.  Defluer and Dennies 1991, Garbner 1977, Morgan 1991).  To explain that acculturation of Nigerian youths takes place as a result of exposure to western TV. which influence the perception of TV. reality and alters self image.  From the review of related literature, the following hypothesis emerged for testing.\n\n          Hi more exposure  to TV will tend to load to identification of western TV stars as models.\n\n          H2 imitation of the behaviours of TV stars will tend to be higher among those who identify with western TV stars than those who identify with Nigerian/African TV. stars.\n\n          H3 students who prefer watching western TV will  tend to approve of  girls initiating love relationship  with men more than those who depend more on TV. for information and entrainment will tend to chose to migrate to western countries more than those who depend more on other media.\n\n          Research hypothesis 1, 2, and 3 received statistical support  from the analysis of collected data using the survey research method.  The testing of hypothesis 4 shows that there are other factors  which influence choice of emigration site along with TV. Recommendations to check the  cultural genocide for further research were preferred.\n\n1.                 Preference for media\n\n2.                 Preference between  local, foreign TV programmes\n\n3.                 Level of Television viewing\n\n4.                 Degree of use of TV. for news and current affairs and entrainment.\n\n5.                 cross tabulation of Sex, degree of use  of TV for  news and entertainment programmes\n\n6.                 identification  with TV stars\n\n7.                 Cross tabulation of TV stars identification with  imitation.\n\n8.                 Reality of stars to local environment.\n\n9.                 Influences of western TV.

It could be seen through the poor quality of life especially now that there are frequent  outbreaks of diseases. One wonders whether our environment will be left to decay due to neglect. Nwabueze (2007:2) gave support to  this when he noted that the environment include the totality of activities, actions and situations that shape the existence of man or any organization in a given habitation.\n\n        Nowadays, the greatest challenge facing all nations is how to preserve the environment for the benefit of future generations. In most developing countries like Nigeria, there exist wide ranges of environmental problems which constitute environmental risk.\n\n        Moreover, the federal government through federal environmental protection agency (FEPA) and other related agencies is doing their best to check the situation. At the level, various state environmental protection agencies including non governmental organizations are trying their best towards the eradication environmental problems (Nwabueze 2004: 1-3). But despite all these efforts, environmental problems have continue to exist in the nation as it nothing is been done.\n\n        Although, environmental problems are seen everywhere both in urban and rural areas, one has to agree with two communication development experts, Colin Frazer and Sonia Refrepoe Strada cited in Olubunmi (2003:21) who insisted that for every problem, there is a solution through communication, but Olubumi (supra) argues that any attempt to address all environmental problems consequently involve all human beings on earth; he further  indicated that the process cannot be possible without effective communication.\n\n        Thus, according to Edwin – Emery (1969:11) communication is the act of transmitting information, ideas and attitude from one person to another. He equally stipulated that before communication can be said to have taken place, that there must be sources, otherwise, called the encoder, and audience receiver also called decoder.\n\n        Robert (1982: 96) equally agree with this when he say that communication also makes art, science, literature and political possible and comprehensible: adding that through communication man avoids the frustrating loneliness of isolation and finds a way of ratifying his needs and wants.\n\n        Similarly, Javawera (1991: 17) defines communication as “an interaction process through which persons or groups relate to each other and share information, experiences and culture”.\n\n        Therefore, the context of communication comprehensively clear and is beyond a reasonable doubt to the extent one cannot claim to have communicated without the receiver giving feedback to show that, what communicated is understood.\n\n        Moreso, African communication system will not be over emphasized, being that African system is indispensable in the communicating process, it especially in the rural areas, because, the channels are trusted and the majority of the people seems to believe in what comes out of them.\n\n        Regrettably, not all change agents realize the greatest opportunities they loose when they ignore this system of African communication. It may be on the basis of not having wider reach, but these systems as Wilson (2006: 10-11) says, political interest groups, political union, ethnic and town unions, national council for women, association, self help group, cooperative societies and cultural groups.\n\n        Nevertheless, other ones can not be over emphasized, owing to the fact that, there are still communication themselves these include, masquerade groups, choiral groups festival traveling theatre such as: African weeding ceremonies and initiation rites. Others are spiritual groups. Like Ogboni, Amorc, Witchcraft Societies, shrine and other organization in an open place such as family meeting (nuclear and extended) other ones include village announcer or town criers among others. However, opinion leaders do also help in influencing their followers by inculcating environment friendly attitude on them. This study is therefore designed to ascertain the relevance of trade system in communicating an environmental risk in Ukelle community in Yala local government area of Cross River state.\n\n        Historically Ukelle is comprised of four (4) villages which include: Wanokom, Wanihem and Wanikade, but according to historical background, Wanokom is the oldest that rule others according to the legend of how Ukelle was, when chief Ikpa Onah, was ruling, there was oneness of hearts, but after his death, the whole of the community were in crisis because, there were confused pertaining who will be the next king, evere before some were told that there were not sons of the soil which lured many of them to  relocate their original lands.\n\n        These four villages lived in a place called Wanokom about 20km West of the present site. Interms of location, Ukelle is located in South East Corner of Yala Local Government Area of Cross River State.\n\n        It occupies an area of approximately 25km or 230 miles and has population of 15.237 out of 1405 million people in 2006 population according to  N.P.C. office in Yala local government headquarter.\n\n        Their main occupation are trading, teaching, palm fruit processing and farming.\n\n        Major environmental problems inherent in Ukelle community are erosion, deforestation, bush burning and other unfriendly environmental culture such as detecting in the bush, dumping hazardous waste on the road.\n\n        In Ukelle the following exist as the major trade system of communication: council of local chief and masquerade while the town crier functions as the broadcaster, others  include age grade, objective which according to Nwogu (2005:177) are communication instrument based on objects which are non verbal information dissemination like palm fond (LIBU) kolanut etc.                      \n\n        Membramophone: this is also an instrument of communication that uses membrane (skin) of animals fixed to wooden frame to produce sound such as talking drum. Nworgu (2005:17) equally describe “aerophones as wind instruments which include flutes, whistle made from bamboo, animal horn and other ones like cannon shot among others”. \n\n1.2    Statement of Research Problems\n\n        The problem which multivated this research is the alarming rate at which environmental risks is increasing in Ukelle community, despite government efforts in reconstruction of the roads and provision of gutters.\n\n        Secondly what promted this research also is nonchanlant attitude of people of Ukelle towards the control of deforestation and bush burning which lead to poor agricultural productivity and incessant erosion, especially during raining season, as Nwabueze (2004:2) state environmental problem leads to poor process of development, poverty and environmental illiteracy.\n\n        A case point was in June 1998 when three (3) children, Mr. and Mrs. Dan Ugbem were drown to death by erosion water.\n\n        Again was in 2005 when one Mrs. Igelle Inaku’s farms where burnt by anonymous and all the farm crops she planted got damaged, where as the poor woman has become aged without children.\n\n        Moreover, there is also a borrow pit which was dug by caterpillar bull dozer when roads where being reconstructed during governors Ebri Clement administration, this borrow pit is now a semi river. This water has also drawn many people to death some were people that went to wash their bread fruit (mellon) and others were those that went to swim but were caught by mud and unfortunately they got drown and died. Though, some of the village roads are now tarred, but yet erosion is still disturbing, there are some deadly pot holes dug by the erosion.\n\n        However, this environmental problems, erosion deforestation and bush burning have created a very irritating problem such as soil infertility to the extent that one cannot brag of good harvest without the aid of animal drops and fertilizer, even loamy soil which is known as best soil for agriculture has equally tuned to muddy land.\n\n        Moreover, this unfriendly environmental problem in Ukelle is being regulated over the years with the aid of African system of communication existing in the community.          \n\n        Idiophone like metal gong, wooden gong, are always at the disposal of town crier to pass important information  in order to put bridges were erosion has damaged in order to rescuer people from being maimed.\n\n        Nevertheless, African system in communicating is always seen as the best medium of communication in Ukelle community. This is why the researcher decided to study the uses and equally the relevance of African media system of communicating environmental risk in Ukelle community.\n\n1.3    Objective of the Study\n\n        This study is set to determine the relevance of Africa media system in communicating environmental risk in Ukelle community.\n\n        Secondly, it is to ascertain the perception of Ukelle community members towards environmental risk communicated through Africa systems of communication. And mostly to make people in Ukelle community to know environmental risk which is prevailing in the community.\n\n1.4    Significance of the Study   \n\n        The significance of these studies can not be overemphasized. The finding of this study will interest government and non-governmental organizations, agencies, groups and other environmentalists who are interested in environmental management communication in order to foster environmental friendly attitude in people.\n\n        Moreso, the result of this study to large extent will assist government policy makers on environment, on how to educate, inform and mobilize rural dwellers towards protecting and maintaining the physical environment from degradation and pollution, the finding will also add to the existence of literature on environmental communication and efficacy of Africa media system of communication.\n\n        1.5    Research Questions\n\n        The following research question will be posed to guide the investigation. Are the members of Ukelle community aware of the existence of the African media?\n\n    Does Ukelle community makes use of African media?\n\n   Are the African media effective in communicating environmental risk in Ukelle?\n\n    To what extent do Ukelle leaders communicate environmental risk to community members through African systems of communication.\n\n1.6    Research Hypotheses\n\n        For effective analysis of the research question, the following null and alternative hypotheses have been proposed.\n\nNull Hypotheses\n\nH1:    There is no decrease in the extent of environmental risk inh",

Organizations are either growing or declining depending on the management by leadership.\n\nAccording to Desmond F. (1979), says\ncommunication\nis the process of maintaining an uninterrupted flow of order, ideas, and suggestions between top management and the rest of the organization. It is a task which requires the manager to communicate with people.\n\nGood communication not only helps management orders to be understood, managers’ knowledge of subordinate attributes and feeling, towards jobs, the films, supervisors and work environment. Effective communication motivates the subordinates. Communication is one of the vital processes that make up the achievement of the goals.\n\nSugder and Morris (1984), says that is it obvious that in any endeavor it requires two or more persons, communications is necessary if individual effort are to be co-ordinate for group action. It is significant to note that a well-planned and organized system of information is what is needed for effectiveness decision making in any organization.\n\nAccording to Ugboaja (1985:22) sees communication as involving all acts of transmitting message to channels which link people to the language and symbolic codes which are use to transmit messages, the means by which message are stored, and the rules, customs and convention which define and regulate human relationship and events, in its broad sense, communication has long been credited as a prime factor in the attainment of high level of organizational goals. Communication is essential for the internal functioning of enterprises because it helps to integrate management functions.\n\nCommunication is that which is needed to establish and attain the goals of an enterprise. The articles needed are that is providing organization with communication system. From the foregoing, there is the need to look critically into the communication system of Nigeria Coca-Cola Company, Onitsha as the study desks among others to examine and identify possible effect that communication has on the administration of the Nigeria Coca-Cola Company, Anambra State.\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM\n\nUnder this study, it is assumed that extent to which an organization attains it goals will among other factors depend on their ability to communicate effectively.\n\nIn most large organizations, like the Nigeria Coca-cola Company, Onitsha, Anambra, there is the problem of effective decision making because of poor information flow, land ineffectively communication for decision making are being deprived of it.\n\nHowever, in Nigeria Coca-cola Company, Onitsha, Anambra State, there is personal administration office, which deals with all information concerning the employed the organization. The need for communication between the submit of component units therefore becomes important of quick and timely decisions are to be made. It is a primary junction of personnel and administration to bridge the various levels of decision-making together by providing each with relevant office information in order to achieve the goals of the organisation.\n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe objective or purpose of the study therefore is to find out the impact of communication on the efficiency of Nigeria Coca-cola Company, Onitsha, Anambra State, because of the advantages of communication in attainment of organizational goals, there is need that the process and means of communication be improved for the attainment of the goals. Therefore, this present study aims to specifically achieve the following objectives.\n\n1.   To examine the impact of communication on the achievement of organizational goals.\n\n2.   To critically investigate the existing media of communication in Nigeria Coca-Cola Company, Onitsha, Anambra.\n\n3.   To highlight the possible obstacles, which hinder communication in an organization.\n\n4.   To find out the employee’s perception on communication,\n\n1.4   RESEARCH QUESTION\n\n1.   Of what importance is communication in promoting effective organisational goals?\n\n2.   What are the existing media in Nigeria Coca-cola Company, Onitsha, Anambra State?\n\n3.   Effective communication contributes to the organisational existence?\n\n1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study will be of benefit to current and potential business managers and management of the business organization in Nigeria.\n\nSignificantly, this study will contribute to the existing literature in the areas of communication in organisation. This will serve as a ready reference tool for those who would be interested in similar research.\n\nIt will also help captions of industries and directors of organizations take effective decisions on issues affecting organizational communication in all human endeavours.\n\n1.6   SCOPE OF STUDY\n\nThis research work will be restricted to communication systems in alt the departments of Nigeria Cocacola Company, Onitsha.

In doing this study, the researcher encountered some basic problems, which invariably limited the research.\n\nFirst was the problem of time. The researcher was limited to time, as the researcher has to continue the study with his’ normal lectures. This was quite tasking.\n\nSecondly, was the problem of literature (data) with which this study was carried out. The Ozoro Polytechnic central library lacks current information in the areas of communication science. The researcher has to onerously search for relevant study. This was very difficult.\n\nThirdly, was the problem of finance, presently, Nigeria is undergoing inflationary period due to cost of stationery materials which is quite prohibitive hence unattainable by student. This high cost of stationeries, elastically affected the eventual typing and binding of this project work.\n\nIrrespective of theses apparent limitations, the researcher painstakingly struggled to overcome them. Therefore and dependable, hence its value should not be underscored, by its present and potential users.\n\n1.8   OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nIn carrying out this research, the researcher has made use of some technical terms, for clear understanding and use of these terms; the following functional definitions have been given.\n\nCommunication: Is the transmission of information from one person to another using symbols or codes.\n\nGoals: Are Ends pursued by an organisation\n\nOrganisation: The process or structure of a definite operation\n\nManagement: getting things done through other people.\n\nEffectiveness: This is the attainment of a stated objective.",

        "content": "THE ELECTRONIC MEDIA AS A CHANCE FOR CREATING AWARENESS AND MOBILIZING PUBLIC SUPPORT IN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n                             INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nGenerally, all mass media organs in all established societies are expected to fulfill certain responsibilities and these obviously would include creating awareness and mobilizing public support towards governmental or public oriented programme. Radio, as a mass media organ is equall expected to fulfill these functions as well for any government to pass information to her citizenry, it must do that either through print or Broadcast media. Both the federal and state government have programmes that obviously requite public support that would make it possible for them to realize their expectations. Programme like, police Diary, breaking the silence, consumer speak, Health watch, HIV/ADIS enlighten among others require the support of members of the public for its success.\n\n        One is not left in doubt as to the importance of radio if these expectation of those in government are going to be realized. Ray power – 105.3 fm located at Agu-Abor in Enugu state has a number of programmes and jingles that are specifically aimed at creating awareness and them mobilizing public support towards these programmes of both the federal and state government.\n\n        In Nigeria today, there are so many radio stations both government and private stations that are responsible for awareness creation and mobilizing public support for national development. Awareness according to oxford advanced learner’s Dictionary means knowing that something exists and is important being interestd in something. It is this awareness and public support that this project will center on in our subsequent chapters.\n\n1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS.\n\nElectronic media is one of the channels that is used to disseminate information to the masses about government programmes and activities. Without it, there will be no democracy and people will be kept in the dark of what is happening in the government. It is because of these functions that the federal republic of Nigeria could grant licence to individuals to operate private radio stations so that the population will be aware of what is happening around them. The freedom of information bill which is before the national assemble for its passage is making leadway because of the support it is gaining from the public for its passage. In anyway one may look at it, it is important and obvious that electronic media especially radio plays a very important roe for the development of our society. Electronic media can mar or build any nation depending on the type of ownership and who is in charge. But this project will concentrate mainly on the positive aspect of the electronic media in building the nation and uniting the people.\n\n1.3    OBJECTIVE OF STUDY\n\nThe following shall constitute the objective of this study.\n\n1.     To ascertain the impact of electronic media as channel for creating awareness and mobilizing public support.\n\n2.     To find out if Ray power fm Agu-Abor is living up to her expectations of informing, entertaining and educating the masses of government programmes and activities.\n\n3.     Again to find out if government influences the programmes of private owned radio stations.\n\n4.     Finally, this project is aimed at finding out the role of electronic media in democratic dispensation.\n\n1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY.\n\nThis study is important in the sense that it would enable readers to know the power of radio station in helping the authorities in the fulfillment of their expectations. It is only when government programmes and projects are given that support by the public that it will then be able to achieve the desired objectives. The study also will be of immense benefit to the management and staff of Ray power radio station because this will help them to channel their programme to those activities that up lift the national development and create awareness of government programmes and activities.\n\n        Finally, those in academic field and specially students who are carrying out research in the similar topic will find out this project very useful.\n\n1.5    RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\nFor the purpose of this research work, the following shall form the research questions of this project:\n\n(a)    Has Ray power fm through its programmes been able to create awareness among the people on issues that affect the people either as individual or group?\n\n(b)    Do you think that electronic media is one of the channels through which economic development could be achieved?\n\n(c)    Do you think that Ray power fm is objective in the reportage of government programmes and activities?\n\n1.6    RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS\n\nFor the effective study of this research work two hypotheses will be formulated.\n\nHO:   Electronic media is not a channel for creating awareness and mobilizing public support.\n\nHi:    Electronic media is a channel for creating awareness and mobilizing public support.\n\nHo:   Ray power fm is not objective in reporting of government programmes and activities.\n\nHi:    Ray power fm is objective in reporting of government programmes and activities.\n\n1.7    DEFNITION OF TERMS\n\nThe following terms would be defined for easy understanding of the project work.  \n\n(a)    CHANNEL:  A means of access, a course in which something may be directed, a route through which anything passes or progresses, a means of communication and also a band of broadcasting frequencies.\n\n(b)    BROADCASTING: This can be defined as the dissemination of information, ideas, attitudes and opinions through the use of awareness.\n\n(c)    RADIO BROADCASTING:       This is the dissemination of audio-visual signals through the air waves.\n\n(d)    MASS MEDIA:     The means of communication through Radio, Television, Newspapers, magazines that reach large number of people.\n\n(e)    MMOBILIZE:       This means to assemble, organize, or to put into motion.

Over the years, development in the country, even in states was virtually urban centers. Houses, god roads, potable water, electricity and other social amenities were regarded as the exclusive preserve of town dwellers which ruralities made  to do with w\\only what benevolent nature could provide them.\n\nAs a result a strong bridge appears between the nations urban centers and rural communities and rural inhabitant crossed the bridge in their thousand to have a taste of the urban amenities. This influx quickly created its own problems for both government and the people as it led to food storage, scarcity houses, the growth of urban slums, unemployment, and increased crime wave- for this improvement or development to take place, the people concerned must realize implement and positively forty the discharge or impartation of  better affairs of the community. it is the crating of this awareness as well as the need to better the television broadcasting are expected to perform.\n\nThe effect of radio broadcasting is not automatic. Frankly speaking radio broadcasting ahs a positive effect on people, especially the ruralities, we learn a lot from radio messages, discussion, quizzes, talks, documentaries, lectures, drama both comic and tragic, interviews etc\n\nBesides, communities gain information on the existence locally produced products or imported ones mainly through the radio as well as government polices and programmes. Radio can be used for information dissemination on political and economic development.\n\nIt would therefore be good to find out how effective the Enugu state broadcasting services (ESBS) radio FM and television are in dealing with these functions in promoting rural development efforts of the state government\n\nIt is an open secret that there has been communication imbalance between the urban dwellers and people in the rural areas are this negative trends militated against imbalance in the development of the state.\n\nIn  its own part, the Enugu state broadcasting services (ESBS) radio is committed to reach people in the rural areas through its programes along the lines of the need and this is why I have decided to write on this topic.\n\nIf we assume that Enugu state broadcasting service (ESBS) radio enjoys ten percent conscious listenership of the populace in urban areas, what about the ruralities and the effect it has on them. this is why  the study of the role of electronic media in the development of rural areas, using the that Enugu state broadcasting service (ESBS) radio FM as a case study is a welcome project. Besides many people living in rural areas have no other  way of hearing about ambitious  government programmes except through the broadcast  medium particualry the radio which they depend on for their information. The mobilization of the masses for government programmes, is such in crucial factor.\n\nRural programmes like Dirri, rural health ORI EPI had al used the electronic media extensively to reach out and educate both urban and rural dwellers who are hundreds kilometers away from the point of action of discussion. The role of radio in Enugu state in brining about rural development  and transformation cannot be easily quantified. This is why in many advanced  countries, government, private organizations and individuals compete in the provision of electronics media organs. In this part of government because  they are the quickest means by which government speak to the people as well as feel the pulse of the public.\n\nDue to the importance of radio that the research wants to know whether the  that Enugu state broadcasting service (ESBS) radio is doing what it is expected to doing respect of rural development.\n\n1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe effectiveness of modem communication network in the areas has always been advocated for many journalists in Nigeria and radio broadcasting in one of  thee communication systems.",

For this study, five rural towns  in Njikoka Local government Area were studied.\n\nThe  important of television as the most mobilization  media of mass communication is universally acknowledge, the  use of television is limited  because of some factors  that militate against its full  utilization, such as high cost of  television, maintenance cost and power supply. Most rural communities   are not connected to the electricity. Non availability of television has made some rural communities  to  resort to the old traditional methods of transmitting  information which is counter productive and mockery of  democracy, especially now that we  are at the stage of entering into the new century.\n\nTelevision has the advantage of audio and visual facilities,  hearing and seeing makes for a lasting impression. Political  and   governments could exploit television to get across their political activities  and agenda to the people politician  could  use it to market their political, ideologies, programmes   and by so doing, win followers and supports through creating awareness and political enlightenment in Nigeria.\n\nThis project is a survey research and primary source of data collection for the study in the questionnaire  which is formed  from three main research question. The researcher made use of oral interview also to get across to the illiterate dwellers also to get balanced  data and ensure credibility’s,  reliability of information supplied.\n\nData collected were analysed and interpreted. The finding reveal that the impact of television in not yet  fully and enjoyed by many in  Njikoka zone because of the high cost of television and lack of electricity supply for those who own TC sets. In this democratic era,  rural, dwellers needs political, education, awareness and enlightenment. The government should therefore do something to improve the economy of the nation to enable may to be  position to own T.V sets. They should also embark on rural electrification and political education. Ministry of information and that of public utilities  should consider the possibility of providing and developing rural television viewing centres for the general public.\n\nAdult services should be encouraged and established  in rural  communities to eradicate illiteracy.\n\nTelevision authorities  should run more programmes to carry rural dwellers along.  The researcher hoped  that the suggestions would enhance political mobilization and public enlightenment.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBackground of  the Study\n\nUses of Television\n\nAssessment of various media\n\nStatement of the research problems\n\nPurpose of the Study\n\nSignificance of the Study\n\nResearch Questions\n\nResearch Hypotheses\n\nDefinitions of Term\n\nConceptual Definitions\n\nOperational Definitions\n\nLimitation of The Study\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nSource of Literature review\n\nThe Review\n\nSummary Review\n\nCHAPTER THREE:  RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nResearch Method\n\nResearch Design\n\nResearch Sample\n\nMeasuring Instrument\n\nData Collection\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nData Analysis\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\nSUMMARY\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nQUESTIONNAIRES\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n  INTRODUCTION\n\n BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study will delve  into an in-depth appraisal  of role of television in the political mobilization of rural area in Nigeria. However, the Nigeria Electorate in recent years has  always been in intensely individualistic  group. Hence political  parties  will always confront profound culture  differences. Given  the cultural structure of the Nigerian electorate, the important of television programmes cannot be overemphasized. The role of television in political mobilization in the annulled 1993 presidential is one of   the  greatest challenges facing the electorate especially  those  in the rural areas. This also is  a typical case of   election  malpractices that have been  the lot of Nigeria elections.\n\nTelevision  on it’s own part is an electronic gadgets wit the combination of sound and pictures. It  is mot effective spontaneous  message carrier of our time. Its  conciseness  brings to the masses especially  the rural dwellers in on the spot account of the event  making it number one when  compared to any other medium. Admittedly television  may  be expensive  as to have it in every home or to be affordable  to most people in the rural  areas but when its ability to satisfy curiosity by allowing you see for yourself  is not just  an overstatement.  Again its ability  to disseminate  information in our various dialects also serves as atomic  to  language barrier. Television as an integral  part of the  fourth estate of the realm, is expected as usual to play its traditional role as a watchdog  of the society and as agent of change and innovations. In rural areas advertisement role  on political  trend aspirant responsiveness to the medium has become a  major feature of campaigns for public office at national state and local  government level. Most rural dwellers are known to be financially poor because of their low education status and cannot afford television sets. This  has often been a problem to efficient and effective use of television in achieving  political  mobilization in the rural area. All things being equal, the term, television and political mobilization refers to all kinds of political  services rendered to the  populace  to bring about information, Education, entertainment and influence in the rural dwellers. Apart from the general  rile, it enhance and encourage through its  various programmes the acquisition  and pursuit of knowledge thereby  promoting national consciousness  and acts as a powerful means of social mobilization.\n\nUSES OF TELEVISION: Television has many uses other than broadcasting programmes at the home. For example, school, businesses, hospitals and many other Organizations use closed   circuit   In closed circuit Television, signal are set by way of wire to only certain television sets rather to all sets within the area that broadcast signals could reach. Since the late 1970s, such equipments  as video cassette record, video dis players and personal computers have changed the way people  use television in their homes. For example, television sets may be used for such purposes as playing electronic games and receiving televised information services, documentaries, discussion  or talk shows and all kinds of sports events.  Considering the fact that television  is not only the means of communication let us have an  overview of the  various media of communication.\n\nASSESSMENT OF THE VARIOUS MEDIA :-Radio, Television magazine, pamphlets, posters, brochures and audio – visual aids  are important media for conveying information simultaneously  to a large population. They easily open the eyes  of  the people to the fact  of mobilization. Radio especially, can reach people and be effectively used in many countries as instrument mobilizing   Television with its sight  and sound characteristics  can create insight which radio cannot. But   Television has its  limitations, its use is hampered by its very cast, only very few rural  folks can afford the luxury of buying sets.\n\nAccording to Rogers and Shoemaker, less reliance  on mass media channels in less developed nations may be attributed to\n\nLow literacy\n\nLack of relevance of messages in the mass media channels  that do exist (Op.cit, p.258) An overview of this assessment reveals to us that upon the benefits according  to each of these  media, there are still  loopholes which stop them from doing perfectly the work for they are meant for  considering these loopholes, one  may be tempted to ask what is the future  of television.\n\nTHE FUTURE OF TELEVISION:- The future  of the  television will be one  of the constant and somewhat  unpredictable change. The zapper, the hand-held remote  control or changing the channel for muting the sound or  changing  the channel without leaving the chair  or couch will continue to trouble advertisers  and they will actively explore alternative   media. Another  aspect of television feature is that  it  is too difficult  to predict its technology.\n\nLooming on the horizon are a number of technology systems that will vastly extend the number of choices  viewers will be able  to make their homes. These includes a number of new ways of deliver. The signal  via optic   cables and telephone lines. Other innovations will enlarge and clarify the picture that viewers see.",

It other a means for bridging  the  gaps between development professionals and rural people through initiating interaction and  dialogue new alliances, inter-personal relationship networks and cross- sectional talk  between organization. It car create mechanisms and sharing of knowledge.\n\n            Rural communities represents the “last rural of connectivity” challenge in both developing countries and developed countries with regard to access to infant service and the telecommunication connections that help transient those service.\n\n            Infant was properly designed to help communication education    and industrial innovation of the past country.\n\nInnovation of the past country:\n\nIt can be found in a basket ball  sized 184  found attempts to calm the public outcry  after  the lunch  of the Russian satellite in full of 1957 president Eisenhower created a government agency to centralism federal    research  and development.  This new department would be called the advanced research projects agency or ARPA.  The  development of network technologies them followed a convoluted path as the focus  of ARPA was  redefined by a series of directors finally in 1965 Robert Taylor, the head of ARPA’s  information processing techniques office became frustrated by the  lack of  uniform operating would and the inability of several computer terminus  to  communicate.\n\n            When Taylor was back in the office   mean while scientist such as Paul Barari Leonard Klein rock and Donald watts Davies had began developing theories   about networking.  After working individual all three scientist reached   the same consensus information must travel a network in the form of “packet” bits of information containing data from a larger fill and labeled with their origin destination and location in the file.  During a conference at Ann Arbor this information became available to the scientist money ARPA.  By utilizing this technique of packet switching and a system of interface massage processors” which standardized the signals from the computers to the network)\n\nARPA created the first network of computer using   existing phone lines- it is called ARPA net from the strain of one increasingly popular application E-mail.  The solution in the form of TCP/P, which was designed by Bob Kahn and visit self in 1970 with the introduction of TCP/IP, the “global network” that formed the internet became a reality.\n\nThe internet communication is created to serve the people in order;\n\n1.      to enhance their chance of speed communication and fast development in the global world.\n\n2.      it also allowed the new world technologies wide web to go beyond test or even images.\n\n3.      it has become a vast library of media easily accessed by the average citizen.\n\n4.      it for whatever reason people  must connect and share information that is why it is stated by Taylor that computer as an extension  of the user and network as an extension of the computer that is why it ecome a way for that interaction to occur.\n\nFor more clew visit: < http: www.

But in Africa Nigeria is rated for the third country that has launch internet in 27th September 203. The remote sensing internet which was launched in Nigeria is not for communication but it made for search and focus finding and retune to day in Nigeria we have achieved enough benefit and development through the internet communication.\n\n1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nInternet connectivity in Nigeria is so poor when compare with that of developed countries because the government of Nigeria Luke warn attitude in pursuing its advancement.\n\n            The ministry of communication and that of science and technology are handicap in the sense that they are only after political gains and issues\n\nThe needed skills for proper computer connectivity are a vacuum which there is no guest presently in place to bridge.\n\n1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe purpose of the study is to find out and x-ray the importance of internet communication.\n\nThe research further wants to know how much the internet has encouraged the people through its service and development and to x-ray the benefits in which communication through internet has done to the rural communities\n\nI will subsequently outline the achievement of internet to communication and rural development and finally to show the grown of internet communication in Nigeria.\n\n1.4       SCOPE OF STUDY\n\nThe scope of this study is to create awareness and at the same time acknowledge the assessment of communication development through internet connectivity in Nigeria.\n\n            Further more the reason embarked on this topic is to find out how to Sentizer both the government and the people on the need to furtherance computer   connectivity.\n\n1.5       RESEARCH QUESTION\n\n1                    What roles does internet communication play in Nigeria?\n\n2                    What impact does internet communication gives to socio-economic development of Enugu state.",

The use of the Internet in the educational environment has enabled easy access to many resources, and information sharing has, therefore, significantly increased. Moreover, the prevalence of this sharing has brought additional benefits in that these resources can be used in any location and any time. Although the efficiency of this technology, it is evaluated with use of proportion of the desired results in students achievement.\n\n        According to Benson (2002), the internet is a loose of inter-connecting commercial and non-commercial computer networks. The constituent networks are tied together by telecommunications lines and by their shared reliance on standard communications controls. The internet with a capital “I” refers to a world-wide system of linked computer system. When used with a small “I” it is mean a group of inter-connected local networks. The net is the global association of thousands of networks and millions of computers across the world that carries data and makes the exchange of information possible. This network of computers is also referred to as global information system or information super high way. The internet is also known by some people as the web, this is the largest computer networks with thousands f network using a communication protocol known as TCP/IP which means Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.\n\n        The internet sometimes called simple “This Net” is a worldwide system of computer networks (connections)actually, it is a networks of networks in which users or anyone who uses one computer can if they have permission to get information from any other computers (and sometimes talk directly to users at other computers) on-line chat.\n\n        Before going into the project, there is need to shed light into information and computer because as earlier stated that the internet is a global association of thousands of networks and millions of computers across the world that carries data and makes the exchange of information possible. Like we know that computer is a mediator between the users because is through the computer that the user browses through the different website in the internet to get proper information.\n\n        The world book dictionary volume one A.K. also defined internet as a global computer network which links smaller networks including the universities, government resources and also individuals.\n\n        According to Cambridge International Dictionary of English, internet is defined as the large system of many connected as the large system of many connected computers around the world, which people use to communicate with each other.\n\n        The internet is devoted solely for the purpose of connecting people from different areas in the world and also providing or making available information in a particular subject interest of the user. It also enhances users communicating via-e-mail with peers in other cities, or other culture or through contact with expert in the field of interest.\n\n        According to Madu (2004), the internet is a public cooperative and self sustaining facility accessible to hundreds of millions of people world-wide.\n\n        Physically, the internet utilizes a portion of the total resources of the currently existing public telecommunication network. Technically, what distinguishes the internet is its utility of set of protocol called TCP/IP.\n\n        Many internet users, electronic mail is most widely used application the net. One can also carry on-line conversations with other computer users, using internet chart and more recently internet telephone hardware and software now allow read time voice conversation.\n\n1.2       Statement of the problems\n\n     The advent of the internet has revolutionized the life of the global community in all ways. Apart  from transacting businesses of different kinds through the internet, its  usefulness seems  to  manifest  greatly  in  the  academic  circles  too,   where  students  and  lecturers  use  the internet also  for  research and  relaxation.   Even though  most under graduate students  can  pride themselves  as  being  computer  literate,  the  fact  remains  that  some  are  yet  to   know  how  the internet  works.  Irrespective  of  their  status  the  need  for  them  to   exploit  the  internet  for  one purpose or the  other  cannot  be underemphasized. Though, it has some drawback as privacy problem, difficulty to search and to find relevant information. Yet, it is more informative, relatively fast and accessible 24 hours a day. Internet has a wide base that allows access to an enormous range of research information either as full publications, or reports, etc.\n\nFor the developing countries like Nigeria to grow and attain its economic and social status, such country must be fully ready in strengthen and empowering its academic institutions, both in science and technological capacity. Hence, the students in their respective field will need an easy, reliable and interactive means of accessing and retrieving information without wasting much time. While the use of this Internet is greatly depends on some associated factors such as purposes, students experience, locations, Internet facilities and services available, among others on academic pursue of the students in their institutions. It is Against this backdrop, the researchers wish to   establish  the  specific  purposes  students  of tertiary institution use  the  internet,  the  extent  to   which  they  use  the internet and how they overcome  the challenges or inhibitions they face in using the  internet.\n\n1.3    Objectives of the Study\n\n        The study is aimed at surveying the importance of internet by student of tertiary institution in research project writing.\n\nOther specific objectives are as follows:\n\n1.   To find out if students use the internet for their research project writing\n\n2.   To identify the reasons why students use the internet and how often they use the internet for academic studies.\n\n3.   To ascertain the contributions of the internet services to the academic achievement of the student.\n\n4.   To identify the factors affecting effective use of the internet by students during their research project writing.\n\n5.   To proffer solutions to factors affecting effective use of internet by students of tertiary institution during their research project writing.\n\n1.4    Significance of the Study\n\n        Considering the fact that internet is used in all facets of the economy and in all fields of endeavor, this study will be of great significance to the entire society particularly in academic institutions in Nigeria especially tertiary institution. This study will be of immense value to researchers conducting their studies in related subject as it will remain a useful and reference document. The study will also help in developing the knowledge of the researcher in the internet facilities in academic libraries in Nigeria.\n\n1.5    Research Questions\n\nThe following questions were formulated in line with the objectives of the study. They are as follows:\n\n1.   Is internet importance to student of tertiary institution in research project writing?\n\n2.   Do students use  the internet in your research project writing?\n\n3.   Why do students use the internet and how often do you use the internet for academic purposes?\n\n4.   How has the internet service contributed to your academics success?\n\n5.   What are the factors affecting effective use of the internet during research project writing?\n\n6.   What are the solutions to the problems militating against effective use of internet by student of tertiary institution?\n\n1.5    Research Hypotheses\n\nThe following hypotheses were formulated in line with the research questions of the study. They are as follows:\n\nHo= null hypothesis\n\nHi= alternative hypothesis\n\nHypothesis One\n\nHo:   internet is not importance to student of tertiary institution in      research    project writing.\n\nHi:    internet is importance to student of tertiary institution in research project    writing.\n\nHypothesis two\n\nHo:   That student of tertiary institution does not make use of the      internet in their research project writing\n\nHi:    Student of tertiary institution makes use of the       ",

        "content": "THE IMPACT OF RADIO CARITAS PHONE-IN PORGRAMMES OF SOUL MENDER AMONG YOUTHS IN ENUGU\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1                                      Background of the Study\n\nCommunication is said to be the life blood of every society. There is therefore a need to know what communication is all about.  Communication as an academic discipline, sometimes called “communicology” relates to all the ways we communicate, so it embraces a large body of study and knowledge. Although, there is such a thing as one-way communication, communication can be better described as a two way process in which there is an exchange of ideas, thoughts, feelings towards a mutually accepted goal or direction.\n\nHence, the process of a phone-in-programme. Mass media are important communication strategy to generate awareness and disseminate information. In most developing countries, Nigeria inclusive, radio is an effective medium to reach the general population. Unlike TV and print, radio phone-in-programmes are popular platforms for direct audience participation to exchange views and voice concerns on issues to increase knowledge, encourage open discussion on health and other socially relevant issues and promote sustained behavioural change.  In broadcasting, a phone-in is a programme format in which listeners are invited to air their live comments by telephone, usually in respect of a specific topic selected for discussion on the day of broadcast.\n\nAccording to research, BBC radio Nottingham is credited with having aired the first phone-in programme on February 4 1968, a programme called “What Are They Up To Now”?  Speech-based Talk Radio UK was launched in 1995, with much of its programming featuring phone-in-programmes. Ian Hutchby researched poor relations in phone-in-programmes looking at arguments and confrontations. Using conversation analysis, he describes how the host retains power through devices such as “the second position” - the concept of going second in a discussion, giving the host time to formulate a response.\n\nSimilarly, the last word is always the broadcasting word. The audience can choose to end the conversation, but they are doing so by withdrawing from the interactional arena. Hutchby (1996:34) Talbot et al.\n\nThough it cannot be stated in actual fact the date phone-in-programme began in Nigeria. According to research, it started before the advent of global system for mobile telecommunications (GSM) putting it in the 1980s. However, since the introduction of GSM in 2000 there has been an increase in audience participation in phone-in-programmes.\n\n1.2   Statement of the Research Problem\n\nThis research work is informed by this innovation in broadcasting especially the introduction of phone-in segment in almost every programme being aired on both public and private radio stations across the country. One of the problems is the implication of having a wrong audience choice which is better imagined. This would make the presenter have negative feedback. This is because there are some audience members who participate in discussions that are not meant for them.\n\nThere is no gainsaying the fact that radio stations are out to perform the basic role of informing, educating and entertaining the target audience. However, another problem is the lure of including phone-in segments in most of the programmes which are capable of rendering them elitist, taking into consideration the number of people that can afford to buy a mobile phone.  Yet another problem is the fact that phone-in programmes are equally seen as an escapist approach of getting people to participate in programmes when they are not adequately informed about the issues involved.\n\n1.3      Objectives of the Study\n\nIt is noticed that the idea of phone-in is now prevalent among radio stations. This study is on radio broadcasting. This decision is made from the fact that the medium appears the cheapest and most accessible to the common man as the radio set is portable and can easily pick up signals from far distances. One of the key objectives is to find how competitive this feasibility of radio programmes appeared to dominate our broadcast.  It is aimed at finding how the industry radio has increased the pace of audience participation in radio programme.\n\nAnother objectives is to find how critical the “soul mender as a phone-in programme has introduced the public and its meaningful contributions to issues under discussion.\n\nThe aim of this research work is to find out if the programme justifies its existence and how it could carried out towards formulating a guiding principle that could help regulate audience participation on radio.\n\n1.4       Significance of the Study\n\nA phone-in programme could be an instantaneous way of having feedback on any given idea, policy or measure about to be introduced either by a corporate organization, an individual or government of the day. It is obviously the best form of testing the acceptability of new ideas, opinions and policies.  This study is therefore significant because it is capable of enabling the sampling of opinion without necessarily undergoing the tedious voting process. This would make the listeners part and parcel (active) of decision making or policy formulation.  The participatory nature of phone-in programme is expected to give an individual radio listener a sense of belonging and not make him an inactive receiver of information and ideas passed across by the radio. It is therefore the opinion of this researcher that the appraisal of this phone-in programme will go a long way to enhancing quality production and presentation, by news makers as well as making it truly for audience participatory process.\n\n1.5   Research Questions\n\n1.      To what extent has the phone-in programme “Soul Mender” on Radio Caritas as provided the expected feedback required of the target audience?\n\n2.      To what extent has a phone-in programme become important in the programmes planning of Radio Caritas?\n\n3.      How truely interactive is “Soul Mender” on Radio Caritas?\n\n4.      Do soul-mender programmes serves as a guiding principle for policy formulation?\n\n1.6       Research  Hypotheses\n\nHypothesis 1\n\nHi:       The phone-in programme “Soul Mender” on Radio Caritas to an extent provides the expected feedback required of the target audience.\n\nNull H0: The phone-in programme “Soul Mender” on Radio Caritas to an\n\nextent does not provide the expected feedback required of the target audience.\n\nHypothesis 2\n\nHi: A phone-in programme is important in the programme planning on\n\nCaritas Radio.\n\nNull H0: A phone-in programme is not important in the programme planning\n\non Caritas Radio.\n\nHypothesis 3\n\nHi: “Soul Mender” on Caritas Radio is truely interactive and serve as a\n\nguiding principle for policy formulation.\n\n Ho: “Soul Mender” on Radio Caritas is not truely interactive and could not\n\nserve as a guiding principle for policy formulation.\n\n1.7       Theoretical Framework\n\nThe theory being critically examined for this research work is the uses and gratification theory.  The notion of uses and gratification has attracted the interest of many scholars in field of communication.  This theory centers on what uses we make of the media and what gratification we gain from exposing ourselves to the media.\n\n            This concept is described as one of the most influential framework for media analysis in recent years.  It centers on a generalization that we should investigative how people uses the mass media, rather than wrong about how the mass media uses its audience.\n\n            Contemporary research indicates that people seek various forms of media content for many reasons.  The psychological reward which people receive from rending, learning and viewing specific content determine the use to which they put the media. So, the idea that media use depends on the perceived satisfactions, needs, wishes or motives or the perspective audience member is almost as an old as media research itself.  Audiences are often formed on the basic of similarities of these appear to have a social or psychological origin.  Typical or such media are those for information, relaxation, companionship, diversion or escape.  The concept of uses and gratification theory is explained further by Danis (1987:73) as \n\n            The concept of uses and gratification theory is explained further by Denis (1987) as:\n\nThe term “uses” implies that audience are active rather\n\nthan passive members of the communication process,\n\nand that they are willingly exposed to the media. The\n\nterm ”gratification” refers to the rewards and satisfactions\n\nexperienced by audiences and helps explain motivations\n\nbehind habits of media use.\n\n     The uses and gratifications theory is also called functional theory. A good illustration of this theory is the functional use of television entertainment by television audience members. Within the mass media audience, people’s needs are generated by their individual and group differences. Here in Nigeria, these needs arise from differences in sex, ethnicity, and education etc. The way Nigerians use the mass media depends on whether they are male or female, Igbo or Yoruba, educated or illiterate etc. because the needs within the people are determined by who or what they are, and people use the mass media for the purpose of gratifying these needs. Okunna, Stella (1998:21). These media use patterns that are not peculiar to Nigeria but are a feature of mass media audiences in different societies.\n\n            From this clarification, it is crystal clear that media audiences are often motivated to listen, view or participate in media programmes by certain factors arising from the benefits accruable from their efforts. The term “uses” has revealed that participants on phone-in programmes are active contributors and their views go a long way to redefining the course of such programmes.\n\n            At the same time, many are often thrilled by the glamour in the media in accepting to feature on their audience participation programmes, make request via mobile phone to their loved ones or even choose to attend musical concerts and live participatory programmes organized by such media outfit to get them exposed to the world. The Soul Mender programme of Radio Caritas Amorji Enugu is designed to enable audience participates by phoning to contribute to the issues discussed which affect them as individuals and the society at large. This provides gratification for the target audience.\n\n1.8       Scope of the Study\n\nPhone-in programme is now prevalent among radio stations as it serves as an instantaneous way or having feedback on any policy or topical issue from the audience. The researcher therefore assumes that the study will throw up the important of the chosen phone-in programme to the audience and media house, as this will shed more and better light on the act of audience participation in radio discussions though phone in  programmes.\n\n            The researcher also assumes that the study will create an understanding in the contributions of phone-in programme to the technicalities that make up the act of communication as a whole.\n\n1.10      Conceptual And Operational Definition Of Terms\n\nImpact: According to oxford advanced learners’ dictionary, it is to have an\n\nimmediate and strong effect on something or somebody.\n\nImpact: It is the influence a phone-in programme has on the listening\n\naudience as well as the impression they are left with about the programme even after it is brought to conclusion.\n\nPhone-In: According to Encarta dictionaries, it is a radio or television\n\nprogramme in which audience members can participate by telephone and ask questions, make contributions or take part in discussions about a particular subject with the host and any quests.\n\nPhone-In: It is a segment in a radio programming schedule in which\n\ntopical and important issues are tabled for discussion. This enables audience participation and allows the media body or outfit elicit feedback from its audience who are interested in the topic of discussion.\n\nProgramme: According to oxford advanced learners dictionary, it is a film,\n\nplay, activity etc that is broadcast on television for people to watch or on radio for them to listen to.\n\nProgramme: It is a schedule of activities to be carried out and aired in a\n\nmedia house, be it radio or television.",

        "content": "THE ROLE OF RADIO IN MOBILISING WOMEN FOR POLITICS IN NIGERIA. PERIOD OF STUDY: (1961 – 2004)\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n            This systems of communication that is Radio pays a major role in mobilisation of women for politics in Nigeria.  For majority of women groups in Nigeria, improving the lots of Nigeria women is a prime target for many of them also, the experience of the management of women is all facts if life is feasible to cultural practice of gender relations within the Nigeria Society.  Let for many of the enlighten women in Nigeria, these practice have become acceptability of life and are not to be questioned.\n\n            The radio, because it is cheap, have become  affordable easy access and have become a base means of mobilizing Nigeria women for politics.  One thing that is glaring today in some of the Radio Stations in Nigeria  is the presence of Nigeria women as news-makers.  The women groups in Nigeria this have the greatest task of carrying out enlightenment campaigns over the Radio to educated Nigeria Women on their right and what constitutes violation of such right, some of these women groups that carries out campaign for women empowerment and participation of women in politics are viz.\n\nWOMEN IN NIGERIA (WIN), NIGERIA\n\nWOMEN’S RIGHT WATCH, CIVIL RESOURCE AND DOCUMENTATION CENTRE (CIBDDOC).\n\nWOMEN’S CONSORTIUM OF NIGERIA.  (WOCON).  The list is not exhaustive.\n\n            The zonal workshops on women in Governance and Decision making network and working as a group was covered by the Imo State Radio and Radio Nigeria in Imo States.  The zonal network groups are following capacity building framing activities designed to provide and contribute  to the broader goal f empowering and advocating for the  full participation of women and potential women leaders in governance and decision making interactive from the South Eastern States OF Nigerian and in particular from Imo State.\n\n            In Imo State within the last six months two senatorial zone were selected for intral zone networking workshops. The zonal networking workshops take place over three days.  The first workshop was held in Orlu, East and Orlu west, while the other senatorial zone was Owerri Municipal local governments.\n\n            The primary aim of these zonal networking workshops is to encourage participate to collaborate and associate together in other to achieve common goals within their communities.  Zonal networking also serves as a platform in which women can demand accountability from their leaders on a venue for information sharing. At the zonal networking workshops that were held in Imo State, women were encourage  to take active apart in their unions to organize meeting with tier leaders to discuss the role of women in leadership positions, participants were also encouraged to organize awareness and skill programmes to enable them to contest and hold political offices.  In addition, participants were encouraged to build and maintain stratagem adhere with one another to enable them identify and find solution to common problems within their communities.\n\n            Another topic that were treated include:-\n\nThe on-going local government reforms process and implication for women.  Benefits of reworking as groups, current situation of women in governance And decision-making of each senatorial zones, women’s rights, constraints to women participation in politics, managing and balancing private and public life for women in politics and the act of public speaking.  The Nigeria women through encourage to overcome their mistrust of one another and other organization and work together toward their shared goals.    Women therefore need to understand networking and works as a group involves and how to maximize its benefits.   The zonal networking workshops were quite interactive and interest.  In Orlu Senatorial zone many women participated in the workshop and equally women from Owerri Senatorial Zones also was in attendant.\n\n            Meanwhile. many of Radio Stations scattered all over Nigeria are coming up to address the culture of silence that was characterized by absence of women in politics in Nigeria.  As addressed in the media (Radio) the liberation of women would imply the liberation of a host of other poor.  Women’s position is similar to that of the poor, the manual labourers, the marginalized, the minorities, both there and religious, the are noted youth, the lower cet.  Herein, then, lies the true significance of tracking women’s issue in communication.  The adopt and acceptance of women’s values in public communication will change our culture of silence. There reduces will not only liberate women but also a host of other marginalized and oppressed groups [our emphasis].\n\n            In the area of information pertaining women in politics, our local Radio Stations are also coming up with beneficial information’s in form of revamping sector into a dynamic tools for facilitating effective women and politics relations.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.1       NIGERIAN WOMEN’S MOBILIZATION IN THE PAST\n\n            throughout the twentieth century, Nigerian women have the social power under their control in their own interests, and in the interests of the community.  The Aba women’s wars of 1928 –1929, the Egba women’s movement of the early 1930s to the 1950s, the Oghanete  women’s uprising of 1984 the Ughelli women’s anti-tax protects of 1985 –1986 and the Ekpan women’s uprising f 1986 are some examples.  In 1928 –1930,  Aba women rose in mess protect against the oppressive rule of the Colonial government.  These Igbo women of eastern Nigeria feared that the head count being carried out by the British was a prelude to women being taxed.   The women were unhappy about the over taxation of their husbands and sons which they felt was pauperizing then and cause economic  hardships for the entire community.\n\n            They also represented the British imposition on the community of warrant chiefs, many of whom carried out what the women considered to be abusive and extortionist actions such as obtaining wives without paying the full bride wealth and seizure of property.  Previously, new village leaders or heads had been democratically chosen and removed by the people themselves.  Power and been diffuse, decisions were reached informed or through village assemble of all adults who chose to attend.  While they had less influence then many women did control local trade and specific crops. Women protected their interests through assemblies.   This had been changed by the colonial government which appointed its agents as warrant Chiefs to rule over the people. The abuses of the British appointed natives judged and tax enumerators impelled the women to stage a protect on 24 November 1929, Using a deeply rooted practice of censoring men through all night song and doner ridicule (sitting on a man) the woman rampages spread. Late December 1929 the women forced the Umuahia warrant chiefs to surrender their caps thus  launching their successful campaign to destroy the warrant chief system. In Aba, women song and demand against the Chief and then “proceeded to attack and loot the European trading stores and Bardays Bank and to break into the prison and release the prisoner.  Some 25,000 Igbo women faced colonial repression and over a two month period of insurrection, December 1929 to January 1930, at least 50 were killed.\n\n            Similarly, between the 1930s and 1950s, the women of Igbo in Western Nigeria pressed for and subsequently secured the abdication of the Aleke or King of Egbaland from his throne he was forced to abdicate on the grounds that he was collaborating with the exploitative colonial government.  The Egba women also claimed  that the King was hiding under the cover and protection of the colonial government perpetrate misrule, hardships and oppression on Egba people, and especially on the women.\n\n            These instances of women’s political intervention during the colonial apoch demonstrate the use of market power and the expression of indigenous feminism’s.  Rapid and massive mobilization was possible because of women’s strong societal organizations and effective communication networks based on concentration in the markets and disposal along the trade routes, Nigerian women’s actions have to do with market control and with duel focus on both the state and those among their own menfolk who were instruments of the state first, women engaged in the business of long and short distance marketing took the initiative in mounting mobilizations.  But peasant women and town women joined the market women to constitute a mess movement. The social power mashed by this analyses centered on the women’s ability to withhold food frame the cities. They paralysed the trading system within which they exercised considerable power. Not only was food denied the cities, but cash crops were denied the colonial authorities and their merchant allies in repeated confrontations over who should determine prices (in the Western Nigeria Cocoa holdup during the second world war for example).\n\n            Second, women mobilized not only against the British State directly but also against collaborating indigenous men whose power was underprimed by a male deal with men in the colonial regime.  In so doing, women stood against class formation which distorted popular control over indigenous political institutions.  The women manifested their distress at the deterioration of their own circumstances with the encroachment of capitalist relations.  As such their actions where feminist in as much as they were aimed specifically at defensibly the interests women.   However, the discourse which women used then and now to explain their motives and objective cannot be assumed to resembled feminist discourses from other societies or periods, and requires analysis in its own right.  In mobilizing against the colonizer-Chief alliance among men, women were acting simultaneously on behalf of women  and on behalf of both men and women in the peasant and trading classes.   We see here the coincidence and inflexibility of feminist and class politics in the history of Nigeria women’s uprisings.  To what extent have these qualities persisted in women’s uprising in the post colonial era ?\n\nSince independence in 1960 Nigeria has been characterized by political instability and series of coups which degenerated into the guided civil war.  The oil boom of the 1970s profoundly transformed Nigerian society from one based on agricultural exports to one based on exports of crude oil.     The State received dollars from oil sales and here relaxed the exhortation of alternative   revenue sources such as exports crops and  agricultural development.  A massive class of middle men flourished on the basis of State connections Nigerian women were mobilizing again against the State and indigenous men folk.",

        "content": "THE ROLE OF RADIO IN IMPROVING THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN ENUGU STATE\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1       BACHGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\n            Education is an important agent for development of an individual, community, the social and the nation a whole.  According to behaviorist, the child is born without a :self”, he is voiced as a clean state on which the care givers write what they wish.  Through education, individuals perceived and imbibe fundamental values and also develop new ones.  Education also as part of socialization help to develop an individual, which in turn leads to the improvement of the society.  Again, certain prescribed goals are realized in areas of economic growth, healthcare, political and social awareness, political stability, self reliance, national identity, cultural correlation amongst other things.\n\n            The need for all sundry to be enlightened and will educated cannot be over emphasized and this, brought about the Introduction of using the media to get people educated.  The electronic media, which serves as a means include the radio, the television, films and cinemas but the radio has continued to wax stronger as a medium of the people.  We regard it as a medium of the people.  We regard it as a medium of the people because radio has become a common sight in both urban and rural communities.  It appeals to both literate and illiterate audiences as its programmes can be broadcast in their local dialects.  According to Ansah (1991: 34) agrees that “of all the mass media generally available to Nigerians, the radio is the most widespread and accessible in other words, it breaks the barriers of distance as its reach is widely and highly penetrating.\n\n            Again, because of this qualities, the radio medium is seen as the effection means to get all sundry educated.  Therefore, the role of the radio in educating the masses are found in some of its educational programmes like ESBS/IMT Poly-Air Programme, Win a million, school debates and host of others  Education therefore is not only the development of individuals mental powers, knowledge and ability but also the systematic training and instruction given out especially to the young ones in colleges and Institutions through the media.  Again, the media serves the purpose of enlightening the public both formally and informally.\n\n            The introduction of ESBS/IMT Poly-Air, a radio programme could be linked with the introduction of educational broadcasting in Nigeria.  It started with the commissioning of wired broadcasting services in Lagos, during the colonial administration.  This services involves the system of using the radio stations to relay programmes to subscribers, using eables connected to load speakers installed in their homes.  In the same vain, the media gets to the audience, relaying different programmes.\n\n            Further, Enugu being the regional capital of the former Eastern Nigeria, the heart-beat of Igbo-land and presently, a state capital which occupies a strategic position in the political and social organization of Nigeria requires its citizens to be well enlightened, self reliant, independent and academically stable.  Based on this, the need to use the media as an agent or instrument of formal learning become necessary.\n\n            Over the years, a lot of researches had been carried out on the issue of ESBS Poly-Air programme in improving the educational standard in Enugu.  Also to find out the relationship between the Poly-air programmes, the Institution offering it (IMT) and also the radio medium that airs it.\n\n            Today, it is well accepted that the radio medium educational programmes produces good effects on the audience in the areas of comprehension, speaking abilities, perception, retention capabilities.  There are also some problems, for instance some lecturers do not go in line with the media style of presentation.  Secondly, there is one side communication and there is no feedback from the audience.  Again there may also be distractions at home and short of power supply from NEPA.  Not withstanding these problems, ESBS/IMT Poly-air has its objectives as:\n\n1.            To help non-regular students and works improve their academic pursuit through radio medium.\n\n2.            Since the radio has the ability to permeable the interiors of the state, the ruralites also listens to the lecturers.\n\n3.            To contribute to the uplifting system of education in Enugu state by importing knowledge to all that are interested. \n\n1.2       RESEARCH PROBLEM\n\n            The study among other things finds out the effectiveness of Poly-air programmes on the students.  Also, it tries to find out if the timing of the programme is suitable for students and hold their interest.\n\n            The study also finds out the importance and the acceptability of the programme by the public and finally, if this radio programme is favouring education the masses as compared to the regular students programmes.\n\n1.3       OBJECTIVES OF STUDY\n\n            The importance of education can never be over-emphasized.  It is the taproot of civilization and rural development.\n\n            Development is achieved, when there is an appreciable level in basic human needs, including high literacy level.\n\n            Bearing all these in mind, the objective of the study includes:-\n\n1.            To find out if the public truly appreciate the radio programme on its efforts of educating the masses.\n\n2.            To create awareness on the needs for those that are not opportune to attend regular programme in tertiary Institution, to enroll in the programme.\n\n3.            To ascertain the extent to which the programme has improved human life especially amongst the youths in the areas of comprehension and speaking abilities, behaviour and character.\n\n4.            To encourage and boost the morale of the public about the programme.\n\n1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY\n\n            This study is guide necessary bearing in mind that the world is ever changing and developing.  In western world, the use of computers to educate the population and give them wider knowledge of the world is very much accessible.  This makes them to be scientifically, technologically, educationally and socially developed.  Nigeria as we know, cannot be compared to the western world and this bring about the need for the public to be educated; those who were not opportuned, to enroll into various Institutions of learning, comes to Poly-Air programmes and benefit from its academic efforts.\n\n            It is imperative to assess and find out the role of Poly-Air programme in educating the masses and at the same time examines the problem encountered in pushing the programme forward.\n\n            Finally, the result of the study will help to find other ways of improving the programme and educating the masses.\n\n1.5       RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1.            Does the ESBS/IMT Poly-Air stimulates the interest of the public?\n\n2.            Does ESBS time this educational programmes to suit its masses of Enugu metropolis and environs?\n\n3.            Is there any appreciable level on the educational system of Enugu state since the introduction of the programme?\n\n4.            Does the programme help to develop individual’s intellect on the perception of issue and events in the society.\n\n1.6       STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS\n\nHI:       Radio educational programmes are more effection in\n\neducating the populace, than academic activities in\n\nschools.\n\nHo:      Radio educational programme are not effective in\n\neducating the populace.\n\nH2        Poly-Air programmes are well packaged to enhanced\n\ncomprehension of the audience.\n\nHo:      Poly-Air programmes are not well packed to enhance\n\ncomprehension of the audience.\n\nH3        The timing of Poly-Air programme on the radio is suitable\n\nto the students\n\nHo:      The timing of Poly-Air programme on the radio is not\n\nsuitable to the students\n\nH4:      ESBS/IMT Poly-Air Programme helps to improve the\n\neducational system in Enugu state.\n\nHo:      ESBS/IMT Poly-Air Programme does not help to improve\n\nthe educational system in Enugu state.\n\n1.7       DEFINITION OS TERMS\n\n            The conceptual and operational definition of terms in the study.\n\n1.

        "content": "THE ROLE OF RADIO IN MOBILIZING WOMEN IN POLITICS IN ENUGU URBAN AREAS\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1         BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nRadio is a vital force for social change through public enlightenment. It exists because people must communicate with one another. Communication is the activity by which people pursue the exchange of idea- an exchange that we pursue continuously throughout our lives. Basically, this exchange is an effort to influence the situations around us. In the light of the above the background of the study is designed to study the role, which the radio as a medium of exchange plays in mobilizing women in Enugu metropolis towards active participation in politics. \n\nInfluencing people through communication is a mutual activity, that is why after considering other communication channels like television, interpersonal communication, traditional communication (rituals and festivals gongs, drums and rites) newspapers and magazines; and in view of how effective these channels could be used in performing the role of mobilizing of women in politics; its credibility is given to the radio in injecting political ideas and awareness into the blood stream of its market audience (women).\n\nThe newspaper and magazines for their non-transient features would have helped but it is found pretty difficult these days to be affordable by the average Nigeria. Women in the same vein find if financially tasking to spend their income in buying newspapers or magazines in the face of the present economic crunch plaguing the country (Nigeria) today. Hence, they resort to the radio for information acquisition. Also, the television due to its high cost is not easily affordable by every family.\n\nTraditional communication is limited to the rural dwellers only. The urban-based women do not employ gongs and drums in dispersing information. It becomes pretty ineffective to use traditional communication. The women in urban centers (Enugu metropolis) have been socially developed and modern channels of disseminating information have been developed too. Therefore, they can tune to their various radio sets for information. Radio as being very vital in this case is due to its handy or portability which enables women to carry it about to their offices, business areas and so on, especially the transistor type.\n\nResearch embarked upon by Obiakalusi et al (1991) postulates that Nigerian political independence in 1960 had raised the hopes of many that the nation was being set towards achieving a free and fair democratic society. It is expected that the press as a whole and the radio in particular should be the market place of political ideas suffice it to say that the radio exists to serve the information needs of the citizenry in politics.\n\nAccording to Edelstain in his 1974 study about audiences concluded that the audience evaluated sources of information not in terms of the sources credibility, newspaper in terms of content, television in breadth of perception and radio in availability.\n\nThe radio, therefore, is readily available and handy to the women.\n\nAnother issue of reference is Akpan (1985) mass communication in Nigeria Book of reading eg (Nwuneli) says that the publics entitled to all facts in a political situation and that on the basis of these facts; it can make its decisions. However, these women being informed about political news tend to revent to political interest.\n\nAlso Noelle Neuman (1985) introduction to mass communication: Agea, Warren, Kenda) says that ‘real life’ is different from laboratory controlled studies; the media are so ambiguities that it is difficult for a person to escape a message, repetitive messages have reinforced impact; and news stories are so much the same that there are few options for selective perception. However, the media for its agenda-setting role and using radio to disseminate information repeatedly about politics, these women tend to be influenced by listening to this repetitive political message. Hence, develop a proclivity for politics.\n\nAgain, Agee, Warren Kendal (1985) also postulate that radio for its special role as a mobilization channel, made American listeners to feel the brutal impact of Hitler’s invasion when Hitler demands against background of historical oratory and Frenzied Nazi Crowd reaction. American were graved when they heard murrow described war preparation in London, relieved when Katlendon predicted that Chamberlain Daladier, Muslim and Hitler would find a peace solution at Munich. However it was radio that brought to them this sense of personal participation in what they described was the world’s crisis not merely Europe’s.\n\nThe broadcast media as technological devices of mass communication are established to inform, entertain and educate. These three basic functions are vital in the democratization process of any nation whether in a homogeneous or plural society. Therefore, the radio providing entertainment to its audience especially women in Enugu metropolis sneaks in political messages to its listeners while it is entertaining them.\n\nThe broadcast media in a democratic setting are the conscience of the nation, the radio especially initiate, sustain and reinforce democracy. As an information channel, it informs the audience about politics in which women from part. Also, for its educational function the FRCN Enugu has mapped out programme time sponsored by Mrs. Florence Ejoor (chairperson Abia state family support programme) to educate them not to shy away from politics, but rather to come out enemas to compete with their male counterparts.\n\nMr. Fedelis Ojielo of ESBS, a commentary writer states that radio, as one of the electronic media has remained one of the greatest legacies of post independence in Nigeria. It uses and impacts in public administration political enlightenment and general development, which have made it an indispensable tool of information management and mobilization.\n\nHe also postulates that from the inception of radio in Nigeria, more than 45 years ago, it was obvious that government had a clear vision of establishing more radio stations in different parts of the country basically for information purposes, especially in engineering women in active participation in politics.\n\nThe setting up of WNBC in Ibadan in 1958 and ENBC in Enugu 1960 awakened the socio-political consciousness of people especially the women.\n\nThe importance of the radio also made the Enugu state broadcasting services (ESBS) to introduce a political programme tagged “women in politics” which was aimed at mobilizing women in active participation in politics.\n\nIn line with the above, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe (1965) said that women should be informed about the political situation in the country and the need for them to participate in politics. The radio, if skill-fully used could become a very powerful means of reaching the audience specially the women.\n\n1.2         STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM\n\nNigeria Secured independence since 1960, over four decades. It is time that pre-independence political was under the dictates of our imperial leaders yet the Nigerian man struggled to be part of the participate in active politics.\n\nChief (Mrs.) Ebun Oyagbola, minister of National planning (1982) in her address to the intra-parliamentary union meeting. The role of women in Nigeria politics rightly points out that Aba women riot 1929 and the activities of a few other women which contributed to the eventual handing over power to the people will ever be recalled as part of the engineering landmarks of the drive to political independence by this great nation.\n\nWomen are often relegated to the background on the importance to integrate proper in all facets of life to enhance their social, political and economic development. Emphatically, it should be borne in mind and globally acknowledge that a woman is the moat relevant of the creator’s skill.\n\nAn aphorism has it that “women are weak and yet they weaken the strongest man”. The above implies that the weakness of women shrouds millions and mountains the will power to match forward and achieve greatness.\n\nAlso, an adage goes this way “if a good strong woman stands behind her husband, his steps shall never falter he shall never fall”. Another “Maxim” says behind every successful man there is a woman. Powerful women were the wheel on which their men rode to success, fame and acclaim. A case study is that of Abraham Lincoln and his wife who literally dragged him to the highest poli8tical seat, the United States presidency and the counseling, but persistent wife of Macbeth the hero of William Shakespeare’s tragedy: “Macbeth” (Daily star March 30, 1982). Down through the ages, there has been an example of powerful women. The biblical Esther who was able to redeem her peoples the Israelites from slavery and oppression. Queen Elizabeth I of England was one of that nation’s more capable and popular rulers. Mrs. Margaret Thatchar of Britain and Mrs. Indian Ghandi of India are not left out of the list.\n\nBack to Africa, Queen Amina of Zaria, a formidable woman, achieved many spectacular feats, ruling a vast kingdom and still fondly remembered as a capable strategist and ruler, (CHIF/MRS.) MARGARET UDO, EKPO, and MRS. FUMLAYO RANSOME KUTI all played a very important role in Nigeria.\n\nThe 1979 constitution in Nigeria provides every citizen male or female the right as long as you have attained the eligible age to vote ad to be voted for. However, the direct opposite was the case in the past.\n\nIn order to make women grasp a clearer understanding of what 1979 constitution stipulates and the role women of equal strength have played in politic of past in different nations of the world. The radio therefore has a reasonable impact on women primarily considering its immediate and flexibility.\n\nAccording to Agee Agult Emery, radio with its peculiar characteristics of being present every where the mail carrier walks a route with a transistor fastened to the male bag, the crowd on the beach listen to a singing group: the carpenter on a roof nails shingles in time, to rock beat. Hence, these women at their various places be it in the office, market place or shops tune on their transistor radio sets and with particular attention to radio messages.\n\nHaving seen the history of great women in other nations of the world and the availability of the radio, the burning questions could be drawn as follows.\n\nWill women in Enugu metropolis after being expensed to radio political messages muster more interest to participate in National politics?\n\nCould their exposure to radio political message activate them to holding political post?\n\nAre they likely to perceive any political hatred as a result of their exposure to radio political messages?\n\n2.3         OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe credibility of the radio in dispersing political information and act as a socio-political tool for mobilizing women in Enugu metropolis to participate in National politics is the objective of this work. The work will also see the journalist as a product of the society. The Nigerian society as a conglomeration of different ethnic groups- traditions, beliefs, images, goals, aspirations and constraints must inevitable influence and be influenced upon by the journalist. He assists in shaping the magnitude and direction of what is communicated to the different “publics” especially women in Enugu metropolis of the media.\n\nThis role has its disadvantages for the constant barrages of charges of biased, prejudice, and partisanship leveled against radio and its staff.\n\nThis study will x-ray how women radio listeners in Enugu metropolis view political messages.\n\nAgain, in talking about credibility in radio reports, the researchers will consider messages credibility and sources credibility. By radio credibility, we are talking about believability of radio reports by women, in Enugu metropolis. In connection with the sources credibility, the research will be interested in knowing whether the source of the news has any influence on the credibility rating of the news report. Do women in Enugu see radio as capable of being manipulated and therefore, of presenting less credible political news report. This work takes into cognizance of the fact that the radio is exclusively owned by the government in (Nigeria) with exception of Minaj 89.4 Obosi in Anambra state and Rap power 100.5 in Lagos state and meg probable be manipulated by powers that be.\n\nFurthermore, this study will examine whether it is the political culture in Nigeria that women should relax in participating national politics.\n\n1.4         SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nWomen have been relegated to the background since the inception of the Nigerian politics. However, women have raised their heads above waters in terms of socio-economic development in the Nigeria. This study is geared towards knowing why their active role in politics has been relegated to the background.\n\nThis study is long over due because of its significance to the theoretical politics socio-cultural development of radio in national politics. One of the theoretical statements will focus on whether the women in Enugu metropolis form opinion or politics, following their exposure to radio news.\n\nAgain, on the effect of radio exposure on political attitude change, on theoretical statement, it will also consider the role of inter-personal communication in relation to women in Enugu metropolis selective perception of radio messages.\n\nThe study will assist the government in making policy on radio use in a political situation especially as it effect political news presentation specifically among women in Enugu metropolis.\n\nFinally, the study will also contribute to our socio-cultural development through an empirical linkage of credibility and sycophancy in Nigeria context. It will again enlighten our mind on the use of radio for socio-cultural integration of the women through fair political news management in the radio.\n\nRESERCH QUESTIONS\n\n2.

Do you see radio news reports about politics as manipulated by the government and its agencies?\n\n1.5         RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS\n\nFrom the foregoing research question therefore, some hypothesis shall be experimented in this study. The hypotheses are as contained below:\n\n1.         H1:      Women in Enugu metropolis radio listeners get            most of their political information form the radio.\n\nH0:      Women in Enugu metropolis radio listeners do not get most of their information from the radio.\n\n2.

        "content": "THE ROLE OF RADIO IN MOBILIZING WOMEN IN POLITICS IN ENUGU URBAN AREAS\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1         BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nRadio is a vital force for social change through public enlightenment. It exists because people must communicate with one another. Communication is the activity by which people pursue the exchange of idea- an exchange that we pursue continuously throughout our lives. Basically, this exchange is an effort to influence the situations around us. In the light of the above the background of the study is designed to study the role, which the radio as a medium of exchange plays in mobilizing women in Enugu metropolis towards active participation in politics. \n\nInfluencing people through communication is a mutual activity, that is why after considering other communication channels like television, interpersonal communication, traditional communication (rituals and festivals gongs, drums and rites) newspapers and magazines; and in view of how effective these channels could be used in performing the role of mobilizing of women in politics; its credibility is given to the radio in injecting political ideas and awareness into the blood stream of its market audience (women).\n\nThe newspaper and magazines for their non-transient features would have helped but it is found pretty difficult these days to be affordable by the average Nigeria. Women in the same vein find if financially tasking to spend their income in buying newspapers or magazines in the face of the present economic crunch plaguing the country (Nigeria) today. Hence, they resort to the radio for information acquisition. Also, the television due to its high cost is not easily affordable by every family.\n\nTraditional communication is limited to the rural dwellers only. The urban-based women do not employ gongs and drums in dispersing information. It becomes pretty ineffective to use traditional communication. The women in urban centers (Enugu metropolis) have been socially developed and modern channels of disseminating information have been developed too. Therefore, they can tune to their various radio sets for information. Radio as being very vital in this case is due to its handy or portability which enables women to carry it about to their offices, business areas and so on, especially the transistor type.\n\nResearch embarked upon by Obiakalusi et al (1991) postulates that Nigerian political independence in 1960 had raised the hopes of many that the nation was being set towards achieving a free and fair democratic society. It is expected that the press as a whole and the radio in particular should be the market place of political ideas suffice it to say that the radio exists to serve the information needs of the citizenry in politics.\n\nAccording to Edelstain in his 1974 study about audiences concluded that the audience evaluated sources of information not in terms of the sources credibility, newspaper in terms of content, television in breadth of perception and radio in availability.\n\nThe radio, therefore, is readily available and handy to the women.\n\nAnother issue of reference is Akpan (1985) mass communication in Nigeria Book of reading eg (Nwuneli) says that the publics entitled to all facts in a political situation and that on the basis of these facts; it can make its decisions. However, these women being informed about political news tend to revent to political interest.\n\nAlso Noelle Neuman (1985) introduction to mass communication: Agea, Warren, Kenda) says that ‘real life’ is different from laboratory controlled studies; the media are so ambiguities that it is difficult for a person to escape a message, repetitive messages have reinforced impact; and news stories are so much the same that there are few options for selective perception. However, the media for its agenda-setting role and using radio to disseminate information repeatedly about politics, these women tend to be influenced by listening to this repetitive political message. Hence, develop a proclivity for politics.\n\nAgain, Agee, Warren Kendal (1985) also postulate that radio for its special role as a mobilization channel, made American listeners to feel the brutal impact of Hitler’s invasion when Hitler demands against background of historical oratory and Frenzied Nazi Crowd reaction. American were graved when they heard murrow described war preparation in London, relieved when Katlendon predicted that Chamberlain Daladier, Muslim and Hitler would find a peace solution at Munich. However it was radio that brought to them this sense of personal participation in what they described was the world’s crisis not merely Europe’s.\n\nThe broadcast media as technological devices of mass communication are established to inform, entertain and educate. These three basic functions are vital in the democratization process of any nation whether in a homogeneous or plural society. Therefore, the radio providing entertainment to its audience especially women in Enugu metropolis sneaks in political messages to its listeners while it is entertaining them.\n\nThe broadcast media in a democratic setting are the conscience of the nation, the radio especially initiate, sustain and reinforce democracy. As an information channel, it informs the audience about politics in which women from part. Also, for its educational function the FRCN Enugu has mapped out programme time sponsored by Mrs. Florence Ejoor (chairperson Abia state family support programme) to educate them not to shy away from politics, but rather to come out enemas to compete with their male counterparts.\n\nMr. Fedelis Ojielo of ESBS, a commentary writer states that radio, as one of the electronic media has remained one of the greatest legacies of post independence in Nigeria. It uses and impacts in public administration political enlightenment and general development, which have made it an indispensable tool of information management and mobilization.\n\nHe also postulates that from the inception of radio in Nigeria, more than 45 years ago, it was obvious that government had a clear vision of establishing more radio stations in different parts of the country basically for information purposes, especially in engineering women in active participation in politics.\n\nThe setting up of WNBC in Ibadan in 1958 and ENBC in Enugu 1960 awakened the socio-political consciousness of people especially the women.\n\nThe importance of the radio also made the Enugu state broadcasting services (ESBS) to introduce a political programme tagged “women in politics” which was aimed at mobilizing women in active participation in politics.\n\nIn line with the above, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe (1965) said that women should be informed about the political situation in the country and the need for them to participate in politics. The radio, if skill-fully used could become a very powerful means of reaching the audience specially the women.\n\n1.2         STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM\n\nNigeria Secured independence since 1960, over four decades. It is time that pre-independence political was under the dictates of our imperial leaders yet the Nigerian man struggled to be part of the participate in active politics.\n\nChief (Mrs.) Ebun Oyagbola, minister of National planning (1982) in her address to the intra-parliamentary union meeting. The role of women in Nigeria politics rightly points out that Aba women riot 1929 and the activities of a few other women which contributed to the eventual handing over power to the people will ever be recalled as part of the engineering landmarks of the drive to political independence by this great nation.\n\nWomen are often relegated to the background on the importance to integrate proper in all facets of life to enhance their social, political and economic development. Emphatically, it should be borne in mind and globally acknowledge that a woman is the moat relevant of the creator’s skill.\n\nAn aphorism has it that “women are weak and yet they weaken the strongest man”. The above implies that the weakness of women shrouds millions and mountains the will power to match forward and achieve greatness.\n\nAlso, an adage goes this way “if a good strong woman stands behind her husband, his steps shall never falter he shall never fall”. Another “Maxim” says behind every successful man there is a woman. Powerful women were the wheel on which their men rode to success, fame and acclaim. A case study is that of Abraham Lincoln and his wife who literally dragged him to the highest poli8tical seat, the United States presidency and the counseling, but persistent wife of Macbeth the hero of William Shakespeare’s tragedy: “Macbeth” (Daily star March 30, 1982). Down through the ages, there has been an example of powerful women. The biblical Esther who was able to redeem her peoples the Israelites from slavery and oppression. Queen Elizabeth I of England was one of that nation’s more capable and popular rulers. Mrs. Margaret Thatchar of Britain and Mrs. Indian Ghandi of India are not left out of the list.\n\nBack to Africa, Queen Amina of Zaria, a formidable woman, achieved many spectacular feats, ruling a vast kingdom and still fondly remembered as a capable strategist and ruler, (CHIF/MRS.) MARGARET UDO, EKPO, and MRS. FUMLAYO RANSOME KUTI all played a very important role in Nigeria.\n\nThe 1979 constitution in Nigeria provides every citizen male or female the right as long as you have attained the eligible age to vote ad to be voted for. However, the direct opposite was the case in the past.\n\nIn order to make women grasp a clearer understanding of what 1979 constitution stipulates and the role women of equal strength have played in politic of past in different nations of the world. The radio therefore has a reasonable impact on women primarily considering its immediate and flexibility.\n\nAccording to Agee Agult Emery, radio with its peculiar characteristics of being present every where the mail carrier walks a route with a transistor fastened to the male bag, the crowd on the beach listen to a singing group: the carpenter on a roof nails shingles in time, to rock beat. Hence, these women at their various places be it in the office, market place or shops tune on their transistor radio sets and with particular attention to radio messages.\n\nHaving seen the history of great women in other nations of the world and the availability of the radio, the burning questions could be drawn as follows.\n\nWill women in Enugu metropolis after being expensed to radio political messages muster more interest to participate in National politics?\n\nCould their exposure to radio political message activate them to holding political post?\n\nAre they likely to perceive any political hatred as a result of their exposure to radio political messages?\n\n2.3         OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe credibility of the radio in dispersing political information and act as a socio-political tool for mobilizing women in Enugu metropolis to participate in National politics is the objective of this work. The work will also see the journalist as a product of the society. The Nigerian society as a conglomeration of different ethnic groups- traditions, beliefs, images, goals, aspirations and constraints must inevitable influence and be influenced upon by the journalist. He assists in shaping the magnitude and direction of what is communicated to the different “publics” especially women in Enugu metropolis of the media.\n\nThis role has its disadvantages for the constant barrages of charges of biased, prejudice, and partisanship leveled against radio and its staff.\n\nThis study will x-ray how women radio listeners in Enugu metropolis view political messages.\n\nAgain, in talking about credibility in radio reports, the researchers will consider messages credibility and sources credibility. By radio credibility, we are talking about believability of radio reports by women, in Enugu metropolis. In connection with the sources credibility, the research will be interested in knowing whether the source of the news has any influence on the credibility rating of the news report. Do women in Enugu see radio as capable of being manipulated and therefore, of presenting less credible political news report. This work takes into cognizance of the fact that the radio is exclusively owned by the government in (Nigeria) with exception of Minaj 89.4 Obosi in Anambra state and Rap power 100.5 in Lagos state and meg probable be manipulated by powers that be.\n\nFurthermore, this study will examine whether it is the political culture in Nigeria that women should relax in participating national politics.\n\n1.4         SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nWomen have been relegated to the background since the inception of the Nigerian politics. However, women have raised their heads above waters in terms of socio-economic development in the Nigeria. This study is geared towards knowing why their active role in politics has been relegated to the background.\n\nThis study is long over due because of its significance to the theoretical politics socio-cultural development of radio in national politics. One of the theoretical statements will focus on whether the women in Enugu metropolis form opinion or politics, following their exposure to radio news.\n\nAgain, on the effect of radio exposure on political attitude change, on theoretical statement, it will also consider the role of inter-personal communication in relation to women in Enugu metropolis selective perception of radio messages.\n\nThe study will assist the government in making policy on radio use in a political situation especially as it effect political news presentation specifically among women in Enugu metropolis.\n\nFinally, the study will also contribute to our socio-cultural development through an empirical linkage of credibility and sycophancy in Nigeria context. It will again enlighten our mind on the use of radio for socio-cultural integration of the women through fair political news management in the radio.\n\nRESERCH QUESTIONS\n\n2.

        "content": "THE ROLE OF MASS MEDIA IN DISSEMINATING AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION TO CASSAVA AND PLANTAIN FARMERS\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION\nAccording to the business dictionary, information is defined as a “Data that has been verified to be accurate and timely. It is specific organized for a purpose and presented within a context that gives its meaning and relevance which can lead to an increase in understanding and decrease in uncertainty. Reits (2010) defines information that when experienced at the conscious level as a question, gives rise to a search for an answer, information is a fact and knowledge needed to answer some questions faced by people in their daily life.\n\nThe world Encyclopedia defines information is any kind of event that affects the state of a dynamic system. The valve of information lies solely on its ability to affect a behaviour, decision or outcome. A piece of information is considered valueless, if after receiving it, and things remain unchanged. Agriculture play an essential role in everyday human activities ranging from the provision of primary needs like food, clothing and shelter to secondary needs like construction, manufacturing etc. while much of the world is still stuck in subsistence agriculture majorly in remote part of the country, a little proportion of agriculture is just being practiced under the light of civilization and mode4rnization. That is to say farmers in the remote part of the country need to be constantly fed with information, idea, knowledge and skills developed from the Research Institute for better Farming Practice and eventual increase in yield. Information might be inform of new technology like storage facilities, better farming system like mechanization, access to credit facilities etc. for Agricultural information to be effective, after the information has been conveyed from the door, i.e. ministry of agriculture and the subordinate like research institute, Agricultural Development Project (ADP) etc to the receiver to the donor of the information must be accomplished.\n\n                   \n\nAlso, Agricultural Information tend to connect the different departments of agriculture be elaborating on how judiciously individual department by products can be utilize by another department another, example, Nigerian is naturally fixed to the soil by some legumes like Callopogonuim Mucunoide, which will eventually increase the nutritive valve of livestock that feed on them while the excreta of the livestock is used to manure for crops to increase their yield. It can be represented sectionally as below.  \n\n                                       \n\n         The means of transporting agriculture may be through extension agents or through mass media. Media transit their information electronically with television, film, radio, movies, CDs, DVDs and some other gadgets like cameras or video consoles. Alternative print media uses a physical object as a means of sending their information such as newspaper, magazines, Brochures, Newsletters, books, leaf lets and pamphlets. Outdoor media is also a form of mass media which comprises billboards, signs, placards, placed inside and outside of commercial buildings like shops/buses, public speaking and event, organizing e.g. demonstration are also considered as mass media.\n\n        Mass media have been acclaimed to be a very effective medium for diffusing the scientific knowledge, innovation and technology to the masses in a country like Nigeria precisely Edo State where farmers literacy level is low. The choice of communication medium is of vital importance. Radio for example, because of its low cost and affordability by virtually all classes of income  earners, it can transfer modern agricultural technology to both literate and illiterate farmers even in interior could serve as a suitable medium of disseminating information and latest technical know-how. The farmers can easily understand the operations technology and instruction through television. The print media widened the scope of communication. It is cheap and farmers can afford to buy and read them at their convenience. It is a permanent medium in that the message are imprinted permanently with high storage value which makes them suitable for reference and research.\n\n        Cassava as the name implies is one of the staple foods consumed locally by the people of Edo State (Nigeria). Recently, the Federal Government has decided to increase the rate of cassava farmers so as to be able to produce food for the masses.\n\n        Also the federal government launched an initiative aimed at consolidating Nigeria’s position as the largest producer of cassava in the whole world. In addition to what was included as part of the package is a research into some possible industrial linkage that would lead to making the cassava a key export product in no distant future.\n\n        Cassava is presently used in the production of garri, industrial starch; alcohol, fufu and animal feeds cassava flour can also be gotten from cassava. This is one product that is found throughout the state and would support all sizes of investors. Investors are assured of relatively cheap and staple source of raw materials in Edo State. Opportunities also exist for large scale farming of cassava.\n\n        The production of cassava is concentrated in the hands of numerous small holders farmers located primarily in south-south state which include Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta Edo and Rivers. These farmers use manual processing techniques in the processing of cassava. Cassava can be interplant with maize plantain etc. cassava can get matured within six month of cultivation and ready for harvest.\n\n        Plantain (Musa Spp) occupies a strategic position for rapid food production in Nigeria. It is ranked among starchy food/staples. The consumption of plantain has risen tremendously in Nigeria. In recent years, because of the rapidly increasing urbanization and the great demand for easy and convenient foods by the non-farming urban populations. Besides, being the staple for many people in more humid regions, plantain is a delicacy and favoured snack for people. A growing industry, mainly plantain chips, is believed to be responsible for the high demand being experienced now in Nigeria. Plantain production in Nigeria has witnessed a steady risk for more than 20 years. As at (2004) Nigeria produce 2.10 million tons harvested from 389,000 hectare production (A.O 2006). Plantain is a majorly source of carbohydrate for more than 50 million Nigerians. In the country, all stages of fruit from immature to overripe are used as a source of food in one form or the other. The immature fruits are peeled, sliced, and made into powder and consumed as plantain fufu. The mature fruits (ripe or unripe) are consumed boiled, steamed, batch, pounded, roasted, or sliced into drips, overripe fruit serve as composite in the making of baby food (Babena and Sogamusa), bread, biscuit and others (Ogazi 1996, Akyyeampong 1999).\n\n        The fruits are produced all years round, the major harvest comes in the try season (November to February) when most other starchy product or staples are unavailable or difficult role in the bridging the gap hunger (Wilson 1986). In Nigeria, plantain peels are used as feed for livestock, while the dried peels are used for soap production. The dried peels are used for soap production. The dried leaves sheath and petioles are used as tying materials sponges and roofing materials.\n\nSTATEMENT OF PROBLEM\nIn Nigeria, the important of cassava and plantain industry cannot be underrated based on the vital role they play in human nutrition, source of employment and income generation at large international potash institution (1957) identified the principal product of cassava to be fain. The three main products gotten from cassava after being processed include garri, flour and fufu. The use of these products which may be locally for consumption by human and livestock or industrially used as raw materials, while plantain a major source of carbohydrate for more than 50 million Nigerians (Ogazi 1996). The ripe plantain is also a major source of iron and also a delicacy for diabetic patient.\n\n        However, cassava and plantain farmers are faced with some problems which include.\n\nLand tenure system problem.\nFund problems.\nProblem of improved planting materials and pest disease.\nThe agricultural role of mass media in disseminating agricultural information, innovation and idea in the study areas has never been recognized despite the fact that researchers are still trying to bridge the gap between the research stations and these rural farmers (cassava and plantain farmers). This has consequently marginalized agriculture and farming family which resulted to low productivity in spite of the efforts of the mass media in communicating agricultural information to the farmers.\n\nTherefore this research attempts to address some of the following research question.\n\nDo socio-economic characteristics of the farmers have any influence on the sources of information through mass media?\nWhat are the available mass media that have been used to communicate extension delivery services to the cassava and plantain farmers?\nWhat are the problems cassava and plantain farmers face in accessing the mass media sources.\nWhat are the factors that constrain respondents from using mass media?\nOBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\nThe general objective of the study is to examine the role of mass media in disseminating agricultural information to cassava and plantain farmers in Edo State while the specific objectives are to:-\n\nExamine the social- economic characteristics of cassava and plantain farmers\nExamine the farmers accessibility to mass media.\nAscertain mass media type through which respondents sought agricultural information.\nAscertain respondents perceived role of mass media as information source\nExamine factors that constrain respondents use of mass media as information source.\nIdentify the problems limiting farmers from cultivating cassava and plantain.\nSCOPE OF STUDY\nThe scope the study is limited to Ovia North East Local Government Area only\n\nHYPOTHESIS  \nThere is no significant relationship between respondent’s access to mass media and their perception of relevance of mass media as information source.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nIt has been ascertained that mass media play an important role in transiting information to large number of audience simultaneously. Yet, Okwu and Obinne (2000) have indentified the main problem of agriculture in Nigeria as that of transfer of new technology information, innovations to farmers and not lack of them perse it is  known that mass media haves been making useful contributions to agricultural technology information and innovat6ion adoption. This study seeks to establish the clear5 existence of utilization by both cassava and plantain farmers in Edo Ovia North East Local Government Area Edo State\n\nHence, the recommendation from this study will be useful to policy makers, researchers, ADP and other stakeholders in agricultural development agencies. This study will provide information which will be useful in solving the problem posed by cassava and plantain farmers.",

The findings on the study reveled that news commentaries have less impact on some resident of the country as a result of low level of awareness and illiteracy.\n\nThe research recommended that radio news commentaries should create enough awareness to control the effect of illiteracy level of respondent and also further studies should be encouraged.       \n\nTABLE OF CONTENT\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1              Background of the study\n\n1.2              Statement of problem\n\n1.3              Objective of the study\n\n1.4              Significance of study\n\n1.5              Research question\n\n1.6              Research hypothesis\n\n1.7              Definition of terms\n\n1.8              Assumption\n\n1.9              Limitation of the  study\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW\n\n2.1       Source of literature\n\n2.2              The review\n\n2.3              Summary of literature review\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY\n\n3.1       Research  method\n\n3.2              Research design\n\n3.3              Research sample\n\n3.4              Data collection\n\n3.5              Data analysis\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nDATA  ANALYSIS AND RESULT\n\n4.1              Data analysis\n\n4.2              Result\n\n4.3              Discussion\n\nCHAPETR FIVE\n\nSummary & recommendation for further study\n\n5.1              Summary\n\n5.2              Recommendation\n\n5.3              Conclusion\n\nBibliography\n\nAppendix\n\nQuestionnaire\n\nCHAPETR ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe history of radio news commentary in Nigeria dated back to the 1930’s when what was known as radio receiver was just a wooden box and as amp liter.  The audience has thrilled by these live commentaries run by various pioneer commentators.\n\nEver since the tradition of running radio commentary has remained with radio to this day.\n\n            In presidential democracy such as ours news commentary whether on the  radio newspaper or television do not only serve as surveyor of public opinion but also serve as a requisite for bridging the credibility gap between government and the governed.\n\nPerhaps, it might be necessary to draw a line of distinction between news and news commentary. A news caster presents straight news without additional comment.  While a news talk provides background information to the new.  Writing on the uses of radio, Richard Aspinall said that:\n\n“with limits radio can persuade   and effectively influence large  audience thereby contributing substantially to the thinking of the nation”  \n\nin the Nigeria media house today news commentary has become a ferment feature.  Airtime is allowed to news commentary immediately after major news- bulletins perhaps as an attention gaining strategy. \n\nThe media house not only give air space to commentaries written by its own staff but also uses those written in the additional headlines of various  new papers this giving freedom of expression a chance.\n\nToday the media house news- commentary not only interpret the news but sometimes comment on societal problems but what happens to the problems or issues of the society and the views expressed by the news- talk after these Tracie broadcasts as in the media house?\n\nDo they influence the attitude and an opinion of the country’s listening public?\n\n1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nPerhaps 50 percent of each radio news commentary listeners who forget to fund their radio during commentary do so are more accustomed to the news paper additional page to which they can easily refer may be and may be not we shall find cut through survey in the subsequent chapters.\n\nOwing to the fact that news- commentary are aired to  listeners and are not seen we have therefore taken it upon ourselves to present at least except of two news commentary aired by ESBS  and FRCN\n\nIs it not often said that seeing is believing? Indeed sight or vision is an indispensable in learning and retention –vision is said to aid the memory to produce previously retained content.  And for quick remembrance of past new-talks by respondents these excerpts shall serve as basis for our analyses.  We shall present them to our respondents for answers\n\n1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nA country like Nigeria with diverse culture and human resource & need radio commentaries or news talk capable of interpreting events bordering global and societal issues. Obviously these news-commentary are staunchly provided to listeners on a daily basis\n\nUnfortunately about 80% of radio listeners ignore news- talk once they have listened to actual news broadcast but radio listeners are 100% attentive to sport commentaries. If all radio commentaries are said to interpret events occurring earlier on illuminating the hidden fact (news behind the news) to the layman then it is  to be preferred to actual broadcast.\n\nMoreover generally the Nigeria audience seems not to appreciate radio commentaries as their western counterpart who listen to radio and write feedback to their radio stations such as BBC which in turn  offers them a round the clock service.\n\n1.3              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe foregoing objectives apart the present study must be seen to be significance or relevant to mass communication at least on two grounds.\n\nFirst, it focuses on Nigeria media consumer on news- commentaries which is a medium essentially designed for news broadcast and its obligatory effort interpreting new to its listeners through commentaries.\n\nThe second point or relevance of this study is its typology. Being an audience research this study seeks to emphasis that communication without feedback is incomplete.  We might wrap up this relevance of feedback   in the words of Quall and Brown \n\n“ In any commumcation system feedback from receivers to a communicator is\n\na necessary ingredient fro maximum efficiency.  Ti is the only true indicator of the effectiveness to reach the people and it provides the only safe basis for alteration of any format”\n\n1.4              RESEARCH QUESTION\n\n1.                  Do the news commentary ever steer a middle course at times disagreeing with government policy and at the other time selling it\n\n2.                  To what extent have the suggestion and opinion offered by the news talk as solution to societal problems been adopted in the society.\n\n3.                  What are the criteria fro selecting among others the news talk to be aired?\n\n4.                  Considering the frequency that news talk are and have the purpose tended to induce  the desired effect\n\n5.                  How often are the suggestions and opinions contributed   in the news talk adopted by the lecterns \n\n6.                  Does Nigeria radio news talk influence the attitude and opinions of the listening public?\n\n7.                  How many media consumer listen to and make use of any Nigeria news  talk\n\n1.5              RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS\n\nTo provide some dues as the direction of this inquiry the following hypothesis have been put forward to us.\n\nH1:      Radio audience in Nigeria do listen to new talk because the letter are\n\nMere  repetition of actual broadcast.\n\nH0:      Radio audience in Nigeria do not listen to new talk because the letter are\n\nMere repetition of actual broadcast\n\nH2:      Things are likely to continuously exhibit this trend toward Nigeria radio\n\nNews talks so long as strong foreign counterparts exist.\n\nH0:      Things do not continuously exhibit this trend toward Nigeria radio\n\nNews talks so long as strong foreign counterparts exist.\n\nH3:      That spot commentaries are livelier and therefore more interesting than\n\nNew talk\n\nH0:      That spot commentaries are not livelier and therefore more interesting than new talk.\n\n1.6              DEFINITION OF TERM\n\nWe are obligated to define the conceptual and key operational definitions are given blow:\n\ni.                    Commentary\n\nii.                  Listeners\n\niii.                ESBS and FRCN\n\niv.                Effectiveness\n\nv.                  Method of presentation\n\nCONCEPTUAL DEFINITION  \n\ni.          Commentary:            This offer listener information on current issues or research of current relevance which helps in directing the minds of the entire audience including those in authority and subjects.\n\nii.         Impact:           According tot the oxford paper- back dictionary it means idea in as much as this is valid? Impact here shall be operationally seen to be effective in result of radio news talk.  It provides such detailed and in-depth opinion as would enable the listeners to interpret the significance of news     \n\niii.        Listener:         These are the audience of radio news talk.\n\niv.        ESBS and FRCN:                 ESBS stands for Enugu state broadcasting service and FRCA stands for federal radio corporation of Nigeria\n\nv.         Effectiveness: This means that ESBS /FRCN commentaries are achieving the intended result aims and objective to which it was established\n\nvi.        Method of Presentation:       This is the technique to which commentary is delivered to the target audience through radio.\n\n1.7              ASSUMPTION\n\nAll the studies of the research work will be passed on survey method. The survey research method will be adopted because in any experimental research the researchers have studied without injecting extraneous variables.  On the other hand the survey research usually involved studying the attitudes of pole, which cannot be predicted.\n\nIt is therefore believed that at the end of this research work a reliable and depended able result will be achieved.

        "content": "THE IMPACT OF CRIME WAVE IN THE NATIONAL ECONOMY\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0       INTRODUCTION\n\nThe situation cannot be tolerated in which our country continues to be engulfed by the crime wave, which includes murder, crimes against women and children child trafficking, drug trafficking, armed robbery, fraud and theft.  We must take the war to the criminals and no longer allow the situation in which we are mere sitting ducks of those in our society who, for whatever reason, are bent to engage in criminal and anti-social activities.  Instructions have therefore already gone out to the minister of safety and security, the National Commissioner of the Police Service and the Security Organs as a whole to take all necessary measures to bring down the levels of crime.  (President N. R. Mandela, 17 Feb. 1995 Cape Town).\n\nPart of the response to the President’s speech was the development of the SAPS 1995 ‘Community Safety Plan’, a package of short-term policing measures aimed at tackling the priority of crimes in the country.  In May 1995, an inter-departmental strategy team, composed largely of civilian officials, began the process of drafting a long-term crime prevention strategy, which would become known as the National Crime Prevention Strategy (NCPS).  The intention was that the long-term strategy would tackle the root causes of crime, in parallel to the police’s community safety plan, which would deliver more effective responses to crimes, which had already been committed or planned.  This bifurcation is essential to an understanding of the shift in government crime prevention policy in the five years since the NCPS was adopted.  At that time, the tough, crime combating approach was contained in the community safety plan (and later the various police plans), and the planning and implementation processes for those were entirely cabinet has asked us to design the process which will eventually culminate in a comprehensive and holistic National Crime Prevention Strategy.  The NCPS, which eventually emerges should be owned by the broadcast possible cross-section of South Africa’s population, and should go beyond a mere police response to crime.  In considering the process, which should be followed, this committee should bear in mind the complexity of the causes of crime and therefore pay proper attention to political, social and economic causes and manifestations of crime.  If this committee succeeds with its task, the NCPS could result in answers to the question.  What is crime prevention all about?  It could result in a recognized and coordinated government response to crime, and in a greater role for civil society and communities in the prevention of crime.  (Mufamadi, May 1995).\n\n1.1              GENERAL BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nThe notion that the crime rate in a country is affected by the state of its economy has a common sense appeal to most individuals.  This belief would especially apply to the Nigeria where theoretically our free-market economy, with its relatively low-funded social programs compared to other western democracies, leaves the underprivileged more at the mercy of changing market forces.  According to this instinct ional approach and most of the “economic” models of criminology, a flagging economy leads to more joblessness, less money for charity and “safety net” programs, and greater difficulty for individuals trying to find or maintain income to sustain the basic needs of their families.  As a result, those individuals will more likely turn to criminal activity as a means of income for these basic needs, since the benefit of lawful activity no longer outweighs the risks of criminal activity (these risks, such as injury at the hands of a potential victim, incarceration, social and familial pressures against crime, etc. are viewed as the “costs” of criminal activity in the economic models).\n\nFrom the perspective of the Department of Public Advocacy, increase crime caused by a bad economy presumably committed inordinately by the economically disadvantaged, could have a significant impact on our individual and agency – wide caseloads.  The current economic downturn has shown some signs of recovery, but the economic situation is not flying high like it was two years ago.  Even if the situation merely stagnates, there is still cause for concern since any local, state, or national bumps in the economy usually hit the poor first and hardest.\n\nDespite this common sense reasoning, there is substantial debate among economists regarding the link between crime and the economy.  The parties to the debate are usually divided and labeled into two familiar camps.  Specifically, “conservative” economists minimize the link between economy and crime, arguing that committing a crime is more an individual choice or flaw, while “liberal” economists emphasize the role of institutions, family structure and societal forces in the commission of crimes.  Despite this debate, the majority of recent scholarly analysis has found that crime rates are directly related to the economy.  The articles offer varying degree of certainty on this point and even disagree about whether the relationship to economic factors only exists for property crimes (and not for violent crimes) or for all crimes.  The two main relevant areas of analysis drawn from the research are (1) wages and unemployment generally and (2) the 1990s economic “boom” and crime “bust” and what both can tell us about the crime/economy connection.  Each segment with the two categories will focus on a specific scholarly writing on crime and the economy.\n\n1.2              PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER\n\nThe primary factor to be considered in the health of any free market economy is employment.  Even if the top corporations in the Nigeria were experiencing huge profits or the world was in a state of virtual peace, such gains would matter little to most Nigerians if they are severely underpaid or could not even find a job.  Economists have performed extensive research into how our society is affected by meaningful employment and its absence.  They have combined their efforts with those of criminologists to explore how fluctuations in the state of joblessness will impact the crime rate (or vice versa).  Some of their findings are discussed below.\n\n1.3              PROBLEM(S) THAT THE STUDY WILL BE CONCERNED WITH\n\nThere are many problems that the study will be concerned with.\n\nSome of which can be explained below:\n\n(i)                             To identify provincial crime prevention priorities.\n\n(ii)                           To identify provincial role-players for possible crime prevention programmes.\n\n(iii)                         To identify location and responsibility for provincial programmes.\n\n(iv)                         To establish provincial co-ordination teams for crime prevention programmes.\n\n(v)                           To involve all government department and civil society organizations in crime.\n\n1.4              THE IMPORTANT OF STUDYING THE SUBJECT AREA.\n\n(1)               The study will bring to the light NCPS into the society and organization.\n\nThe NCPS will progress or can make control in combating crime.\n\n(2)               The Government itself with this study knows the importance of the role of NCPS in any society.  And how efficient training can increase the rate of combating crime.\n\nOther societies will benefit from it and help them to carry out their duties by giving the information.\n\n(3)               This study will serve as an impact to a further crime control\n\nAnd besides, it will reverse other areas of crime.\n\n1.5              DEFINITION OF IMPORTANT TERMS\n\n(1) NCPS:       National Crime Preventions Strategy\n\n(2) Crime:        Is an offence against the nation’s Law and Regulation and the breaching goes with a punishment by the authority.  It is an offence against the Law and humanity.  It’s also an offence committed by individual or anybody.\n\n(3) Punishment:           The reward for any person that commits this offence.",

        "content": "THE IMPACT OF RADIO PROGRAMMES IN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCommunication is the process of sending message from one point to another and the content of the message is called information.  Information pervades the whole spectrum of life.  It is a treasure to a nation, community and the larger world.  Every sphere f life will remain static without well-packaged information.  Information to a large extent is an asset, a resource, a commodity with social economic and political consequences.\n\nCommunication is as old as mankind and it is the pivot on which human existence, continuity and national development revolves.  Different media are used in communication, which classified into print – such as Newspapers, Magazines, etc.; Electronics – such as Radio, Television, etc., oral – eg. use of gongs, etc.\n\nThe electronic media categories are the most prominent and significant.  They are younger than oral and print media being mainly the products of twentieth century.  Stella Okunna (1987) noted, “Radio appears to be more powerful.  It stands out as having the greater power of reaching the diverse people of the Nigeria nation” Radio as a medium of mass communication has wider scope of coverage and as a commonly used medium makes greater impact on the audience.  Radio is a mechanical medium of communication whose reception according to Okonkwo (1997) “is aural”.  Radio makes use of sense of sound and hearing to convey its message to the audience.  It is a faithful comparison everywhere one found a set to listen to while having a walk, at work, in the farm, in the market places, riding a car, on a motor-cycle, on a donkey, etc.  Radio is used countrywide even in rural areas.  This is attributable to the unique qualities of the medium – it is portable, easily affordable and easily – operated even in the absence of electricity.\n\nIn this study therefore, we have set out to examine the roles played by Radio Programmes in National Development with particular reference to Imo Broadcasting Corporation (IBC), Owerri as a case study.\n\n1.1        BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nNigeria is a giant nation strongly backed up by a collective will to develop and forge ahead.  “In dreams”, writes Fred Amadi (1999) “begins responsibility”.  The responsibility of carrying the people of the nation along its developmental journey falls on radio – the media used countrywide.\n\nIt is believed that Nigeria nation has not less than 250 ethnic groups with different socio-cultural backgrounds.  This calls for a medium that can cross boarders, break through all barriers and make developmental impact on the audienc as according to Wilbur Schramm (1994) “for there to be unity and national development, there must be effective communication”\n\n1.2        STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nLanguage is one of the major barriers that hinder radio programmes from being consumed by the audience.  Nigerian is a multi-lingua nation and as such, differences in language reduce the listenership of radio programmes.  Unlike newspaper, which has the advantage of semi-permanence, radio programmes are transient in nature.\n\nDevelopmental role of radio programmes will be a failure if appropriate time is not allotted to the programmes in order to get the target audience.\n\nIn addition, failure to programme introduces boredom thus, reducing the listenership of radio programmes.  In order to conquer boredom caused by monitoring, the IBC Radio Station introduces variety in programming.  Regional and ethnic sentiments reduce radio programmes from being ‘local’ to the diverse and heterogeneous Nigerian audience\n\n1.3        OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study aims at examining the role of radio programmes in motivating national development.\n\nTo ascertain whether the radio programmes can be used in educating the people on the need for national development especially the rural dwellers, who holds the key to national development in every nation.\n\nIt is also aimed at informing the audience on the gain that is accruable in national development.\n\n1.4        SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY\n\nThe results and findings of this study will enhance programme production in various radio stations in the country.   In addition, the study will bring to the fore the effectiveness and importance of radio programmes in achieving the much desired national development.\n\nThis in addition will help in breaking the language barriers that hinder radio programmes from being consumed by the audience.  It will also help in reducing boredom caused by monotony.\n\n1.5        RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\nAs a standard, our attention is drawn on research problems.  The research questions are stated below:\n\n(1)         Can Radio Programmes help in National development?\n\n(2)         Does IBC Radio Station especially the AM Radio Station, have programmes that can help in national development?\n\n(3)         Is the role of IBC Radio Station pgoramme seen as positive of negative in the national developmental journey?\n\n(4)         Can IBC station’s programmes elicity the desired action on the audience?\n\n(5)         Has IBC Radio Station done enough in achieving national development?\n\n1.6        RESEARCH HYPOTHESES\n\nH1:     The quality of the programmes produced by the IBC Radio Station helped in developing the nation.\n\nH0:     The quality of the programmes produced by the IBC Radio Station does not help in developing the nation.\n\nH2:     The programmes have effect on its audience.\n\nH0:     The programmes have no effect on its audience\n\nH3:     The nature of the advertisement of the programmes makes the people to be aware of that programme.\n\nH0:     The nature of the advertisement of the programmes does not make the people to be aware of that programme.\n\n1.7        ASSUMPTION\n\nAs usual with a study of this nature, the researcher hereby made the following assumption.\n\nWith the advancement of technology in mass communication field, there tends to be a growing awareness among societies.  Therefore, there is a belief that the people’s perceptions and understanding of media messages are considered high.\n\nIt was also assumed that people embark on industrialization as a result of mass media influence.\n\nFinally, it was also assumed that most rural dwellers in Imo State speak and hear Igbo language in which the IBC Radio Stations Industrial Development Programme produced.\n\n1.8        DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nELECTRONIC MEDIA\n\nConceptual:         All means of spreading simultaneous information to a scattered and heterogeneous audience (outside the print media) using vocal and visual means.\n\nOperational:        All radio and television stations in Nigerian from the electronic media here.\n\nRADIO\n\nConceptual:         Vocal means of disseminating simultaneous information to a scattered and heterogeneous audience.\n\nOperational:        Medium that makes use of the sense of sound or hearing.\n\nROLE\n\nConceptual:          This means the task or duty of a person in a particular understanding.  It could also mean a part played by a person in a particular event.\n\nOperational:        The total programmes of the Radio medium as a task of national development.\n\nNATIONAL\n\nConceptual:         Having or sharing characteristics of a large community of people with political character and aspiration and also with a central or common language.\n\nOperational:        Nigeria as community of people with English as a central language and other characteristics that defines it as a nation.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\n\nConceptual:         To cause to grow more organized and more mature or unfold into a large status.\n\nOperational:        Shifting Nigeria from the present status to a more organized nation in all aspects of politics, economy, religion, etc.\n\nPROGRAMMES\n\nConceptual:         Electronic media messages broadcast or disseminated to the audience.\n\nOperational:        Radio messages – includes knowledge, information, entertainment, education, etc. disseminated information to the people (audience).",

Under electronic  media  there is an intensive use of  (AM) Amplitude modulation and (FM) frequency modulation stations both in federal radio co-operation of  Nigeria FRCN, Enugu  state  broadcasting  service  ESBS) and daily star  newspapers  among other  are  used to create awareness  for  the  rural development.  The under- development community Obuoffia have  called  for a great concern of the press  media.\n\nThe  timidity  and  ignorance  that  often exhibited by the  rural dwellers have linked the media  concerns as to how  they should educate inform enlighten mobilize sensitize  in order to  revitalizes the regrettable trend in Obuoffia and  the entire  rural communities.\n\n            Most  rural dwellers  do not know the  opportunities available to  them they still flourish in the previous  dog mate  belief that cannot equate them with their counterparts  in the urban setting.\n\nThe media here are  face with he Obligation on the betterment of the  rural communities through the packaging of  information on how to do something with their  in-exposure which hinders them from acquiring basic knowledge there by educating  them through programmes which  can sharpen their intellects  providing  job  opportunities  for  the ever increasing  population  explosion in rural set –up and re-orientation of our  rural dwellers  through sensitization enlightenment mobilization and motivation .\n\n            Rural development of  any kind in  any place can only be meaningfully achieved through a well planned  execute complex interactions.\n\nThe major role of media is usually to enlighten and examine problems and issues that need to be  understood in order  to improve the quality of life in the rural  dwellers.\n\nEnugu state broadcasting service  of  Nigeria and the federal radio corporation of Nigeria  should  help to maintain  the much needed  regular  two-way communication between  the  poor  people of  Obuoffia  and the urban elite’s especially the government  or those holding political powers in the country.\n\nIt is no longer contestable that  when  media  is properly  applied communication can work together  with a nexus  of  other  social variables to facilitate social change.   That is why the communication and development  experts  or practitioners in Africa and  around  the world have been  long engaged in  the  search  for methods approaches  devices  techniques  and of course  strategies that could help them put communication to the fullness and most effective use in achieving their various development  objectives.\n\nThe two broadcasting station news articles  features have 50 long be recognized as officious packages for  development  especially now that we are in the democratic  despencention.  Media  should focus  more  on how we  use rural newspaper  for development and for the  mobilization of such neglected  and discarded rural  dwellers  in the primitive  and the interior parts of Enugu sate .\n\n            We  are convinced  that it will be quite unreasonable  for us to expect achieving any meaningful  realistic  and  actualized rural development of Obuoffia Awkunanowo  in  Enugu  state  that  communication without  careful  and systematic  approach towards  mobilization  and  participation of rural communities which of course  can be achieved through the media using Enugu state broadcasting service (ESBS) as case study.\n\n1.2       PROBLEM STATEMENT\n\nIn the problem statement of the role of mass media in rural development using Enugu state broadcasting service as a case study.\n\nWe  observed  very unfortunately  that  many problem  exist\n\nHowever in a case of money change agents rural  development officer public relation officers.\n\nInformation officer and other  officers   that are involved  in  preparing  news articles and features for  rural development projects do  not do their work well enough to achieve the required and desired results.\n\nBesides the problem is ignorance  but most of the time the problem  is either  lack of  insufficient   oritention of those  officers to achieve the special need techniques and systematic approaches for preparing  new, articles and features towards achieving rural development objectives.\n\nFurthermore  high illiteracy  barriers is another problem of the mass media  in achieving its arms and objectives in rural development  most of the people in the rural area are not intelligent and educative enough to understand some of the information’s been passed from the media  house.\n\nAgain the rural dwellers major weakness to develop  rest on the point the readership level is how due to the low literacy rate of the rural  targeted audience .  even the rural newspapers has continued  not to allow them develop inspire of the role of media in Enugu as the case study.   \n\n1.3       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe  objective of this research is to find out the means through  which media/press can develop the rural dwellers in Obuoffia communities in Enugu state as a case study.\n\n            Therefore  media should inclulge in its traditional  communication style  through which it must preceded by an  extensive research effort  by identify the information needs of the  rural dwellers the social cultural and  economic  characteristics literacy level historical religions  biases and readership pattern.\n\nFurthermore the  media for the rural areas must also be preceded by  the  formulation of a clearance editorial policy that is dominantly guided by a sound muralist philosophy    with a broad outlook.\n\nIn addition the objectives  of this study is to evaluate on how the media in Enugu state has gone in maintain a Gason communication between the rural communities and the state government.\n\n1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nTo  provide a reliable panacea through which media should embark in alleviating about 70% of the rural   dwellers that have been seriously neglected in the policies and  policies and programmes of the government affairs the significance of this project\n\n            This will be very important to the researchers  academics  the Enugu  state newspaper daily stars and of  course  Enugu state Broadcasting  service.

        "content": "THE IMPACT OF RELIGIOUS BROADCASTING ON NIGERIA VIEWERS\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.10BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nIn treating the effect of religious broadcasting on Nigeria audience, we shall continually interchange the concept influence with effect. Though both words are synonym, the word effect is more common in studying communication impact.\n\nConsidering the audience dimension we state that there is no broadcasting without an audience. The audience factor is the most important. The audience keeps the media alive, they are heterogeneous in nature.\n\nBroadcasting is a two way communication via telephone, E-mail, tax, satellite etc. It remains predominantly a one-way social phenomenon.\n\nTo understand the impact or effect of broadcasting on Nigeria audience, we need to understand it from the context of their social categories and selective capacities. The mass of the Nigerian public are socially a numerous subset. Each subset has its traits, which affect its level of exposure to the media and invariably the extent of the effect of such message on them.\n\nVariably such as age, sex, educational attainment, social economic status, social affiliation all combines individually or in concert to affect the public disposition to broadcast messages. This is where the theories of selective exposure and uses and gratification come into play in shaping audience perception of broadcast message and the gratification they get form it.\n\nThe two factors to have in mind when presenting religious programme, is the audience and the medium of conveyance. This factors guides your presentation, and goes beyond ordinary information. The audience with its greater part determines which material will be presented. You have to be familiar with your medium and know the difference between your medium and others. The radio medium is transitory and fleeting and so message have to be brief and concise.\n\nThe television medium is more economical to use than the radio because the audience view things for themselves on the screen.\n\nA critical analysis of the radio and television broadcasting media will be essential in examining the effect of religious broadcasting. It will be done with thorough care within the scope of limitation.\n\nIn recent time religious groups has imbibed the efficiency of broadcasting as a means of communicating to their members and the society at large in order to disseminate their doctrines. In our country Nigeria, we have three major religious groups. They are, the Islamic religion, Christianity, and traditional religion. They have various segments with different view and doctrines which guides them and cannot be known by an outside without being effectively informed. Information and communication technology have improved our broadcasting media through the use of state of the art electronic digital gadget to reach the world and therefore our religious group has deemed it fit to be the most effective means of reaching the world.\n\nThe main purpose of this work is to have an in depth analysis on how effective the broadcasting media has been for religious groups in converting people with force or bias. This is because religions which interwoven with the culture of the people, can be defined as the belief of a group of people in regards of their existence in this world.\n\nReligion frames one’s mind to adhere to the rules and regulation of the society he or she lives in. it helps to nurture the mind and make one a better being through indoctrination.\n\nBroadcasting is one of the most effective means of communication. It has helped religious group to better the society and eliminate crime that has in recent times became the other of the day.\n\n1.11STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM\n\nThe purpose of religious groups is to create a sense of reasoning among the masses and change the world at large. Each individual is governed by his own intuition, the transformation of individuals into a better being is not an easy task and unless brainwashed with doctrines he cannot easily change or adapt to changes. Human beings have animalistic tendency. This makes it even more difficult to predict an individual.\n\nThe society at large influences the behavior pattern of individuals and so in corrupt society religious groups finds it difficult to penetrate into the society and defect it. Religion plays a vital role in everyone’s life. To what extent has religion influenced the lives of people through broadcasting media to reach the society? This poises the main problem to the impact of religious broadcasting in our country Nigeria.\n\n1.12OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe objectives and aims of this study is as follows:\n\n1)          To determine the impact of the broadcast medium in creating awareness on religious issues for the urban audience\n\n2)          To find out, how exposure to television have greater influence on the audience than radio.\n\n3)          To analyze whether age can contribute to the media preference of the audience\n\n4)          To find out the prospects of using the social status and level of education of an audience to determine hours spent on a medium.\n\n1.13SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThese research stems from the fact that communication is very much at the heart of each religious organization. This study will show and determine how religious broadcasting affects the audience and the way they react to broadcast stimuli.\n\n1.14RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1)          Does radio broadcast create more awareness for the audience on religious issues?\n\n2)          Does a television exposure have greater impact on the audience than radio?\n\n3)          Does ages contribute to media the impact, the broadcast media has on its the audience?\n\n4)          Does education and social status of an audience influence their opinion on issues that is aired on broadcast media?\n\n\n",

It is now possible for people to make interpersonal communication with others to get desired information as quickly as possible from other areas of the country or form other countries with the use of social media without leaving their immediate environment.\n\nThe growth of technology towards the end of 20th century propelled by the emergency of the internet, satellite etc led to what is called social media. While social media on the other hand is a term in this present, world which means the encompasses of the emergency of digital, computerizsed or networked interactive information channel. It should be noted that because, also social media is a form of electronic communication which facilitates interaction based on certain interests and characteristics.\n\nSocial media are made for social interaction, using highly accessible and scalable publiching techniques. Social media use web-based technologies into social dialogue and one of such are facebook, twitter, eskimi and 2go social networking.\n\nAccording to Harvard, sophomore and work Zuckerberg (2006) facebook was actually made by hacking Harvard’s data base containing identification images of students. facebook started as a local social network made for the students. the initial idea was actually to compare the faces of students with images due to potentially damaging contents of the site, the creators decided to put it down before it caught the attention of school authorities.\n\nThe application was shut down, but the idea of creating on online community of students came to existence. The plate form was then improved and sooner than they expected, face book was released in compuses other than Harvard.\n\nTherefore, high schools were already starting to get attracted to the idea of having online communities, thus opening the website to the younger offered the opportunity to the rest of the world.\n\nAs 2007 approached, the registrants reached an overwhelming digit-roughly a million dozen. Facebook has grown to become the biggest and most popular social networking site today with a population of above 500 million active users (Facebook statistics, 2012). According to Harvard (2012) also, 2go, formally 2go travel, is a ferry company which is based in Manila, Philippines with its main hub located in eva macapagal super terminal in pier is in the manila south Harbor. Until 2012, 2go was known as Negro navigation. It changed its name following a significant realignment of ferry transportation in the phillippines which saw long-standing companies super ferry, cebu ferries and super cat first merged into super ferry, under the Aboitiz transport system and then purchased by Negros navigation.\n\nAccording to Andrew (2005) information travels over the internet through a variety of language known as ‘protocols’. The term internet is actually a short form for internet network, which implies that internet is a networks, which implies that internet is a network of computer networks.\n\nComputer accepts, data, process it, stores it and give it out when required. It became possible for people to chat from terminals which led to networking.\n\nThe worlds first commercial space communication company created by the United state congress in 1962 was the communication satellite corporation (COMSAT). In 1964, the United state government and eleven (ii) foreign nations signed a space communication pact. The partnership was known as international telecommunication satellite organization (INTELSAT). The internet known as the world’s information super high way” is a world wide inter-connected computer Network (Andrew 2015).\n\nIn the view of Paul (2010) intenet is a massive network of network”, a networking infrastructure which connects millions of computers together globally, forming a network in which any computer can communicate with each other as long as the are both connected to internet.\n\nThe internet consist of local area network (LAN), connecting computers in the same building while wide area network (WANS) connecting several LANS in different locations. It consists both private, commercial, government and academic network including a grown number of home computer.\n\nHistory of the Internet\n\nThere are conflicting versions about the origin of the internet but the common story is that the internet is a product of cold war. (Hafner and Lynon, 1996). It origin is traced back to 1957, when the soviet union launched “Sputhik1 into space, as a reaction to this in 1958, the united state founded the advanced research project agency (ARPA) , a special agency under the department of defense whose mission was to develop along term highly innovative and hazard research projects (Cartoni and Tarding, 2006). Leonard Llein rock of UCLA successfully developed the first computer network through “packet switching” to the concept to distributed network”, two fundamental science, packet switching is a process that allows division of messages into packets and sending them to their destination following different routes, once they arrive at their destination, there are all recomposed into the original message. Paul in 1960 developed the concepts of distributed network funded by United States Air force at the research and development corporation (RAND) which is aimed at developing a telecommunication network which can stand a nuclear war, Paul (1964).\n\nIn 1995, the internet was just one networking system among many others such as Usenet, Fidonet, Mintel, ATST, but with advent of the web, the internet became by far the most important networking system. That led to what is now know as internet , a global network of inter connected computer that communicate freely, share and exchange information (Paul, 2010). The younger a person, the greater the likelihood he or she has access to the internal (Kim, 2004).\n\nSocial Network\n\nEarly 1990s, chat rooms and bulletin boards were forms of social networking in a way, they help people to connect with others and share interest. A little cate, dating sites hooked those looking for partners and classmates.\n\nCommunicating allows people to connect with people they had known in high school and colleges and enable them to meet others.\n\nIn the early 20s, a site called friendster was set up where people invited their friends and their friends also invited others. The site was popular for a while, but suffered from technical difficulties and fake profiles and began to loose members.\n\nIn 1999, my space took over but became popular in 2003. its roots a bit muddy because it received financial and logistics support from another company called the E-universe and most of the early users where employers of e-universe but Tom Anderson and Chris De work       are given credit for much of the innovation and success of the site, which built up to one hundred and fifteen million users worldwide. Some television programmes had started producing programmes to air on my space in (2005)\n\nRupert Murdoclis News corporation (parent of fox broad casting) bought myspace for five hundred and eighty million dollars ($580). A competitor to myspace is facebook which started in about 2004 by Mark zuckerberg which he was a student at Harvard and grew rapidly in 2007.\n\nAt first, facebook was solely for college and tertiary institution students but mark open it to everyone and like myspace, it encourage all types of member postings. There are also smaller social networks like 2go, You-tube, and blackberry chat for people to have access top.\n\nBlackberry Messenger\n\nBlackberry is propriety internet-based instant messenger application included on blackberry devices that allows messaging between blackberry users. It was developed by the manufacture of the blackberry research in motion (RIM), messages sent via blackberry messenger sent over the internet and use the blackberry pin system, so communication is only possible between blackberry devices.\n\n2go Logo\n\n2go is a social networking site, chat, and instant messaging (IM) application. It enables users to chat on their mobile phones free.\n\nPeople can meet users and 2go users as friends chat rooms on different topics are opened where people can chat in the discussion and socialize with others and also, 2go have gateways that enable users chat with friends on Gtalk, Mxit, and facebook.\n\n1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nSince the advent of social media sites in the 1990s, it is assumed in some quarters that the academic performance of students in facing a lot of neglect and challenges. There is a deviation, distraction and diving, attention between social networking activities and their academic work. it is observe that students devote more attention to social media than they do their students.\n\nAdvance in technology in this era has reshaped all human activities on earth to include communicant. The world has become a global village as prostituted by Prof. Marshall Mcluhan where the use of computer and internet facilities in indispensable. Social media is among the numerous means which the people interact and communicate online.\n\n1.3              RESEARCH OBJECTIVES\n\ni.

        "content": "ASSESSMENT OF CAREER FULFILMENT AMONG PRACTING RADIOGRAPHERS IN SOUTH EAST NIGERIA\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1    Background of the study\n\nCareer fulfilment of radiographers has been found to be an important factor affecting productivity and has received considerable interest.\n\nThe subject of Carrier fulfilment is particularly relevant and of interest to radiographers due to the fact that organizational and employees’ health and well-being rest a great deal on Carrier fulfilment 1.This is particularly important because radiographers in a healthcare delivery system are expected to provide quality patient care while working in a highly stressful environment (Faye, 2013).\n\nThe evidence from published research points to specific determinants and correlates of Carrier fulfilment and productivity. Various studies have established that dissatisfaction with one’s job may result in higher employee turnover, absenteeism, tardiness and grievances. Improved job satisfaction resulting from Carrier fulfilment, on the other hand, results in increased productivity (Goetz et al., 2012).\n\nEvery individual has unique needs and desires that need to be satisfied, which are related to the behaviour they exhibit, and these play a significant role in their preferences in different areas such as their workplace. Social, cultural and job factors all influence employees’ behaviour (Lehman et al., 2015).\n\nOverall Carrier fulfilment is actually a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction. Intrinsic job satisfaction is when workers consider only the kind of work they do and the tasks that make up the job, while extrinsic job satisfaction is when workers considers the conditions of the work, such as but not limited to pay, co- workers, management style and communication (Blaauw et al., 2013).\n\nFrom the point of view of practicing radiographers, Carrier fulfilment may reflect benefits that people might be looking for when they take the job; these benefits are usually determined by the employer based on their strategy to be profitable and competitive in recruiting and retaining people. On the other hand job-related factors that affect satisfaction relate to employees’ desire to use their skills and abilities to make a meaningful contribution and to be valued. From an organization’s point of view, they employ people to perform specific tasks in order to achieve their business goals. When organizations finds people who fit their job requirements and are happy with what is being offered, then a win-win situation is created between the employer and the employee (Okaro et al., 2010).\n\nMany organizational scholars have shown interest in why some people report being satisfied with their jobs, while others express lower levels of job satisfaction. However, not much is known about which factors influence job satisfaction in hospital staffs. \n\nSatisfied employees tend to be more productive and committed to their jobs. In a healthcare setting, employee Carrier fulfilment has been found to be positively related to quality of service and patient satisfaction. Employees can directly influence patient satisfaction in that their involvement and interaction with patients plays a significant role in quality perception (Visser and Marais, 2012).\n\nA number of studies have looked into Carrier fulfilment in the healthcare setting and the focus was on the need to understand Carrier fulfilment of healthcare providers such as radiographers. \n\nGoblar suggested a motivation–hygiene theory where factors influencing Carrier fulfilment are separate from those that lead to job dissatisfaction. Factors leading to Carrier fulfilment, described as motivators, were promotional and personal growth opportunities, responsibility, achievement and recognition (Gronroos and Pajukari, 2010). These are factors that are intrinsically rewarding to the individual. Extrinsic factors, described as “hygiene” factors, leading to Carrier fulfilment include pay, physical working conditions, job security, company policies, quality of supervision and relationship with others (Myhren et al., 2013).\n\nFactors contributing to high levels of Carrier fulfilment have been identified as: supportive colleagues, supportive working conditions, mentally challenging work and equitable rewards.\n\n1.2    Statement of problems\n\nMany workers on a daily basis do their jobs without being satisfied. Likewise, many of them expected so much in their chosen career, but are not fulfilled therein. This does not leave radiographers out as a number of them working in both academic and clinical lines are either fulfilled or not fulfilled in their career. This is why the study was embarked on to assess career fulfilment among practicing radiographers in south east Nigeria.\n\n1.3   Objectives of study\n\nThe objectives of the study are;\n\n·        To examine Academic radiographer’s views on the different facets of their Jobs\n\n·        To examine clinical radiographer’s views on the different facets of their Jobs\n\n·        To assess the overall satisfaction among clinical and academic radiographers\n\n1.4    Research Questions\n\n·        What is the view of Academic radiographers on different facets of their Jobs\n\n·        What is the view of Clinical radiographers on different facets of their Jobs\n\n·        What is the overall satisfaction among clinical and academic radiographers\n\n1.5    Significance of the study    \n\nThe study will be useful for the governments, practicing and aspiring radiographers and researchers.\n\nIt will be of immense benefit to the government because they will have an insight into the job issues radiographers are facing.

        "content": "MASS MEDIA AND CHILDREN’S SOCIALIZATION: A STUDY OF ENUGU METROPOLIS\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY \n\nEarly childhood was also a time children become aware of television and movie characters. Throughout history, familiar characters have appealed to children from an early age. The expansion of children’s media in recent years through sources such as cable TV and video games has greatly increased the number and variety of such characters and their related toys. The mass mediaare designed to expand children’s knowledge of society and the larger world, develop creativity, encourage problem solving, roleplaying, socialization, and improve literacy and vocabulary.\n\n The entire study of mass communication was based on the assumption that the media have significant effects, yet there was little agreement on the nature and extent of these assumed effects, McQuail (2007:456). This uncertainty was more surprising since everyday experience provides countless  examples of influence. For example, we dress for the weather as forecast, buy something because of an advert, go to a film mentioned in a newspaper, react to media news, films, music etc. There are many cases of negative media publicity for instance food contamination leading to significant changes in food consumption behaviour, acts of violence or suicide appear to be copied or stimulated by media portrayals. McQuail further asserts that our minds are full of media derived 2\n\ninformation and impressions as we live in a world saturated by media sounds and images.  Few people cannot think of some personal instance of gaining significant information or of forming an opinion because of the media.\n\n According to Wimmer and Dominick (2003:394) the\n\ndevelopment of the social impact of the mass media was evident as far back as the 1920’s when many critics charged that motion pictures had a negative influence on children. In 1928 the Motion picture Research Council, with support from the Payne fund a private Philanthropic Organization sponsored a series of thirteen studies on the movies’ influence on children. After examination of film content, information gain, attitude change and influence on behaviour, it was concluded that the movies were potent sources of information, attitudes and behaviour for children.\n\n In the early 1950’s another medium, the comic book was\n\nchastised for it’s alleged harmful effects. John Klapper (1960) cited in Wimmer and Domnick (2003:394) summarized what was known about the social impact of mass communication. In contrast to many researchers, Klapper downplayed the potential harmful effects of the media. He concluded that the media most often reinforced an individual’s existing attitudes and  predispositions.  In the late 1950’s and early 1960’s concern over the antisocial impact of the media shifted to television. Experiments on college campuses by Bandura and Berkowitz in Comstock and Paik  3\n\n(1991:97) showed that aggressive behaviour could be learned by viewing violent media content and that a stimulation effect was more probable than a cathartic effect. Subcommittees examined possible links between viewing violence on television and juvenile delinquency and in 1965 one subcommittee concluded that televised crime and violence were related to antisocial behaviours among juvenile viewers.\n\n The early 1970’s saw extensive research on the social effects of the mass media. Three years after the publication of the Eisenhower Commission report came the release of a multi-volume report sponsored by the Surgeon General’s Scientific Advisory committee on television and social Behaviour. The committee summarized it’s research evidence:\n\nThere is a convergence of fairly substantial evidence on short run causation of aggression among children by viewing violence and the much less certain evidence from field studies that violence viewing precedes some long-run manifestation of aggressive behaviour. Wimmer and Dominick (2003:394)\n\nThe committee tempered this conclusion by noting that any sequence by which viewing television violence causes aggressive behaviour is most likely applicable only to some children who are predisposed in that direction.\n\nGamson and Modigliani (1989) cited in McQuail (2007:461) work on media texts, audiences and also media organizations in the late\n\n1970’s brought about a new approach to media effect which can\n\n 4\n\nbest be termed “social constructivist”. This involves a view of media as having their most significant effects by constructing meanings. \n\n In today’s society, mass mediaare thoroughly integrated into the fabric of life with television, movies, video, music, videogames central to both work and play.  Recent studies indicate that young children in Nigeria and in Enugu which is the limited area of this work use a wide variety of screen media. The media are increasingly part of children’s environment as television programmes are being made for infants, toddlers and teenagers.  \n\n On the positive bide of the ledger, there is evidence that thoughtfully designed TV used at the appropriate developmental stage can be educational. At the same time, the mass mediacan contribute to aggressive behaviour, anxiety and obesity in children. \n\n The mass mediaplays important role in socialization through learning which it does by providing important sources of information. It also plays an important role in the transmission of attitudes, perception and beliefs. \n\nDominick (2002:484) highlights specifically that television was an influential force when the following factors are operative:   \n\ni.             The same ideas, people or behaviours recur consistently from programme to programme and are presented in a stereotyped manner. \n\nii.           A child was heavily exposed to TV content\n\n5\n\niii.          A child has limited interaction with  parents and other socializing agents and lacks an alternative set of beliefs to serve as a standard against which to assess media portrayals.\n\nThe need to develop scientifically based practical answers to important questions about media effects on the physical, mental and social health of children was now greater than ever.\n\n1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM \n\n  The mass mediaair programmes for children’s consumption to fulfill their social responsibility theory. The mass mediapose a problem of showing tricks and exaggeration which creates a false impression on the minds of the young ones. They do not enable children to make concrete decisions for themselves concerning their academics, total well being and future because what they get from the mass mediausually leads them to confusion and despair. \n\nThis work also looked at why the mass mediaatimes warrants children’s   unfriendly and friendly behaviour towards their friends, siblings and people around them.\n\nIt also finds out if a child’s academic performance is being affected too when exposed to the electronic media.   \n\n1.3    OBJECTIVE/PURPOSE OF THE STUDY \n\n          This work finds out the following:\n\n1.   To find out if the mass mediaaffects the socialization process of children residing in Enugu. \n\n2.   To ascertain whether children in Enugu metropolis derive gratification from exposure to the electronic media.\n\n3.   To find out if the media serve as a good agent of socialization.\n\n4.   To find out why different children who are exposed to the mass mediado not receive the same measure of effect.\n\n5.   To ascertain whether children’s preference over a particular thing was as a result of exposure to the electronic media.\n\n1.4  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\n    The problem which the mass mediaposes affects\n\nvirtually every child directly or indirectly, so the significance of this work cannot be ignored in that it will help the mass mediapractitioners know the extent of the effects of their programme content on the social development of a child.   \n\nThis work was to advance the frontier of knowledge in the field of mass communication as well as serve as a repository of knowledge and also contribute to available literature in the field of mass communication. Issues pertaining to media effects on children have become a serious matter which demands attention by all and so this work serves as a reference material, to interpret and recommend appropriate actions.\n\n1.5  RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n The following research questions were formulated to  guide the study:-\n\n1.    Does the mass mediahave any influence on the lives of children?\n\n2.    To what extent was this influence?\n\n3.    How helpful was the mass mediain the socialization process of a child?\n\nTo what extent has this help been?",

This wisdom has become intuitively logical because the traditional forms of communication are innate to Third World societies and, therefore, better suited for the dissemination of culture-centred development information to people at the grassroots. However, while the intrinsic nature of the indigenous forms of communication endows them with \"a high degree of credibility and acceptance by the people\" (Ranganath, 1977; Adhikarya, 1974), the attitude of Third World peoples toward the modern mass media are not yet clear.\n\nThis study explores Nigerians Attitude toward the role of mass media (i.e. radio, television and newspapers) in enthronement of democracy in Nigeria.

They still flourish in the previous delusion and dogmatic belief that cannot contemporaries in the urban setting.\n\n        The press here are faced with the obligation of battering the lives of rural communities through the packaging of information on how to do something which their in exposure hinders them from acquiring basic knowledge. Educating them through programmes, which can sharpen their intellect, providing job opportunities forever increasing population explosion in the rural set up and re orientation of our rural dwellers through sensitization enlightenment, mobilization, emancipation and motivation.\n\n        Rural development of any kind in any place can only be meaningfully achieved through a well – planned and executed complex interaction of many economic and non economic variables. The major role of press (Enugu state media) is usually to highlight and examine problem and issue that need to be understood and tackled to achieve rural development or improve the quality of life for the rural dwellers. The Enugu state media should also help to maintain the much needed regular two way communications between the poor or marginalized rural dwellers and the urban cities especially the government or those who hold political power.\n\n        It is no longer contestable that when media is properly approved, communication can work together with a nexus of other social variables to facilitate social charge that include rural development experts or practitioners in Africa, Asia, Latin America and other developing areas have long been engaged in the search for method approaches, device, techniques and of course strategies which help them to put communication to the fullest and most effectively use in achieving their various development objectives.\n\n        The crucial area that engaged the attention of these experts in the area of preparing the necessary and tantamount information, education and communication materials that can be usually utilized for the effective application of communication in rural development.\n\n        Enugu state media’s news, features and so on have so long be recognized as efficacious packages for rural development especially when they are well prepared and the press writers should know how to prepare them. The press should focus more specially on how we can better develop and use rural (RADIO) for development and for the mobilization of the much neglected and discard rural dwellers in the primitive and interior part of Enugu state.\n\n        We are convince that it will be quite unreasonable for us to expect to achieve any meaningful, realistic and actualized rural development in this Mgbidi communities without careful and systematic mobilization and participation of the rural dwellers, which of course can be achieved through the press using the Enugu state media as a case of study.\n\n1.2    PROBLEM STATEMENT\n\n        In stating the problem statement of this role of press in mgbidi, using Enugu state media as a case of study, we observe very unfortunately that many problems exist.\n\n        However, in a case of many change agents, rural development officers, public relations officers, information officers and other officers that are involved in preparing news, or officials and features for mgbidi dwellers are participant in rural development project, do not do them well enough to achieve the required and desired result.\n\n        Besides, the problem is ignorance, but most of the time the problem is either lack of insufficient orientation or sensitization of those officers to the special philosophies, needs, techniques and approaches for preparing news, articles and features towards achieving rural development objectives.\n\n        Furthermore, the other problems of the role of press is achieving its aim in rural development mgbidi is because of the high illiterates factors among the rural dwellers and the problems of overcoming geographical and language barriers.\n\n        Again, the rural dwellers major weakness to develop arises from two – readership due to the low literacy rate of the rural targeted audience of course, the rural dwellers inability to read and understand the rural newspapers has cautioned not to allowed them develop spite of the role of press in Enugu state.\n\n1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe objective of this research is to find out the means through which press can develop the rural dwellers in the communities in Enugu state, using Mgbidi media as a case study.\n\n        Therefore, press should indulge in its traditional communication style through which it must, for instance be preceded by an extensive research effort that will, among many other things, identifying the information of the rural dwellers, their social – cultural economic characteristics, literacy level, historical religion biases and readership patterns.\n\n        More so, the press of the rural dwellers must also be preceded by the formulation of a clan cut, additional policy that is dominantly guided by a sound ruralist philosophy with a broad look.\n\n        Meanwhile, for the press to achieve its objective of the developing the rural communities, it is good that it adopt what is called ruralism concentric circle philosophy (RCCP).\n\n        This is a journalistic model that stresses, among other things the problem of a rural community ideas, balanced and development cultural integrity, self reliance conscrenfigetion, unity and generally improved quality of life for the rural dwellers in Enugu state.\n\n        Additionally, in objective of this study is evaluated for how far the press, Enugu state media have gone to maintaining lesson communication between the rural communities and the state govt.\n\n1.4    SIGNIFICATION OF THE STUDY\n\nThe significant of this research is to provide a reliable panacea through which the press, Enugu state media should ensure in alleviating about 80% rural dwellers that have been seriously neglected in the government affairs.\n\nThe project will also be very important to the researcher’s academics and also to Enugu state Broadcasting service and rural dwellers.\n\nIt will be helpful guiding the press in retting connecting such issues as health, agriculture, education, culture, family planning, government, transportation and religion.\n\n1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\nDo the Mgbidi people gone to ESBS Radio?\n\nDo the ESBS radio relay broadcast programme as it touches Mgbidi people?\n\nDo the ESBS radio rural development programmes mobilize the Mgbidi people?\n\nDid Mgbidi community developed based on the roles of the ESBS radio rural programmes?\n\nDo Mgbidi community developed based on the roles of the ESBS radio rural programmes?\n\n1.6    RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS\n\nH1:  Mgbidi people tune to ESBS radio?\n\nH2:  ESBS radio relay rural broadcast programme that affect Mgbidi community.\n\nH3:  ESBS radio development programmes mobilized Mgbidi people for development.\n\nH4:  Mgbidi community had witnessed development due to the ESBS radio rural programme conceptual and operational plead.\n\n1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nPRESS;      it includes the print and electric media tools such as the radio, newspapers, television, magazine and periodical usually done by the journalist.\n\nDEVELOPMENT;  it means developing or being developed. The process of encouraging new mentions and industries to create jobs and jobs for the people.\n\nCASE; it means the instance or example of occurrence of something. The actual state of occurrence of situation.\n\nSTUDY;      process of gaining knowledge of a subject a subject that needs investigation.\n\nMEDIA;      the means of communication such as television, newspaper, magazine and radio.\n\n1.8    LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\nThis research certainly has some limitation or handicaps due its nature. It is not likely that I can cover the scope of the study because of time factor; I limit my work to Enugu state media which is star printing and publishing company and Enugu state Broadcasting service (ESBS) and also among the dwellers at Anike village and Ezinaise town and Enugu state. There are encounters in this cause of carrying out the work.",

        "content": "LISTENER’S ASSESSMENT ON AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMMES ON RURAL AREA BASED RADIO\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1     BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY\n\nThe success of agricultural development programmes in developing countries largely depends on the nature and extent of use of mass media in mobilizing farmers who live mostly in rural areas for the need for development. Communication has been acknowledged for playing, a prominent role in the success of agricultural production and adoption of innovations through programmes aired. The planners in developing countries realized that the development of agriculture could be hastened with the effective use of mass media (GCRA, 2003). Mass media has been defined as any material, objects, instruments or system which serves to communicate information including letters, pamphlets, and other written and printed materials, all types of cinema films, radio, television and video system (Adams, 1982).\n\nSeveral channels such as the extension agent, individuals, farmers-to-farmers contact, print media (news papers, magazines, news letter, pamphlet and posters) and electronics media (Radio, television, and film schedules and films trips) have been widely used to disseminate information to farmers in rural area (Van & Hawkins, 1992; Olowu & Oyedokun, 2000).\n\nAmong the mass media means of communication, radio is found to be the most important means of communicating agricultural information to the rural farmers. In the opinion of (Kuponiyi, 2000), radio is one of the broadcast medium which the rural populations are very familiar with and which almost all experts identified to be the most appropriate for rural emancipation programme. This is because radio beats distance and has immediate effect on farmers. Furthermore, radio is favored as a medium of communication in rural communities because of the advantages ascribed to it, inform of transcending the barrier of illiteracy and demanding less intellectual exertion than the print media massages (Folarin, 1990).\n\nAbsence of a functional agricultural information delivery system is a major constraint to agricultural development in Nigeria. Aina, (1989) identified non-provision of necessary agricultural information as a key factor limiting agricultural development in Nigeria. According to Youdeowei (1995), lack of access to relevant agricultural information by farmers in developing countries cuts across all subsectors of agriculture and different stages of agricultural production process.\n\nFarmers need to be informed and educated about improved agricultural practices to enable them increase their productivity and income. Radio is one broadcast medium which almost all experts identify to be the most appropriate for rural emancipation programme. This is because a radio set is cheap to obtain and is widely owned in the rural areas. This is made possible by the advent of the battery-operated transistorized sets.\n\nThe terms rural radio have come to be used to describe FM stations established to broadcast to a local and predominantly rural audience. The growth of rural radio stations over the past few decades reflects both the improvements in information technologies and the shifting development paradigm towards a more participatory style of information and knowledge transfer.\n\nRural area based radio is the focus of this study because the predominantly agricultural audiences of these stations can benefit from information to improve their livelihoods. Radio initiatives as part of broader communication for development strategies have been used by international organizations such as the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations since the late 1960s.\n\nRadio stations set up in rural areas have a predominantly agricultural clientele. Whether those who run them are pursuing the development objectives of the station’s funder or simply aiming to entertain, they are aware that agricultural issues are very high on their listeners’ priorities. However, agricultural extension systems have only shifted to more participatory approaches relatively recently and so much of their early efforts used the top-down technical scientific information approach which tended to ignore the diversity of both local agricultural problems and the farmers’ existing knowledge and skills. Other social development sectors, such as health and education, have been more effective, using rural radio to communicate messages to a target community or a specific demographic group. In many areas radio stations have become highly valued for interacting with specific disadvantaged groups and for handling complex social problems.\n\nThe Independent Television/Radio, Benin City, Edo state owned by Sir Chief G.O. Igbinedion was inaugurated by the Oba of Benin, Omo ‘N’ Oba Nedo, Uku Akpolokpolo Oba Erediawa on Saturday 7th November 1998 urging the Station’s operators to carry out their objectives with the same zeal for the running of Independent Television which was founded a year earlier and has demonstrated excellence. There has been the acquisition of State of the Art digital ultra high-tech virtual studios equipment including high definition cameras, teleprompters, virtual studio components, complete digital studio lightening systems and digital sound console. The station is located at Iguosa, an outskirt of Benin where rural farmers can easily receive clear signals of Independent Television/radio.\n\n1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe reason behind airing any agricultural programme by any mass media means is to sensitize and educate farmers about improved agricultural practice needed to be adopted. This implies that radio agricultural programmes are an effective tool in creating awareness on improved agricultural programmes among farmers. Rural radio broadcasting when skillfully used has proved to be the most effective medium of communication, which is essential for developing societies. Radio is also the most highly used media in accessing development and agricultural information. The listeners of agricultural programmes are supposed to make use of various improved practices they gained knowledge of and they found the program aired as very useful to their agricultural practices.\n\nDespite the fact that many researches were conducted on the importance of radio agricultural programmes on listeners in the rural area, no such study was conducted and documented in the study area. This may limits the listener’s assessment of improved agricultural technology and hence affects their level of production. This allowed a huge gap that tends to limit farmers awareness on the relevance and efficiency of radio as source of information for improving their agricultural activities. Based on the above, it is therefore, imperative to examine the listener’s assessment on agricultural programmes on rural area based radio.\n\n1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the objectives of this study:\n\nTo examine the level of listeners/farmer’s usage and reactions on agricultural programmes on rural area based radio.\n\nTo determine the perception of listeners benefits of rural agricultural programmes aired on Independent Television/radio on the listeners.\n\nTo examine the opinion of the listeners on the quality of agricultural programmes of Independent Television/radio in Edo State.\n\n1.4     RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\nWhat is the level of listeners/farmer’s usage and reactions on agricultural programmes on rural area based radio?\n\nWhat is the perception of listeners benefits of rural agricultural programmes aired on Independent Television/radio on the listeners?\n\nWhat is the opinion of the listeners on the quality of agricultural programmes of Independent Television/radio in Edo State?\n\n1.5     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the significance of this study:\n\nBased on the importance of knowledge through agricultural programmes aired on rural radio to the development of agriculture in the Nigeria, the results from this study will form a useful guide for policy makers in sponsoring many other useful agricultural programs. It will also educate the general public on the benefits of listening to agricultural programmes on rural radio. This research will be a contribution to the body of literature in the area of the listener’s assessment on agricultural programmes on rural area based radio, thereby constituting the empirical literature for future research in the subject area.\n\n1.6     SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study is limited to public listeners of Independent Television/radio agricultural programmes living in Benin and rural environment. It will also cover the opinion of the listeners on the quality of the agricultural programmes aired in Independent Television/radio.\n\nLIMITATION OF STUDY\n\nFinancial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).\n\n Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work. This consequently will cut down on the time devoted for the research work.\n\n1.7     DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nRadio: the transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves of radio frequency, especially those carrying sound messages.\n\nAgricultural programmes: educative and informative piece aired on radio to boost the knowledge of farmers in their techniques\n\nMass media: any of the means of communication, as radio, television or newspapers that reach very large numbers of people\n\nRural area: Sparsely populated area outside of the limits of a city or town or a designated commercial, industrial, or residential center. Rural areas are characterized by farms, vegetation, and open spaces.\n\nDevelopment: the process in which someone or something grows or changes and becomes more advanced",

This wisdom has become intuitively logical because the traditional forms of communication are innate to Third World societies and, therefore, better suited for the dissemination of culture-centred development information to people at the grassroots. However, while the intrinsic nature of the indigenous forms of communication endows them with \"a high degree of credibility and acceptance by the people\" (Ranganath, 1977; Adhikarya, 1974), the attitude of Third World peoples toward the modern mass media are not yet clear.\n\nThis study explores Nigerians Attitude toward the role of mass media (i.e. radio, television and newspapers) in enthronement of democracy in Nigeria. Specifically, the study addresses some questions, these questions are necessary to discern what value people at the grassroots place on the mass media in Nigeria. Such knowledge will be crucial to the efforts by development support communicators to receive maximum influence from communication resources at the project level of development planning.\n\n1.2 Statement of the Problem\n\nThe problem that leads to the study of Nigerians Attitude toward the role of Mass media in the enthronement of Democracy since 1999 can be perceived from the rapid change in the constitution and laws that guide the activities of the media in the country. In the view of some individual, mass media as not been able to meet up with there role of upholding democracy in the country. However this is\n\n2\n\nnot so in the view of others, many people believe that the mass media as not be empower to carry out their function of gakekeeping in the Nigeria economy.\n\nThis study will emphasis the attitude of people towards the activity of mass media in protecting and upholding democracy.\n\n1.3 Objective of the Study\n\nThis research work seeks to examine the attitude of Nigerian to the role of mass media in enthronement of democracy since 1999.\n\nThis paper examines the role the media have played and continue to play in the socio-political and socio-economic reengineering of structures in a country faced with enormous problems which militate against its optimal performance as an emergent democracy. This study will seek to know the impact of mass media on enthronement of democracy and analysis the attitude of Nigerian to the this role of mass media\n\nResearch Questions\n\nDoes mass media play any role in a democratic setting?\n\n(ii)To what extent has mass media promoted democracy in Nigeria?\n\nTo what extent do Nigeria value the role of mass media in the democratic setting?\n\nDoes mass media contribute to the political development of Nigeria?\n\n1.5 Significance to the Study\n\nThis study help us to access the power of mass media in influencing and bringing about attitudinal changes in people, especially to win support a candidate during election and to promote the enthronement of democracy in the country. It will also help political analyst and campaign managers to know the\n\n3\n\nbeset type of media to reach out to people during election as they fashion their campaign programmes to get maximum support and acceptance.\n\n1.6 Scope of the Study\n\nThe scope of this study is limited to the Nigeria Mass media. This study focuses on the role of mass media in the Nigeria Democracy since 1999. The concepts defined in this project work are mainly related to the Nigeria media. However the concepts may be well applicable to the media of other African country and the world at large.\n\n1.7 Limitation of the Study\n\nThe following are the limitation that hinders the study of this research work;\n\nFinancial Constraint: There are not enough funds to fuel the study of this research work.

        "content": "RELEVANCE OF ORAMEDIA IN THE PREVENTION OF MEASLES A STUDY OF BATEREN COMMUNITY, WARRI, DELTA STATE\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 Background to the study\n\nSince the existence of humans, various systems of communication have been used for the dissemination of information in the society. For instance, in rural areas the oramedia platforms of communication have remain significant for disseminating information, knowledge, and for mobilising rural dwellers concerning issues and events that threaten their social existence. Temofeh (2016) argues that oramedia predates the use of modern mass communication channels, as the oramedia was used to spread information to the receiver without involving mass media channels. A major proponent and father of oramedia, Ugboajah (1985, 1987) pointed out that oramedia platforms include; songs, dance, dramas, drumming, storytelling and proverbs. According Ugboajah (1985) the term “oramedia” is used interchangeably with folk media, traditional media or ora arts.\n\nTemofeh (2016) observes that oramedia platforms of communication are indigenous channels of communication that are easily identified by group of people with common culture.  Itari, Beshel and Okeme (2015) argues that oramedia which are known as indigenous media channels of communication because they are peculiar to people’s culture and ways of life. \n\nDespite the evolution of modern channels of communication in the 21st century, oramedia continue to play indispensable roles in the promotion of enlightenment campaigns on issues and activities that affect members of the society. The significance of oramedia of communication cut across various aspect of human endeavours: economics, politics, health and education, especially in the rural areas where access to modern communication platforms is nearly non-existent. Asemah (2011) argues that oramedia, also known as the traditional media of communication have stood the test of time mainly in developing countries like Nigeria, where access to modern communication platforms is still largely an urban affair.\n\nAnaeto and Solo-Anaeto (2010) aver that in rural areas, there is preference in the use of oramedia in disseminating information because of several factors. These include, illiteracy among rural dwellers. In emerging economies like Nigeria, illiteracy is still prevalent especially in rural areas. Since the modern media platforms of communication require certain levels of literacy for it usage, oramedia becomes the effective channels for communication since messages disseminated through these platforms required no level of literacy on the part of the receivers.\n\nThe unavailability of power supply is another factor which makes oramedia a preferred choices in rural areas. This is because, most rural areas in Nigeria are either yet to be connected to the national power grid or still have a fair share of the unstable power supply which is common both in rural and urban centers (Anaeto and Solo-Anaeto, 2010). \n\nOramedia platforms of communication include the various communication platforms through which information are spread through words of mouth.  Watson and Hill (2012) aver that oramedia are the various channels of exchanging information and meanings mainly through the words of mouth. The use of pictures to communicate meanings and information complement the use of these media platforms for disseminating information. Asemah (2011) argues that the use of oramedia is effective in disseminating information among rural dwellers, particularly in rural settings where literacy required for reading and writing is relatively low.\n\nOramedia refer to the traditional media of communication which predate modern mass media channels. Ndolo (2006) cited in Asemah (2011) observes that the growth, existence and continuity of any society largely depend on among other things, a system of communication through which members of the society could engage in communication (exchanges of ideas and feelings). The argument proves that despite the invention, advancement and use of modern communication platforms, oramedia of communication remain significant communication tools in places where access to modern communication remains grim.  \n\nAs society evolve the need to attain societal goals, requires a system of communication regardless of its sophistication. Societal goals will continue to remain unrealistic where there is absence of any means or structure for carrying out communication. Therefore, oramedia of communication serve as important tools in achieving the objectives of the society. Sambe (2008) argues that since without communication the human society cannot exist, humans have continued to seek for any available structure of communication since creation, to enable them realise the potentials of the society. This proves why oramedia of communication continued to serve as relevant tools for spreading information, ideas and meanings especially among rural dwellers.  \n\n Asemah (2011) opines that in some parts of Nigeria, rural dwellers still rely on information disseminated through the oramedia platforms. Inhabitants of rural areas easily trust in oramedia platforms which they can easily identify with compared to the modern or contemporary media platforms. Such rural dwellers easily identify with the oramedia which they considered as part of their culture. Among such rural dwellers, oramedia are relevant in promoting meaningful and tremendous social changes in the society. These forms of communication promote communication and dissemination of information that are relevant to the society. In preventing the spread of epidemic such as measles, the use of oramedia to distribute information, messages and ideas may prove to be effective means of promoting enlightenment campaigns on prevention of the epidemic especially in rural areas.\n\nOramedia could be used effectively in carrying out enlightenment campaigns among rural women who are custodian of culture and continue to hold on to traditional belief systems and practices relating to health problems such as measles which could easily be prevented. Ivieh (2015) notes that oramedia could be useful in educating women on ways of preventing epidemic such as measles while disseminating messages on the prevention of the disease. It is against this background that this study seeks to examine the relevance of oramedia in the enlightenment of rural women on the prevention of measles particularly as it relates to disseminating information on the prevention of the disease among dwellers in Bateren community in Warri South Local Government Area of Delta state.\n\n1.2 Statement of Problem\n\n            It seems that the indigenes of Bateran community in Warri South Local Government Area of Delta State are not fully aware that the spread of measles could be easily prevented. It is also likely that oramedia platforms has not been fully used in carrying out enlightenment on the prevention of the epidemic in the community. This is because, oramedia channels of communication appear to be effective channels for promoting awareness campaigns on the prevention of measles, especially in rural areas where the spread of the epidemic has continued to threaten human lives and wellbeing.\n\nIn promoting healthy social living in rural areas, oramedia of communication also seem to play vital role in communicating information on the prevention of measles. Oramedia could be deploy in carrying out enlightenment to educate, inform and sensitize members of the community on how to prevent the spread of measles while ensuring healthy living in the society.\n\nIn Bateren community, low level of awareness on the prevention of measles and traditional beliefs among members of the community, may also account for the spread of measles in the community. Engaging in behaviours that expose the entire community to measles is likely to also account for the spread of the disease in the community. It is against this background that this study seeks to examine the relevance of oramedia in promoting enlightenment on the prevention of measles among women of Bateren community.\n\n1.3 Objectives of the Study\n\n            This study will focus on achieving the following:\n\n1. To ascertain if oramedia platform are used for promoting awareness on the prevention of measles in Bateren community.\n\n2. To determine the roles played by oramedia in the promotion of awareness on the prevention of measles in Bateren community.\n\n3. To ascertain the challenges affecting the effective use of oramedia in promoting awareness on the prevention of measles in Bateren community.\n\n4. To ascertain the people’s perception of the use of oramedia in Bateren community, Delta state.\n\n1.4 Research Questions\n\n            The following research questions which will provide answers to the problems been investigated by this study:\n\n1. What oramedia platforms are used for promoting awareness on the prevention of measles in Bateren community?\n\n2. What roles do oramedia platforms play in the promotion of awareness on the prevention of measles in Bateren community?\n\n3. What are the challenges affecting the use of oramedia in promoting awareness on the prevention of measles in Bateren community?\n\n4. What are the people’s perception the use of oramedia in Bateren community, Delta state?\n\n1.5 Significance of Study\n\n            This study aims at contributing to knowledge on the relevance of oramedia in promoting awareness on health issues that affects Bateren community. This will highlight the importance of oramedia as channels of communication capable of addressing social issues confronting Bateren community and instilling in the larger society values and attitudes that would assist them lead safer and better lives as members of the Bateren community.\n\n            It would highlight the importance of oramedia platforms in distributing information concerning issues which pose threats to the survival and sustenance of Bateren community, despite the growth and ongoing transformation of communication platforms in the twenty-first century where communication platforms continue to transform massively and become highly sophisticated.\n\nThe study will also reveal the lapses of social institutions of government, non-government agencies and the public in making efforts in promoting the\ndissemination\nof information on the prevention of epidemics such as measles in developing countries like Nigeria. It will also reveal efforts of social institutions such as international donor agencies and organisations such as World Health Organisation (WHO), in promoting awareness capable of spreading information on the prevention of epidemics in rural areas where epidemics remain common among the inhabitants.\n\n            Also, the study would be of immense value to researchers and students in the field of communication and those interested in carrying out related studies in the future, on the relevance of oramedia channels of communication in promoting awareness on health issues as it relates to human lives in the society.\n\n1.6 Scope of the Study\n\n            Due to the limited time frame and resources available for this study, the scope of the research work was limited to the use of oramedia channels in Bateren community in Warri South Local Government Area of Delta State, especially as it affects the use of the oramedia platforms of communication for promoting awareness on the prevention of measles. In addition, the scope of the study was limited to women in Bateren community. This will enable the researcher to derive data for the study and limit the scope of the research to a manageable limit. The study will sample women in Bateren community as they are directly involved in seeking solutions for the treatment of measles.\n\n1.7 Operational Definition of Terms\n\nEnlightenment: Enlightenment refers to the role of the oramedia platforms as channels of promoting knowledge or understanding concerning issues affecting members of the society.\n\nEpidemic: An epidemic is the rapid spread of infectious disease to many people in a within a defined geographical location and within a short period of time, usually two weeks or less.\n\nHealth Communication: Health communication refers to communication activities involving the use of mass media channels to disseminate promotional health related information such as public health campaigns, health education in the society.\n\nMeasles: Measles is an infectious disease which causes fever and a red rash on the skin. It mainly affects children but can occur at any age. Measles is a viral infection of the respiratory system. Measles is a very contagious disease that can spread through contact with infected mucus and it is recorded that Nigeria still tops the chart of country where many children are not immunized as preventative measures against the disease.\n\nOramedia: Oramedia refers to various traditional means or channels of communication used for spreading information especially in remote areas where access to modern communication channels is inadequate.\n\nPromotion: This concept refers to the role of the oramedia channels of communication in disseminating information to members of the society, and capable of educating, sensitizing, advocating,\npopularizing\nthe need to support efforts aimed at developing the society for the benefits of the members of the society.\n\nRural Area: This refers to remote geographical area that is located outside towns and cities.\n\nRelevance: This refers to the outcomes, consequences or usefulness in using oramedia platforms of communication in the society particularly as it relates to dissemination of information on the prevention of measles through these platforms.\n\nSociety: This refers to a historically developing whole for the sake enlightening practical consciousness, building a collective political will and national guiding practice. It is also a system of self-preservation, a relatively independent self-perpetuating human group, which occupies geographical territory and has association with other groups.\n\n1.8 Theoretical Framework\n\nUses and Gratification Theory\n\nThe uses and gratification communication theory provide explanation on how the audience of media channels chooses the kind of medium and contents that they will expose themselves to. This choice is usually based on certain benefits or rewards they feel their choice would give them. The theory was developed in 1970 by Elihu Katz and Paul Lazarsfeld. \n\nBaran and Davies (2009) argues that the thrust of the theory is aimed at challenging and changing the dominant thought of communication research from ‘How the Media Affect People?’ to ‘What People do with the Media?’ The basic thrusts of the uses and gratification theory are; examining the rationale behind the preference of media audience to a medium and what benefits they (the audience) derive from such choice(s) or preference. The theory also focuses attention on why do people use the media, the way they do and what are people looking for or benefits they are expected to get from their use of the media? In other words, the theory seeks to answer the question: why are people becoming active audience or users of the media? And, are people satisfied with the active use of the media?\n\n            According to Baran and Davies, (2009) the goal of the theory, which became popular during the 1960s and 1970s when television viewing was expanding, was to gain more useful understanding of what people were doing with the media in their day-to-day living, i.e., examining; what people were doing when they use the media? Are the media audience passive consumers of media contents or are the media contents serving much important purposes to them? Are the audiences just passive or active in their use of the media? Do they get the expected gratification they seek from their choice of the media and media contents?\n\n            Popoola (2010) outlined the assumptions and prepositions of the uses and gratification theory to include; the mass media audiences are active, the audiences freely select the media and the content that they can best use to gratify their needs, the media are not only the source where the audience seek gratification, the audience members are or can be made aware of their interest and motives in certain cases and the mass media has no effect in determining the use and gratification of its audience.\n\n The theory also postulates that the free choice of the media audiences to using the media and its content arise from the fact that the media is not the only source that provide certain gratification or benefits or need satisfaction to the audience. The media as a source of providing satisfaction or gratification to the audiences compete with other sources of need satisfactions away from the use of the media. In their free choice of the use of the media or media content, the uses and gratification theorists assumed that the media audiences in certain moment are conscious of their motives in the use of the media or its content, while at other time the media make them to be conscious of their interest and motives for the use of the media or its contents.\n\nKate, Guretitich and Haas (1973) cited in Emenyeonu (2014, p.64) described the uses and gratification theory as an approach to the study of the media behaviour of individuals who are audiences of the mass media. This suggests that the media audiences often bend their media exposure to their needs rather than have the media over power them.  The media audiences in the uses and gratification theory use the media not only out of their free choice but out of their value judgments of the media and not from the cultural significance of the media to them.\n\nMcQuail (2010) observes that the needs which media audiences seek from their uses of the mass media and media contents are the needs for information, relaxation, companionship, diversion or escape. These needs that media audiences seek from their uses of the media can also be refer to as motives for the use of the media.\n\nTherefore, the uses and gratification theory to a large extent provides basis in understanding the preference of rural dwellers in the use of oramedia for carrying out enlightenment campaign.  This points to the fact rural dwellers who are the target audience of the Oramedia channels are likely to choose the oramedia as their sources of getting information. The choice and preference most often may be what expected benefits they feel such action would grant or benefit them. The expected benefits the rural dwellers are likely to gain from choosing the oramedia as their sources of information may be that oramedia channels have proven to be channels of communication that are considered credible as sources of information.\n\nThe theory also provides basis to understanding that oramedia channels of communication serve as sources of need gratification for rural dwellers who develop interest in sourcing their information from the traditional media channels which compete with other sources of need satisfaction. Other reasons for the use of oramedia for carrying out enlightenment campaigns in rural areas may be because they are media channels that are indigenous which the people could easily identified. Therefore, oramedia channels meet the need gratification of the rural dwellers.\n\nDevelopment Media Theory\n\n                        The thrust of the development media theory stipulates that concern for the society, the media channels of communication are deployed in communicating development related issues that affect the society. Asemah (2011) observes that the development media theory holds the assumptions that in communicating development related issues, the communication media become useful in spreading information on issues that affect members of the society. The theory according to Asemah was propounded by McQuail in 1987.\n\n            McQuail (2010) argues that the development media theory speculates that in communicating information on issues relating development, media channels should be in the forefront or vanguard, which will determine the pace of development in the society. In other words, the pace of development to a large extent is determined basically by on how the communication media channels are deployed in communicating information that can advance the development of the society and quite significantly, it is also determined by the extent to which the media channels are used in communicating development related issues.\n\n            McQuail (2010) cited in Wogu (2008) avers that the theory has the following principal tenets:\n\n·         Communication media channel should be used in accomplishing development tasks in line with nationally established policy.\n\n·         Freedom of the communication media channels should be open to restriction according to:\n\n(i) Economic priorities and (ii) Development needs of society.\n\n·         Media channels should give priority in disseminating news and information to on development is being achieved in countries which are close geographically.\n\n·         In the interest of development, the society has right to intervene or restrict media operations, and devices of censorship, subsidy and direct control can be justified.\n\n·         Communication experts and professionals have responsibilities and freedoms in their information gathering and dissemination tasks.\n\n              The theory was adopted as the thematic framework for this study to explain how oramedia channels of communication are useful in spreading and communicating information that are capable of fostering health development in rural areas. Since the spread of killer diseases are common in rural areas and impede the social development of the areas, the use of oramedia channels of communication become necessary in spreading information that will assist people in rural areas to be better inform on how to prevent the spread of epidemics that threatens the well-being of children. \n\nREFERENCES\n\nAnaeto, S.

        "content": "COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT IN NIGERIA AND CHALLENGES IN A DIGITAL WORLD\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n1.1   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY \n\nIt is a known fact that the greatest heritage of a nation remains the creativity of its citizens, and therefore one of the primary functions of law enforcement agents and other appropriate authorities is to protect the ingenuity, resourcefulness and innovation of the citizenry. However, Nigeria has joined the league of nations that have enacted domestic legislations to protect the copyrights and creativity of its citizens against any undue infringement. The principal legislation in this regard is the Nigerian Copyright Act, which is hinged on the fact that any copyright infringement is stealing (Thomson, 2009). Since the beginning of the 20th century, the world has continued to experience astronomical advancement in scientific and technological innovations which have changed the face of modern society, leading many thinkers to term this present civilization ‘the jet age’ (Ajirere, 2008). This technological advancement has had enormous impact on the world’s copyright enforcement authorities and the legal systems in general, disrupting traditional modes of protection of intellectual property, and has left the law completely in a state of flux, literally gasping to catch pace with the ever changing forms of innovations (Ethan, 1992). In Nigeria, the life of every average citizen now revolves around one or more of these technologies, such as computers including palmtops and hi-tech phones, satellite and cable receivers/signals, facsimile transmissions and the perpetually growing internet (Ayemi, 2010). Over the years, since the country achieved independence, Nigeria has benefited immensely from the magnanimity of copyright related products. Section 1(1) of the Copyright Act provides protection and confers copyright status on the following innovative products: literary works, musical works, artistic works, cinematograph films, sound recordings, and broadcasts. The spectrum of these products implicitly covers digital innovations like computer software, satellite and cable broadcasts, and reprographic transmissions. Thus, as at 2008, the totality of copyright based industries operating in the country contributed just about N1.2 trillion to the Nigeria gross domestic income, a figure publicly made known by the authorities during the 50th anniversary of the Nigerian Copyright Commission (Ayemi, 2010). Notwithstanding the above, and especially the enormous benefits which the country has derived from copyright related products, Nigeria still remains the largest piracy destination and market in the world invariably in the same products ostensibly protected by the Copyright Act, particularly computer software. This is due to a number of factors, essentially bordering on the obsolescence and inability of the Act to meet contemporary challenges in the protection of copyrights of particularly new genres of innovations within the above broadly provided products. Also, though Nigeria is signatory to various international conventions on copyright protection, these conventions are hardly enforceable in Nigeria owing to the fact that they have not been domesticated. \n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM \n\nIt is an indisputable fact that copyright is a monopoly of limited duration, but unlike most monopoly, it is a legitimate monopoly created by the law and enjoyed by the author of an original work. However, digital technology in the varied forms known to us today was not expressly contemplated for protection under the Nigerian Copyright Act; most of the new digital innovations can be accommodated in some form under the copyright Act if they approximately fall under any of the intellectual property of individuals protected under the Copyright Act. For instance, take satellite and cable broadcast and computer software, how would certain digital products derived from these innovative technologies relate to the protected categories under the copyright Act. This necessitated this study on the copyright infringement in Nigeria and challenges in a digital world. \n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY \n\nThe following are the objectives of this study: 1.  To examine the spate of copyright infringement in Nigeria. \n\n2.  To identify the challenges of copyright infringement in a digital world. \n\n3.  To determine how copyright infringement can be handled considering digital technology. ",

        "content": "THE INFLUENCE OF FOREIGN MUSIC ON LIFESTYLE OF NIGERIA YOUTHS (A CASE STUDY OF WARRI, DELTA)\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n1.1   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY \n\nThe advent of foreign music like the hiphop, Reggae, Rock & Roll, R & B, rap, jazz etc in Nigeria has been a welcome phenomenon, while some people believe it has created a massive and unappealing change in the life of the youths, insisting it’s slowly but surely wiping out the Nigerian culture coupled with the perception that the whole world is emulating America in a lot of ways, and Nigeria is no exception (Leadership Newspaper, 2014). It is a known fact that in the 21st century, young Nigerians frequently cite Jay-Z and other foreign artist as their favorite artist. American musics has provided a blueprint for the rest of the world to appropriate and build new cultural formations that manifest in music and identity. Yet, the subtitle of Jay-Z’s Blueprint 2 album, “The Gift and The Curse” is an apt description for the complexity of the relationship between African American culture and Nigerian youth identity, which also impacts Nigerian popular music (Adeolu, 2011).The foreign music culture has affected the way many young people and even the elderly see themselves in Nigeria. Many female contemporary musicians want to be like Beyonce, Rihanna, Jennifer Lopez, Nicky Minaj, etc. They put on skimpy clothes that expose all their natural endowments, ignoring the kind of society they belong. They move around in shorts that could pass as underwear for men. Their male counterparts put on clothes that don’t correspond with the weather just because they want to appear cool. Still, to some extent, the personal style of Nigerian music artistes is quite distinct. For example, Phyno, who is known for weaving the Igbo dialect into his music, has endeared fans all over the world with his funky hairstyle and skinny pants. On the other hand, Olamide, from the yoruba cultural setting, usually has a mix of western and local outlook in his dressing  and this goes a long way to influence the lifestyle of their fans. Many Nigerian artistes, as mentioned earlier, strive to be like foreign entertainers, at the expense of their own cultural values and modes of expression. When they put down lyrics, they are usually replete with words and expressions quite alien to the conservative society they belong. While technology has enhanced acceptability of otherwise strange phenomenon, many Nigerians frown at the continued denudation of our culture. Warri is a city in Delta State, Nigeria. It is an oil hub in Southern Nigeria and houses an annex of the Delta State Government House. It served as the colonial capital of the then Warri Province. It shares boundaries with Ughelli/Agbarho, Sapele, Okpe, Udu and Uvwie although most of these places, notably Udu, Okpe and Uvwie, have been integrated to the larger cosmopolitan Warri. Osubi houses an airport that serves the city. Effurun serves as the gateway to and the economic nerve of the city. Towns in the Warri metropolis include: Ogbe-Ijo, Aladja, Ekurede Itsekiri, Jakpa, Ubeji, Ugbuwangue, Ifie-Kporo, Egbokodo Itsekiri, Ajamimogha, Pessu, Koko, Ugbolokoso, Ugborodo, Ajagbodudu, Iyara, Ode-Itsekiri (Big Warri), Osubi, Effurun, Enerhen, Ugborikoko, Agbarho, Deco, Okuokoko, Ebrumede, DSC Township, Ugbomro, Edjeba, Ekurede-Urhobo, Okere, Agbassa, Ogidigben, Gbaramatu, among others. The city of Warri has a unique history that has not been documented well enough by historians. The name Warri province was once applicable to the part of an area now called Delta State under the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. Its boundary in the Northeast was Sapele/Udu creek near Ughelli and Aboh, with Forçados River in the Southeast and Jameson Creek in the Southwest which later changed to Delta Province. Warri city is one of the major hubs of petroleum activities and businesses in the southern Nigeria. It is a commercial capital city of Delta State, with a population of over 311,970 people according to the national population census figures for 2006. The city is one of cosmopolitan cities in southern Nigeria comprising originally of Urhobo, Itsekiri and Ijaw people. Warri is predominantly Christian with mixture of African traditional religions like most of the Southern Nigeria. The city is known nationwide for its unique Pidgin English (Wikipedia, 2015). \n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM \n\nIn Nigeria today, the youths have become a brain washed set of youths who think more of other peoples culture of such music aired on various satellite media that are produced overseas. About 97 percent of such foreign music have violent and romantic traits. Many Nigerian youth get their phones and other personal digital assistants (PDAs) like MP3, Ipad loaded with thousands of foreign music which might contain thousand of death and heartbreaks, heard harsh and brutal languages “fuck you”, a son of bitch, nigger men and kiss my ass etc. It is also believe to have influence dressing and has contributed to behavioral changes in youths in general. However, the researcher is examining the influence of foreign music on the lifestyle of Nigeria youth with special; focus on Warri, Delta State. \n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY \n\nThe following are the objectives of this study: 1.  To examine the influence of foreign music on the lifestyle of Nigeria youth. 2.  To examine the morality of the foreign music content. 3.  To determine the level of acceptance of foreign music by Nigerian youths. ",

        "content": "THE INFLUENCE OF WESTERN TELEVISION PROGRAMMES ON THE CULTURAL VALUES OF NIGERIA YOUTHS\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis study probes the impact which Tv has on the cultural values of the Nigeria youths. It specifically tackles the impact of western Tv programes on Nigeria University students. The research posits that the current trends in cultural behaviour of youths in Nigeria as observed among Caritas student Enugu is significantly associated with their perception of western culture and exposure to western Tv programmes. The assumption that foreign media content has direct powerful effects is shared by optimistic modernization theory. Lerner (1962) Rogers (1964) Schramm (1964) and the later critical perspective of cultural and media imperialism. McPhail (1981), (1984) Gerbuer (1977). The research applies the theory of acculturation along with the culturation hypothesis. “Defluer and Dennis 1991, Garbner 1977, Morgan 1991” explains that acculturation of Nigeria youths take place as a result of exposure to western Tv which influence the perception of Tv reality and alters self-image. From the review of related literature, the following hypotheses emerged for testing HI: More exposure to Tv will tend to identification of western television stars as models. H2: The improvement of Local Tv movies industries will increase Nigerian youths’ preference for local Tv product. Research hypotheses 1 and 2 received statistical support from the analysis of collected data using the survey research method Recommendations to check the cultural genocide for further research were preferred.             \n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study is on The Influence Of Western Television Programmes On The Cultural Values Of Nigerian Youths using Caritas University Students as a case study. The term culture has been defined differently by different people. The different definitions attached to culture are based on the differences in the orientation of the people.\n\nAccording to Ekeh (1989), culture is construct used in an attempt to analyze and integrate events and ideas in broad spectrum of areas of society. Jekayinka (2002), states that from wider perspective, culture includes the total repertoire of human action which are socially transmitted from generation to generation. Obiora (2002), says the transformation of culture is gradual and not sudden. He (2002), contends that culture is a continuous process of change. It changes exactly the same way as the human being change. It is dynamic, learned, acquired, transmitted or diffused through contact or means of communication flow from generation to another. The Nigerian culture is observed to be fading out as a result of the acceptance and adaptation of the modernist’s solution on to underdevelopment. One of such theories which relates to this subtle method of assault international communication is given by Lerner (1956).\n\nIn his concept of “empathy”, Lerner states that the inhabitants of third world nations must learn to empathize with the West for modern transformation of their societies to be possible. Schramm (1964), on the other hand, developed an interesting model in which he equates the level of social development of communication to various nations. Access to these modern mass media (Radio, Television, films, telephone, and newspapers) is linked to individual modernity. Nigeria and other third world countries have reacted to these finding by inventing a substantial amount of their foreign exchange earnings to import radio and television transmitters and sets. The television programmes especially provides many powerful models for children and abundant opportunities for observational learning.\n\nThe television programmes include:\n\n1.                           Depiction of sex\n\n2.                           Violence\n\n3.   Drug and Alcohol used\n\na.           Vulgar Language – behaviours. Etc. that most parents do not want their children to imitate.\n\nStudies have been found by early adolescence that the average Nigerian children have watched thousands of dramatized murders and countless other acts of violence on television (\nwww.encarta.com\n). For many years, psychologists have debated the question of whether watching violence on Tv have detrimental effects on children. A number of experiments both inside and outside the laboratory have found evidence that viewing Tv violence is relayed to increased aggression in children.\n\nNigerians as exemplified by trends in Enugu Metropolis where Western exports of television entertainment, information are shown in NTA Enugu, ESBS Television, Minaj Channel, Cartoon Network, ESPN –“Expanded Sports programmes Network” channel provided by various satellite transmission  operators as DSTV, Multi – Choice, Music television, Euro – sports, etc. Have raised Nigerians eyebrows to such Western television programmes. Thereby, making them to behave like them, associate with them and even speaks like them. Even our generation that is shown on NTA Enugu and the youth perspective on ESBS are presented by youth and replete with music video of Western origin dominated by rape stars as (Late) Tupac, Beyonce, Ashanti, 50- Cent, Sean Paul, Kelly Rowland, Celine Dion, etc. It is the researcher’s believe that western television especially American television exports have a strategic “weapon” aimed to over power the cultural values of Nigerian youths.\n\n1.2       STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM\n\nThe influence of Western television programmes on the cultural values of Nigerian youths have been said to be a serious problem facing Nigerians. Some of these problems are:\n\n1.                           Inadequate policy to guard the youths towards Western Tv programmes.\n\n2.               There is an erosion of the cultural values.\n\n3.               The imitation of Western cultures especially the American   cultures.\n\n4.                           The Nigerian youths are faced with brain wash.\n\nTherefore, if the above problems are not been taking care off, it will lead to a total destruction of the Nigerians culture.\n\n1.3       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe researcher’s objective is to conduct an in-depth research on the influence of Western television programmes on the cultural values of the Nigerian youths with an insight to determine its implication to the cultural values of Nigerian youths are:\n\n1.                 To show how the contents of Western television programme affects Nigerian University students.\n\n2.                 To examines its pervasive impact on the cultural values of Nigerian University student.\n\n3.                 To know how to isolate Western television programmes from Nigeria.\n\n1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\n1.                   The research will help in possible dilution, domination and finally absorption of the African/Nigerian culture which until the present has been characterized with good neighbourliness, respect for elders, virtuousness, community orientation and collectivism.\n\n2.                   It will enable the government and policy makers to put adequate measures in place to check the movement of Western television programmes into Nigeria.\n\n3.                   It will help remove the idea of imitating Western cultures or ways of life from Nigeria.\n\n4.                   The conduct of this research will enable the government to know what role the media can play in the development of a country and therefore, harness the mass media especially Tv in the democratic process and development process in general.\n\n1.5       RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\nThe research questions are arranged questions meant to be asked by the researcher and receives a feedback (answer) from a respondent. For a researcher to achieve her aim, the following question should be used.\n\n1.                   Do Nigerian youths expose themselves more to Tv than other media?\n\n2.                   Do they prefer Western Tv programmes to locally produced ones and why if yes?\n\n3.                   Do Nigerian youths identify more with locally or foreign Tv stars as models?\n\n4.                   Will improvement of local Tv/movies industries improve Nigerian youths preference for local Tv product?\n\n1.6       RESEARCH HYPOTHESES\n\n1.                   Hi: More exposure to Tv  lead to identification of Western\n\nTv stars as models\n\n   Ho: More exposure to Tv do not lead to identification of\n\nWestern Tv stars as models.\n\n2.                   Hii: The improvement of local Tv /movies industries will\n\nincrease Nigerian youths preference for local Tv product.\n\nHo: The improvement of local Tv/ movies industries will not\n\nincrease Nigerian youths preference for local Tv product.\n\n1.7       SCOPE/DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\nThe scope of this study is to find out how the Western Television Programmes affect the Cultural Values of Nigerian Youths using Caritas University as a case study.\n\nThe institution is been noted for a constant influence of Western television programs on their cultural values. Hence, the need for choosing the institution as a case study commenced.\n\nIn the cause of the research, oral interview were consulted on both staffs and students of the institution. But the research depends more on the questionnaire which were distributed to students and staffs and were completed and returned. The researcher also consulted some textbooks, Newspapers and journals which provided a lot of information pertaining to the study.\n\n1.8       ASSUMPTIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following were the assumption of this study:\n\n1.                           A greater number of Nigerian University Students watch Tv.\n\n2.                           Western Tv programmes have a greater appeal to Nigerian University\n\nStudents than locally produced programmes.\n\n3.                           That the programmes contents of Western Tv project symbiotic forms of social reality.\n\n4.                            The Western Tv is having a greater acculturation on Nigerian University Students in particular and on Nigerian youths in general.\n\n5.                           That the improvement of local Tv/ movies industries will change Nigerian youths attitudes towards Western Tv programmes.\n\n1.9       LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\nThough this research work is on the influence of Western television programmes on the cultural valves of Nigerian youths. It is limited to Caritas University Students Amorji-nike, Enugu, using five departments that were randomly selected from faculties and hundred and fifty questionnaires that were distributed to them. This is because of time and resource, had it been that time and resource were available similar studies would have been done in other private University/ schools in the country so as to ensure a more embracing result.\n\n1.10    CONCEPTIONAL AND OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS OF THE TERMS.\n\n1.                   Youth:\n\nConceptual:      It means young men and women.\n\nOperational: It is defined as students in various Universities in Nigeria and who fall between the ages of 15 -30",

        "content": "THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PUBLIC RELATIONS PRACTICE IN THE OIL SECTOR (A CASE STUDY OF AFRICAN PETROLEUM PLC PORT-HARCOURT)\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\n        African petroleum Plc, a Marketer of petroleum products and chemicals, knows that public support and goodwill as well as good corporate image are very important for business success. Tends to be influenced by their publics which includes, its staff, shareholders, customers and of course members of the press.\n\n        The company is actually very much interested to know its public problem areas and opportunities with the aim to improving the organization’s overall performance to enable them know what their public thinks about African petroleum public Relations programmes and quality of services of the organization to its publics.\n\nThe researcher therefore decided to embark on this study with the objectives.\n\n        The objectives of the study are:\n\nTo determine the extent of AP’S public Relations messages accessibility to their publics and also find out whether AP’s public relations practices influence the opinion of their publics.\n\nRelevant data based on the scope of the study were collected through primary and secondary data with structured questionnaire as the main instrument administered to two hundred and fifty (250) respondents comprising forty African petroleum staff, sixty share holders, one hundred and twenty customers and thirty members of the press.\n\nThe questionnaire was highly structured and open – ended where necessary. The questions and the response were very standard to facilitate comparison of responses and to secure good control of the questions, chi-square (x2) was used to analyse the hypotheses formulated.\n\nAmong the findings were that the African Petroleum Public Relations Media Message and quality of their overall services are satisfactory through their mobilization programmes and enlightment campaign but needs more efforts. AP’s Public Relation’s Practice influences their publics to favour her products through persuasive and convincing communication. The following recommendation were made; AP should always engage in a constant evaluation of their public relations practice and its effectiveness to identify any short comings. Media combination should be reviewed to always embrace appreciable coverage.\n\n  CHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0   INTRODUCTION 1.1   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY\n\n        The history of African petroleum Plc date back to 1954 when the then British petroleum BP company Limited, brought up the assets of Atlantic refining company on the West African coast Ten years later (1964) that company was incorporated in Nigeria as British Petroleum of Nigeria Limited which of course is a subsidiary of the world wide British petroleum Group that marketed petroleum product throughout the Federal Republic of Nigeria. In 1978, the company changed from a private company to a public company, when forty percent (40%) of the shares were sold to Nigerian citizens in compliance with provisions of the Nigeria Enterprises promotions degree of 1977. On the 31st July 1979, the Federal Government acquired the sixty percent (60%) share in British petroleum (BP) Limited, just to make the company wholly Nigeria affair. As a result, the name of the company had to change to African Petroleum (AP) Limited which was in November 1979.\n\n        Accordingly, 20% of the Federal Governments 60% shares in African petroleum were offered to the public in March 1989 in fulfillment of its privatization policy. The share were seven times over subscribed during the exercise, thus increasing the number of share holders from about fifty thousand to one hundred and sixty thousand share holders. The company’s current paid up share capital of N 86.4M which of course is the largest in the country.\n\n        As a marketer of refined petroleum in Nigeria, African Petroleum (AP) procures and distributes petroleum products like petrol (PMS), Diesel oil  (AGO), Household kerosene or Domestic petroleum kerosene (HHK/DPK), Low poor fuel oil (LPFO), Liquefied petroleum Gas (LPG), fuel oil, Jet-A-1 (Aviation furbric kerosene) etc the company also manufacture and market a wide range of lubricants, insecticide and chemicals. This company’s marketing operation areas are Kaduna, Kano, Port – Harcourt, Warri.\n\n        African petroleum plc has its head office in Lagos. The main source of its products is the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) through its strategic network depots and refineries. As contained in its Diary (1998) African petroleum is a world class integrated petroleum company where outstanding and dedicated people supported by superior technology deliver exceptional benefits to its shareholders”. Their mission is to be an innovative and customer oriented, provider of quality petroleum and related products and services”.\n\n        Businesses are open systems, and most of what they do generates direct benefits and costs for their societies. Today society demands that businesses join in the urgent task of solving societies, problems. Corporations are more than economic institutions and have a responsibility to devote some of their resources problems mainly of which corporations helped to create.\n\n        However, small or large our enterprise, we cannot isolate our business from the society around us. Nor can we function without its goodwill. The researcher therefore tried to x-ray the public relations practice in African petroleum plc to assess its effectiveness in building desired goodwill imperative to healthy business survivability.\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS:\n\n        African petroleum plc (formerly British petroleum) that has been in existence since 1954 is now one of the major marketers of petroleum products in Nigeria. African petroleum plc operates few major marketing areas in Kaduna, Kano, Lagos and Port Harcourt. It has depots at (Apapa) Lagos, Jos and Kano but its main source of Petroleum Company (NNPC). Presently the company entered into the marketing of chemical, real estate development and manufacturing of insecticides.\n\n        Coming to the ever-increasing number of competition and continued fuel scarcity in the country, the company does not fold its arms watching rather she continues to diversify and expand on its activities. The reason being that should the company fail to satisfy her numerous publics by constant supply of product as at when needed and of course quality product, the publics negative reaction would affect its profit making ability and in respect affect the nations economy. In the effort of improving the quality of its product and services, as regards achieving public commendations, goodwill and support, cannot in the actual sense understand how actually the publics feel about their company’s quality of services and their public relations programmes.\n\n        This research work shall do justice to address certain problems like\n\na.           How far is the public relations messages of AP plc accessible to her publics.\n\nb.          Were the right public relations media often use?\n\nc.           Is the public relations department of AP rated high by her publics in terms of its efficiency?\n\nd.          Does the public relations practices of African petroleum plc influence the opinion of their public in favour of AP.\n\ne.           Do the public relations consider African petroleum plc’s public relations practice as adequate?\n\n1.3      OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe objective of the study are as follows:\n\na.           To ascertain the extent of African petroleum’s public messages accessibility to their public.\n\nb.          To know whether the right public relations media were often used.\n\nc.

To ascertain whether African petroleum’s public relations department is rated high in terms of its efficiency.\n\ne.           To find out if the publics of AP plc consider their public relations practices as adequate.\n\n1.4   FORMULATION OF HYPOTHESIS\n\nH01: The degree of African petroleum’s public relations messages accessibility to her public is unsatisfactory.\n\nH02:  The right public relations media were not often used.\n\nH03:   The public relation practice of African petroleum does not influence the opinion of their public in favour of African petroleum.\n\nH04:   The public relations department of AP is not rated high in terms of its efficiency.\n\nH05:   The public considers African petroleum’s public relations practice as adequate.\n\n1.5     SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe scope of study is focused on public relations practices in African Petroleum Plc. and their internal and external publics in Port Harcourt metropolis were studies as for the topics covered, all the items as contained in the objectives of the study and hypothesis were treated.\n\nThe view of the office holders and opinion leaders were bought since they constitute decision makers.\n\n1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\n        Coming to the diversification and expansion of its activities, the current crisis and the ever-increasing competition among oil marketing companies. African petroleum plc are concerned with generating marketing information which all will help them to achieve a favourable market share and maintain its profit marketing ability if really wants to remain in business.\n\n        The researcher may after some recommendation that will help to ensure an adequate and effective use of public relations as a tool for business promotions.\n\n        Moreover, this work will also serve as a working tool for Chief Executives and managers in the oil marketing sectors; this piece of work will actually form a basis for further development and as well contribute to the existing knowledge in the area of oil marketing.\n\n1.7   DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nPUBLIC RELATIONS:        Public relations is the art and service of achieving harmony with the environment through mutual understanding based on truth, knowledgeable and full information.

        "content": "FACTORS AFFECTING THE QUALITY OF ‘FAMILY FORUM’- A RADIO PROGRAMME OF ANAMBRA BROADCASTING SERVICE, AWKA\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE   \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n1.1     BACKGROUND OF STUDY \n\n“The lesson to be learned is that the future belongs to the station to the extent that the station that produces and controls programming well will be successful”. Fepper (1995). Programming as the bedrock and mainstay of broadcasting involves a long-term calculated planned policy expressed in predetermined executable action, which if appropriately implemented and executed as individual programme operations, wins maximum success for station. Dunu (2002). Furthermore, according to Dunu (2002), programme is also defined as the strategic selection of programme materials appropriate or suitable to a particular segment of pre-defined target audience. It is undoubtful that effective programme is synonymous with a successful broadcast station. Broadcast programming involves a series of inter-dependent processes which are expected to satisfy some specific needs of the listening and viewing audience. A programme is a broadcast material created to meet certain specific needs or attain some set objectives and transmitted to some predetermined target audience. Programming in radio involves the task of choosing programmes and scheduling them in meaningful order and evaluating their degree of success and or failure. Indeed, programming is constrained by time. It makes use of daily schedule for the day’s transmission or master schedule for 13, 26, 39, 52 weeks as the case may be. Programming plays a dual role between the broadcaster who views it as a means of income and society which views it as entertainment and public service. Programming for specific audience is one of the areas of great problem to Nigerian broadcasters. The problem seems to arise primarily from lack of knowledge about the specified audience, the potentials of the radio, communication theory and the objective of broadcasting  in the first instance. In order to increase rating and attain success, broadcast stations employ programming strategies which according to Eastman (1993) are compatibility, habit formation, audience flow control, programme resource conservation, and breath of appeal. Radio programming poses most challenges which include making the programme clear, logical, meaningful and easy to understand . According to Robert Hillard, Radio may represent a character in one setting and in a twinkling transport him - and the audience - to an entirely different one. This is done through  the use of  narration, sound effects and dialogue. Consequently, it is important to note that certain indices exist that undermine the quality of broadcast programmes specifically radio programmes in Nigeria. It has been discovered that government censorship and  financial control of most broadcast stations affect the quality of programmes aired. A case in point is where incumbent government insists that airtimes be utilized in sychophany and  praise singing  broadcast of the government in power. Post and pre-censorship of programmes are in too. There is a common saying  in regard to mass media  control in Nigeria  and  elsewhere which has become a cliche that “he who pays the piper dictates the tune”. This means that the owner of a mass media channel controls what the medium broadcast and how it broadcasts it as the case of Anambra broadcasting service Awka. Surely control through ownership is a fact of life in every society, but then the nature of this control usually varies greatly depending upon the political system, the orientation of political leaders in control of government and the political climate prevailing  the caliber of Journalists and  other professionals communicators. These forces exert control over the broadcast media in the  sense that their individual or combine influences could shape the content, activities and orientation of the broadcasting  media   quite  considerably, depending upon the magnitude of  influences and  these affect the quality of the programmes. The broadcasters, before giving information considers if the “piper” likes it or not. They shave out the parts that will not be pleasant to the “Piper” and not considering what the public (audience) needs to hear. This is a major problem that affects the quality of ‘events from government house’, a radio programme in ABS, Awka. Any information that is not accepted by the government who is the ‘Piper’ cannot be disseminated to the public. Aside from this, it has also been discovered that lack of qualified staff and use of obsolete equipment has become a huge  stumbling block and hindrance to effective   quality programmes. Effective programming  requires well talented and trained staff with the right orientation and sound judgment in the intricacies of broadcast productions. These include writers, directors, producers, presenters, engineers, maintenance staff, announcers, etc. Programming involves putting the right peg in the right hole. Therefore, the personnel required for programming affects it to a large extent . Thus when the staff lack talent or are not creative, programmes lose their integrity and attraction. It takes a creative mind to put out a fantastic performance. When a mind is creative, it has the ability of putting together research findings. The radio station of Anambra broadcasting service (ABS) Awka, is an example of one of the  most broadcasting stations  where untrained staff and  analog or obsolete equipment are  still much in use  rather than the recent digital and computerized system. It is also plagued with the absence of quality   transmitters that makes radio broadcasting programmes  epileptic. Oftentimes most of the content of programmes being aired  are not entertaining, educative and  informative. Programmes aired by radio broadcast should basically  focus on development, that is such transmissions that can spur people to greater individual and national development. It should also focus on how to sustain the attention of their listening and viewing audience. It should include  hooks, suspense and  other attention-getting  device. Programme   for broadcast is meant to  be  supplement to formal school offering but it is not so in Nigerian context. However, the recent Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) guideline stipulating 60% local content of any programming effort though good is adversely affecting the quality of most indigenous programmes. Misuse of the broadcast media for political purpose has  always  constituted a serious problem in the country. Government   and private broadcast media sometimes disregard the started objectives of their organisatiosn by allowing their channels to be used for political selfish ends by political lackeys. The ABS radio station is sometimes being hampered by  lack of significant independence in programming  because the prime viewing   time has been  taken over by network programmes which the ABS radio station is meant to hook onto. The scheduling of some of these radio station broadcast programmes does not coincide with audience activity. This is evident in the time scheduling to some programmes which does not suit with the timing of the listeners. For instance, ABS, Awka airs the radio programme ‘Events from Government House’ at 5.30am. This time is not convenient for its audience as they might not be awake by that time and so wrong audience who now listen to it may not understand the quality of such programmes. Lack of continuity  of such programmes and effective feedback and lack of proper research on the  subject matter are also cankerworms that have hindered the production of  quality  radio programmes. Most times, radio programmes  are  haphazardly done, and  because of this, quality programmes will never be the end product. The feedback system through phone–in-facilities has become the lazy way out of programme production. Producers are no longer keen in searching for qualitative artists to discuss programmes on radio. Instead they allow unguarded or uncontrolled outbursts from listeners who are privileged to have telephone in their homes but  do not  know what  to do with them. Years ago, listeners where encouraged to write letters to producers  of programmes and such letters have been constructive and of tremendous help in improving the quality of broadcast programmes. It is difficult to explain why a developing country like Nigeria will issue licenses to broadcast operators just to play music. This is true, but sad development. Broadcast Media should be channel towards development efforts and this pre-supposes the fact that recipients of broadcast messages should be part of programmes conceptualization and implementation. Every radio programme in Nigeria should be   backed up by researchers. \n\nHISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF RADIO BROADCASTING IN NIGERIA \n\nOver the decades, broadcasting in Nigeria has served as the channel for government propaganda. Radio has been found to be very useful, because it is  popular  with the rural population and also enjoys the  intimacy which other media of communication lack. In developed world, radio has been used for development purposes. Programmes that are meant to achieve these development purposes have been conceived and executed at the various levels of the society. In  Nigeria, however, radio has been seen as a one-way communication channel in which the government communicates to the governed without an appropriate feed-back  system. Radio, according to Microsoft Encarta Premium (2009) is a  system of communication employing electromagnetic waves propagated through space. It has been acknowledge universally as a very important  means of disseminating  information of all the modern means of communication in the world,  radio is the most popular  because  the majority  by of the members of the public have access to it. Moreover, radio has the capability of achieving its programmes for both literates and illiterates. This is particularly true in a developing country like Nigeria with its high illiteracy level. Newspapers, Magazines, posters and books which are the print media can hardly reach the illiterates. Radio can, because it employs the oral vernacular as well as   television. Launery (1962) observed  and  said:  “Africa will in large measure own their freedom and newly found place in the world to two singular technological developments. The dry cell battery powered portable offer leaders of Africa’s newly independent countries that only practical means of reaching much of their people most of the time”.  Radio is supplemental. Most radio listening occurs while   we are doing something else–driving working, studying cleaning, falling asleep, waking up and so on. Radio rarely is the prime focus of our attention; it provides an audio background for our activities. Also radio is portable. Virtually every household has at least one working and almost every car  is equipped with radio. Some radio sets, like the walkman, are small and personal.  Others like the boom box, are big and public. No matter their size, radio sets are easily transported and go every where-the beach, sporting events , jogging trails, the work place etc. Car radios provide  news and entertainment  to commuters on  their way to and from work. Infact, it is hard to find a place where radio cannot go. Radio broadcasting in Nigeria dates back to 1932 and has its roots in England. It started as ‘wireless for monitoring and relaying programmes  from the  British  Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for the interest of her colonial servants’. Church (2009:9). Before independence, all the programmes are packaged and relayed from BBC in London. Radio in Nigeria between 1937 and  1955 was an extension of oversea broadcasting organization. Programmes were purely British, sometimes tailored to suit the task of the colonial listeners.  In 1951, the Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS) was  formally inaugurated as a relay station working closely with  the BBC. The ordinance No. 36 of 1956 heralded the setting up of the  Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) which was  set up among other functions, ‘ to provide  independent and impartial broadcasting services” within Nigeria. The NBC tried to maintain a national profile in its operation but according to Lan Mackay (1964) “it failed to provide a regional image to the satisfaction of the  regional government’. The growth of radio stations often followed the creation of more states in the country. An example is in 1976 when the country was divided into 19 states, radio stations increased. The NBC later changed its name to Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN) in 1979. Today in Nigeria, all the states of the Federation enjoy the broadcast service of FRCN along with the state owned stations like Anambra Broadcasting Service (ABS), Awka. That had made radio to be the medium of the widest audience in the country. Radio is the most obvious as well as the most effective means of mass communication in Nigeria because its impact is immediate and enduring. Therefore, radio broadcasting is regarded as a national undertaking of the highest order and an indispensable element for  public motivation by every government. Political, social and technical considerations are the cardinal reasons for the proliferation of FM radio stations in Nigeria. The federal government decided to restrict state radio stations to medium wave broadcast on December 8, 1979. This  led to the setting   up of FM station by some government  in Nigeria. This brought the existence of the many FM stereos and other FM stations. The Anambra Broadcasting Service (ABS) Awka is a disengagement from Anambra Broadcasting Service, Enugu in 1992. The ABS Awka originally started in 1960 at Enugu as the Eastern Nigerian Broadcasting corporation (ENBC) which was  later renamed the East  Central State Broadcasting Service (ECBS) of 1971 after the civil war at  Enugu. The then ECBS has a television and a radio arm, which   was later spilt into Anambra Broadcasting Corporation and the Eastern Nigerian Television Authority (ENTV) as of 1976.       Subsequently, the ABS was renamed the Anambra Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the Eastern Nigerian Television Authority (ENTA) was renamed as the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) with subsequent political charges, merging took place in 1985 under a re-organization exercise which resulted to the ABS Enugu. Anambra Broadcasting Corporation and Anambra television which came into existence by Jim Nwobodo were the two stations that merged and this was backed up by the then government Edict No 6 of 1985 and later by the Edict No 4  of 1987 as a  corporate establishment. After the creation of states in 1992, Anambra Broadcasting Service or corporation disengaged from ABS Enugu as an autonomous corporate establishment and backed by the Edict No 4 of 1987 under the Ministry of Information with specified   scheme of service and the conditions of services for staff regulations and welfare.   \n\nGovernment Regulations of Broadcasting  \n\nAmong the different media of mass communication, the broadcast media have always been a source of worry to government. One major reason for government control of broadcasting is based on the fact that the airwaves (electro-magnetic spectrum) are a scarce and public resource. It is argued that this resource should be controlled and allotted by the government in the way best suitable for serving the public good. Another reason for government control of broadcasting derives from the perceived power of broadcasting to influence public opinion, given the peculiar characteristics of broadcast media. From its inception, therefore, government has sought to exercise control over the broadcast media. It is not usually the case with the print. Consequently, for a long time in virtually every third world country, the government owned and controlled all broadcast media. The defence often offered for the adoption of  this prevalent ownership pattern in developing  world is that there is an urgent need for national development and that the government needs to control the mass media so as to better  use them to achieve the national goal. However, government control of Broadcasting has always involved more than ownership, and extends beyond government owned media to include privately owned broadcast media. Even in most advanced democracies, broadcasting is subject to government regulation which varies in degrees from country to country. In the United States of America, for instance, the government regulates broadcasting through the Federal Communication Commission (FCC). This is the body established by the United States Congress in 1934 and empowered to regulate radio, television, and telephone communication. Bittner (1980:326).   In Nigeria, the equivalent of the FCC is the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) which was established by Decree 38 of 1992. This decree gives wide – ranging powers to NBC to regulate and control the broadcast industry in the country. Licensing process and control is one way the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) regulates the broadcast industry. The then information minister, Chief John Nwodo (Jnr) says:  “‘under the National Broadcasting Commission Decree No.38 of 1992, the commission is empowered to receive, process and consider applications for ownership of radio and television stations including cable to services, direct satellite broadcast and other medium of broadcasting” Establishments licensed to broadcast under Decree No. 38 of 1992, are subject to strict monitoring and control by the commission in relation to purely technical as well as to regulate the type of broadcast equipment to be used by it. Operators of license stations are obliged to make their broadcast facilities (including equipment and station log book) available for inspection by the inspectorate staff of the commission. Another control Mechanism can be seen in the fees which Broadcasting Association of Nigeria called for a review of fees payable by broadcasting houses arguing that ‘this will remove the present situation of unilateral imposition of asphyxiating fees in millions of Naira on broadcasting stations by the NBC’. \n\nQuality of Radio Broadcasting in Nigeria \n\nHow could the programme content be improved in order to achieve national idea of combating most on the social ills of the society, is one important question which needed to be asked in this study. This brings the word ‘Quality’ which means a general standard.      The quality of Radio Broadcasting could be determined by the good or bad programmes rendered to the listeners.  A quality radio broadcast programme as articulated in the National broadcasting code of 1993 is meant to: A)     Cover the areas of education, entertainment and information. \n\nB)     Promote social values and norms, civic and social responsibilities \n\nC)     Promote the acquisition or pursuit of knowledge. \n\nD)     Promote the physical, mental and social well–being of the people \n\nE)     Foster the spirit of self discipline and self sacrifice \n\nF)     And encourage the prevention and development of human values and respect of the dignity of man. The services rendered by the Nigerian Broadcasting commission has achieved little or no benefit. For instance, broadcasting to the Mass audience has the ability to transcend illiteracy and other traditional barriers associated with the print media programme. Contents of radio which is programme should be  given a careful consideration and  every decision that has to do with the proposed programme should be evaluated in  line   with the expectations of the intended audience. The ability to reach specialized audience and penetrating the lives of virtually the entire world population could mean that   radio broadcasting has high quality in rating. \n\nObjective of Radio Broadcasting      \n\nRadio broadcasting has come a long way like many countries in Africa. It has evolved from transmitting programmes  from the home countries of the colonialists to the poor natives in Africa. Radio in this sense had been effective in brain washing the Africans on  what their colonial masters were doing to cater for their interests. At independence, the African leaders were to know the effect of broadcasting on the people and so used it as government megaphone. Radio broadcasting is a medium that could be used for a lot of purposes. It could help to report the activities of the people for government attention and because of the high illiteracy level, radio broadcasting is preferred to other media of communication because  of its portability and its flexibility in programming. Government policies could be translated into local languages and broadcast to the people. It is not therefore  surprising that broadcasting has been adopted to propagate the ideas of a government  in power to  the detriment  of the people they are supposed  to serve. \n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM      ",

        "content": "TELEVISION AS A TOOL FOR NATIONAL INTEGRATION (A CASE STUDY OF N.T.A KADUNA)\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0     INTRODUCTION\n\nTelevision as a mass medium of communication has become a very important and most effective medium of communication ever since it invention. It synchronous transmission of audio and visual signal enable it to exert enormous influence on the society there by making it more compelling and enable it to command great respect and attention than the other media.   It significance is that it has become a nerve linking the society and its activities together. This explain the reason why government of developing countries, especially Nigeria are enchanted by the power of television, thereby using it to publicize most of their programmes to promote unity and cultural upliftement of the people   Television creates awareness of different life style in a society. In doing this emphasis are placed on similarities in life style and this is beneficial to developing nations like Nigeria where “loyalties rarely extend beyond the village, tribe or religion” and where integration is usually seen as an identification with the larger whole that is the state.   Therefore, television as a tool for national integration plays the role of creating sense of identification through the propagation of common cultural values and symbol, by giving interpretations to events that will aid and promote unity of the nation. However the television medium should desists from interpreting events in such a way that it may give rise to disaffection, inflame tempers and course disunity among the people with diverse cultural norms, belief and values   It can therefore be held that television, due to the role it plays in limiting people with different culture, religion, tribe and even race reflects the value pattern of the society because it determines where and when information flows.   \n\n1.1      HISTORY OF CASE STUDY \n\nTelevision broadcasting has since 1954 grown by leaps and bound through out the federation. Barely a year after the establishment of Western Nigeria Television (WNTV). Eastern Nigeria television (ENTV) now NTA Enugu, was established by the then governor of former Eastern region in 1962 the Northern  regional government joined inter – alia in the formation of the radio Kaduna television (RKTV) from which the F.R.C.N and N.T.A Kaduna evolved from.   Nigeria television Authority (NTA) Kaduna was excised from the former broadcasting corporation of northern Nigeria (BCNN) which was established by decree No 21 of 31st March 1962, the decree took effect from April 1st 1976.   The station has 10 kilometer each cover to down south of Kaduna, Malumfashi in Katsina state and part of Kano State. The transmitter operates on 4 bands 1 VHF, transmitter which is situated at No 99, Isah Kaita Road Kaduna, and was commission in 1993 and covers up to Kafanchan, Saminaka and Birnin Gwari. The transmitter could be said to cover three quarter of the land area of Kaduna.  ",

National media and presses are expected to emphasize on the promotion of work culture, especially among the young generation so that the countries' industries not become dependent on the migratory labor. This mission could particularly be performed by the television as the most public media. Also, the Association of American University Presses believes that the most effective way that presses can recruit and retain individuals representing the widest variety of backgrounds and experiences is by having as open and as supportive an environment as possible. Organizations use all sorts of tools to represent their goals and ambitions. Simulations of simulations and representations of the simulated are used for organizational sense making. Scenarios are representations of business goals; business goals which are used to reorganize and structure the next generation of scenarios. But some things simulated and others not, or is it simulation “all the way down”? Managing occurs by representing goals via all kinds of media; media that are involved in spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, and diagrams of goals, visions and strategies. Not only physical media, like telephones or computers, but also theoretical imaginaries abound (Boeschoten,20).\n\nIn a complex interplay of significations, participants take part in processes of representation. But the role of the intermediaries or the media is little recognized. Media seem to play a neutral role within the process of signification, as if true values or meanings hide behind the representations. But on a closer look, one can see that media shape the understanding of organization (Lever, 19).\n\nThis study has tried to review the role of national media in promoting the work culture among its audiences and in this respect; television is particularly dealt with as the most public national media.\n\n1.2       Statement of the Problem\n\nMost Television stations in Nigeria are basically set up to promote the numerous Nigerian cultural value. But inspite of this, most stations in Nigeria show too much western programs thereby promoting western culture as against Nigeria culture which they are originally set up to promote. This constraint has hinder the transfer of Nigerian cultural heritage to the younger generation. It is against this background, that the researcher consider the subject matter of this research as an empirical problem worthy of investigation.\n\n1.3       Aim Objectives of the Study\n\nThe aim of this study is to examine the role of AIT in promoting youth popular culture in Kaduna metropolis. The specific objectives are to:\n\ni)                    Assess the role of AIT in repackaging Africa’s rich cultural Heritage to attract youths.\n\nii)                  Determine the contribution of AIT in enhancing Nigeria values among youths.\n\niii)                Appraise the role of AIT in promoting popular trend among youths.\n\n1.4       Research Questions\n\ni)          What are the significant technical elements that are essential towards reinforcing Nigeria cultural value in AIT?\n\nii)         What role does AIT play in repackaging Africa’s rich cultural Heritage to attract youths?\n\niii)        What are the contributions of AIT in enhancing Nigeria values among youths?\n\niv)                How does AIT promote popular trend among youths?\n\nv)                  What are the significant technical elements that are essential towards reinforcing Nigeria cultural value in AIT?\n\n1.5       Significance of the Study",

        "content": "THE ROLE OF THE RADIO IN PROPAGATING CULTURE IN NIGERIA\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThis research work focused on the role of radio in propagating culture in Nigeria (a case study of southern Ijaw local government Koluama Bayelsa State). It is believed that the radio does not propagate culture in Nigeria  and as a result of this the researcher decided to embark on a research to find out why the radio does not propagate culture in Nigeria- Research questions were constructed to guide the researcher in the study using the survey research method which was adopted, and data was collected at the end of the study the researcher  was able to find out that radio does not propagate culture as was said and our culture also serve as hinderance to the propagation of culture.The researcher also recommended that the radio should try to promote our culture instead of potraying that   of the western.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nCulture entails the way of life of people culture is the total way of life of a people, culture can also be defined as the identity through  which a particular set of people are identified.\n\n       Every society, no matter how civilized or uncivilized has its totality and way of life. This pattern or way of life is carried on from one generation to another. It is technically and naturally impacted on to the young one’s through various channels of communication Of which one of the outstanding is the electronic media which is the radio and television.\n\n       Which ever way the electronic media which is the radio intends to pass the messages, it is important to know that it is through the media which is the radio that the targeted audience can be reached.\n\n       Communication according to Nsude and nwosu et al (2006: 266) is the art through which pieces of information are related form one person to an other in the process of interaction.”\n\n       Eziechine (1999:11) say’s that communication involves the exchange of information and ideas.\n\nIn the words of jayaweera (1991:17) communication is “An interactive process through which persons or group of people relate to each other, share information, experiences, culture and lots more.\n\n       Nwuneli (1985:187) see’s communication as “The sharing of experience, which may involve two or more people”\n\n       From the above definitions it is clear that communication means basically to share information ideas, Opinions, feelings and experiences between people. For communication to get to its targeted audience it must be passed through a channel which is the radio.\n\n       The media is a compound of many things rolled into one however, the media is divided into two parts the broadcast and the print media. But one thing that remains common is the mention of the world “media” it brings about something related to news entertainment, information, cultural transmission.\n\n       According to O’Shaughnessy (1999 .4) the mass media are technologically developed and economically profitable forms of human communication, held in public or private ownership which can transmit information ,ideas, entertainment  across time and space to a diverse group of people.\n\n       Therefore through the broadcast media which is the radio crucial roles are played in education members of the society educating and enlightening the people on the need to uphold their culture.\n\n       Lasswell (1948: 5) said that the foremost functions of the media which is the radio in any society is to provide surveillance of the environment disclosing threats and opportunity affecting the valued parts position of the community and component part within it, a reasonable media such as the radio should therefore be used to position the citizen in a way they would see the importance of their culture, there by fighting towards promoting this culture of theirs.\n\n       The Radio is believed to have the capacity which can cut through the barriers of illiteracy and is the overall development of the society. This perspective has been  accepted by different authorities in mass-communication, from the long standing traditional change this suggests that the radio is relevant in power distribution and watching over the extent at which the power is negatively or positively being impacted on the people.\n\n       The mass media are significant part of the society mostly in this modern day where and when communication, information, technology has made the world a global village. To this effect a diverse and heterogenous group of people are dependent. Upon  the regular contact with the radio for education, information, entertainment, opinions,  ideas sensitization mobilization, integration among others, which  are is one way or the other connected to our attempt to define who and what are.\n\n       The Radio transmits ideas information to the targeted audience, this shows that they are responsible for most adjustments in the behaviourial patterns of the people in the society. Sometimes these adjustments take the target audience unawares and they find themselves trapped in the manifestation of the acquired behaviour for instance “African youths who are faced with the relegation of African values to the background” (Odetola and Ademola 1985). Whichever way it is considered, the radio has used in this research work tends to show row they affect the lives of the people in promoting culture.  \n\n       The generally learned and shared ways of doing things that are peculiar to our society come under the shield of culture and this culture is transmitted from one generation to another.\n\n       This research work intends to examine the role of the radio in propagating culture in Nigeria, It aims at finding out whether the radio as a channel of the mass media recognize their obligations to the society, especially in the area of culture.  Due to the fact that the culture of the people is supposed to be their identity and it is gradually fading away all because we African’s ignore our culture  and prefer that of the westerners\n\n       This research intends to touch a certain rural area to know the extent at which the media (Radio) carry out their roles in promoting culture in Nigeria. It focuses on Koluama, a typical rural autonomous community in Bayelsa state precisely. It considers the type of food they eat the way they dance the music and their traditional attire et.c.\n\n       Imperatively research has it that the mode of dressing amongst our youths boys and girls even the married women and men are nothing to write home about. Because of their quest to look good women and youths in\n\nOur society male or female dress half naked all in the name of fashion and trend.\n\n       One would find a young man with braided hair like that of a lady. Some of these young men go as far as putting on ear-rings drawing tattoos on various parts of their body, wearing their trousers down known popularly as sagging.     \n\n       The traditional and local music of the people has been replaced with that of the westerners which is known as hip hop, rock and roll, which were introduced by the white men today our young boy’s and girls can no longer compete with their fellow boy’s and girls from the neighouring villages in traditional and cultural dances, All because of the domination of the western   ways.\n\n       Language which is supposed to be the vehicle through which our culture is passed on from one generation to another has been overridden by the westerner’s way of life where children can no long longer speak their language  parents in various families nowadays teach  their children English language instead of their native language. While in schools pupils are forbidden to speak any language which is not English language.\n\n       In tertiary institutions under graduate prefer to study foreign languages while those that are studying indigenous languages are looked down upon. All these and more are caused due to the negligence of our culture by us African’s (Nigerians).
