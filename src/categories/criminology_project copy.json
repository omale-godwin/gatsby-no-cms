[{"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The use of ATM has grown rapidly in popularity because of its low banks transaction  costs and customers convenience which has made it a basic element of today’s financial service delivery. However, the ATM which is meant to be serving the customers better is now becoming a nightmare for some customers because of fraud perpetuated in their accounts through ATM withdrawals. The main purpose of this work is to examine the activities of fraudsters through ATM pin and how these frauds have affected financial institution growth and customers patronage of banks. This researcher made use of four banks as a case study for this research work. Data was collected from questionnaires, interviews and observation from the four banks under study. Three hypotheses was tested using the chi- square statistical tool and it was observed that there is a significant relationship between ATM fraud and fraud in Nigeria, it was also observed that ATM fraud affects customers patronage and financial institution growth. In conclusion, the activities of fraudsters needs to be monitored and measures should be put in place to mitigate these frauds. To solve this, additional security layer on the ATM is recommended and proper monitoring of the ATM machine by the banks. We believe that if banks and service providers heed to some of these suggestions in this work, we will have a safer, hassle- free and worth while banking experience in this country.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>…</strong></p> <p>1.2 <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM.</strong></p> <p>It will be pertinent to highlight the needs for embarking on a study of this nature which will examine the activities of fraudsters through ATM.<br/>This study will attempt to seek answers to the following problems.</p> <ol><li>Can ATM cause fraud in the banking industry in Nigeria?</li> <li>Is there any relationship between ATM and fraud in Nigeria?</li> <li>Is there any need for ATM since the rate of fraud is alarming?</li> <li>How do these fraudsters commit these frauds?</li> <li>Does ATM fraud affect financial institution growth?</li> <li>What are the reactions of the banks when these frauds are committed?</li> <li>What are the reactions of the customers that are affected by the fraud?</li> <li>What are the reactions of the central bank of Nigeria in regulating this fraud?</li> </ol> <p>1.3 <strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to;</p> <ol><li>To know the relationship between ATM fraud and fraud</li> <li>To examine the ways by which these frauds are committed.</li> <li>To know the measures that central bank of Nigeria has taken to mitigate this fraud.</li> <li>To know the reactions of the customers affected by these fraud.</li> <li>To know the reactions of banks when these frauds are committed.</li> <li>To know whether fraud affects financial institution growth</li> <li>To find out the ways that we can avoid this risk. Atm Pin</li> <li>To proffer solution to fraud in Nigeria. Atm Pin</li> </ol> <p>1.4 <strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <ol><li>What is the relationship between ATM fraud and fraud?</li> <li>What are the ways by which these frauds are committed?</li> <li>How will the central bank of Nigeria stop this crime. Atm Pin</li> <li>How can the customers and users of ATM avoid the risk of being defrauded?</li> <li>What are the solutions to fraud in Nigeria. Atm Pin</li> <li>How does fraud affect financial institution growth. Atm Pin.</li> </ol>\n\nAN ASSESSMENT ON THE ACTIVITIES OF FRAUDSTERS USING ATM PIN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ASSESSMENT ON THE ACTIVITIES OF FRAUDSTERS USING ATM PIN", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Over the years various activities across the borders of ECOWAS member states have hindered sustainable economic growth and development in the Union (Orji, 2008 :?) Activities such as bunkering, terrorism, smuggling of banned items, drug trafficking, human trafficking and prostitution do not encourage socio-economic growth in developing nations such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Togo etc.</p> <p>The desire to build a vibrant and sound economy is the desire of every patriotic ECOWAS member. This desire can be demonstrated through total elimination or reduction of cross border crimes, and other activities that may hamper the success of free trade policies currently formulated by the economic union.</p> <p>Cross bordercrime represents a number of illegal and notorious activities carried out by individuals and groupsacross national and international borders, eitherfor financial or economic benefits also socio political cum religious considerations. It is a setof criminal acts whose perpetrators and repercussions go beyond territorial borders (Owolabi, 2009: 23).</p> <p>Cross border crimes include human trafficking, money laundering, drug trafficking, arms smuggling or trafficking of weapons, international terrorism, illegal oil bunkering, illicit trafficking in diamonds, business fraud, to mentionbut these notable few.Organized criminal groups carry out their illicit activities using major technological tools such as information networks, the financial system and other sophisticatedmeans, while other crude methods include concealing banned items from one country to the other, human trafficking and major oil bunkering activities with speed boats and vessels.</p> <p>Some cabals involved in cross border crimes also take advantage of differencesin legislation, legal systems and traditions,which often seriously hamper state efforts torespond adequately to the threat of organizedor cross border crimes.</p> <p>Ortuno and Wiriyachai (2009: 56) have maintained that the past few years have been characterized by a significant increase in global criminal activities such as money laundering, trafficking in human and nuclear technology andmaterial, the trade in human organs and migrant smuggling. At the same time, emergingcrimes such as modern piracy, and traffickingin toxic waste, counterfeit medicines, preciousmetals or natural resources have been added tothe list of traditional illegal activities such asprostitution, drug trafficking and arms trafficking.Most recently,cross national crime has increased in scope and is characterized by increasinglyglobal reach, involved in multiple forms of criminal activity, expanding criminal markets toinclude large-scale financial fraud and cyber-crime. And the syndicates are willing to protect their activities through violent and ruthlessmeans, linked to international terrorist groupsand devising novel and notorious organizationalstrategies to deter capture (Luna 2008).</p> <p>In Nigeria, the dimension of these criminal activities has increased. The emergence of militancy in the NigerDelta, and the spade of kidnappings have created serious problems of insecurity. This is however done in connivance with security agencies. This situation is scaring to foreign and localinvestors and impinges seriously on the socio-economic development of societyDrug trafficking like its twin sister, money laundering, has economic effect on developingeconomies also. It places increasing demandson the public health services and the society atlarge. These increasing demands and strainscome in different forms,these will include serious epidemic like HIV/AIDS. The United Nation Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports that along the cocaine trafficking route,numbers of users and cases of HIV/AIDS is distinctly higher.It is also noted that a number of youths areinvolved in Drug trafficking and the implication is that these youths stay out of school. Education, especially education being made available to the poor, is key to development in theway that it empowers people. This research intends to investigate and appraise cross -border crimes andits effect on the economy of Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Cross border crimes have slowed down growth and development rates in which most West African nations should attain globalization and free trade zones have numerous advantages to an economy-either capitalist or mixed. These benefits are enjoyed when due processes and legal activities between countries are carried out. However, in areas with some restrictions in trade, high unemployment rates, high poverty rates as often witnessed in most developing nations, the reverse is the case. Revenue realizable from most products smuggled in and out of the nation is enough to build schools, good roads and other social amenities in Nigeria.</p> <p>Cross border criminal activities in West Africa straddle weak borders into specific geographical location in affected countries where state capacity to respond to the threat and challenges posed by these illegal activities is equally weak. The smuggling of goods, especially cocoa, timber, ivory and petroleum products across national borders is most prevalent along Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria and Burkina Faso corridors of the sub-region.Cross border crimes are increasingly becoming sophisticated by each passing day with devastating consequences on the economies of countries, particularly Third World countries. The tendency is that, these crimes affect monies available to government to provide basic amenities for the poor. These basic amenities may include medical or health facilities, education, housing, income and the provision of other infrastructural facilities like road electricity, water and others.</p> <p>Ordinary business men, women and sometimes rebels and criminal gangs are involved in the smuggling of these and other products. These goods are smuggled in vehicles or on foot, using secret and illegal routes across the borders to evade special regulations, levies or taxes, thereby making more income through the cross border action of these products.</p> <p>For instance Nigeria, Senegal and Ivory Coast were named and shamed for allegedly fuelling the illegal Ivory Trade. Having largely wiped out their own elephant population, the three countries were believed to be importing and selling tonnes of ivory which had been poached in nearby countries.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study is to examine cross border crimes and socio-economic development of ECOWAS member states. Specific objectives of the study are:</p> <ol><li>To identify various cross border crimes perpetuated in ECOWAS member states.</li> <li>To examine the challenges posed by cross border crimes and how these challenges affect the socio-economic growth of Nigeria in particular and other ECOWAS member states.</li> <li>To appraise the effectiveness of various machineries put in ground by the government to curb cross border crimes.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In-order to achieve the objectives of the research, the following research questions was formulated:</p> <ol><li>How effective are the various machineries put in place by the government to curb cross border crimes?</li> <li>What are the challenges posed by cross border crimes and how has these challenges affected the socio-economic growth of Nigeria and other ECOWAS member states?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5. HYPOTHESES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>H0:     There is no significant relationship between cross border crimes and the economic development of Nigeria.</p> <p>H1:     There is significant relationship between cross border crimes and the economic development of Nigeria.</p> <p>H0      The level of cross border crimes  in Nigeria is high</p> <p>H1:     The level of cross border crime in Nigeria is low</p> <p>H0      The role of government in combating cross border  crime in Nigeria is low</p> <p>H1      The role of government in combating cross border  crime in Nigeria is high</p> <p><strong>1.6. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE  STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study shall analyze the nature of cross border crimes and elucidate its effect on the socio-economy of ECOWAS member states. This study would help suggest ways of building a vibrant and sound economy by reducing the increase in criminal activities. This work will investigate and appraise cross border crimes and its effect on the economy of Nigeria.</p> <p>It shall provide a significant source of information for security analyst and law enforcement professionals as well as the general public.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study covers cross border crimes in ECOWAS member states from 2004-2014, using Nigeria as a case study.</p> <p>1.8 <strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <ol><li><strong>CROSS BORDER CRIME:</strong>Cross border crime represent a number of illegal and notorious activities carried out by individuals and groupsacross national and international borders, eitherfor financial or economic benefits and also socio political or religious considerations.

It is among the increasing and fierce violation of human rights that hinders women of security, equality, personal dignity, self-worth and right to enjoy fundamental freedom. Domestic violence against women exists in many countries in the world, throughout the boundaries of culture, class, education, income, ethnicity and age (Un Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women and General Assembly Resolution 1993).</p> <p>Women Aid Collective (WACOL 2004) pointed that domestic violence can be likened to anything that provokes an action taken against someone, which is capable of robbing the individual his or her fundamental human rights. (Women Aid Collective 2004) also pointed that domestic violence is a kind bullying whereby an individual is dealt with physical or mal handled, hence resulting to injury on the individual just because the attacker cannot control the situation when it goes wild.</p> <p>Kantor in Yogo (2008), pointed out that domestic violence is a serious global topic that is always associated with women’s segregation from supportive ties to kin. It is a very vital component of gender-based violence that has been defined as those actions and activities that can result to emotional, physical and psychological damage to a person as a result of a mere misunderstanding (Ityavyar in Okeph, 2005). As an existing issue, violence against women however, relates to a large spectrum of issues bothering the existence of the female gender in relation to the family. The female counterparts suffer in there marital homes because God himself constituted marriage in the Garden of Eden and further subjected women to be a help mate. So consequently, our social system places women in an unfortunate position (Okpeh, 1999).</p> <p>The Study of Secretary General of United Nation (2004) further explained that early marriage has to do with marriage of a child below the age of 18 years. Young</p> <p>The study of Secretary General of United Nation (2004) explained that early marriage involves the marriage of a child below the age of 18 years. Young girls have not achieved full maturity and capacity to act, and lack ability to control their sexuality. When they marry and have children, their health can be adversely affected. Early marriage has inflicted dangerous and devastating effects on young girls who are compelled to tie the knot in most cases.</p> <p>The convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) adopt in (1979) affirmed that the principle of fundamental rights and freedom of every human being are guided by a broad concept of human right that stretches beyond civil and political rights to the core issues of economic survival, health and education that affect the quality of daily life for most women and children. United Nation General Assembly (1993) postulated that violence and abusive behaviour continue to be a major cause of death, injury, stress and fear in various families. Domestic violence and abusive behaviour are responsible for poor family relationship, although personality conflicts and troubles within a marriage affect intimate behaviour, (Olson and Defrain 2006).</p> <p>Htt://bahai-library.com.(2000) stated that, family relationship refers to unity which is strengthened by love. The members of the family all have duties and responsibilities toward one another and to the family as a whole. These duties and responsibilities vary from member to member because of their natural relationships. Such behavior can be seen in a man that stopped the wife from government employment and made her to engage in preparation and sales of local wine (burukutu) for many years. The woman could not further her education after primary school certificate.</p> <p><strong>1.2                  Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>This study’s problem was based on, the researcher’s experiences, conversations and observations on the happenings in families. Husbands and wives do not discuss family issues but husbands take sole decisions. Through interactions with friends and colleagues, women talk about their situations at home, there they are commonly abused by their spouses through battering, sexual abuse, giving out female children in marriage at the early years and depriving them neither to participate in the decision of child marriage nor to take part in family affairs. Such early marriages limit education, affects young girls’ academic pursuits, the future compromised and other opportunities often leading to early child bearing and increased health risks. Early child bearing affects female reproductive organs and health problems such as unsafe abortion, and obstetric fistula. Husbands take decision whether it suits the family or not. Though most wives and children suffer the consequences of the heads of the families decisions.</p> <p>It is also observed that violation of women at home has made women situation difficult to participate fully in issues concerning them in the home and in the society. As such, women have no freedom to speak for themselves because of fear of punishment from their husbands. Men think women are meant for giving birth, taking care of the children and doing only domestic works. The problem statement pf the study therefore was whether domestic violence against women had effects on family relations.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Objectives of the study</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study was to assess domestic violence against women on family relationship.</p> <p>The specific objectives were to: </p> <ol><li>assess the effects of spousal abuse against women on family relationship in Taraba State;</li> </ol> <ol><li>examine the effects of sexual abuse against women on family relationship in Taraba State;</li> </ol> <ol><li>identify the effects of early marriage of young girls on family relationship in Taraba State; and</li> </ol> <ol><li>examine the effects of deprivation of women rights in decision making on family relationship in Taraba State.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4                  Research Questions</strong></p> <p>This study provided answers to the following research questions </p> <ol><li>to what extent has spousal abuse against women affected women and family relationship in Taraba State?</li> </ol> <ol><li>what are the effects of sexual abuse against women on family relationship in Taraba State?</li> </ol> <ol><li>to what extent has early marriage of young girls affected women on family relationship in Taraba State?</li> </ol> <ol><li>to what extent has deprivation of women’s rights in decision making affected family relationship in Taraba State?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5                  Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The following research hypotheses were postulated:-</p> <p>H01: There is no significant relationship between the effects of spousal abuse against women and family relationship in Taraba State.</p> <p>H02: There is no significant relationship between the effects of sexual abuse against women and family relationship in Taraba State.</p> <p>H03:                 There is no significant relationship between the effects of early marriage of young women and family relationship in Taraba State.</p> <p>H04:               There is no significant relationship between the effects of deprivation of women’s right in decision making and family relationship in Taraba State.</p> <p><strong>1.6                  Basic Assumption</strong></p> <ol><li>This study assumed that domestic violence against women affects women physically, morally, emotionally and psychologically. This retards the progress of families, the state and the nation at large.</li> </ol> <ol><li>It is assumed that when domestic violence against women is controlled, it will reduce the rate of sexually transmitted diseases (HIV/AIDS) and there will be fewer rates of deaths in the families and state.</li> </ol> <ol><li>It is assumed that talks on domestic violence against women will create awareness, thereby allowing women to participate in decision making in the family which will contribute to the development of the families, state and Nigeria as a nation.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.7                  Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>The findings of this study will help women in Taraba State to identify domestic violence. Through enlightenment they will learn to cope with such situations and be able to enjoy their relationship in the family.</p> <p>The findings of this study will enable home economists to improve the content in family life relationship through teaching of students. It will help husband and wife to sit together to discuss family issues and take decision.</p> <p>The findings will educate individuals and families through teachings in the classrooms in Home Economics subjects and courses, through seminars, conferences, giving talks to religious organizations in the church and mosques, in public religion gatherings. The knowledge gained from such teaching will broaden the knowledge of men to consider women as instrument for change because when women are educated, the whole family will be educated either directly or indirectly.</p> <p>The findings will make husbands to involve their wives in decision making for the progress of their families and to give women rights and privileges for a harmonious relationship since the genesis of human behaviour starts in the home.</p> <p><strong>1.8                  Delimitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study covered different kinds of domestic violence such as spousal abuse, sexual abuse, and early marriage of young girls and deprivation of women’s rights in decision-making on family relationship.</p> <p>The reason for choosing married men and women is that, they are people that have gone through violent behaviour in the home. As such they are in a better position to say much about domestic violence. It was delimited to married men and women in four Local Government Areas in Taraba State.</p>\n\nCAUSES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ABUSE AGAINST WOMEN AND ITS EFFECTS ON FAMILY RELATIONSHIP IN FOUR SELECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CAUSES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ABUSE AGAINST WOMEN AND ITS EFFECTS ON FAMILY RELATIONSHIP IN FOUR SELECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN NIGERIA", "id": 3}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong><br/>  <br/>It is not exaggeration that despite the effort of NAPTIP and other bodies like the ILO, there are still cases and reports of women and child trafficking in Nigeria. There are occasions where hospitals take in young pregnant girls, offer them money for their babies ranging from N20,000-N25,000, which they in turn sell between N150,000-N30,000 depending on the gender of the baby. Regrettably, many Nigerian children in particular and Africa in general are prone to the whims and caprices of human traffickers at a very astronomical rate. Some of the problems of trafficking in persons are; the past and present military and political leaders lack political will of the states to deal with the current issues despite large budgetary amount that was earmarked to deal with the issue of all sorts of criminal activities, parents and relations of trafficked persons are never interested in helping law enforcement officials to discourage their children or alert the officers responsible for the prohibition of trafficking in persons, The absence of reliable records in the offices of NAPTIP, various ministry of justice and some police departments on crimes and victimization has hindered the understanding of crime pattern and trend of human trafficking, the lack of enforcement mechanisms in to search arrest and prosecutions of the suspects of trafficking and deal with them in accordance with provisions of the law is another problem. Some of the objectives are; to examine the laws on trafficking, to examine the application of the law on the offence of trafficking, also to establish findings on the application of those laws on the offence of trafficking and to provide recommendations. The findings are; the judiciary and administrative mechanisms for the prevention of human trafficking is ineffective, illiteracy contribute a lot to backwardness of combating human trafficking, Nigerian anti-trafficking law in itself does not provide a serious punishment that is commensurate with the gravity of the offences, it has been observed that there has been a problem of lack of coordination between international agencies and the Nigerian domestic agencies, i.e. NAPTIP and other law enforcement agencies that are meant for protection of trafficking. The recommendations are; Judicial and administrative mechanisms should be strengthened where necessary to enable victims to obtain prompt and adequate redress through formal and informal procedures that are expeditious, fair, inexpensive and accessible, Need to educate the public about the rights and duties of suspects, offenders, victims and the state as stakeholders in the criminal justice system, Need to further re-examine our criminal justice administration with a view to addressing the problems created by our inheritance of a colonial system which extols the theory of law and state to the point that recognizes only the state and the offender as the “parties” to criminal proceedings, and to the attendant neglect of the rights and welfare of the victim.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>  <br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>  <br/>1.1      Background to the Study<br/>It is not exaggeration that despite the effort of National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) and other bodies like the International Labour Organization (ILO)1, there are still cases and reports of women and child trafficking in Nigeria. There are occasions where hospitals take in young pregnant girls, offer them money for their babies ranging from N20,000-N25,000,which they in turn sell between N150,000-N30,000 depending on the gender of the baby2. Regrettably, many Nigerian children in particular and Africa in general are prone to the whims and caprices of human traffickers at a very astronomical rate. This however, truncates their chances of being exposed to proper and standard education and/or training that is expected to transform them into becoming part of the available human capital resource in Nigeria and the entire Africa.If human capital development centres on the education and training of human being within a society and human trafficking involves the movement of human beings illegally from one location to another for the purposes of exploitation and money making, then trafficking in persons should be considered as a serious impediment to the development of human capital of any nation. As a matter of regret, it is unfortunate to disclose that the women and children who are trafficked from Nigeria to other nations for the development of such destination countries would have been the same people who ought to have been developed and used in Nigerian nation3.Train up a child well, and he or she would become a functional future adult member of society, bound with the responsibility of developing the nation4.<br/>The act of women and child trafficking in Nigeria and West Africa in general has become a common phenomenon, which involves young boys and girls on the average age of 15years, which are mainly girls.60%- 80% of them are sent to Italy for sex trade and the common routes are west coast of Nigeria to Mali, morocco, boat to Spain or west coast of Nigeria to Libya and Saudi Arabia. It has been estimated that about 15 million children are engaged in child labour in Nigeria and 40% of them are of the risk of being used for entertainment, pornography, armed conflict, rituals and forced labour5. Adenekan further revealed that traffickers lure children to leave their homes promising them education and training abroad, though due to poverty some go willingly. Sometimes officials at borders and traffickers conspire to smuggle women and children out for selfish interest6.<br/>Ignorance and poverty are central reason why some parents allow their children to be taken away from them for menial works. Parents with large families too willingly give out their wards to strangers for money to enable them cater for the rest of the family.7 Traffickers prey on the vulnerability of such poor parents who are mostly illiterates to exploit them, since they are desperate for financial succor and therefore give out their children to strangers who give them money with promise to give the children quality education. Ironically the children are maltreated, physically and psychologically abused. Those that are taken as domestic servants stand the risks of being sexually exploited which invariably, exposed them to deadly diseases like HIV/AIDS8. Unfortunately, some of them are used for ritual. Majority of the people trafficked, ranging from children to girls, young women and men are usually engaged in forced labour9. Such assignments include: domestic services, agricultural activities, prostitution and extraction of some parts of their body such as kidney and at the extreme, using them for rituals. The implication of this is that the human capital strength of the country is jeopardized as the resources in human persons are being wasted sometimes very prematurely. It is germane to note that even at the local and international fronts; victims of human trafficking are mostly subjected to carrying out odd job10. These include assignments like; nannies, house helps and some other domestic works as well as street trade (hawking) which would never allow them to develop any reasonable low manpower skills, let alone middle or high level manpower skills and knowledge. Even when such victims are exposed to good education and other forms of training, they would only be withheld to make them use their skills and knowledge within their countries of destination. Furthermore, the monies made by the traffickers are sometimes used to import illegal arms and ammunitions which are used by politicians and criminals to eliminate people within the country. Consequently, this gesture reduces the number of existing human capital in Nigeria11.<br/>Apart from the inconsiderate treatment meted out on these women and children they neither feel at home in the hands of their captives, nor could they escape as the route are extremely risky. Stories abound on how women and children who are victims of traffickers have been rescued at border posts. Some rescued from refrigerated trucks severely dehydrated. Regardless of their age or sex; the women and children try to survive in a cruel environment. If we believe that children are the leaders of tomorrow, what type of future do we anticipate for a nation where child trafficking remains a lucrative business in our country12.<br/>The effects of trafficking are devastating therefore having negative consequences on our children. Isolated from their families, as well as communities and culture, most of these children find it difficult to trace their roots as a result of long wasted years or the influence exerted by their masters. Those women and children are denied their rights to in rare cases, some that managed to return to their villages finds it thorny to adjust to the new environment. The act of child trafficking is inhuman using our children as objects of transaction and its effects on the Nigeria include loss of lives, violence and crime, school drop outs, impaired children, poor national image, massive deportation of Nigerian girls. This, in addition, has worsened the regions growing AIDS crises because of the sexual exploitation of the victims13. It seems some parents do not help the matter as they occasionally  defended  traffickers  after  the  arrest  claiming  they  have  their  consents. <br/>Nigeria is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically conditions of forced labor and forced prostitution. Trafficked Nigerian women and children are recruited from rural areas within the country‟s borders − women and girls for involuntary domestic servitude and forced commercial sexual exploitation, and boys for forced labour in street vending, domestic servitude, mining, and begging. Nigerian women and children are taken from Nigeria to other West and Central African countries, primarily Gabon, Cameroon, Ghana, Chad, Benin, Togo, Niger, Burkina Faso, and the Gambia, for the same purposes15. Children from West African states like Benin, Togo, and Ghana – where Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) rules allow for easy entry – are also forced to work in Nigeria, and some are subjected to hazardous jobs in Nigeria‟s granite mines. Nigerian women and girls are taken to Europe16, especially to Italy and Russia, and to the Middle East and North Africa, for forced prostitution17. Traffickers sometimes move their victims to Europe by caravan, forcing them to cross the desert on foot, and subjecting them to forced prostitution to repay heavy debts for travel expenses. During the reporting period, Nigerian girls were repatriated from Libya and Morocco, where they were reportedly held captive in the commercial sex trade18.<br/>The Government of Nigeria fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. It demonstrated sustained progress to combat human trafficking during the reporting period. In 2009, the government convicted 25 trafficking offenders and provided care for 1,109 victims, increases over the previous reporting period19. It also continued to undertake strong efforts to raise awareness of human trafficking. In addition, its National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) ensured the practice of interrogating trafficking suspects at the same Lagos facility housing its shelter for trafficking victims. To better ensure victims‟ rights are respected, NAPTIP formed a committee in mid-2009 to review victim care policies, aiming to strike a balance between ensuring victims‟ safety in shelters and promoting their freedom of movement. The Nigerian government in 2009 pledged over $7 million in annual funds for NAPTIP‟s operation and activities; all government programs received partial payment pending budget approval by legislative and executive branches. Due to a four-month delay in approval of the 2010 national budget, funds were distributed to all federal agencies in April 201020.<br/>The Government of Nigeria sustained law enforcement efforts to combat trafficking in 2003. The 2003 Trafficking in Persons Law Enforcement and Administration Act, amended to increase penalties for trafficking offenders, prohibits all forms of human trafficking. The law‟s prescribed penalties of five years‟ imprisonment and/or a $670 fine for labor trafficking, 10 years‟ imprisonment for trafficking of children for forced begging or hawking, and 10 years to life imprisonment for sex trafficking are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Nigeria‟s 2003 Child Rights Act also criminalizes child trafficking, though only 23 of the country‟s 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory, have enacted it. According to the Nigerian constitution, laws pertaining to children‟s rights fall under state purview; therefore, the Child Rights Act must be adopted by individual state legislatures to be fully implemented. NAPTIP reported 149 investigations, 26 prosecutions, and 25 convictions of trafficking offenses during the reporting period under the 2003 trafficking in Persons Act.21 Sentences ranged from two months to 10 years, with an average sentence of 2.66 years‟ imprisonment; only two convicted offenders were offered the option of paying a fine instead of serving prison time. Together with international partners, the government provided specialized training to officials on how to recognize, investigate, and prosecute instances of trafficking. Police and immigration officials, including those who work at border posts and airports, at times allegedly accepted bribes to overlook trafficking crimes. NAPTIP dismissed two staff members from public service who were found to have diverted victims‟ funds; they were made to refund the money back. Nigeria continued its efforts to protect trafficking victims in 2009. Police, customs, immigration, and NAPTIP officials systematically employed procedures to identify victims among high-risk persons, such as young women or girls traveling with non-family members. Data provided by NAPTIP reflected a total of 1,109 victims identified and provided assistance at one of NAPTIP‟s eight shelters throughout the country during the reporting period; 624 were cases of trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation and 328 for labor exploitation. Various government agencies referred trafficking victims to NAPTIP for sheltering and other protective services: immigration referred 465; police referred 277; Social Services referred 192; and the State Security Service referred nine. Shelter staff assessed the needs of victims upon arrival and provided food, clothing, shelter, recreational activities, and instruction on various skills, including vocational training; psychological counseling was provided to only the most severe cases. While at NAPTIP‟s shelters, 70 victims received vocational training assistance provided by government funding. NAPTIP estimated the government‟s 2009 spending on its shelter facilities to be $666,000. The 2003 trafficking in Persons Law Enforcement and Administration Act provides for treatment, protection, and non-discriminatory practices for victims22. The law specified no trafficking victim could be detained for any offense committed as a result of being trafficked. During the reporting period, the government took steps to relocate victims‟ quarters a considerable distance from detention areas for trafficking offenders, greatly reducing the possibility traffickers could exert undue influence over their victims. Victims were allowed to stay in government shelters for six weeks. If a longer time period was needed, civil society partner agencies were contacted to take in the victim. Officials encouraged victims to assist with the investigation and prosecution of traffickers, and victims served as witnesses in all of NAPTIP‟s successful cases. Victims could theoretically seek redress through civil suits against traffickers, or claim funds from a Victims‟ Trust Fund set up in 2009 through which assets confiscated from traffickers are transferred to victims. The Trust Fund committee is chaired by the Minister of Justice and meets four times per year. The government provided a limited legal alternative to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face hardship or retribution – short-term residency that cannot be extended.<br/>The Government of Nigeria sustained strong efforts to raise awareness of human trafficking over the last year. NAPTIP‟s Public Enlightenment Unit worked throughout the reporting period on national and local programming to raise awareness. For example, in rural Benue, Kogi, and Edo States, NAPTIP introduced grassroots programs and held its first annual race against human trafficking in Edo State with 5,000 runners23. On the national level, it convened the 2009 Model UN Conference for secondary students with a theme of combating human trafficking. Furthermore, a nine-state tour was launched to establish state working groups against human trafficking. The objective of these and several related programs was to sensitize vulnerable people, sharpen public awareness of trends and tricks traffickers used to lure victims, warn parents, and share ideas among stakeholders. Audiences ranged from 50 to 5,000 persons. NAPTIP worked with Immigration Services to monitor emigration and immigration patterns for evidence of trafficking. The long-established Stakeholder Forum continued quarterly meetings in Abuja to foster collaboration among agencies. In August 2009, NAPTIP held a stakeholders‟ workshop in Kaduna to set program priorities and cost estimates for implementing the National Plan of Action, which was established in 200824. Nigerian troops undergo mandatory human rights and human trafficking training in preparation for peacekeeping duties abroad. The government did not take major action to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts, though officials moved to shut down two brothels in Lagos during the first quarter of 2010. At these brothels, authorities rescued 12 females, including six underage victims of trafficking. One property owner was convicted, sentenced to two years in prison, and required to forfeit his hotel; his case remained under appeal at the end of the reporting period. The second brothel owner‟s trial was ongoing and he remained totally free on bail25.<br/>Women and children have become the victims of crimes in many part of the country26. Serious crimes like sexual violence27, domestic violence against women28, human-trafficking29, cultural and religious crimes against women30, child labour, unnecessary killings by different groups31, kidnapping32, etc. Children become vulnerable to being trafficked for a number of reasons, with the root causes being poverty and lack of opportunities, corruption and instability and/or armed conflict. Their parents may pay for them to be taken to another country, in the hope that they will gain employment and a better life abroad. Alternatively, children may be sold to traffickers by their parents, or kidnapped by such groups. Street children are particularly susceptible to becoming trafficking victims, as are children who suffer from other forms of discrimination. In the Niger Delta, children who have been stigmatized as „witches‟ are extremely at risk as they are usually rejected by their families and communities, and often live on the streets with no-one to care for them33.<br/>However, the unending issue of human trafficking still exists in the 21st century. Governments, international organizations and civil society are devoting considerable efforts to counter it, but there is still an information deficit about the extent of this tragedy. Only by understanding its depth, breadth and scope can we design policies to fight it. This understanding still eludes us; efforts to counter trafficking have so far been uncoordinated and inefficient. The above problems compelled the current research work to make an analysis of the concept of trafficking on women and children generally, with a view of providing workable recommendations to the identified problems.<br/>  <br/>1.2      The Statement of Research Problem<br/>The problems for study are as follows:<br/>1. In the last few decades, humanity has witnessed the emergence of several patterns of crimes of human trafficking. Nigeria has not been exclusive as it is confronted with pervasive crime waves, issues of “Boko Haram” officially called “Western Education is sacrilege or a sin”33, in the North-East and some North-Western states, for example, attacks by “Boko-Haram” in Baga, Gwoza and other parts of Borno State that caused massive displacement34, for example, the Book Haram group has abducted school girls at Chibok. Some of the girls were raped, some were allegedly sold to unknown persons, while some were forced into compulsory marriage at N10, 000: 00 dowry. even if the taking away of Chibok girls does not amount to human trafficking, their constitutional right to education, personal liberty, right to associate with their family members, development and right not to be subjected to force labour and or any degrading or inhuman treatment as enshrined in the Constitution35 has been violated. Loss of thousand of lives, destruction of houses and taking hostage of student girls, small children and their mothers, kidnapping in the Southern part of the country, which has compounded the problem of insecurity in the country. In the cities, hoodlums unleash terror on unsuspecting citizens, and bandits are reported to man many Nigeria link roads. There is also the problem of identification of criminals and those who train, fund, and harbor them. Upon all these criminal activities there has rarely been an instance where the criminals are prosecuted by the relevant authorities and the victims of such crimes are left unprotected. Another problem is also that in many occasions, women and children who are among the most vulnerable group of the society are mostly affected as victims of such crimes, whether of a primary or secondary degree, and whether in time of war or not. Women and children are always victims of sexual harassments like gang-rape, rape, defilement, all in the course of trafficking. Women and children are left handicap by the government, by not paying much attention to their predicaments. Women and children only end up getting meager donation from both the Federal and States governments, as if there are no laws or judicial arm to deal with the perpetrators of such crimes.<br/>  <br/>1. The past and present military and political leaders lack political will of the states to deal with the current issues despite large budgetary amount that was earmarked to deal with the issue of all sorts of criminal activities like human trafficking in the country36, they are not willing to put an end to the commission of such crimes and insecurity issues in the country neither are they showing any deep concern about the current position of the victims of those crimes, despite the country‟s police, civil defence and military personnel that are stationed in all angles of the country.<br/>  <br/>1. The absence of reliable records in the offices of NAPTIP, various ministry of justice and some police departments on crimes and victimization has hindered the understanding of crime pattern and trend of human trafficking in the country. Apart from identifying human trafficking trends, victim surveys help to elicit a clearer picture of levels of human trafficking victimization as well as the opinion of a cross-section of society on matters relating to human trafficking and punishment, their perception of the criminal justice agencies and the methods of handling offenders and victims of human trafficking. Such information collected from victims also covers their experience before, during and after the offence has occurred. It constitutes a better indicator of the level of crime than the number of crimes reported to and recorded by the police. As Mueller37argues, gathering information about crime victims would not only help analyzing victim-offender relationships, but also in planning crime prevention and control38.<br/>  <br/>1. Another problem lays in the lack of enforcement mechanisms in to search arrest and prosecution of the suspects of trafficking on women and children and deal with them in accordance with the provisions of the law. For example, Boko Haram abducted more than 200 Chibok girls in Borno State. But since then, nothing has been done to deal with the issue apart from propaganda by the authorities concerned in the Medias.<br/>  <br/>1. Lastly, parents and relations of trafficked persons are never interested in helping law enforcement officials to discourage their children or alert the officers responsible for the prohibition of trafficking in persons.<br/>  <br/>The above problems of study are still in the increase in Nigeria, which needs urgent intervention and control.<br/>1.3      Objectives of the Research<br/>  <br/>The objectives of this research are:<br/>  <br/>1. To examine the laws on trafficking on women and children in Nigeria.<br/>  <br/>1. To examine the application of the law on the offence of trafficking on women and children.<br/>  <br/>1. To establish findings on the application of those laws on the offence of trafficking.<br/>  <br/>1. to provide recommendations. <br/>1.4      Scope of the Research<br/>The research examined international and municipal literatures that are relevant to the offence of trafficking in Nigeria, with particular emphasis on women and children as victims, being the most vulnerable groups in the society.<br/>  <br/>1.5      Justification of the Study<br/>It is justifiable to conduct research on the topic from time to time in order to provide a current finding on the above problems. It also improved the existing literatures on the knowledge of the concept of trafficking on women and children in Nigeria, both at national and international levels. It further contributed positively to the legal knowledge of regulations and procedures for the protection of human trafficking and victims of such crime in Nigeria and at international parlance, particularly to lecturers and students as well as provided materials for future research on the topic.<br/>1.6      Literature Review<br/>In order to explain the meaning, nature and the concept of trafficking on women and children as it affects the Nigerian populace, study has been made of literary from the municipal and foreign sources. For example, statutes, case laws, textbooks, articles, journals, seminar papers, internet sources, etc. were used and acknowledged. The foundation for the research is based on contributions of writers on the field of criminology and criminal victimization as well as victims of crimes in Nigeria. The following existing literatures were used in the course of this research.<br/>According to Adenekan, A.39 The phenomenon of slavery, no doubt, dates back to the ancient times when victorious armies and tribes in Europe and Asia found it more profitable to use as slave, people they caught in wars than to murder them just like that. In many Asian countries, likewise in Israel, slaves were bought and used for various domestic and farm labour. In the 14th century Europe, these unfortunate men and women caught at wars were known as serfs, a title that classified them as members of the lowest order and are “owned”, in most cases, by the lords of the manor. They attended to his mundane wishes, work in farms and depended solely on him for their livelihood40.<br/>The above author maintains that going by the history, the Portuguese started kidnapping and poaching human beings as far back as 1442 in the west coast of Africa particularly in countries like the Gold Coast (the present Ghana), Togo, Benin, and Nigeria while in 1517, they encouraged Spain to embrace the “lucrative” inhuman market. The English<br/>followed in 1553, France in 1624 and soon after the Dutch, the Danes, and America. Africa, in 1650, had a population of about 100 million (20 per cent of the then existing world), 90m million in 1800, 95 million in 1850 and 120 million in 190041.<br/>The author further views that taking into account the high profitability of the illicit trade in which human beings were the fiscal wares, many crude methods were employed for the security of the diabolical ventures. Cases were reported whereby houses in villages and hamlets were irrationally set ablaze in the middle of the nights just in order to catch hapless individuals including women and children for sale in open market like common household commodities42. According to the above author, the illicit trade was always a subject of many crude channels. European ships were chartered by the merchants to take manufactured goods to the coast of Africa and on reaching the destination, the commodities were exchanged for slaves who would be later taken to the West Indies and sold for huge profits. In this place, their merchants used their money to buy commodities like sugar, coffee and tobacco which would be later taken back to Europe. Since the ultimate intention of the trade is to make huge profit, the ship captains loaded as much as healthy slaves for the lowest possible price. They normally had a system whereby the captains would bring a fewer number of slaves in their ships so that the chance of disease and death would be reduced to the barest minimum. It is quite apparent that hundreds of thousands of African men, women and children are forced by ever worsening environmental, economic and social circumstances into situations of labor and sexual<br/>exploitation both within and outside the continent every year. Trafficking in persons – the modern day slavery is evidently a serious threat to human security and development. Right now, awareness of trafficking increases gradually because of the vigilance on vehicles conveying child laborers to markets and plantations in different places. In Nigeria for example, an International Labour Organization (ILO) report found that 40% of the street children and street hawkers were victims of trafficking. In March 2002 for example, it was said that eight million Nigerian children undergo the worst forms of child labour serving as domestic servants, street beggars, hawkers, agricultural laborers and prostitutes.43He maintains that at least 60% of foreign prostitutes in Italy are from African countries with the most of them from Nigeria. Nigerian and Italian authorities estimate that there are from 10,000 to 15,000 Nigerian prostitutes in Italy alone. Trafficking of foreign women into South Africa for commercial sexual exploitation from other areas of Africa, Europe and South East Asia is not only growing but appears to be controlled by organized criminal gangs from Bulgaria, Russia, Thailand, China, and Nigeria44.<br/>It is very clear that without serious and sustained political will at the top levels of governments and throughout societies; intervention will remain limited compared to the scope and magnitude of the problem. Traffickers will continue to victimize African men, women and children, depriving them of their basic human rights, depriving countries of critical human capital to compete in the global economy and also governments of the ability to establish law and order within their own borders.<br/>According to Ricco, V.45 and Attoh, F.46 majority of the people trafficked, ranging from children to girls, young women and men are usually engaged in forced labour. Such assignments include: domestic services, agricultural activities, prostitution and extraction of some parts of their body such as kidney and at the extreme, using them for rituals. The implication of this is that the human capital strength of the country is jeopardized as the resources in human persons are being wasted sometimes very prematurely47. It is germane to note that even at the local and international fronts; victims of human trafficking are mostly subjected to carrying out odds jobs. These include assignments like; nannies, house helps and some other domestic works as well as street trade (hawking) which would never allow them to develop any reasonable low manpower skills, let alone middle or high level manpower skills and knowledge. Thus the people trafficked are usually under-developed while, it would also amount to Nigerian nation remaining at the developing stage. Ricco48 simply sees human trafficking as a modern or contemporary slavery. Such victims are forcefully or deceptively, collected and sold to others whom in most cases; mutilate their bodies in the name of branding or guarding against possible escape of such persons, and engaging them in all sorts of inhuman jobs including prostitution. Perhaps the basic distinction between the traditional slavery and the contemporary “human trafficking”, could be the sophisticated means of transportation and communication systems which the latter utilizes in the delivery of trafficked human beings to various destination ports49.<br/>Attoh50 defines human trafficking though, with emphasis on the female sex as “the illicit movement of young women across international borders for certain exploitative purposes.” She affirms that such unlawful movements usually take a bottom-top dimension. That is, it involves the exploitation of victims from the developing and underdeveloped countries to the developed nations. Which ever angle one looks at trafficking in persons, it is quite glaring that it has to do with taking people or someone away from his or her environment to a different location to do some work and other very odd things which ordinarily he or she would not accept doing. Whether the consent of such a person was sought and approval given before the said movement is immaterial. What most likely qualifies a victim as a trafficked person is that the fellow would be in another environment where he or she would be subjected to doing things against his or her volition. In other words, the fundamental rights of freedom of movement, association and even expression may have been denied such victims in question.<br/>Awopegba, P.51 opines that Nigeria remains under-developed partly because of unplanned efforts towards the development of human capital; it could be argued further that, the state of under-development in the country may be attributed to the reduction of the human beings who ought to have been developed as human capital through<br/>trafficking in persons. According to the author trafficking in persons mostly, takes place from the South (developing countries) to the North (developed countries) and makes way for the transfer of human resource elements from the under-developed and developing countries to the developed countries of the world. This could be further explained as a conscious attempt by the North to further under-develop Africa and some other nations in Asia and other continents of the world. Some people may also contend that trafficking in persons satisfies their utilitarian needs since, they can afford to make immediate financial gains but the long term effect would always be felt by the dearth of human capital in Nigeria. The number of Nigerians trafficked to Europe since the late 1990s were only able to generate fund for the traffickers to invest in other illicit trades and activities like drug trafficking and other mafia related businesses such as oil bunkering and exportation as well as importation and proliferation of arms and ammunitions. One may describe human trafficking as a cyclic process of evil against the development of human capital of Nigeria and many other nations where it thrives. Even when such victims are exposed to good education and other forms of training, they would only be withheld to make them use their skills and knowledge within their countries of destination. Furthermore, the monies made by the traffickers are sometimes used to import illegal arms and ammunitions which are used by politicians and criminals to eliminate some group of people within the country. Consequently, this gesture reduces the number of existing human capital in Nigeria and creates tension by eliminating people or group of people.<br/>As pointed out by Dave-Odigie, C.52 “human trafficking deprives Nigeria of her human resources.” Although, she observes that majority of those trafficked are semi-literate and non-literates, the point remains that such people would have become part of human capital base of the country, were they conserved, educated and trained. The author further explains that human trafficking also reduces the population of human resource to death. For example, a good number of the trafficked persons especially, those who are used for prostitution, are more often vulnerable to the contraction of HIV/AIDS and other Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) because they are compelled to engage in unprotected sex. This in most cases results in premature death of such victims. Ironically, those who patronize the prostitutes too, become prone to the contraction of HIV/AIDS and subsequently face sudden deaths, even though they were not direct victims of human trafficking. Regrettably, trafficking in human beings certainly reduces the life expectancy of both the victims of the illicit business and that of normal persons in Nigerian society. This affects the country‟s human capital base adversely. However, apart from pushing talents and human resources out of Africa through human trafficking as he submits, the locally consumed trafficked victims are subjected to personal under-development and further reduction in human capital development of Nigeria and other affected nations of Africa and the World in general.<br/>Jegede, S.53 suggested that a nation should have at least 65 per cent literacy level in development. Thus, there is need to shift a pragmatic attention to the promotion of literacy programme or even design further programmes in that direction so as to reduce the high percentage of illiteracy in Nigeria and that of other developing African countries. Since illiteracy leads to poverty and poverty escalates human trafficking, which ostensibly jeopardizes the development of human capital in Nigeria, there is an urgent need to objectively, implement all the policies that relate to the advancement of Adult literacy and Non-formal education programmes and improve the general standard of education in the country.<br/>According to Dalaker, J. and Proctor, B.54 farmers are more likely to be victims of poverty than people who live and work in cities. As a result, since the greater percent of Nigerians reside in the rural areas and engage in farm works, poverty is more pronounced there. This makes the poor people in the rural areas more prone to trafficking. Even in cities, there is the “underclass,” that is, the persistently poor, unemployed and dependent people who dominate the inner city. This class of individuals can voluntarily surrender themselves to be trafficked. Young girls are compelled to joining trafficking due to the inability of families to meet their primary responsibilities.<br/>Butegwa, F.55 capture unemployment and poverty, as the major push for women participation in trafficking in persons. The authors maintain that trafficking in women in Nigeria is necessitated by unemployment, low socio-economic status and perhaps ignorance of the long term effect of the act on victims and society.<br/>According to Aghatise, E.56 Poor implementation of laws that apply to the issue of human trafficking appears to be a contributing factor to the rapid growth and development of the illicit trade. For example, how many of the traffickers and their agents caught are prosecuted, let alone giving appropriate punishment? Thus, human traffickers tend to take undue advantage of the gap in the judicial system to perpetrate such heinous crimes against humanity and society. The author states that the law enforcement agents in Nigeria investigated 209 trafficking cases and convicted 23, the figure remains very infinitesimal when compared with the rate at which people are trafficked as reported in the media. High rate of illiteracy in developing countries is also responsible for people becoming vulnerable to human trafficking. It is quite easy to deceive illiterates into being trafficked than the educated persons. At least, an educated person would be conscious of getting involved in the crime unlike the illiterate who is more likely to believe false stories without asking logical questions.<br/>Joseph, U.57 maintains that Juju is another major factor that “lubricates the wheel of human trafficking” in Nigeria. From the accounts of repentant traffickers, it was revealed that victims are usually mandated to seal their agreement with oath in shrines of voodoo or juju priests. The fear of loosing their lives to oaths compels them to conceal the identities of traffickers from authorities. This claim is evident in the assertion of Abdulrahim Shaibu58, The Deputy Director of NAPTIP‟s Prosecution and Legal Services, who maintains that the agency had problems prosecuting traffickers because victims are afraid of coming out in court to expose the supposed culprits due to the juju oaths they were forced to take.<br/>John Egwu a retired Assistant Comptroller General of Immigration Service, as quoted by Nwagbo, N.59 states that, “victims of human trafficking are the main reason why the business thrives”. In his words, “the people who are being trafficked are willing tools and they are never willing to cooperate with the officials”. According to him, parents and relations of trafficked persons are never interested in helping law enforcement officials to discourage their children or alert the officers responsible for the prohibition of trafficking in persons. In the case of people trafficked into Nigeria from other countries, the retired Assistant Comptroller General of Immigration maintains that officials of those countries do not cooperate with Nigerian Immigration officials in most cases.<br/>Kidnapping is another form of trafficking that affects the development and well being of women and children in Nigeria. According to Hiscox Insurance Group, as quoted by Pharoah, R.60, in Nigeria, kidnapping for ransom started in 1992 with a single incident. By the end of 1999, the figure had grown to 34, but government did not raise alarm until 26 February 2006 when the Niger Delta militants kidnapped foreign oil workers to press home their demand. Since then kidnapping has become ubiquitous and a commercialized venture. It has spread from the Niger Delta to virtually all nooks and crannies of the country, with some states of course being hotspots. Kidnappers now make victims not only of foreign oil workers but also of Nigerians suspected to be closely related to the wealthy including parents, grandparents, and toddlers from whom they hope to get some ransom. Those behind the recent wave of the despicable act have also changed from being exclusively Niger Delta militants to dodgy elements from different walks of life - armed robbers, unemployed, fraudsters and gangsters. In a survey report rendered by Eboh, C.61, more than 1,500 persons were said to have been kidnapped in Nigeria in 2009. This was against 512 persons in 2008 and 353 in 2007. The growing incidence of kidnapping in the country suggests its profitability. Kidnapping can be classified into two: criminal and political. While criminal kidnapping has the motive of obtaining ransom from the family or business of the victims, political kidnapping has the objective of furthering the political aim of the group or movement. In this case, a monetary ransom is demanded for the group to fund their activities. This type of kidnapping differs from holding individuals against political ends, such as the release of comrades from prison. Judging by this differentiation, one can conclude that most of the kidnapping in Nigeria are criminally motivated. When the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), started kidnapping foreign oil workers in 2006, the emphasis was largely political: to gain a share of the region's wealth. Presently, many criminal gangs have taken to kidnapping and have made ransom payment their main source of income.<br/>The above literatures used in the course of this research are found resourceful to this study. The literatures reviewed above have addressed topical issues of concern on trafficking on women and children. However, this research aims at contributing current findings and recommendations.<br/>  <br/>1.7      Research Methodology<br/>One principal method was the use of data and information. The doctrinal method of research was used, using library materials such as books, articles, journals, periodicals, seminar papers, as well as internet/websites, etc.<br/></p>\n\nAN ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPT OF VICTIMS OF CRIMES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPT OF VICTIMS OF CRIMES IN NIGERIA", "id": 4}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong> INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Drugs are commonly used by everybody whether young or old. Drugs are not only useful for human beings; they are also useful for animals for good health. Human beings give drugs to their animals when they discovered that they are not healthy. Drug is an effective substance in the life of any living thing to cure sickness and to make life healthy. It is true that drugs are used for beneficent therapeutic purposes, effective substance for good health, but they are being abused by people especially youths. They use it illegally and unlawfully, thus it becomes harmful to the body.</p> <p>Drug abuse is the Use of drugs for purposes other than medical reasons, thus affecting the individual in a negative way socially, cognitively or physically Kuria (1996). Social effects may be reflected in an individual’s enhanced tendency to engage in conflicts with friends, teachers, and school authorities. Cognitive effects relate to the individual’s lack of concentration on academic work and memory loss. While Lewinsohn (2007) defines a drug as any product other than food or water that affects the way people feel, think, see, and behave. It is a substance that due to its chemical nature affects physical, mental and emotional functioning. It can enter the body through chewing, inhaling, smoking, drinking, rubbing on the skin or injection.</p> <p>Drug abuse amongst the global youth population has become a serious problem affecting everyone. Addiction leads many people, young people prominent amongst them, into downward spiral of hopelessness that in some cases ends fatal. They range from glue- sniffing street children and teenage ecstasy users, to hard core heroin and cocaine addicts (Nacada, 2005). Drug abuse is responsible for lost wages, destruction of property in schools, soaring health care costs and broken families. It is a problem which affects us all as parents, children, teachers, government officials, taxpayers and workers.</p> <p>The African seminar on problems of drug dependence held in Lagos, Nigeria declared that “Drug abuse and dependence producing substances are widely prevalent in African countries have continue to increase. These problems affect the individual, the family and the society in general. Substance abuse, which was originally conceived as the problem of a selected few is today becoming a problem of a sizeable proportion of the world population. The problem is so grave that it has extended beyond the usual characteristic profile of abusers being male, adult, and urban-based to now include females, youngsters and those who live in rural areas. Its economic effect is so devastating that it is estimated that the annual retail cost of psychotropic substances by prescription is over two billion naira while the alcoholic industry which produces over five billion gallons of alcoholic beverages annually generate more than four billion naira from sales to a consumer population of about 30-35 million people<strong> (</strong>Folawiyo, 2008). Illicit Drug traffic known to generate huge profit and fortune and that is one reason why it has been very difficult to combat the drug traffic in spite of several laws that have been promulgated. For instance, it has been estimated that the sum of $400 billion is the turn over of illicit drug industry, which is equivalent of approximately 8% of total international trade and therefore larger than the trade in iron steel, motor vehicle, textile, tourism <strong>(</strong>Innerarity, 1999) Drug abuse and other associated problems constitute a major threat to the survival and effective functioning of human societies, lives are lost daily through addiction and activities of addicts. A significant number of deaths from accidents and violent crimes have been traced to the activities of persons under the influence of drugs (Falope, 1991). Treatment facilities nation wide are now gradually being over burden with drug-related problems and cases<strong> (</strong>Odejide, A.O., Ohaeri, J.U., Ogunleye, D.A., Ajuwon, A and Ige A. 1990). The need to prevent drug abuse among the Nigerian youths which are the growing generation of Nigeria thus becomes imperative.</p> <p>The use of drugs by the old and young is growing on a daily bases in Nigeria. Drugs could mean those vital substances in the life of all living organism to prevent ailment, relief pain and to promote a healthy life.</p> <p>But these drugs that are meant to save lives are usually turning around to destroy them because of abuse. This is usually found among youths. The use of these drugs illegally and unlawfully has its consequences. Drug abuse has brought so much shame on the face of families, societies and Nigeria as a whole.</p> <p>According to the statistical data made available by the world heath organisation (WHO, drugs such as alcohol, tobacco and cocaine is the root cause of road accident which have claimed lives and the high rate of sickness suffered by our societies today. The issue of drug abuse has now become the main topic of discussion in our societies today. Drug abuse does not only destroy the affected person or individual but also have a negative effect on those that are connected to the individual (relatives, friends etc.). According to Barry 1984 he stated that in a country, drug abuse and alcohol has significant effect on serious crimes and also contributes hugely to fatalities.</p> <p>According to Boris (1974) stated that drug abuse plays a significant role in everyday interpersonal affaires although there is no data shown, but many youths in Nigeria are also user of drugs, however, there are many other users of such drug that is beyond moderate level to them, drug abuse constitute a vey solving problem and this condition appears to be based on an underlined psychological abnormality. Drug abuse seriously affect the individuals health and social function, it also hurt the users family, friends and colleagues and society as whole. It is to this regard that the researcher wishes to take surulere local government area of Lagos state as the case study of the research work.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>This study is instigated by the increasing use and abuse of drug among youths in Nigeria. Drug abuse and it effects on the youths are relevant to the present trend of event, which was noticed to be increasingly growing as observed. Drug abuse has been found to bring different kinds of hazards to both the individual and the country as a result of an increased intake.</p> <p>In Surulere local government area, the predominant dwellers indulge in drug consumption as a social cultural whereby drug sellers sell the products to youths. Also in youthful birthday parties, drugs are being distributed as a type of refreshment to guests. The younger ones grow up to become drug abuser, thereby seeming no harm whatsoever in use of drug intake. Youth and adolescent of this community also pick up this habit through observing others abusing drug. In other words, these people are typically family members, parent, friends and neighbours around them. On the health effect, Barry (1996) state that damage to the ovum or sperm before conception can lead to abnormalities in the child. He further says that if the foetus is exposed to alcohol in the mothers blood in the early weeks, it may be born with foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Some studies suggest that marijuana produces change in the users chromosome and as with nicotine and alcohol may damage sperm, reducing fertility and affecting the developing foetus. A defective ovum which is fertilized is likely to produce an early miscarriage. chronic cannabises use causes decreased level of male hormone testestone, testicular, degeneration and arrested or abnormal sperm production (Barry, 1996).</p> <p>It is in consideration of the above that the researcher is concerned with survey of effect of drug abuse on the youths in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3      OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Based on the above stated problems the study came up with the following objectives. The specific objectives of the research work are stated as follows:</p> <p>i.             To examine the major effect of drug abuse on the youths</p> <p>ii.            To discover the extent drug abuse has influenced the youths in Nigeria.</p> <p>iii.          To find out the control measures put in place to check drug abuse among youths in Nigeria</p> <p>iv.          To investigate the physical or health consequences of drug abuse on the society today</p> <p>v.           To examine the effectiveness of the government in fight against drug abuse among youths</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>In order to achieve the above objectives the study came up with the following research questions. The research questions are stated as follows:</p> <p>i.             What are the major effects of drug abuse on the youths?</p> <p>ii.            To what extent has drug abuse influenced the youths in Nigeria?</p> <p>iii.          What control measures have been put in place to check drug abuse among youths in Nigeria</p> <p>iv.          How effective are the government responding to fight against drug abuse among youths?</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>1.      H0: Drug abuse has not significantly affected Nigerian Youths</p> <p>H1: Drug abuse has significantly affected Nigerian Youths</p> <p>ii.      H0: No good control measures have been put in place to check drug abuse among youths in Nigeria</p> <p>H1: Good control measures have been put in place to check drug abuse among youths in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study will be of immense benefit to the youths, the state government and the federal government of Nigeria in addressing the issue related to problem of drug abuse on the family, youth and general society</p> <p>The study would also contribute to the knowledge Lauina (theory) discovered in existing relevant literature in the field thereby enabling government and non-governmental organization to find a possible solution to drug abuse.</p> <p>In other words, it will provide scholarly information for further studies. More importantly the study will come up with a suggested program, that when put into consideration the problem of drug abuse affecting the family would be brought to the barest minimum</p> <p><strong>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study the effect of drug abuse on Nigeria youths will cover the whole of surulere local government, Lagos state.</p> <p><strong>1.8 LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>FINANCIAL CONSTRAINST</strong>: financial constraints tend to impede the speed of the research in moving round the to gather resources. But the researcher was able to get meaningful information concerning the research topic.</p> <p><strong>TIME CONSTRAINTS</strong>: the research being a student will be involved in other departmental activities like submission of assignments, presentation of seminars and attendance to lecture will limit the time to arrive at the completion of the research work but however the researcher was able to meet up with the time allocated for the completion of the research work.</p> <p><strong>1.9 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>The importance of definition of terms in any academic work cannot be over emphasized. It is therefore necessary to define some terms in this work.</p> <p><strong>Youth:</strong> Summer (2003:1920), defines youth as “the period of time when someone is young especially the period when someone is a teenager”. From Hornby (2000:1389), “youth is the time of life when a person is young, especially the time before a child becomes an adult”.</p> <p><strong>Drug:</strong> Hornby (2000:359), (1) “an illegal substance that some people smoke, inject, etc. to give them pleasant or exciting feelings”. (2) “a substance used as a medicine or used in a medicine”. Onah (1982:2) defines drug as “any chemical substance that has an effect upon the body or mind, by modifying one or more of the terms”.</p> <p><strong>Abuse:</strong> “It is the use of something in a way that is wrong or harmful” (Hornby, 2000:5) Drug Abuse: Onah (1982:2), Sees it as “It is an excessive or inappropriate use of a drug by a person; such use being considered or judged to be illegal (immoral) by the culture and also resulting in harm to the person or society”. From Aka and Akunyili (2003:60), drug abuse refers to drug use mainly by self-medication in a manner that deviates from approved medical or social patterns”.</p> <p><strong>Alcohol</strong>: Hornby (2000:26), “Drinks such as beer, wine, etc that can make people drunk or that colourless liquid that is found in drinks such as beer, wine etc and is used in medicines, cleaning product, etc”.</p> <p><strong>Alcoholism</strong>: Royce (1989:10), “The use of alcohol that results or interferes with personal life including school, job, family, friends, health, food, the law or spiritual life”.</p> <p><strong>REFERENCES</strong></p> <p>Abel, E.

Basically in most societies, men and women are totally different from each other and this is seen in their activities and business, and also their access to and control over resources, and partaking in decision-making. Gender is a power tool, a social institution and cultural construct.</p> <p>The idea of gender is not constrained to the male or female species, but further breaks the bound to fully assess the correlations between them. This relationships has continuously been argued on by researchers, the layman, political parties, etc in the process of enforcing change in the political environment, economy, social and cultural environments at the local, national and supra national levels to mention but a few.</p> <p>Crime is a specifically an interesting event and a huge problem in any society because it is in all ramification the opposite of good deed. This is basically true if we define crime broadly in terms of behavior in which individuals acquire resources from others by force, fraud, or stealth. Criminal acts do just the opposite of good. People who commit these acts intentionally harm others in other to satisfy their selfish interests.</p> <p>Conventionally, crime is defined as acts forbidden by law that can be punishable by imprisonment. Murder, robbery, burglary, rape, drunken driving, child neglect, and failure to pay your taxes etcall are examples of crime. The behavioral definition of crime centers on, criminality, a specified personality profile that encourages all manner of crimes. Criminal behaviors comprises the use of force, fraud, or stealth to obtain material or symbolic resources. Furthermore, criminality is a style of strategic behavior characterized by self-centeredness, selfishness, indifference to the suffering and needs of others, the feeling of “I cannot achieve it on my own” and low self-control.</p> <p>Gender criminalities in Nigeria have caused The study of gender simply means having total knowledge of both the roles women and men play together with their responsibilities. A comparism on the impact of gender criminality in Nigeria has to do with the comparative analysis between male and female, these will also throw more light on gender inequalities in the society and how it encourages criminality in Nigerian prisons, Suleja prisons specifically. The term Gender inequality does not actually mean that all women are worse than all men, neither is the reverse. But to some degree, gender (being male or female) is a vital social separation described by the word inequality. Gender to a large extent influences people’s perspectives and their social expectations. Gender equality on the other hand has to do with women and men enjoying the same status and having equal human rights and also the opportunities for acknowledging their full right and humans and the ability to partake, contribute to national, political, economic, social, and cultural development, and also to benefit from the end results. Gender equality reduces crime and fosters unity, growth and development in the society.</p> <p>more harm than good to the citizens, inmates specifically. Among women, poverty is common.  Previous research works revealed that women account for over 70% of the world’s absolute poor. Women most times fall victims of frowning circumstances because they want retain the position enforced on them as the house keeper, baby making machines etc and keep their homes, provide for their children, and as such bear a disproportionate burden, trying to manage household consumption and production under conditions of recession.</p> <p>Amongst various areas in which the parliamentarians play important roles in encouraging, supporting and protecting women’s rights, the discrimination against women and girls in the criminal justice system makes up a huge problem which is less seen addressed than others. These concerns range from discriminatory, gender inclined offences and reasons for detention to the impact of the lack of financial resources in order to prevent detention and a prison system that has been designed by men for male prisoners. The excessive increase in discrimination positions girls in situations where they are open to attacks.Nowadays, the circumstances in which women commit criminal offences are different from men. For this reason, a considerable number of women offenders are in prison as a direct or indirect outcome of the discrimination and deprivation, which is most times often experienced from theirspouses, their family members and the community. Crimes committed by women are related to poverty and most timesas a result of trying to survivein other to support their family and children. When it comes to the profile and background of women in prison, and the reasons for their imprisonment, it differscompletely from those of men. Just like the men, women prisoners basically come from economically and socially underprivilegedparts of society, together with drug peddlers/users, lower-level property offenders, and sex workers are overrepresented. To compare the male prison populations, women mainly commit minor crimes, theft and fraud and these are chiefly caused by emotional, physical, and/or sexual abuse which contributes to women’s criminal behaviour. Women (and girls) make up the minority of prisoners all over the world, amounting to an estimated 2 to 9% of national prison populations. Howbeit, the number of imprisoned women has drastically increased in some countries, and to a large extent higher than for men. For this reason, the specific needs and characteristics of women and girls which are the main reason of the criminal justice system have remained unacknowledged and unaddressed. Prison systems are on every occasion crafted for the majority male prison population which is not meant to be and is as a result of discrimination; from the framework of prisons, to security procedures, to facilities for healthcare, family contact, work and training. Consequently, a few numbers of prisons meet the specific needs of women prisoners, and most times do not get them ready for release with genderappropriate rehabilitation. The United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders were embraced in December 2010 to in other to put things in place especially the lack of standards, however the international community till date are deficient of awareness and commitment to implementation. Gender roles has resulted to a scar on women in prison, and while their husbands, partnersoften support their husbands in prison and upon release as a matter of course, reciprocally women tend to be silenced by their spouse and often even the whole family if they are by any chance detained. At the same time, women are most times the sole caretaker of young children, which has resulted in a particular impact of even short periods of detention on children and the wider family.</p> <p><strong>1.2.    </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE GENERAL PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Criminality in Nigeria has been an age long problem that has significantly affected the development of the country both economically, politically and otherwise. The issue of criminality has taken a surprisingly upward surge in Nigeria owing to the increase in the wave of crime and other illicit practices. This high level of criminal tendencies in Nigeria has negatively affected the international image of the country and thus preventing or making it difficult for us to enjoy the goodwill of other developed countries of the world. The issues of criminality has led to high security concerns as the lives and properties of innocent Nigerian can no longer be protected unlike in other countries of the world, this has gone a long way in reducing the level of investment into the country thus leading to poor economic growth and hardship.</p> <p><strong>1.3.    </strong><strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The major aim of the study is to examine the impact of gender criminality in Nigeria. Other specific objectives of the study are as follows;</p> <ol><li>To determine if women receive preferential treatment in sentencing over men and to explain this disparity if it exists.</li> <li>To examine if crime in Nigeria is gender related</li> <li>To determine the negative impact of criminality in Nigeria.</li> <li>To compare the gender differences in the Nigerian prisons as regards to issues of criminality in Nigeria.</li> <li>To recommend ways of ensuring the reduction of total eradication of criminality in Nigeria.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4.    </strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <ol><li>What is the impact of criminality in Nigeria?</li> <li>Do women receive preferential treatment in sentencing over men?</li> <li>Is crime in Nigeria is gender related?</li> <li>What is the negative impact of criminality in Nigeria?</li> <li>Is there a difference in gender as regards crime in Nigeria?</li> <li>What are the ways of ensuring the reduction of total eradication of criminality in Nigeria?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5.    </strong><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p><strong>H0: </strong>There is no significant difference in gender in terms of criminality in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>H1: </strong>There is a significant difference in gender in terms of criminality in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>H0: </strong>There is no significant impact of gender criminality in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>H1: </strong>There is a significant impact of gender criminality in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6.    </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study would be of immense importance to government at all levels, the Nigerian prison service and relevant stakeholders as it would reveal the impact of gender criminality on Nigeria. The study would also benefit students, researchers and scholars who are interested in developing further research on the subject matter.</p> <p><strong>1.7.    </strong><strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is restricted to the impact of gender criminality in Nigeria using a case study of Suleja prisons in Minna, Niger state.</p> <p><strong>Limitations of the study</strong></p> <p><strong>Financial constraint:</strong> Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview)</p> <p><strong>Time constraint:</strong> The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work. This consequently will cut down on the time devoted for the research work.</p> <p><strong>1.8.    </strong><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>GENDER: </strong>the state of being male or female (typically used with reference to social and cultural differences rather than biological ones).</p> <p><strong>CRIMINAL: </strong> an act or the commission of an act that is forbidden or the omission of a duty that is commanded by a public law and that makes the offender liable to punishment by that law</p> <p><strong>PRISON: </strong>a building to which people are legally committed as a punishment for a crime or while awaiting trial.</p> <p><strong>SOCIAL VICES: </strong>is a practice, behaviour, or habit generally considered immoral, sinful, criminal, rude, taboo, depraved, or degrading in the associated society.

These agencies work in synergy in the prevention, deterrence, apprehension, investigation, trial, punishment and rehabilitation of offenders. The said public agencies maintain law and order, law enforcement and imprisonment of offenders. They also make provisions for sustainable programmes for corrections and rehabilitation of inmates.  Therefore, the goal of the criminal justice system is prevention, deterrence and control of crime in the society. Although, Moore (1997) noted that the criminal justice is not a system in the sense that, all agencies are directed towards a particular objective with the help of a centralized authority, that, it is a limited system to the extent that, the different agencies are linked through a process in which one agency’s output become the next agency’s input. The output of the police is the input of the courts, while the output of the courts is the input of the prisons, and vice versa.</p> <p>Furthermore, Dambazau (2011) viewed same as an instrument of practical purposes, accountable for the efficient and effective reduction of crime. This is through three distinct mechanisms: deterrence, incapacitation and rehabilitation. Meanwhile, Iwarimie - Jaja (2003) viewed same as “a process where the different components co-ordinate their independent functions by processing the criminal suspect from one stage to the other”. The process involves arrest, booking, trial and confinement. However, this study will concentrate on the criminal justice system in Nigeria, lessons from the courts – prisons interact in Abia State geographical area.</p> <p>The study will emphasize more on the contributions of the courts and the prisons towards timely delivery of justice in Abia State. Although, it is believed that the courts failure to dispense justice timely is due to prisons ineffectiveness and corruption in the Society. Meanwhile, the prisons argued that offenders standing trail never arrived late to courts and cannot be the reason for delay in justice delivery. Therefore, the study intends to uncover reasons behind such delay since, justice delayed is justice denied.</p> <p><strong>1.2           </strong><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The courts-prisons interact within the criminal justice system is geared towards prompt justice delivery and rehabilitation of offenders. Most recently, it is an issue of concern in the national dailies, subject of discussion by citizens and legal practitioners on how the system has degenerated, yet it has persisted unabated.  According to Brown (n.d), “the various reasons why the courts could not sit, or when they sat could not mention a matter but adjourn to a future date frustrates effort of the prisons officers”. The courts never considered how prisons officers feel returning with offenders to base with directive to reproduce same offenders on the adjourned date. The situation could be worse considering distance covered, poor state of roads, logistics and financial position of the prisons. The prisons’ effort to meet with their routine obligation as well as service several courts within the jurisdiction has created problems. The courts inability to effectively and timely dispose of cases and/or the prisons to continue to house offenders without trial in courts, have further compounded the problems.</p> <p>Hence, the study intends to probe into how the situation has constituted the failure of the criminal justice system. To that extent, the study will aim at proffering solution as to stem the tide and better the lot for the justice system. It will also win the hope for justice by the common man. The situation necessitated in-depth investigation into the courts - prisons relationship in Nigeria with particular reference to Abia State. In sum, many scholars have written on the criminal justice system as a whole and the specific structures therein, namely: the police, courts, and prisons. There is no known study in Nigeria that is concerned with the contretemps in the relationship between the courts and the prisons in the course of justice delivery. This is the essence of this study with a view to making the criminal justice system more effective, hence the need for a rethinking.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is to ascertain and appraise the work-relationship between the courts and the prisons in the criminal justice system in Abia State. The subsidiary objectives of the study include the following:</p> <ol><li>To find out factors that hinder criminal justice agencies, particularly the courts and the prisons in the discharge of their duties.</li> <li>To find out the extent of ethics adherence by the courts and the prisons.</li> <li>To ascertain what causes delay in court proceedings which ultimately affect justice delivery in Abia state.</li> <li>To investigate how the criminal justice agencies, particularly, courts and the prisons in Abia State can co-operate more in the course of justice delivery.</li> <li>To make suggestion and recommendations for a more reliable and efficient Justice delivery in Abia State. </li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4       Research questions</strong></p> <p>The following questions guide this study:</p> <p>                        i.         What are the factors that could hinder criminal justice agencies in discharging their duties in Abia State?</p> <p>                       ii.         What is the extent of ethics adherence by criminal justice agencies in Abia State?</p> <p>                     iii.         What are the factors which causes delay in court proceedings that affect justice delivery in Abia State?</p> <p>                     iv.         In what ways do criminal justice agencies co-operate in justice delivery in Abia State?</p> <p>                       v.         In what ways can criminal justice system be improved in Abia State? </p>\n\nTHE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN NIGERIA", "id": 7}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The concept fraud is a term known in all works and cranny in Nigeria. Fraud has eating deep into the fabrics of Nigerian society, mostly in this present 21st Century. The only remedy to this ugly situation will be self discipline and honesty among bank staff, otherwise this decadence will persist. What is fraud? Some well read individual have tried to bring the subject home in a better language for easy understanding. Okorie (2000). Defined fraud in his book “Understanding Practical Auditing and Investigation,” as irregularities involving the use of criminal deception to obtain unjust or illegal advantage. The word irregularity is used to refer to intentional distortion of financial statements for whatever purpose and misappropriation of Assets. Donnel (2001) argued that “fraud in the contemplation of Civil Court of Justice, may be said to include all act of omission and concealment, justify reposed and are injurious to another by which undue or unconscientiously is taken of another”. Microfinance bank certification programme study manual (2012) define fraud as a deception deliberately practiced in order to secure unfair or unlawful gain. Adewumi (2011) described fraud as a “conscious premeditated action of person or group of person with the intention of selfish or personal monetary gain”. It involves the use of deceit and trick and sometimes highly intelligent canning, and known how. The action usually takes the form of foregoing falsification of documents, outright theft. Fraud in its entering whereby another is sought to be deprived by illegal or inequitable means what he is entitled to Donnel (2001). The above definition may not enough to express what fraud is to the reader, but can at least give a vivid definition of the term because it contains the fundamental of fraud which includes. 1. There must be deceived through motive immaterial. 2. There must be damage to the person deceived, Infact, where there is money, there is bound to be fraud. Harry (2000) opined that “No one is entirely immune to fraud. It crop up in small and large amount. It is perpetrated by management both senior and junior employees whenever fraud is mentioned, one thinks of loss of money in financial institution like banks and insurance companies. In the 1960s, Banks and Insurance fraud are not tetched. The establishment of banks and more insurance companies concomitant at over stretched of staff resources and accordingly, the weakness in the system the result of these is the speed at which fraud in banking and insurance companies has risen. Commercial fraud covers multitude of malpractice including such “with dollar crimes”, as obtaining credit without intending to pay, obtaining money in mart-order business without supplying the goods, obtaining money by promising to invest and not doing so, obtain by computer fraud insiders trading and tax fraud. “A Corporate Crime”. Where business people commit frauds against other invest or one tax authorities or where directors commit fraud against companies. Fraudsters involve themselves in fraudulent activities so as to be reckon with the society as those who have made it. The loss of funds assets through fraud reduces resources available for use in bank and insurance company operations. Considering the up-short the rate of frauds, hence the study of the effect control and possible solution to these special crime in bank.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong>Banks has continued to witness increased number of fraud and malpractice with varying degree of sophistication. It was reported by the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) that “Banking Industry has lost billions of naira to fraudulent activities, indicating a continuing increase in banking fraud” in the present 21st century in Nigeria. This shows that while bank management are busy working out means of checking fraud and malpractice fraudsters on the other hand in conjunction with some dishonest bank staffs are designing new methods on how to circumvent those measures. It will then be pointed out here that the results or implication of these is damaging. Fraud and malpractice leads to unnecessary loss of huge amount of money. This loss of money by the bank cripples banks activities and transactions. Again, every incidence of fraud reduces public confidence on bank; hence they question the credibility of the banking industry in protecting their money and meeting up with daily transactions. Banks fraud and malpractice delay or slow down the development of banking habits in Nigeria economy. People shy away from banks in fear of losing their money in case fraud occurs. Banks fraud and malpractice keeps the management of banks alert and cause them to waste resources and energies on fraud prevention and detection.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF BANK FRAUD IN THE NIGERIAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (21ST CENTURY EXPERIENCE)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECTS OF BANK FRAUD IN THE NIGERIAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (21ST CENTURY EXPERIENCE)", "id": 8}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is a common knowledge that Nigeria since her return to civil rule in 1999 faces some national security challenges across the six geo-political zones in the country. The spate of bomb blasts, kidnapping, pipeline vandalism and other forms of criminalities in recent times in various parts of the country are emerging trends of domestic terrorism. In fact, the high rate of kidnappings, armed robbery and political assassinations, are added dimensions to the security challenges, which are stretching the nation to its limits, sometimes constitute a great threat to the very fabric of its existence. (Abimbola and Adesote 2012) A number of analysts have variously attributed the disturbing trend to political dissatisfaction, ethnic and religious differences, perceived societal neglect and pervasive poverty among the people. However, the outbreak of Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria marked yet another phase in the recurring pattern that violent uprising, riots and disturbances have become in Nigeria. Given the heterogeneous nature of the Nigerian society, the religious sensitivity of Nigerians, and the prolonged military rule that ended with the advent of civil rule in 1999, the situation could perhaps not have been different. But what is alarming is the forceful attempt by religious fundamentalist to impose a religious ideology on a constitutionally recognized secular society (Nwogu 2012:43). Boko Haram poses an enormous and complex threat to national security and not only has it been inimical to human security, economic development and political stability, it has also portends harmful ramifications for the corporate existence of Nigeria. Thus, it could be argued that it is the governments’ inability to efficiently address poverty and unemployment and other social malaise inimical to the good life that have combined to create an environment in which religious sects like the Boko Haram flourished. Some cases, the situations had gotten worse. There is massive poverty; lack of access to educational opportunities, unemployment and ignorance due to limited educational opportunities; and government corruption, including misuse of resources, by which the people were repulsed. (Usman 1987, Ale 2009) In this direction, the maintenance of law and order in Nigeria has been very challenging to the extent that the ability to manage internal security by security agencies is being doubted by the citizenry. The government which is constitutionally charged to provide security and ensure the welfare of all persons within the polity has although, taken some steps to address these emerging trends of violence and suicide bombings that pose major challenges to security in Nigeria but these efforts have not proven effective. Security is said to mean the quality or state of being secured. It implies freedom from danger, freedom from fear or anxiety and freedom from the prospect of being laid off. Security from these perspective is holistic and encapsulates the total well being of a person in persons (Nwogu 2012) It is against this background that this research is anchored to investigate the origin, ideology and activities of the dreaded Boko Haram sect and its effects on the management of security in Nigeria. The research will also examine the response of the Nigeria government to the threat posed by Boko Haram with a view to suggest possible solutions/strategies to address the scourge.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Currently, the issue of Boko Haram cannot be over-looked, particularly as it has become one of the greatest threats to government in Nigeria. The activities of the group threaten the fabrics of Nigeria and are capable of disintegrating the country. It is pertinent to state that Boko Haram has taken a new dimension and has continued to improve on the methods of attacking their targets. It has advanced from the stages of assassination, gunpowder plot to that of bomb-planting explosive attacks, suicide bombing, sporadic shooting in busy areas, including schools, supermarkets, religious places and more recently kidnapping e.g. the kidnap incident of the Chibok school girls that attracted the attention of the international community. Nwogu (2012:43) observed that Boko Haram has grown from an issue of local nuisance to a frontier of international terror. Its heady rise to international terror group status has been marked by unabated audacious and brutal terror attacks that have shaken the country to her roots. More so, Boko Haram poses enormous and complex threat to the management of national security in Nigeria, which is a major challenge to human security and economic development. Akinferinwa (2011:109) pointed out that Boko Haram is undoubtedly one of the problems in Nigeria. He noted that it is a major component part of the problem. And also stated that, Boko Haramists do play the role of a catalytic agent in the worsening of one Nigeria’s main problems; national unity. From this viewpoint, it can be seen that Boko Haram is a serious challenge to security in Nigeria, thus, this research is focused to examine the extent of threat by Boko Haram with a view to propose comprehensive framework to address the problem.</p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of the research is to take a critical look at the challenges posed by Boko Haram to the management of security in Nigeria and to explain its effect on the development of Nigeria. Therefore, in summary, the research is aimed at the following objectives.</p> <p>1. To attempt a critical study on the origin, ideology and activities of Boko Haram.</p> <p>2. To examine the extent at which Boko Haram has affected the security situation in Nigeria.</p> <p>3. To explore how Boko Haram terrors has impacted on Nigeria, politically, economically, socially and otherwise.</p> <p>4. To reveal the response of the Nigeria state to the challenges posed by Boko Haram.</p> <p>5. To recommend strategies and policies that may be possible solutions to address the Boko Haram challenge.</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESSTIONS</strong></p> <p>1. Was it poverty and illiteracy that resulted in the formation of Boko Haram?</p> <p>2. To what extent has Boko Haram worsened the security situation in Nigeria?</p> <p>3. How has Boko Haram terror affected Nigeria politically, socially, economically and otherwise?</p> <p>4. In what ways has the Nigerian government responded to the Boko Haram threats?</p> <p>5. What are the possible strategies to tackle the scourge of Boko Haram?</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In recent times, many scholars and commentators have written and commented elaborately on the insecurity situation of the country, particularly, arising from terrorism. However, this study focuses squarely on the Boko Haram phenomenon and management of security in Nigeria. This will help in understanding the activities of the terror group and explore steps to address its menace. The study is also significant because it will contribute to existing literature on terrorism, especially on Boko Haram and the issue of security, which will further encourage research into this area.</p>\n\nAN ASSESSMENT OF THE SECURITY MANAGEMENT IN NIGERIA (THE BOKO HARAM CHALLENGE)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ASSESSMENT OF THE SECURITY MANAGEMENT IN NIGERIA (THE BOKO HARAM CHALLENGE)", "id": 9}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <ol><li> <div><strong>SUMMARY</strong></div> </li> </ol></div> <p>This study has been able to look into the contributions of different scholars on the issue of female criminality. It has been able to relate findings as they affect the research problem.</p> <p>The problem of the study was specifically aimed:</p> <div> <p>To describe the extent and type of female involvement in crimes and analyze the types of crimes in which women have been most visible;</p> <p>To determine the socio-economic attributes of women in crime. And finally identify factors predisposing women to criminality.</p> </div> <p>The findings show that most of the female offenders are first offenders. This means that most of these female offenders find themselves in prison once in their life. But there is also a few cases of recidivist of whose frequency does not exceed three times. These recidivists could fall into the category that Lombroso (1894) termed the occasional criminal’ a more frequent criminal type who commits crime at the suggestion or by the influence of a male probably a lover.<br/>Data collected revealed that the types of crime females are involved in are armed robbery, kidnapping, murder, theft, assault, cheating, drugs, criminal bridge trust, and conspiracy. But the crimes of which the respondents have been most visible are murder and theft.<br/>Based on the findings, it was discovered that a high percentage of these female offenders resided in the rural areas. This is a good enough reason why they engaged in criminal acts or activities. The rural area is known for its homogeneity. Relationships are more at the inter-personal level, and the bond between individuals becomes strong that the. In the rural areas, everybody knows virtually what his or her neighbour is doing and as result one can can easily offend the other and in the cause of retaliation one gets hot. Civilization which is more evident in the urban areas has opened the eyes of many.<br/>Bad company is another predisposing factor to criminality. Peer groups have great influence on individuals. When an individual continues to associate more with a group that sees the societal norms of offensive, the individual also tends to violate the values of that society. Hence, a good percentage of the offenders are introduced into criminal activities by their friends.<br/>In addition to this, most of the female offenders were brought up by their parents. The family under which one grows up also affects his or her life. The type of upbringing one had during his or her childhood influence his or her behavioural conduct and adulthood. The inference here is that parents no more carry out their responsibilities of inculcating morality in their children. There is laxity in the socialize children. It also serves for religious and moral training. If the family does not carry out these functions, the resultant problem will be moral decadence. The above point seems to agree with the hypothesis that poor socialization process is likely to influence criminality in individuals.<br/>Economic conditions are another contributory factor to criminality. Most of these female offenders are either in the informal sector or unemployed, thus they have no stable means of income. Even those in employment earn meager salary. Where would this get them, with the economic hardship that has befallen Nigeria? The frustration caused by this hardship is enough to make one commit murder.</p> <div> <ol><li><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></li> </ol></div> <p>The basic assumption of the major work on female criminality than seeing it as a physiological or psychological problem. For instance, from the findings, the educational level or attainment of the female inmates countered the argument Lombroso that female criminals look and behave like the primitive males that lacked formal education.<br/>However, it does not mean that these assumptions are totally wrong in themselves. The various scholars must be credited for their attempt in trying to understand the issue of female criminality.<br/>The main argument in this study is that criminality is caused by social factors and not biological factors. As such, there is a need to carry out a new study on women and crime. And to this, it is necessary to understand the assumptions made by the traditional to understand the assumptions made by the traditional writers and break away from them. Crime should not be seen as caused by factors within the female, rather, crime should be seen as caused by factors external to the females.<br/>In conclusion, this study is not claiming superiority over the already existing literature nor is the argument absolute and perfect. The study is equally open to criticisms and modifications.</p> <p>5.3    <strong>RECOMMENDATIONS</strong><br/>This project is not only meant to find out the type and factors that lead to female criminality. It also meant to recommendation because it is not only to study a social problem that matters, there has to be a way to study a social problem that matters, there has to be a way out of the problem. Thus the recommendation is in two angles:</p> <div> <p>To the family which is the smallest unit of the society where socialization first begins and,</p> <p>The government whose policies affect the individuals in the society.</p> </div> <p>In as much as civilization has contributed to the decay of the family function, the family should still see it as its primary function to socialize children, to inculcate sound moral values in them. This sound start right from childhood.<br/>On the other hand, unemployment causes a lot of problem in the society. The government should review its policies so as to create job opportunities for members of the society. All hand must be on deck. The government should review the salary scales of workers also. This should be done in such a way that the monthly salaries are able to meet the financial demands and obligation of individuals.<br/>If there is anything the government can do to improve the standard of living of individuals in reducing hardship, the government should do it. At least this effort can go along way in reducing or curbing crime and female criminality particularly, in Nigeria. Thereby, giving the country a face lift.</p> <p><strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong><br/><strong>Akubukwe, David O.

Owing to this, Gbadamosi (2008) is of the opinion that fraud has become a pandemic disease, surpassing geopolitical boundaries, race, ideology or the level of economic development. Although, with determination and little effort, fraud can be managed to limit financial losses as well as fraustrate and expose the criminals that victimize us all. Ezeilo (2010).</p> <p>However, the automated forensic tools which was discussed earlier in this research work has being a helpful tool for identifying root cause of fraudulent practices and facilitation of security measures in organizations.

In order to gather relevant data and information on the subject matter, the researcher used the questionnaire as data collection instrument, which was administered on 200 respondents within the FCT which is the limit of the scope of the study.  A self constructed questionnaire titled Child Abuse Questionnaire (CAQ) was administered on the students after validation. The instrument has construct validity co-efficient of 0.756 and reliability co-efficient of 0.95. The statistical technique that was used to analyse the data collected was Chi-Square distribution test. The result of the analysis showed that there was a significant relationship between poverty and economic deprivation and child abuse in Nigeria. Also the study revealed that child abuse is still very prevalent in Nigeria and also that religious and cultural influences contribute to child abuse in Nigeria. <br/>The result revealed that the Rights institutions are not doing enough to arrest the problem of child abuse and that the child right act is not working in Nigeria.</p>\n\nTHE ROLES OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND PUBLIC COMPLAINT COMMISSION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLES OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND PUBLIC COMPLAINT COMMISSION", "id": 12}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong> Abstract</strong></p> <p>This study is on efficiency and effectiveness of security agencies in Nigeria ports. The total population for the study is 200 staff of Nigeria port Authority, portharcourt, Rivers state. The researcher used questionnaires as the instrument for the data collection. Descriptive Survey research design was adopted for this study. A total of 133 respondents made marine engineers, firemen, seamen and signal officers were used for the study. The data collected were presented in tables and analyzed using simple percentages and frequencies  </p> <p><strong> CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Nigeria is indeed one of the greatest maritime nations of the world; this is confirmed by both the local maritime operators and foreign maritime operators. Ports are supposed to be security zones and policed as such to prevents crimes mainly theft, smuggling among sabotage attacks, stowaway. In olden days, theft as merely limited to petty pilferage and broaching of cartons by Dockers only tilling their pockets that would neither attract attention nor cause appreciable loss to the cargo consignee. The crime latter escalated to piracy onboard vessels at anchorage. Crews were violently robbed and cargo stolen, with some measure of success in checking piracy at anchorage, attention shifted to the ports proper. There are many security agents both conventiona1l recognized law enforcement agents and the fadeless ones purporting to be government officials seeing to the general security of our ports These notwithstanding the ports are being easily accessible to a multitude of hoodlums now popularly known as “what rats” and syndicates of other malefactors actors who have made the ports their homes. They vandalize the lighting system to enable them carry out their natural and notorious activities. Any degree of crimes can now be perpetrated by these hoodlums acting in cohorts with some of the security agents, and port official. Crewmembers going ashore are sometimes violently attacked and robbed within and outside the ports. Cargo theft has grown from breaking any types of package within the ports to complete disappearance of container out of the ports. Cargos are being successfully cleared from the port by spurious owners. Ships are boarded by unauthorized persons who steal both cargoes and ship property including those relate to safety. What a criminal act! Vehicular cargoes are more vulnerable to plunder age because of the attention they attract. They are loaded with some goods that are not made parks where they normally await clearing. They are securely locked and then keys are handed to security officials for safety. But most of these vehicles with or without undeclared goods are mysteriously opened and their valuable parts are stolen Clearing of cargoes is a process which the shippers, freight forwarded and consignees thinks is as difficult as the head of the camel having to pass through the eye of1the needle The customs long room is being made too “long” for clearing agents Problems with all department involved in the clearing start from the usual indifferences to work, the officials thinking that they are doing the agents favour The agents must “co-operate” with the officials, otherwise their entries will either be unnecessarily delayed further or completely lost in the labyrinth of bureaucracy Having survived the voracity these official and the goods released the clearing agent face the cast ordeal of having to “settle” all other security agents and officials even with authentic release documents Some of the security men still go outside the ports to intercept and tort the consignee for “settlement” Coupled with factors like high port tariffs, port insecurity is now causing Nigerian ports serious loss of clientele to neighbouring ports. Lome and Cotonou for example, although in charter parties and ordinary contracts of affreightment where carriage of goods by sea Act 1971 does not apply to the operating bills of lading. Ship owners can exclude liability for loss of or damage to cargo arising from piratical acts generally the Act (COGSA “71”) does not provide such that Nigeria has joined the club of port stigmatized as dangerous in insurance circle. Consequently, ship owners and shippers pays higher premiums for ships and cargoes, a burden that is ultimately passed to the public consumers.</p> <p>If Nigeria must grow both politically and economically, there are needs for an efficient and effective security system for safety of cargoes id ship including the crews. There should be both the activities of the appropriate authority and the private sectors to ensure that security at the port be maintained.</p> <p> <strong>1.2</strong> <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Crewmembers going ashore are sometimes violently attacked and robbed within and outside the ports.

Ayantokun (2006), defined computer as a machine that performs tasks, such as calculation or electronic communication, under the control of a set of instructions called a program. Programs usually reside within the computer and are retrieved and processed by the computer’s electronics. The program results are stored or routed to output devices, such as video display monitors or printers. Oyewole and Obeta (2002), define a computer as an electronic device that accepts, processes, stores and outputs data at high speed according to programmed instructions. Computers perform a wide variety of activities reliably, accurately and quickly depending on the purpose it was designed for. Computer can be used in areas of education, medicine, engineering design, scientific research, office automation, personal administration etc (Morley and Parker, 2007).</p> <p>According to Rogers (1995), the rapid evolution of the computer brought the internet. The internet services have reduced the world into a global village which makes it look as if everybody is in the same place at a particular point in time. Aside the fact that the internet has made communication to be easier and faster, a lot of other transactions are consummated at the speed of lightening. Oyewole and Obeta (2002), state that the internet is the inter connection of computer across the world thereby creating unlimited opportunities for mankind. Ehimen and Bola (2009), state that cyberspace has provided a save haven for internet platform, which has created geometric growth and accelerated windows of opportunities for businesses and the removal of economic barriers hitherto faced by nations of the world. People from diverse areas of human endeavor can now freely access and utilize the advantages offered by internet platform. In addition, Young Media Association (2007), listed the following as the positive gain the internet has brought to the world:</p> <p>Facilitation of job search and employment.</p> <p>Accessibility to research information for education and businesses.</p> <p>Rural integration.</p> <p>Enhancement of trade and commerce.</p> <p>Sharing of resources and ideas.</p> <p>Enhance communication.</p> <p>1.2       Statement of the Problem</p> <p>The contribution of internet to the development of the nation has been marred by the evolution of a new wave of crime. The internet has also become an environment where the most lucrative and safest crimes thrive. There are indications that social media fraud is rising. For example, a 2005 YouGov poll of UK Internet users found that 1 in 20 had lost money in online scams. Also a 2001 survey revealed that 52 per cent of companies interviewed said internet fraud posed real problems for them (Wall, 2007). These are clear indications that social media fraud is on the increase and as such, it is beginning to gain recognition at the global level and there is dearth of study in the area of this burgeoning criminal act in Nigeria.</p> <p>Technology has integrated nations and the world has become a global village. The economy of most nations in the world is accessible through the aid of electronic via the internet. Since the electronic market is opened to everybody (which includes eavesdroppers and criminals), false pretence find a fertile ground in this situation. Vladimir (2005), said the internet is a global network which unites millions of computer located in different countries and open broad opportunities to obtain and exchange information but it is now being used for criminal purposes due to economic factors. Nigeria, a third world country is faced with so many economic challenges such as unemployment amongst others, which are capable of making this crime thrive. Apart from the economy factor been a possible cause of social media fraud in Nigeria, there might be other causes for the continued rise in social media fraud activity.</p> <p>In Nigeria, perpetrators of this crime who are commonly referred to as “yahoo yahoo boys” take advantage of e-commerce system available on the internet to defraud victims who are mostly foreigners thousands and sometimes millions of dollars. They fraudulently represent themselves as having particular goods to sell or that they are involved in a loan scheme project. They may even pose to have financial institution where money can be loaned out to prospective investors. In this regard, persons and organization are duped or have fallen victims. However, these are not the only techniques used by these social media fraudsters, there could be others which the research intends to unravel.</p> <p>Attempt to address social media fraud by various governments and international organizations have not been successful owing to the fact that the identities of the perpetrators of social media fraud remain ambiguous and inadequate. A study by Zero Tolerance (2006), indicates that social media fraudsters are usually within the age bracket of 18 to 30 years and they indulge in the crime in order to survive and have a taste of good life. Noting these observations, there is need to identify more attributes/characteristics these social media fraudsters possess and what are other causes since it have been acknowledged that a good taste of life is a major factor.</p> <p>Consequently, many countries have intensified efforts in curbing the excesses of social media fraudsters. Nevertheless, efforts have been made by the Federal Government of Nigeria to curb the menace of the crime too. For instance, according to Awe (2009), the government of President Olusegun Obansanjo in 2003 set up a working group known as the Nigeria Cyber Crime Working Group (NCWG) to address this phenomenon since the loss suffered by both consumers and investors creates serious credibility and image problem to the country. Similarly, according to Abdulhamidet al, (2011), in Nigeria, a bill title “Cyber Security and Critical Infrastructure bill” is presently been prepared to deal specifically with the menace of social media fraud. The Economic and Other Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) and the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) have also played vital roles in curbing this menace. To support their efforts, Microsoft and other internet related organizations like PARADIGM Initiative Nigeria, Background Check International (BCI) and the Internet safety,</p> <p>Security and Privacy Initiative for Nigeria (ISSPIN) have also assisted to curb the maladies (Awe, 2009). In spite of all these efforts, social media fraud in Nigeria is still on the increase. The situation raises a question on the type of social media fraud that is on the increase and remedy to solve the menace. Consequently, base on the above statements the research work was designed to provide answers to the research questions raised and also to suggest solutions to the problem.</p> <p>1.3       Research Questions</p> <p>What is the pattern of social media fraud in tertiary institutions in Zaria?</p> <p>What are the social attributes of those involved in social media fraud in tertiary institutions in Zaria?</p> <p>What are the factors responsible for social media fraud in the study area?</p> <p>What are the types of social media fraud common among social media fraudsters</p> <p>in tertiary institutions in Zaria?</p> <p>What are the consequences of social media fraud in the study area?</p> <p>How can social media fraud be curtailed?</p> <p>1.4      Aim and Objectives of the Study</p> <p>The objectives of the study are as follows:</p> <p>To find out the pattern of social media fraud in tertiary institutions in Zaria.</p> <p>To explore the social attributes of those involved in social media fraud in tertiary institutions in Zaria.</p> <p>To identify the causes of social media fraud in the study area.</p> <p>To identify the types of social media fraud that is common in the study area.</p> <p>To examine the consequences of social media fraud in the study area.</p> <p>To suggest appropriate solutions to the problem.</p> <p>1.5      Significance of the Study</p> <p>With the ever increasing pace of development, social media fraud has become an inevitable and a more specialized area of crime which threatens the economy and even the peace and security of the nation. The publicity surrounding Nigeria social media fraud is raising fears that the country may face a slowdown in international investment in telecommunication as well as the financial sectors (Thomas, 2011). As more Nigerians use the internet for their banking needs, the number of fraudsters eyeing people’s bank accounts and online financial transactions has also multiplied. Hence, this study has provided useful information on the factors responsible for the increase rate of social media fraud in the society.</p> <p>Unlike the advance societies, developing societies have almost little or no modalities put in place to curb the excesses of social media fraudsters. In order to out smart the social media fraud fighting agencies, these social media fraudsters have connections with one another thereby learning more sophisticated methods/skills day in day out to commit this havoc. As such, the exposure of the techniques been used by these social media fraudsters will contribute positively to the efforts being made by these agencies.</p> <p>Moreover, since youths within the age bracket of 18-30 years (Zero Tolerance, 2006), have been identified to be most vulnerable to this crime and have also been identified to be either in tertiary institutions or about to be admitted into one or graduates. The research work was able to identify other attributes/characteristics of social media fraudsters. In addition, since social media fraud is denting the country image among the committee of nations and the present administration has vowed to place Nigeria among the top twenty largest economies in the world by 2020. This research will contribute positively to the efforts being made by concerned government and private agencies to develop strategies to combat the menace.</p> <p>Above all, taking into account that social media fraud and the underlying criminology behind cyber criminals are very new and there is a relative shortage of available research and literature on the subject. This therefore, makes this study very important because the study has added to the existing literature by revealing a number of different bases on what typically makes and motivates social media frauds and also identify the consequences it has in the society.</p> <p>1.6       Scope of the Study</p> <p>The study revolves around issues on the pattern and consequences of social media fraud. It was conducted in Zaria, Kaduna State and limited to students of 3 selected tertiary institutions namely; Ahmadu Bello University, Federal College of Education and Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic.  In addition, other respondents that participated in the study were operators of cyber café, lecturers from Computer Science Department of the selected tertiary institution and individuals who indulge in social media fraud. The study was conducted from August 2011 to May 2013.</p> <p>1.7      Definition of Key Terms</p> <p>Computer: Computer is described as an electronic machine that works under the control of store information (programs).

The pursuit of these rights is however not absolute as there exist state institutions like the police whose mandate is to maintain law and order and curtail the citizenry‟s excesses within constitutional means</p> <p>hence:[1]</p> <p>Police power is the exercise of the sovereign right of government to promote order, safety, health, morals, general welfare within constitutional limits and it is an essential attribute of government.‟ Indeed, the police are the outward civil authority of the power and might of a civilized country. The generality of the public is potentially affected one way or another by their action or inaction</p> <p>What this presupposes is that while democracy allows or guarantees freedom, the police as an institution policed that freedom and in carrying out this function, they are expected to operate within existing democratic norms, else the essence of democracy becomes defeated. This is because the role of police and the existence of these norms remain the standard benchmark in ascertaining an acceptable democratic system. As a result, most of the policing applications that are classified as democratic policing practices in an ideal society are designed to ordinarily promote democratic principles and human rights. In Nigeria however, many dilemma arose concerning the way and manner the police carry out its statutory responsibilities. Top on the striking balance of this is the need to respect the inalienable rights of citizens while carrying out their legitimate duties. These duties ought to be performed within the context of existing rules duly fashioned and recognized. It is however regrettable that despite more than a decade of democratic governance, Nigerians are still faced with lots of human rights abuses in the hand of the police. Contrary to what democracy represents, the police is still largely authoritarian in nature[2] .  McCulley[3] opines that the state of human rights violations by police officials is becoming a culture of impunity and this includes arbitrary arrest, extra-judicial killings, illegal detention and destruction of property by security forces etc. The question therefore is how democratic is the Nigeria Police Force and how well have they imbibe democratic policing principles? What is their response level with regards to the observance of human rights since 1999? It has been correctly pointed out that the police have not performed well in this regard.</p> <p>The Guardian editorial opined:</p> <p>The truth is that the police system in Nigeria is decadent at several levels, not least of which is the tunnel vision of our police men in their operational  approach to investigations and the treatment of suspects and detainees. Driven by overwhelming corrupt tendencies, they are rooted to a mixed bag of torture tactics that have nothing to do with the enforcement of the law or the promotion of justice… Nigerians know too well that whether accepting commissions from individuals or groups to settle scores against antagonists, opponents or offenders, whether hounding persons or groups in the name of the state or making suspects plead guilty to a crime not committed in order to be saved from police brutality, or whether committing sexual violence against female detainees, our police are adept to making life hell on earth for their victims.[4]</p> <p>Reuben Abati observed further:</p> <p>…the Nigeria Police Force is one of the most unpopular institutions in Nigeria today; it is distrusted by the same people whose lives and property it is meant to protect, and this has resulted into a resort to self-help in many ways. Every year, the Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch as well as local civil society organizations report on many cases of police brutality, police inefficiency and corruption. The crime rate is on the increase and the police have proven to be helpless and overwhelmed. This has been so in nearly every instance, be the matter of armed robbery, kidnapping, ethno religious violence or financial fraud. It is also generally regarded as a corrupt police force with policemen collecting bribes openly and showing tendencies of thuggery and mendicancy. It is so bad that rich persons hire the police for all kinds of unlawful purpose, or simply as bodyguards to oppress the less privileged. [5]</p> <p>In spite of the foregoing, it has been shown that there are inherent factors responsible for this negative impasse. One of such is the impact of Nigeria‟s colonial/ military history. The annexation of Lagos by the British in 1861 and the subsequent establishment of a Consular Guard were solely to protect British economic interest and so no foundation was properly laid for a civil and genuine police force for Nigeria.  Dambazau agrees when he stated that “the Nigeria Police was not constituted to provide services to the community in a manner consistent with human rights and democracy, but the main concern of the colonial administration was to brutally suppress popular resistance against colonialism by poorly educated and poorly trained personnel, and the effects are still felt today”[6] . Alemika also agreed:</p> <p>…Historical evidence demonstrates that the colonial police forces were organized and oriented to behave as occupation forces- ruthless,  brutal, corrupt, dishonest and prone to brutalizing the colonized peoples and vandalizing their properties… The preoccupation of colonial and post-colonial Nigeria police were not the promotion and enforcement of just laws, rule of law, natural justice and equity and security of the vast majority of Nigerians, as colonial surrogates often claimed…the greatest part of the police energies and resources were committed to, and dissipated on the suppression of struggles and protests against oppression and exploitation, the large scale theft and mismanagement of the public wealth by those who controlled the economy and state apparatus.[7]</p> <p>Regrettably at independence in 1960, it became obvious that those who took over from the colonial authority began to manipulate the system for their own selfish interest.[8] Worst still, subsequent military regimes that took over from 1966 failed to improve the police and instead used it to enforce authoritarian rule which further entrenched a culture of public disdain and hatred for the police.[9] These negative tendencies continued unabated and finally culminated into acts of indiscipline, corruption and violation of the rights of citizens to mention but these few. Another germane problem is the loopholes in the Nigeria Police Act which has enhanced the obvious disconnect between the police, the law and the citizens. Innocent Chukwuma laments that “since 1943 when the police Act was enacted by the colonial government, it has not been reviewed to reflect present day realities”[10] . According to him:</p> <p>The first is to capture and incorporate into law, recent positive policy developments in the Nigeria Police Force. Such developments include community policing, police performance monitoring and minimum educational requirement for entry and performance in the force. The second issue is to amend or expunge provisions in the Act that have either become outdated or obnoxious in the light of the present democratic dispensation. The third is the necessity to amend sections of the Act that makes it impossible to insulate the police from partisan political control[11]</p> <p>Suffice it to say that Democracy is a term that has been jointly and severally subjected to all kinds of meaning and interpretation. According to Buhlman et al, „there are abundant literature relating to democratic theory with countless definitions of what democracy should be and what democracy is‟[12] . Laza corroborated this view by saying that „there is no consensus on how to measure democracy, and that definitions of democracy are contested and there is an ongoing lively debate on the subject.[13] To start with, „democracy‟ was define as „a system of rule by the poor and disadvantaged; a form of government in which the people rule themselves directly and continuously without the need for professional politicians or public officials; a society based on equal opportunity and individual merit rather than hierarchy and privilege; a system of welfare and redistribution aimed at narrowing social inequalities; a system of decisionmaking based on the principle of majority rule; a system of rule that secures the rights and interest of minorities by placing checks upon the power of the majority; a means of filling public office through a competitive struggle for the popular vote.[14] To some writers, „democracy is a system of government by which political sovereignty is retained by the people and exercise directly by the citizens. In Sadaro‟s own view „the essential idea of democracy is that people have the right to determine who governs them. In most cases, they elect the principal government officials and hold them accountable for their actions. A democracy also imposes legal limits on the government‟s authority by guarantying certain rights and freedoms to their citizens‟[15] .</p> <p>The minimalist sees democracy as a „political system of political rights that specifies how leadership should be designated at the highest national level in a policy. It is in this same line that Schumpeter[16] defines democracy as „that institutional arrangement for arriving at political decision in which individuals acquire the power to decide by means of a competitive struggle for the people‟s vote. Other authors like Diamond Larry uses the maximalist definition of democracy as all encompassing „not only a civilian, constitutional, multiparty regime, with regular, free and fair elections and universal suffrage, but organizational and informational pluralism; extensive civil liberties; effective power for elected office and functional autonomy for legislative, executive and judicial organs of government.[17]</p> <p>From the foregoing definitions, the essential principles or elements for any system to qualify as democracy are many. In other words certain elements must co-exist for a political system to be called a democracy. Several views abound and shall be considered. Buhlman et al identified equality, freedom and control as the key principles or elements of democracy. They opined thus, “we define freedom, equality and control as the three core principles of democracy.</p> <p>To qualify as a democracy, a given political system has to guarantee freedom and equality. Moreover, it has to optimize the interdependence between these two principles by means of control. Control is understood as control by the government as well as control of the government.[18]</p> <p>Linz and Stepan[19] argues that for a democracy to be consolidated, five interrelated conditions must exist, that is to say: free and lively civil society, a relatively autonomous and valued political society, the rule of law to guarantee citizen‟s freedom and independent associational life, functioning state bureaucracy which can be use by the democratic government and an institutions analyzed economic society. In his own contribution, Professor Eteng posits that genuine democracy is obviously inconceivable today without the following structures and elementary forms: free and fair election completely bereft of money driven, zero-sum, macabre prone electoral process, truly representative government drawn not from ethno-religious constituencies but rather more or less from various occupational groups, an independent judiciary, a vibrant civil society comprising organized labour, professional bodies, pro democracy and human rights organization a free and unfettered press and finally a people oriented economy.[20]</p> <p>The Inter-Parliamentary Council, the plenary governing body of the Inter-Parliamentary</p> <p>Union in its 161st conference held in Cairo Egypt on 16th September 1997 adopted the Universal</p> <p>Declaration on Democracy and asserted as follows:</p> <p>A state of democracy ensures that the processes by which power is acceded to, wielded and alternates allow for free political completion and are the product of open, free and non-</p> <p>discriminatory participation by the people, exercised in accordance with the rule of law, in both letter and spirit…. As an ideal, democracy aims essentially to preserve and promote the dignity and fundamental rights of the individual, to achieve social justice, faster the economic and social development of the community, strengthen the cohesion of society and enhance national tranquility.</p> <p>The Council maintained that democracy must be based on existence of a well structured and functioning institutions as well as a body of standards operated on the will of the society with rights and responsibilities. It is founded on the right of everyone to take part in the management of public affairs through the holding of free and fair elections at regular intervals. To achieve this, civil and political rights are essential, and more particular among them, the right to vote and be voted for, the right to freedom of expression and assembly, access to information and the right to organize political activities. Public accountability applies to all who hold public office and independent judicial institutions with effective oversight. Mechanisms are equally required to give efficacy to the doctrines of the rule of law.[21]</p> <p>1.1     Statement of the Problem</p> <p>Policing a democratic state entails the ideals of the rule of law and human rights as its core principles. The rule of law emphasizes the need for all persons and institutions including law enforcement agencies (police) to be responsive to the tenets of all democratic laws that are consistent with human rights standards. These standards have assumed universal acceptance to the extent that there is a duty imposed on law enforcement officials to, at all times respect and obey the law, protect all persons against illegal acts and protect human dignity and maintain and uphold the human rights of all.</p> <p>The constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) in line with international norms and obligations contains human rights provisions to protect the rights of citizens. The constitution also established the Nigeria Police Force with the statutory duty of maintaining law and order. This duty must however conform to standard best practices that reflect the tenets of the rule of law and human rights observance. Unfortunately, the overall performance of the police in Nigeria leaves much to be desired. The force appears more adept to paramilitary operations, anti democratic tendencies and abuse of police powers. Incessant abuses such as arbitrary arrest, illegal detention, torture, inhuman and other degrading treatment as well as extra judicial killings are common place. Besides, democratic policing attributes like the rule of law, accountability, responsive/representative policing and respect for human rights are essentially lacking.  The shortfall stems from the lapses in the Police Act and the inefficiency and ineffectiveness in the overall operation and execution of policing generally which if critically viewed together do not help to create a police force that respect the rights of citizens as guaranteed under the constitution and other international human rights conventions which</p> <p>Nigeria has signed and ratified.</p> <p>1.2       Scope of the Research</p> <p>This research work is limited to policing a democratic Nigeria and the observance of human rights by its police force in comparative terms with international best practices.</p> <p>The reason for this limitation is most clearly informed by the fact that human rights standards are compromised and abuses abound in a developing country like Nigeria. Besides, policing raises issues which either enhances or retrogresses democratic advancement hence it became expedient to use the Nigeria Police Force as a case study to review their overall performance and participation in the democratic process to see whether Nigeria‟s nascent democracy is being advanced</p> <p>1.3    Objectives of the Research</p> <p>This research had explored three correlated questions. First, to what extent or degree are democratic policing principles applicable in Nigeria? Second, how well has the Nigeria Force faired in terms of human rights observance since the return to civil rule in 1999? Was the Nigeria Police Act fashioned to encourage democratic policing and observance of human rights? To this end, the research x-rays the powers and operational capabilities of the Nigeria Police Force vis a vis the observance of human rights in the new Nigeria democratic setting. It explores in very simplistic terms, the basic principles of democratic policing and the need for human right observance within the context of global best practices. It provides a comparative and indebt analysis of policing as a major component of democracy, policing and human rights issues, judicial attitude to policing and other operational efficacy of the police with particular emphasis on the lacunas of the enabling law establishing the police. It also brings to the fore myriads of abuses inherent in the system, the need to officially recognize their violations and the challenges of surmounting them. The overall objective is to observe and proffer amicable recommendations that will help save guard democratic policing in Nigeria.</p> <p>, findings/observations, and recommendations.</p> <p>[1] Per Uwaifo JSCin Fawehinmi Vs Inspector General of Police (2002) 7 N.W.L.R (Pt. 767) 606 at 672-673</p> <p>[2] Akhaine, S.O. and Chizea, B.U., State of Human Rights in Nigeria- Center  for Constitutionalism and Demilitarization Annual Report, Abuja (2011) p. 16</p> <p>[3] McCulley, T.P., “Nigeria‟s Commitment to Human Rights”, The Punch, 25th April, 2013.</p> <p>www.punching.com(assessed on 4th November, 2013)</p> <p>[4] The Guardian, 18th August, 2005,p. 16</p> <p>[5] This Day Newspaper, Tuesday, 15th April, 2008, p. 23</p> <p>[6] Dabazau, A.

No society is free of crime and criminals. The Nigeria Police Force is an agency established by law to ensure preservation of public order and law enforcement as well as prevention and detection of crime. The police plays vital role in the administration of justice in any society. The police present the entry point into the criminal justice system either through reports from the public or its own investigation and surveillance. It is therefore a fact that an average citizen has contact with the police more than with any other agency for administration of criminal justice. </p> </div> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong></p><p> General Introduction  1.1              Background of the study   </p> <p>The phenomenon, “crime” has been a major subject of private and public concern throughout human history. No society is free of crime. However, the question often asked is that even if crime is part of inevitable human behaviour, how much of it can a society tolerate? This question is linked to man’s natural instinct for survival, the ability to respond to any threat to his life and property. Crime poses such a threat, particularly in its violent form.  </p> <p> The recent upsurge in violent crimes in Nigeria has created enormous uncertainty in the security of lives and property of individuals and of social stability in general. The incidents of traditional crimes such as armed robbery, arson, drug trafficking and abuse, murder, kidnapping, rape, hired assassinations and ritual killings are examples of the most serious and violent crimes which have been on the increase in the recent past. Correspondingly, White Collar Crimes in the form of Advance Fee Fraud (popularly, known as 419), contract deals, embezzlement and mismanagement in both the public and private sectors are also on the increase. The aggregate of the traditional crimes mostly committed by the less privileged and white collar crimes mostly committed by the highly placed call for a change in the strategies for the prevention and control of crime in Nigeria, </p> <p> The existing patterns in criminal activities show that criminals are getting more organized, sophisticated and brutal in the manner they carry out their dastardly acts, either in the way they physically attack individuals with dangerous weapons or the method they use in taking advantage of their official positions to steal and stash away millions of public funds in foreign and domestic accounts. Equally worrisome is the new dimension in organized criminal behaviour in Nigeria involving acts of terrorism and sabotage against individuals and public places. Recent incidents, in which some individual were stalked and eventually trapped in the volley of bullets from assault weapons, depict the viciousness of violent criminals. These acts are usually well-planned, orchestrated, syndicated and organized in the mafia-type fashion. In addition to these new patterns of violent crimes against persons, there is also the equally disturbing criminal behaviour against the Nigerian economy leading to the collapse of financial institutions and government parastatals. In short, we are witnessing the emergences of dangerous trends in the nation’s social and economic well-being.  </p> <p>Three bodies are responsible for the administration of criminal justice in Nigeria. These bodies are: the Courts, the Police and Prisons. This research focuses on the police functions in the administration of justice and the manner in which such functions are carried out.</p> <p>The primary functions of the police are detection and prevention of crime as well as preservation of law and order. The police has constitutional powers of ensuring the prevalence of law and order and the preservation of public peace. </p> <p> The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria confer on the police force powers and duties for effective oversight and accountability[1]</p> <p>Added to the above, is the seeming lopsidedness in recent times in the prosecution of criminal offences as it affects the privileged and less privileged members of the society.  On a day to day basis in Nigeria, Magistrates and other inferior courts are inundated with minor cases of stealing, cheating, criminal breach of trust and traffic offences committed by Nigerians who in most cases belong to the less privileged class of the society.  In fact, some months back, a Magistrate </p> <p>Court sitting in Lagos attracted attention when she sentenced hundreds of Nigerians, some of whom under aged, to different terms of imprisonment without option of fine for minor traffic and environmental offences.  On the contrary, the prosecution of most blue or white collar offences hardly attracted the same level of success or determined prosecution.  The prosecutions of several persons alleged to have committed serious crimes of official corruption have dragged on for years without success.[2]</p> <p>Two factors seem responsible for the above situation – the overriding powers of the president and state governors in the appointment and removal of Lawyers and the refusal of the judiciary in Nigeria to invoke the power of judicial review on the exercise of powers by the Lawyers on the ground that the powers are absolute and subject to no judicial review what so ever.5.   </p> <p>The above background facts therefore, motivated the desire of writing this dissertation.  The dissertation looked at the aforementioned problems and offered suggestions towards solving the same and achieving a better administration of criminal justice in Nigeria. </p> <p> 1.2             Statement of the Problem  </p> <p>The Nigeria Police is saddled with the responsibility of maintenance of law and order. It also protects, prevents and investigates criminal activities. In the discharge of these duties, the force has over the years failed. This is by virtue of certain inherent problems and challenges that has militated the force in its application of its powers as have been statutorily provided. Some of these problems are: </p> <p>a.             The abuse of human rights, collection of bribes, corruption in the force, flagrant shooting of suspects and fellow policemen, illiteracy and incompetence of certain police officers to the mounting of illegal road blocks. </p> <p>b.             Lack of respect for fundamental human rights of every citizen in the discharge of their duties. These rights and liberties take the forefront in the operation of the rule of law in all democracies of the world today. Sadly, even when the Nigerian Constitution of 1999, reserves an entire chapter (the famous chapter iv) declaring and providing for the protection of these rights, the Police still continue to engage in their abuse from time to time.  </p> <p>c.             There is police lawlessness which begins with small irregularities or illegalities such as the disquieting features of committing crime of falsifying crime records against accused persons. These sorts of events, actions or inactions indulged in by policemen show an open disregard for the principles of the rules of law and civilized conduct which adversely affect police discipline and make mockery of the Nigeria Police force generally.  </p> <p>d.             There is also the problem of police extortion at road checkpoints, arbitrary arrest and detection, torture of detainees, administrative cover-ups are a few of the crimes committed by the police force in their pursuit for justice which they claim to uphold. </p> <p>e.             Again, the Nigerian Police in the modern age seem to be handicapped in the face of current realities. It has been noticed that despite the teeming police personnel, the force is still bereft of manpower in certain quotas. There have been situations in which the police complain of shortage of staff when issues are reported to them.  </p> <p>f.              Another problem is the lack of scientific and technological equipment for detecting crimes by the police. </p> <p>g.             The police are handicap on the following aspects: Shortage of manpower  </p> <p>i)               Inadequate transport facilities  </p> <p>ii)             Lack of scientific equipments for detecting crime </p> <p><strong>1.3 Aims and Objectives  </strong></p> <p>The aims and objectives of this research work are:  </p> <p>1)   To examine the role of the Nigeria Police and Lawyers in the administration of justice. </p> <p>2)   To identify the inadequacies of the police in the discharge of their functions. </p> <p>3)   To proffer practical solutions for combating crimes in Nigeria.  </p><p> 1.4 Justification   The importance of this research work cannot be over  </p> <p>emphasized. It analyses the role of Police in the Administration of Justice in Nigeria in order to give the public clearer views on police administration. Also, the research is necessitated to show case the </p> <p>indiscriminate violations of human rights by the police and the gross increase of crime rate in the country which often leaves much to be desired.  </p> <p>With the above issues, this research will serve as a viable </p> <p>source of information to all and sundry. First, it will benefit the police, those engaged in the administration of justice, law enforcement agencies and the court. It will also provide relevant suggestions on how best to curb the increase of crimes; it is also of immense benefit to policy makers, government officials, academicians, students and anyone interested in the peaceful co-existence of the Nigerian populace.  </p><p> 1.5              Scope of the Research  </p> <p>This research is limited to the Role Of Lawyers And Police In Administration Of Justice in the administration of justice. It will also look into the issues of crimes prevention and mechanisms for control crimes in Nigeria. But, reference shall be made to the former colonial master (United Kingdom) who introduces police administration in Nigeria. Analysis was also made to other police organization to enhance more knowledge on this area.</p> <p> 1.6             Research Methodology   </p> <p>The methodology employed in this research is doctrinal. That is, both the primary and secondary sources shall be employed such as the examination of statutes, Case laws, law reports, textbooks by renounced scholars. Other library materials such as journals, newspapers had been made reference to. Of course, internet sources were considered for current trends on crime detection and prevention. Encyclopedias, thesaurus and police diaries have been made </p> <p>reference to.  </p><p> 1.7           Literature Review   </p> <p>This work examines an institution of great historical and political interest and significance. Together with the judiciary, civil services and the military, the police constitute one of the key institutions of a modern state. In particular, the origins, development and role of the police have not only prevented, detected and crime, they have also maintained law and order, preserved public safety and generally buttressed the existing governments, which were at first British and later Nigerian. </p> <p> Alcock, R.N. in his book, <em>“Police Instruction Book</em>”[3] discussed very fundamental issues on crime prevention and detection. His work is indepth on the role of police in the prevention of crime, but failed to address to the minute detail of issues of enforcement of law. Also, his work, though relevant for this research, it is not in tune with contemporary issues as they obtain in Nigeria.  </p> <p>Adebayo M.A., while writing on the powers of Lawyers in the institution and conduct of criminal prosecution, observed that the powers of </p> <p>Lawyers are too wide and subject to whimsical exploitation by the political class in Nigeria.  He opined that as the Lawyers combines the office of the Chief Law Officer and Chief Legal adviser to the government of either the Federation or the State (which automatically makes him a member of the executive council) it will be very difficult for him to go against the will of his appointer in matters of personal interest to the appointer.  This arrangement according to him is very dangerous to the administration of criminal justice in Nigeria since the powers of the Lawyers may be invoked by the executive to compromise criminal prosecution against their political supporters; whilst at the same time using the power to whimsical advantage in haunting political opponents with criminal prosecution.  He therefore, suggested that as the powers of Lawyers is not reviewable by any court of law in Nigeria, “the provisions of section 174 and 211 of the Constitution should be amended to allow the court to have the power to review the exercise of the powers of Lawyers where it is found out to be grossly abused or where the exercise of such power will engender injustice to any member of the public.”[4]</p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] Section 214(2)(b) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria with Amendments 2011.  </p> </div> <div> <p>[2] Babalola A., (2015), <em>The need to separate office of the Minister of Justice from the Attorney General of the Federation, </em>Babaji/AppData/Local/Temp/Low/CTLH4X.htm, 12/05/2015. 5<em>State vs Ilori</em> (1983) 2 S.C. p. 155. </p> </div> <div> <p>[3] Alcock, R.N., <em>Police Instruction Book</em>, (Worth Publishers, New York, 2005), p. 18.  </p> </div> <div> <p>[4] Adebayo, M.A. (2012), <em>Administration of Criminal Justices System in Nigeria,</em> Princeton Publishing Co., Ikeja-Lagos, , PP. 125-127. </p> </div> </div>\n\nROLE OF LAWYERS AND POLICE IN ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ROLE OF LAWYERS AND POLICE IN ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE", "id": 19}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>TORTURE AS A MEANS OF OBTAINING RELIABLE INFORMATION FROM CRIME SUSPECT</strong></p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Governments sometimes characterize torture as an indispensable interrogation tool for gathering strategic intelligence. In this article, we review the relevant social scientific research on the effectiveness, impact, and causes of torture. First, we summarize research on false confessions and examine the relevance of that research for torture-based interrogations. Next, we review research on the mental health consequences of torture for survivors and perpetrators. Finally, we explore thesocial-psychological conditions that promote acts of cruelty (suchasthoseseen at Abu Ghraib) and examine the arguments typically offered to justify the use of torture. We argue that any hypothesized benefits from the use of torture must be weighed against the substantial proven costs of torture. These costs include the unreliable information extracted through interrogations using torture, the mental and emotional toll on victims and torturers, loss of international stature and credibility, and the risk of retaliation against soldiers and civilians.</p> <p>Torture is one of the most extreme forms of human violence, resulting in both physical and psychological consequences. Torture has been used for thousands of years, and is still widespread, occurring throughout much of the world (Amnesty International, 2009). Research has shown that torture can have enduring negative effects on both survivors and perpetrators, and is ineffective for obtaining reliable information in interrogation. Although many international laws and codes have been established to prohibit torture, its widespread use continues as part of internal</p> <p>conflicts within nations, as well as in international conflicts. The issue of torture has most recently stirred debate with respect to interrogation practices used by the United States.</p> <p>In 2003, the world was stunned by a series of photographs of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. These photos, taken by U.S. soldiers on cell phones and digital cameras, depicted prisoners subjected to cruel and humiliating treatment at the hands of U.S. troops. In one photo, a handcuffed, terrified prisoner is shown cornered by a snarling military dog straining against its leash. In many photos, naked prisoners had been forced to lie on top of one another in a pile or to simulate sexual acts. Several pictures show naked, hooded inmates handcuffed in painful positions to beds and cell bars. Some inmates have bleeding wounds; others appear to have wires attached to their bodies (Hersh, 2004). Some photos were especially disturbing because they show soldiers (both men and women) posing next to the abused prisoners, grinning or giving “thumbs up” signs, appearing to take sadistic pleasure in the abuse. In responding to the outcry created by the photos, soldiers explained that they had been instructed to “soften up” prisoners for more systematic interrogation (Scherer &amp; Benjamin, 2003).</p> <p>At present the United States is engaged in what it has termed the \"Global War on Terror.\" In this effort many prisoners are taken by the US and its allies. Clearly some percentage of these prisoners may hold information which has the potential to: 1) prevent (or lessen the impacts of) terrorist acts against civilians; 2) prevent terrorist acts against military targets; 3) provide the means to break up the terrorist network(s); 4) provide the means to disrupt terrorist command and control activities. Similar situations may exist in many other areas of the world, such as Chechnya or Israel, where a recognized government is \"at war\" with terrorist organizations.</p> <p>The governments or occupying powers hold an asymmetric relationship with the groups they are fighting. Decisions of the governments will be unilateral and any concessions toward humane treatment will not necessarily be reciprocated by the terrorist groups.</p> <p>This paper does not directly examine issues of whether the detention of prisoners is justified, but rather the conduct of interrogation sessions and whether the use of torture in those sessions is ever justifiable.</p> <p><strong>1.1.1  Definitions</strong></p> <p><strong>Dictionary definitions:</strong></p> <p>Interrogate<em>: verb: 1 : to question formally and systematically</em> [1]Torture: <em>noun: 2 : the infliction of intense pain (as from burning, crushing, or wounding) to punish, coerce, or afford sadistic pleasure verb: 1 : to cause intense suffering to : TORMENT 2 : to punish or coerce by inflicting excruciating pain <strong>[2]</strong></em></p> <p>Other definitions:</p> <p>[from 18 USC 113C Section 2340 US Anti-Torture Act]</p> <p><em>(1)   </em><em>\"torture\" means an act committed by a person acting under the color of law specifically intended toinflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or physical control;</em></p> <p><em>(2)   </em><em>\"severe mental pain or suffering\" means the prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from (A) the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering;</em></p> <p><em>(B)                </em><em>the administration or application, or threatened administration or application, of mindaltering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality;</em></p> <p><em>(C)                </em><em>the threat of imminent death; or</em></p> <p><em>(D)               </em><em>the threat that another person will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain orsuffering, or the administration or application of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality;</em></p> <p>From the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment: <em>For the purposes of this Convention, the term \"torture\" means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions. </em></p> <p>The definition of <em>interrogate</em> yields very little sense of the fact that subjects of interrogation do not</p> <p>generally want to divulge information. Interrogators often utilize coercive techniques to cause the subject to cede</p> <p>the desired information. These coercive techniques exist on a continuum from “direct questioning” through “torture” and “death”.[3]</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>As early as the third century A.D., the great Roman Jurist Ulpian noted that informationobtainedthroughtorturewasnottobetrustedbecausesomepeopleare “so susceptible to pain that they will tell any lie rather than suffer it” (Peters, 1996). This warning about the unreliability of information extracted through the use of torture has echoed across the centuries. As one CIA operative who participated in torture during the Vietnam War put it, “We had people who were willing to confess to anything if we would just stop torturing them” (Andersen, 2004, p. 3). Indeed, the Army Field Manual explains that strategically useful information is best obtained from prisoners who are treated humanely, and that information obtained through torture has produced faulty intelligence (Leahy, 2005).</p> <p>It is important to acknowledge that torture may sometimes lead to the disclosure of accurate information. That is, confronted with excruciating pain, some people tell what they know. However, many survivors of torture report that the truthful information they revealed was intentionally incomplete or mixed with false information (Harbury, 2005). The goal was to appease the torturer, not to reveal the truth. And, because the interrogators were not omniscient, they could not discern which bits of information were true and which were false. Misreading their victims, torturers often failed to recognize the truth and continued to inflict pain. Victims continued to disclose, often fabricating information to in an effort to stop the pain (Conroy, 2000; Haritos-Fatouros, 2003). Many survivors of torture report that they would have said anything to “make the torture stop” (Mayer, 2005; McCoy, 2006). And, even in cases where torture may have preceded the disclosure of useful information, it is impossible to know whether less coercive forms of interrogation might have yielded the same or even better results.</p> <p><strong>1.3     Aim of the study</strong></p> <p>The main aim of this study is to evaluate torture as a means of obtaining reliable information from crime suspects.</p> <p><strong>1.4     Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the national and international public debate over the use of torture in interrogations has focused on legal and moral issues. Often overlooked is the psychology of torture and the substantial body of empirical research relevant to the debate. This study summarizes that empirical research and places the issue of torture in social-psychological context. We begin by reviewing research on the psychology of coercive interrogations and the problem of false confessions. Next, we summarize the findings of research on the psychological impact of torture on victims and perpetrators. Finally, we place the issue of torture in context by exploring the situational factors that facilitate cruelty and the arguments used by governments and individuals to justify the use of torture.</p> <p>This study will also benefit researchers and academicians carrying out research related to this study.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] “Interrogate.” Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/interrogate</p> </div> <div> <p>[2] “Torture.” Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/torture</p> </div> <div> <p>[3] Filarowski-Sheaks, Christina, Interrogation Policy &amp; the Global War on Terrorism, Presentation to Terrorism</p> <p>Cybersecurity Class, Berkeley, California, 30-Nov-2005</p> </div> </div>\n\nTORTURE AS A MEANS OF OBTAINING RELIABLE INFORMATION FROM CRIME SUSPECT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " TORTURE AS A MEANS OF OBTAINING RELIABLE INFORMATION FROM CRIME SUSPECT", "id": 20}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Abstract</p> <p>Chapter One: Introduction</p> <p>Background of the Study</p> <p>Statement of the Research Problem</p> <p>Research Objectives</p> <p>Hypothesis</p> <p>Significance/Scope of the Study</p> <p>Organization of the Study</p> <p>Research Methodology</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>Literature Review</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>Research Design</p> <p>Research Methodology</p> <p>Questionnaire Design</p> <p>Population of the Study</p> <p>Sample Size/Technique</p> <p>Data Collection/instrument</p> <p>Method of Data Analysis</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>Data Analysis</p> <p>Presentations of Data</p> <p>Testing of Hypothesis</p> <p>Interpretation</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p>Summary</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Recommendation</p> <p>Bibliography</p>                                                           \n\nEVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HUMAN RIGHT LAW IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HUMAN RIGHT LAW IN NIGERIA", "id": 21}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Abstract</p> <p>Chapter One: Introduction</p> <p>Backgroundof the Study</p> <p>Statement of the Research Problem</p> <p>Research Objectives</p> <p>Hypothesis</p> <p>Significance/Scope of the Study</p> <p>Organization of the Study</p> <p>Research Methodology</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>Literature Review</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>Research Design</p> <p>Research Methodology</p> <p>Questionnaire Design</p> <p>Population of the Study</p> <p>Sample Size/Technique</p> <p>Data Collection/instrument</p> <p>Method of Data Analysis</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>Data Analysis</p> <p>Presentations of Data</p> <p>Testing of Hypothesis</p> <p>Interpretation</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p>Summary</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Recommendation</p> <p>Bibliography</p> <p>Appendix</p>                                                           \n\nEXAMINING THE INTEGRITY OF POLICE OFFICERS IN ADMINISTERING BAIL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EXAMINING THE INTEGRITY OF POLICE OFFICERS IN ADMINISTERING BAIL", "id": 22}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>The study examined the role of Human Rights institutions in the country in addressing the problem ofchild abuse.The objective of this study is causes, types and effects of child abuse on the child, the family and thenation. The work is meant to draw closer attention on this increasing scourge and access measures ofaddressing to preserve the fundamental human rights of the child as entrenched under the NigeriaChild Right Act.In the study, the researcher defined what child abuse is; the various forms of child abuse, and alsoidentified some of the causes and consequences of child abuse as a reflection of the societal problemand its impact on the life of the child. The study also evaluated the extent of damages it does to theabused child and the Nigerian society. In order to gather relevant data and information on the subjectmatter, the researcher used the questionnaire as data collection instrument, which was administeredon 200 respondents within the FCT which is the limit of the scope of the study. A self constructedquestionnaire titled Child Abuse Questionnaire (CAQ) was administered on the students aftervalidation. The instrument has construct validity co-efficient of 0.756 and reliability co-efficient of0.95. The statistical technique that was used to analyse the data collected was Chi-Square distributiontest. The result of the analysis showed that there was a significant relationship between poverty andeconomic deprivation and child abuse in Nigeria. Also the study revealed that child abuse is still very prevalent in Nigeria and also that religious and cultural influences contribute to child abuse in Nigeria.The result revealed that the Rights institutions are not doing enough to arrest the problem of childabuse and that the child right act is not working in Nigeria.</div> <div> <div> <div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</div> <div>The Collins concise dictionary defines juvenile as pertaining to the young or immature of youth orchildhood. This comprises the child and the adolescent. According to World Health Organization(WHO), a child falls within the age group of 0</div> <div> – </div> <div> 19 years. Some countries further include any oneless than or up to 21 years. The Nigerian labour act defines a child as those who are 16 years of ageand below but the International Labour Organization (ILO) has brought it down to individuals below15years of age. Child abuse can be defined as ‘an intentional or neglectful physical or emotional injury imposed on achild, including sexual molestation.’ (Garner 1999:10) Child abuse violates the United NationDeclaration of Human Rights, the United Nation’s Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted in1989 and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the African Child. Child abuse can be seen as situation whereby the fundamental human right of a child is temperedwith. That is, the child is not given adequate care and protection as it’s the responsibility of every parent to take good care of their children. This rights are right to education, religion, freedom,movement, shelter etc. The child on most occasion is exposed to unnecessary hardship and odds inlife.Although child abuse occurs in Nigeria, it has received little attention. This is probably due to theemphasis placed on the more prevalent childhood problems of malnutrition and infection. Another possible reason is the general assumption that in every African society the extended family systemalways provides love, care and protection to all children. Yet there are traditional child rearing practices which adversely affect some children, such as purposeful neglect or abandonment ofseverely handicapped children, and twins or triplets in some rural areas. With the alteration of society by rapid socioeconomic and political changes, various forms of child abuse have been identified, particularly in the urban areas. These may be considered the outcome of abnormal interactions of thechild, parents/ guardians and society. They include abandonment of normal infants by unmarried orvery poor mothers in cities, increased child labour and exploitation of children from rural areas inurban elite families, and abuse of children in urban nuclear families by child-minders . Preventivemeasures include provision of infrastructural facilities and employment opportunities in the ruralareas in order to prevent drift of the young population to the cities. This would sustain the supportiverole of the extended family system which is rapidly being eroded.</div> </div> </div> </div>                                                         \n\n THE ROLES OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND PUBLIC COMPLAINT COMMISSION: A STUDY OF CHILD ABUSE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  THE ROLES OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND PUBLIC COMPLAINT COMMISSION: A STUDY OF CHILD ABUSE", "id": 23}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Abstract </p> <p>The aim of this article is consider the current constitution, and likely future prospects, of the field of criminology, and to examine in particular how it might be becoming more global in nature. The term ‘criminology’ will be used broadly, referring to the academic field as a whole, and hence including the study of the causes of crime, responses to crime including criminal justice, as well as to the field’s many sub-disciplines. The article begins by considering international and comparative criminology, before reviewing previous work that has raised the prospect of a ‘global criminology.’ The focus then shifts to consideration of the question, ‘what is criminology?’, prompted in particular by the various essays in Bosworth and Hoyle (eds) (2011). It is argued that this question usefully draws attention to certain problems currently facing Anglo-American criminology, and contends moreover that these issues are related in certain respects to issues that will face criminology as it globalises. Drawing from work by Wenger (1999) and others, a novel way of conceptualising the field of criminology is proposed, namely as a group of ‘communities of practice.’ The article shows how not only does this approach help model some of the challenges facing Anglo- American criminology both domestically and globally, but that it also suggests some practical measures that could be undertaken to help overcome these problems.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>Background to study</strong></p> <p>The context and history of comparative criminology Comparative criminology is as old as criminology itself. Beccaria, Bentham, Voltaire, Helvetius, Quetelet, and many others of the 18th-century Enlightenment compared and contrasted their own systems of justice with those of other nations. Their recommendations and findings were often influential in bringing about change in countries other than their own. Indeed, the U.S. Constitution owes some of its language and ideas to the writings of these thinkers (see Granucci 1969; Schwartz 1971). Yet, for most of the 19th century and much of the 20th century, comparative criminology was neglected as nations looked inward for solutions to their specific crime problems. It was not until the middle and late decades of the 20th century that interest again emerged in comparing and contrasting the problems of crime across nations. There are many reasons for this renewed interest. The most obvious is that the latter half of the 20th century saw the world become a smaller place, a transformation initiated by revolutions in communication, transportation, and information technology. At the close of the 20th century, nations are increasingly pressured to account for their actions, and the activities of nations are transparent as never before.</p> <p>One can reasonably argue that transparency began in economic institutions, where trade and commerce demanded it. But the availability of information about various facets of national social life has flourished as well, some have argued, because of an abiding concern with the health of democracy. Kenneth Prewitt, current Director of the U.S. Census Bureau, has suggested, “A healthy democracy needs a healthy number system, and anything that erodes that number system undermines democracy” (American Sociological Association 1999, 3). Gradually, countries have collected and made available to the international community statistics on a wide range of subjects relevant to the interests of comparative criminologists (see, for example, United Nations Development Programme 1998). Among these data are statistics on crime and criminal justice, which have only recently become widely accessible at the international level (Newman 1999). Although nations formerly guarded information on crime and criminal justice zealously, many nations now provide these data on the Internet, where they are available to anyone with adequate technological resources. The transparency and availability of such information have created a climate in which the promises of comparative criminological research may be realistically pursued.</p> <p>Although many theoretical, methodological, and philosophical problems certainly have dogged comparative criminology since its inception, there is little doubt that this field of investigation is currently in a state of rapid expansion. While this chapter outlines some of the main problems that confront comparative criminology, the discussion also focuses on what cross-national research has accomplished and what it can do for the field of criminology in the future. We begin with two questions often asked of comparative criminology: What is the comparative perspective, and why employ it? Following this discussion, we move to a consideration of the substantive and theoretical issues that lie at the root of comparative criminological inquiry. We must begin with theory, because the plethora of databases and other information now available from many countries provides an environment that tempts rash comparisons and sometimes unsubstantiated conclusions based on what may be incomparable data. Faced with such a challenge, theoretically informed research supported by sound methodology is the wisest defense. Consequently, we look at the theoretical perspectives that have been brought to bear in understanding crime from a comparative perspective. Following this, we consider crime as a dependent variable in comparative work, then stake out the methodological approaches that are often used in this type of investigation. We then consider the data available to researchers interested in pursuing comparative studies and conclude with some observations about the future of comparative research in criminology.</p> <p>The impact of globalization on crime and criminal justice is an important consideration from the perspective of comparative research. One reason for this is the link between globalisation and punitiveness, the main point of interest of comparative criminology. Baker and Roberts (2005) point to the various reasons why ‘new punitiveness’ is associated with globalisation. They argue, however, that globalisation does not necessarily cause punitiveness, as it is not a universal trend. Globalisation is a complex phenomenon, which has definitely affected penal policies, privileging punitive responses and facilitating ‘policy transfer’, but it can as well ‘spark diverse, jurisdiction‐specific responses’ (Baker and Roberts 2005: 122).</p> <p>A further reason is the fact that globalisation, of itself, presents specific challenges to the credibility of nation states: as crime increasingly displays international dimensions, it is becoming more and more difficult for nation states to deal with it. Globalists claim that a global criminology instead of comparative criminology is needed to understand what is happening in this field (Larsen and Smandych in Nelken 2011).</p> <p><strong>Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>Comparative criminologists have defended their discipline, pointing to differences between countries due to local features, values and cultures. Further, it has been argued that, for every global model explaining levels of punitiveness, there are exceptions, as will be discussed later in this contribution. In addition, there is at the same time the contradictory process of glocalisation: the persistence of national and even regional autonomy in the face of global pressures (Meyer and O’Malley 2005). Globalisation doesn’t spell convergence, according to Lacey (2011); therefore, comparative research on national and regional levels is crucial to understand the mechanisms by which master narratives affect penal policy in different ways, in different countries. Meaningful comparative research needs to move back and forth between the global and the local, refining the global model with local empirical data and findings, as features within individual countries might explain how and why they deviate from the leading pattern. Along the same lines, Savelsberg (2011) concludes that both the study of globalisation and cross‐national comparative research are needed, and that they need to be closely linked, as global trends are translated in a nation‐specific way and filtered through local institutions. Nelken (2011) agrees with this view, pleading that comparative research is particularly well placed to study the interaction between the global and local forces and the ways how to best do this. Therefore, and according to these authors, despite globalisation, comparative research still has a place within criminology, identifying local dynamics and ways out of the doom scenario of mass imprisonment (Lacey 2008).  To contribute to this existing body of literature is the major goal of this research.</p> <p><strong>Objective of the study</strong></p> <p>The aim of this article is consider the current constitution, and likely future prospects, of the field of criminology, and to examine in particular how it might be becoming more global in nature. The term ‘criminology’ will be used broadly, referring to the academic field as a whole, and hence including the study of the causes of crime, responses to crime including criminal justice, as well as to the field’s many subdisciplines.</p> <p><strong>Scope of the study</strong></p> <p>The scope of this article is focused on examining international and comparative criminology, before reviewing previous work that has raised the prospect of a ‘global criminology’.</p> <p><strong>Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>In this regard our significance of study will be both on the theoretical levels and practical levels. Theoretically, this study seeks to highlight and widen scholarly perceptions of criminology,practically, the study will be a response to the intellectual challenges involved in the extent of the application of comparative method in globalized criminology.Also this study will be of vital importance to scholars on criminology, law and other researchers serving  as a further take off point for future inquiry in the study under review.</p> <p><strong>Research methodology</strong></p> <p>The study is more descriptive than analytical. An assessment the scope of global criminology and the current state of comparative criminology carried out. The information relied on for these works are sourced from secondary sources. In this connection, journals on legal system among others serve as major secondary source. The include-materials on the internet, books, essays, journals and articles published on the subject matter  was also used together with the opinions of the courts in judicial decisions.</p>                                                            \n\nTHE COMPARATIVE METHOD IN GLOBALISED CRIMINOLOGY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE COMPARATIVE METHOD IN GLOBALISED CRIMINOLOGY", "id": 24}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong><br/> 1.1 Introduction – – – – – – – – 1<br/> 1.2 Objective of Study – – – – – – – 4<br/> 1.3 Significance of Study – – – – – – 5<br/> 1.4 Scope and limitation of Study – – – – – 6<br/> 1.5 Definition of Terms – – – – – – – 8</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong><br/> 2.1 Types of Security Agents in port – – – – 11<br/> 2.1.1 Function of Security Agent – – – – – 11<br/> 2.2 The Port as a Civilian Area of Operation – – – 14<br/> 2.3 Previous Government Plans and Actions to<br/> “Fight” Port Insecurity – – – – – – – 16<br/> 2.4 Evaluation and Performance of<br/> Port Security Agents – – – – – – 18</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE: PROBLEM FINDING</strong><br/> 3.1 Pilferage Problem – – – – – – – 20<br/> 3.2 Egunge Syndrome – – – – – – – 20<br/> 3.3 Menace of Drug Pusher – – – – – – 21<br/> 3.4 Stowaways – – – – – – – – 22<br/> 3.5 Ship Clearance – – – – – – – 23<br/> 3.6 Security Official and Smuggling Problem – – – 24<br/> 3.7 Non-Availability and maintenance of<br/> Port Security Equipment – – – – – – 25</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR: ASSUMED SOLUTION</strong><br/> 4.1 Training of Security Personnel – – – – – 27<br/> 4.2 Improved Remuneration – – – – – – 28<br/> 4.3 Reduction of Security Agents<br/> to reduce cost and delay – – – – – 28<br/> 4.4 Provision and Maintenance of<br/> Security Equipment – – – – – – 29</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong><br/> 5.1 Summary – – – – – – – – – 30<br/> 5.2 Recommendation – – – – – – – 33<br/> 5.3 Conclusion – – – – – – – – 34<br/> 5.4 Bibliography – – – – – – – – 36</p>                                                           \n\nCRIME AND COMMUNITY POLICING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CRIME AND COMMUNITY POLICING", "id": 25}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/></strong></p> <p><strong>1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/></p> <p>Youth empowerment involve build the capacity of young people and motivating them to take responsibility of their lives .This is done through the process of improving their access to resources that will help in changing their lives ,beliefs, values, and attitudes Youth empowerment  is carried out to improve the quality of lives of the youth.  Youth empowerment is attained through   youth empowerment programs conducted by non-profit organizations, government organizations, schools or private organizations.

One of the basic functions of every government is the protection of lives and properties. Hence, it is the sole responsibility of the formal police structures to see to this objective and the problem of crime has become acute that the police force as a government apparatus has no choice other than to employ the use of technologies to curb crime. This study was positioned to evaluate the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in property crimes detection and controls by the police in Abuja Municipal Area Council. The sample size for the study comprised of two hundred (240) respondents cutting across (140) members of the police force and (100) members of the public. The sampling technique for the study was the multistage sampling technique. The structured questionnaire and in-depth interview (IDI) served as the instruments of data collection. The findings from the study therefore revealed that the utilization of ICT by the police in property crimes detection and control has been significantly felt within the Abuja Municipal Area Council. The study therefore recommends proactive strategies to effect a change in the attitude of police and police organizational structure to accommodate ICT in their schemes.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The major law enforcement agency, police have been recognized as an important part of the state administration. Police is the major player to give greatest security to the public by controlling the crimes and maintenance of law and order. In the ancient times the major job of the police personnel was to maintain law and order and establish the sovereignty of the state. (Chaturbedi, 2006) Police is the state subject thereby, making state governments responsible for maintaining law and order and preventing crime. In modern times due to the process of liberalization, privatization and globalization the police force is facing the new challenges.</p> <p>The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) has been trying to operate a means to ensure that the internal security of the country is maintained, but in spite of this effort, there appears to be growing uncertainty in public order, as reports of high crime rate such as armed robbery, assassination, kidnapping and child trafficking seem to be on the increase (Punch Newspaper, May 29, 2009, Pg. 7). With increasing anxieties of the fast growing cities and slums full of poor, anonymous and potentially dangerous classes, it has been argued that the police hardly see itself as the law enforcer and the defender of the society against lawbreakers. As such, this is responsible for the public criticism of the inability of the police to fight crime in the society, as the police morale has also been dampened over the years.There is no doubt that the need for technologies to help the police fight crime can never be over-emphasized as the relationship between both the police and technologies goes a long way in the determination of the achievement and sustainability of their ultimate goals, and also, the success and well-being of the nation at large. The role of technology in police institutions and police practices has long been recognized as relevant and ambivalent (Ogunbameru, 2008). Technological advances are particularly relevant for policing because they are seen to influence the organization and practices of police in the ways that intimately connect to the police function of crime control. New and more efficient means of crime detection, communication among police, and police transportation, all these influence how successful police is doing its job as a group of crime fighters, and additionally affecting the level of legitimacy police receive from the public and relevant bodies of governments (Simon, 2004).</p> <p>Striking a more general theme of societal modernization in the development of policing, police’s reliance on technology generates some tension between demands for effective crime control on the one hand, and a continued and revived focus on issues of justice and rights, on the other hand. The increasing use of technology in police institutions was virtually synonymous with advancing progress and civilization. However, soon after technologies were introduced and applied by police, suspicions also mounted against an excessive and unbalanced reliance on technology. In particular, civil-liberation currents sought to curb technologically driven police practices that were motivated by a blind reliance on the often assumed, but largely unproven merits of technologies at the expense of concerns of civil rights and constitutional demands of due process. The tension between a need for efficacy in crime control and the recognition and respect for citizen and human rights has remained a central topic of controversy since when technologies were applied in policing.</p> <p>The new “information imperative” for police organizations would have been impossible to satisfy only a decade ago, but it is now feasible because of affordable advances in information technology and the intense pressure on police to detect threats in advance. While we can expect more tactical and strategic changes in the near future as diverse forms of technology take center stage today, the largest influence on police decision making has come from data mining systems.</p> <p>Based on the premises above the study intends to investigate the  how information and communication technology have improved the securing life and property responsibilities of the police.</p> <p><strong>1.2  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>We are in the era of law enforcement where ICT and other advanced technologies are becoming a powerful tool for responding to criminals, engaging in hotspots policing, solving violent crimes, monitoring employees’ performance and many other functions. The introduction if this new methods of technology has been a blessing and a curse to the police and other security agencies in performing their protection of life and property. Because the so called law committers are also indulging in the usage of the technology to boycott the hands of the law through the manipulation of the security officials (Wardman &amp; Allison. 2004) Technologies, such as video cameras, data mining systems, heat sensors, biometrics, GPS tracking, Internet and telecommunication systems are being used for the detection, investigation, prosecution and prevention of crime in the law enforcement community. As it did in the middle of the 20th century, technology is beginning to alter the nature of policing and to impact on the management and delivery of police services. Emerging models of policing in the 21st century demand accurate real-time information for strategic planning, problem analysis, deployment decisions, community interface, inter-organizational communication, accountability, threat detection and many other functions (Simon, 2004). Based on the dual premises of being a blessing and a curse the study will fill the gap by enquiring into impact of information and technology on the operations of the police in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3  OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study intends to investigate the impact of information and technology on the detention and protection of property and crimes.

This project is focused on studying the effect of Law enforcement agency in the Surulere Nigerian police force. The study made use of both primary and secondary data. And the research instrument used was the questionnaire administered to a sample size of 100 respondents. From the test result of hypothesis one, the study discovered that inadequate training does significantly contribute to ineffective crime control by the law enforcement agencies in Nigeria and hypothesis two shows that the effort of the law enforcement agents in creating a safer Nigeria is greatly hampered by unavailability of modern crime gadgets.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The relationship between police and citizens must be informed by the ethical and professional principles that allow for the effectiveness of their function. One of the challenges to community police units is to maintain peace and. When Law is violated, crime has been committed. This study seeks to focus on the Law Enforcement Agency (Nigeria Police Force) in crime control and prevention. The law enforcement agency in the real sense of the term according to Iwarimie-Jaja (1991:74), refers to criminal justice agency (federal, state or local) which perform the principal functions of prevention, and the apprehension of alleged offenders. By enforcement of the law Nigeria Police Force reflect the ideological interest and priority desired by the controllers of the state as observable in intractable competitions.</p> <p>          Throughout the length and breadth of our nation Thompson (1986), posted that innocent citizens are gripped with the fear of armed men, hoodlums, and vagabonds who perpetrate their evil with reckless abandon.</p> <p>          Our society has ever since been witnessing an unprecedented upsurge of criminal activities ranging from conventional, victimless to white-collar crime, especially “pen-robbery” which is now almost institutionalized. Any nation plagued with this magnitude of social problem which people sign as they pass by make comments like it’s too bad, will no doubt look for solutions. It is on this basis that Nigeria Police Force has come to stay.</p> <p>          According to Ogunleye (1976:250, duties of the police are defined in section 4 of the Police Act as “the prevention and detection of crime, the apprehension of offenders, the preservation of law and order, the regrettable, it is only the latter that law easily punishes because of their vulnerability whereas the former is let go with impunity.</p> <p>          Up till now the public fails to acknowledge the fact that the role of the police in our society is the defence of the right and property of the bourgeois, consequently, the police has been singled out as escape goat for all the ill of the society. It is from the context of the corrupt society we all belong that allegation of inefficiency and corruption consequently levelled against the Nigeria Police be viewed.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>          In Nigeria today, the problem of Insecurity has risen to its highest level, corruption, crime, communal disturbances as in the case of the recent Communal Killings of Farmers by the Fulani Herdsmen, religious intolerance and the likes in Nigeria is a cause for serious concern. What nation loses as a result of violation of criminal law cannot be quantified. Not only is the economy dragged to the base continually, the image of the nation will need a great quantity of detergent to be laundered both home and abroad.</p> <p>          Therefore, the important questions are: How do we rid crime out of our society? Could it be controlled or prevented? What are its remote causes? The police have made series of efforts aimed at controlling and preventing crime yet not much has been achieved.</p> <p>          Many people have lost their lives, property, money and even intangible things such as reputation, joy, peace due to crime they committed or those of others. Could the inability of the police to achieve a crime free society be attributed to the socio-economic structure of our society, absence of sophisticated equipments to combat crime, poor communication network, outright bribery/corrupt practices among the police? Hence, these questions put low the integrity of the police and places one in a valley of indecision as to whether the Nigeria Police Force has the interest of the nation at heart.</p> <p>          The problems of Surulere Nigerian police in exercising its duties are both logistical and moral. Over the years in logistical terms, the force has maintained by the federal government has not had enough equipment. The quantity and quality of weapons, arms and ammunition available in most mobile squadron units in the country are hardly enough. There are some instances where the force cannot stand the counter firepower of armed bandits. In terms of human resources and strength, the Surulere Nigerian police is yet to have the strength that can adequately contain crime in country. Recruitment into the force has been epileptic. Losses of personnel through natural death, active service, retirement and disciplinary action have not been adequate replacement over the years. With regard to the standard laid by the United Nations ratio of one policeman to 400 citizens. Nigeria has not met the standard. The strength of the force, by the time the then Inspector General of Police Mr Musliu Smith assumed duty was under 120,000 (Nigeria Tribute 10th August, 2000). Okunola (1995) estimated the ratio of the police man to about 641 Nigerians. Which is not much improvement on ratio 1:980 as at 1979 (Danmadani, 1979).</p> <p>          The reward and pay structure of the force is also not encouraging compared to what it takes for one to lay down his/her life, the security is not available. The benefits are not attractive as revealed by Mr. Iwendi Haz, police public relation officer.</p> <p>          All these among others constitute the major problems of the study. The Criteria for Measuring Successful Policing (According To NOPRIN, 2004). These criteria are as follows:</p> <p>• EFFECTIVENESS (e.g. fewer or reduced criminal victimization; higher proportion of crimes known to the police cleared by arrest; increased recovery of stolen property; higher rates of arrests which result in conviction; lower traffic accident rates; faster response time to reports/complaints).</p> <p>• RESPONSIVENESS (e.g. higher citizen perception of safety from crime; higher citizen ratings of police performance in general; higher citizen ratings of specific police activities; higher citizen ratings of specific aspects of police conduct such as honesty, integrity, courtesy and fairness).</p> <p>• EQUITY (i.e. with reference to egalitarian distribution of “protection” to all sections of the population).</p> <p>• EFFICIENCY (i.e. with reference to cost-and-benefit analysis of “protection” output relative to monetary, human and material in-put). However, when the above are translated into their ordinary meaning, the value and worth of a police force can be determined by:</p> <p>• The amount and quality of protection it offers the citizens as a whole; and</p> <p>• The degree of confidence and cooperation it enjoys from the average citizen. Effective and efficient policing in Nigeria: Inadequacies, problems &amp; obstacles Judged by the yardsticks outlined, it has long been clear to a majority of Nigerians that the Nigeria Police Force falls short of optimum performance. There is abundant official and research confirmation of this assertion, apart from information in the daily newspapers, and there is no need to “prove” the non-optimum performance of the Nigeria Police Force in the present contribution. Rather, what is needed is the identification of the major inadequacies, problems and obstacles that are responsible for the situation. And these may be grouped into three categories: material inadequacies; human problems; and obstacles external to the Force.</p> <p><strong>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          This study is aimed specially at: identifying the strategies Nigeria Police Force uses in controlling and preventing crimes. The study will investigate to identify problems the police encounter in combating crime. The study is very important, predicted upon its emphasis on an understanding of the structure of our society and criminal activities.</p> <p>          Hence, it will serve as a guide for eliciting change in social police and practise, which is a desideration. Hopefully therefore, the various aims of government, general public and the police in particular will find the study useful. Other scholars will equally benefit from the study as it adds to existing literature of knowledge, advance measure in crime control and prevention to the betterment of our society. In Clear terms, It is the objective of the study to examine the following:</p> <p>1.      The role of The Law Enforcement Agency (in this case the      Police) in crime control and prevention within the context of   historical materialism.</p> <p>2.      The impact of the historical circumstances of the country on   crime causation, prevention and control.</p> <p>3.      The possibility of our attainment of a crime free society.</p> <p>4.      Establish position relationship between the law enforcement   agencies.</p> <p>5.      Establish whether a significant relationship exist between the structure of Nigeria Police Force and criminal activities.</p> <p>6.      The possibility of cordial relationship between the police and the general public.</p>\n\nEFFECTIVENESS OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY", "id": 28}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The <em>Fula</em> people also known as <em>Fulani</em> in <em>Hausa</em>language, are a mass population widely dispersed and culturally diverse in all of Africa, but most predominant in West Africa. The Fulani’s generally speak the Fula language. A significant number of them are nomadic in nature, herding cattle, goats and sheep across the vast dry grass lands of their environment, keeping isolate from the local farming communities, making them the world’s largest pastoral nomadic group (Eyekpimi, 2016). They are massively spread over many countries, and are found mainly in West Africa and northern parts of Central Africa, but also in Sudan and Egypt. The main Fulani sub-groups in Nigeria are: Fulbe Adamawa, Fulbe Mbororo, Fulbe Sokoto, Fulbe Gombe, and the Fulbe Borgu (Eyekpimi, 2016).</p> <p>Nigeria as a nation state is under a severe internal socio-economic and security threat. At a more general level, the threat has special economic, political and environmental dimensions. Each of these dimensions has greatly affected the nation’s stability and can be traced to the Fulani-herdsmen and farmers clash, ethnic militant armies, ethnic and religious conflicts, poverty, insurgency, armed robbery, corruption, economic sabotage and environmental degradation (Damba, 2007).</p> <p>Food security is a condition related to the supply of food, and individuals' access to it. Concerns over food security have existed throughout history. There is evidence of Granaries being in use over 10,000 years ago, with central authorities in civilizations including ancient China and ancient Egypt being known to release food from storage in times of famine (Illufoye, 2009). At the 1974 World Food Conference the term \"food security\" was defined with an emphasis on supply. Food security, they said, is the \"availability at all times of adequate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuations in production and prices\" (United Nations, 2013). Later definitions added demand and access issues to the definition. The final report of the 1996 World Food Summit states that food security \"exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life\" (United Nations, 2015).</p> <p>Household food security exists when all members, at all times, have access to enough food for an active, healthy life (USDA, 2008). Individuals who are food secure do not live in hunger or fear of starvation (FAO, 2006). Food insecurity, on the other hand, is a situation of \"limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways\", according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) (2008). Food security incorporates a measure of resilience to future disruption or unavailability of critical food supply due to various risk factors including droughts, shipping disruptions, fuel shortages, economic instability and wars (Boeing, 2016). In the years 2011-2017 (FAO, 2017), an estimated 842 million people were suffering from chronic hunger (FAO, 2017). The Food and Agriculture Organiation of the United Nations, or FAO, identified the four pillars of food security as availability, access, utilization, and stability (FAO, 2009). The United Nations (UN) recognized the Right to Food in the Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, (United Nations, 2015) and has since noted that it is vital for the enjoyment of all other rights (United Nations, 2015).</p> <p>Violent conflict and crisis in Nigeria, like other parts of the world, have created a rift in human relations, caused serious threat to food security, among many other effects (Basil, 2015). Crisis is inevitable as long as we live together, especially in a multi-ethnic, cultural and religious community like Nigeria. However violence leaves us with various forms of retardation and underdevelopment resulting from the destruction of lives, farmland and property. The menaces of violent crisis conflict have been on the increase in some most Nigerian cities in the last two decades (Ilufoye, 2009). Most of these conflicts are generally regarded as ethno-religious bigotry and antagonism.</p> <p>According to Kassam (2014) and Basil (2015), the conflicts in most part of Nigeria especially the Fulani herdsmen and farmers clash are largely uncalled for. Farmers can no longer farm peacefully because of Fulani herdsmen. These Fulani herdsmen and farmers clash have pitched Christians and Muslims against each other. The conflict has had devastating effects on inter-group relationships especially in Nasarawa Egor in Nasarawa State and Agatu L.G.A of Benue State. Apart from the loss of lives, farmlands, food produce and property, it has profound influence on residential relationships, leading to new trends in the polarization of communities. This is evident in a physical manifestation of mono religious areas in Nasarawa and Benue States, with Christians and Muslims living in dominant religious clusters(Eyekpemi, 2016).</p> <p>Recent studies conducted by Basil (2015) and Ekpeyemi (2016) have shown that, serious conflict erupt between Fulani herdsmen and farmers leading to loss of lives, valuable properties and destruction of vast expanse of arable agricultural farmlands thereby posing serious threat to food security since farmers for fear of attack could no longer go to farm and harvest their farm produce. The recent attacks by Fulani herdsmen is on the increase, with the most recent attacks in June 2016 occurring in Ossissa community in Ndokwa East and Abraka community in Ethiope East Local Government Areas of Delta State and three more communities (Ugondo, Turan, Gabo Nenzev) in Logo Local Government Area, Benue State, total killings involving no fewer than 60 persons (Ekpeyemi, 2016). The Federal Government recently ordered an inquiry, military crackdown on the group and affirmed its plans to establish cattle ranches as a solution to the frequent clashes between Fulani herdsmen and farmers in Nigeria (Basil, 2015). In recent times, the killings recorded by Fulani herdsmen and farmers clash has rampaged most communities displacing them of their farmlands and loss of their major source of livelihood. This is becoming unbearable with the Fulani herdsmen always having their ways leaving the farmers at their mercy. Farmers now go to farm armed with weapons for defense in case of attack (Ekpeyemi, 2016).</p> <p>Recently, several deaths and casualties have been recorded in series of clash between Fulnai herdsmen and farmers. Most people attribute the clash between Fulani Herdsmen and Farmers to religious differences between the Muslims or Islam’s and the Christians(Basil, 2015). Several farmlands have been destroyed due to conflict erupting between farmers and herdsmen. Herdsmen attribute the roots of the crisis to religious differences resulting in the killing of their cows while the farmers see the herdsmen as a threat to their crops and agricultural produce since the herdsmen allow their cows to feed on the farmer crops. Evidences have shown that herdsmen and farmers clash in several parts of Nigeria especially in the Nassarawa, Delta, Edo, and Benue states could be due to differences in religious background between the herdsmen and farmers. Several lives and farmlands been destroyed in this crisis (Ekpeyemi, 2016). Recently, in Abraka Fulani herdsmen attacked farmers at the farm and claimed one life which prompted the indigenes of Abraka to riot. It was due to this saga that the Ovie of Abraka Kingdom (HRM Akpomedaye Majoroh II) declared state of emergency on the 23rd of April, 2017 on the Fulani herdsmen and farmers clash in a bid to restore peace to the community. It is against this background that this study is conducted to investigate the effects of Fulani herdsmen-farmers crisis on food security in Abraka region.  </p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Nigeria is seriously threatened by Fulani herdsmen and farmers crisis and therefore, considered to be a major potential threat affecting Nigerians mostly on the part of socio-economic activities of the country (Egodi, 2010). The Fulani herdsmen and farmers crisis is posing a serious obstacle to a successful national economy. Fulani herdsmen and farmers has become a major threat to the national security and development of Nigeria due to the fact that its increased operation has caused diversion and removed government attention on some key areas of the economy, as huge amount of human and material resources are channeled into curbing the menace (Egodi, 2010).</p> <p>Conflict is a great predicament in any human society, and most times, it is predictable. In fact, history indicates that conflict is an on-going process in human relations and may occur within and among groups and communities. In the case of Nigeria, the frequent occurrence of Fulani herdsmen and farmers crisis has left adverse effects on food security and socio-economic development of the people (Damba, 2007). In the course of these conflicts, farmers have at certain times, taken up weapons to counter the attacks from the Fulani herdsmen, claiming to do so in self-defense. The study conducted by Kassam (2016) gave an overview of the general concept and causes of conflicts in Nigeria and, advocates for ethical principles such as the common solidarity of humanity by origin, forgiveness and tolerance that could engender cordiality and understanding rather than sustained hostility and suspicion in Fulani herdsmen and farmers relation in Nigeria.</p> <p>Fulani herdsmen and farmers crisis no doubt have negative impact on the lives, property, food security and educational development in Nigeria. Though, there is the dearth of quantitative evaluation of the catastrophic attacks, available statistics has it that between June 2015 to December, 2016 Human Rights Watch in 2017, reported a total death toll of 65 persons in more than 24 attacks. It was also reported that an estimate of 50 people were killed in Nasarawa Egor (Nasarawa State) and Agatu/Logo (Benue State) in the June 2016 and recently lives were claimed in Abraka in the April 23rd 2017 crisis between Fulani herdsmen and farmers. Fulani herdsmen attack apart from the loss of lives has also led to the destruction of arable farmland and valuable properties worth several billions of naira.</p> <p>The above scenario has dire consequences for sustainable and educational development in the regions of attack in particular and Nigeria in general. In the regions where the Fulani herdsmen and farmers crisis is pervasive and the property destroyed potentially and in real terms, drag their economic fortune back by several steps. Besides the property destroyed, economic life in those regions is automatically grounded to a halt. People are no longer free to go about their farming, economic and educational activities for fear of being killed. This is made worse as several thousands of people have migrated swiftly to other parts of Nigeria. The overall implication for sustainable development is that the farming, economic and educational activities are fast deteriorating. The murderous campaigns and vicious onslaughts on individuals and institutions provide highly unfavorable business environment for internal and foreign investment, which is a major factor in the achievement of sustainable development (Damba, 2007).</p> <p>Another major problem posed by Fulani and herdsmen and farmers clash is that farming activities in some parts of Nigeria has been put to a halt. Farmers within this region find it hard to go to their farms as well as to get enough food crops to the market thereby, increasing price of commodity in the market. The government has spent huge amount of money on the renovation of buildings, and infrastructures that has been destroyed by these religious conflicts. Also, huge amount of funds from the country’s budget has been spent on the compensation of families who have lost their loved ones to the Fulani-herdsmen and farmers crisis. Also, huge amount of money is being spent on the acquisition weapons, ammunition in other to equip the military to handle the situation on ground. All these have affected Nigeria’s economy.</p> <p>Again, in Abraka the recent Fulani-herdsmen and farmers clash which took place on 23rd April, 2017 at Abraka reserve have caused serious damage to farmlands, claimed life and disrupt the socio-economic activities of the people of people leading to increase in the price of food items and commodities. Problems emanated from fear of Fulani herdsmen since people can no longer go to farms and walk at night. This has disrupted the peaceful coexistence of the Hausa people and indigenes of Abraka community. All these have form the basis for the problem stated in this study, and this research work focuses on the effects of Fulani herdsmen-farmers crisis on food security in Abraka region.</p> <p><strong>1.3    AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to examine the effects of Fulani herdsmen-farmers crisis on food security in Abraka region. The specific objectives include to;</p> <p>1.    examine the causes of Fulani herdsmen and farmers crisis in Abraka region;</p> <p>2.    ascertain the level of awareness of Abraka people on issues relating to food security in the area;</p> <p>3.    examine the level of food availability and accessibility as a result of Fulani herdsmen and farmers crisis in Abraka region;</p> <p>4.    evaluate the effect of Fulani herdsmen and farmers crisis on food security in Abraka region;</p> <p>5.    discuss the management options of the Fulani herdsmen and farmers crisis as it affects food security in Abraka.</p> <p><strong>1.4  RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>The following research hypotheses were tested in this study;</p> <p>1.    The crises between Fulani-herdsmen and farmers is not significantly depended on grazing of crops, depletion of vegetation in the north and harsh climate.</p> <p>2.    The crisis between Fulani herdsmen and farmers has no significant effect on food security in Abraka region.</p> <p>3.    There is no significant difference in the level of awareness of the people on issues relating to food security in Abraka region.</p> <p><strong>1.5  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is basically produced to fulfill an academic requirement. Nevertheless, it is hoped that it would go a long way to encourage more meaningful development efforts on issues relating to the effects of Fulani herdsmen-farmers crisis on food security in Abraka region.</p> <p>This study is not intended to break an entire new ground, rather, it is undertaken in the premise that it will add to the existing literature in the area of geography. In addition this study is very necessary especially at this point of Nigeria’s development, when there is massive increase in the need to map and study the infrastructural development of an area.</p> <p>This work is expected to guide geographers, educationists, scientists, planners, engineers, architects, environmentalists, etc, and all those whose livelihood are affected to gain understanding of how Fulani herdsmen-farmers crisis can affect food security. However, the findings will also provide useful background information to future research in the contribution of geography education towards nation building.</p> <p><strong>1.6    STUDY</strong> <strong>AREA</strong></p> <p><strong>1.6.1  Location and Size</strong></p> <p>Abraka lies approximately on latitude 050 481 North of the equator and on longitude 06o 061 east of the Greenwich meridian. It is situated at the Eastern Bank of River Ethiope in Ethiope East Local Government Area of Delta State in the Niger Delta zone of Southern Nigeria. It is bounded to the North by Orhionwon Local Government Area of Edo State, and to the East and South by Ukwani Local Government Area and the Ughelli North Local Government Area respectively and lastly, the Ika Local Government Area bounds her western boundary. The region of Abraka has a total land area of 21.2 square kilometer (Akinbode and Ugbomeh, 2006).</p> <p>The boundary, size and location of Abraka is such that favours cattle grazing and farm practices at the same time. This has prompted Fulani herdsmen to migrate from the north to Abraka for cattle grazing which has in turn resulted to serious clash between herdsmen and farmers in various quarters that make up Abraka clan. This crisis in recent times has led to increase in food items and food insecurity in Abraka.   </p>\n\nEFFECT OF FULANI-HERDSMEN AND FARMERS CRISIS ON FOOD SECURITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF FULANI-HERDSMEN AND FARMERS CRISIS ON FOOD SECURITY", "id": 29}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/></strong></p> <p>The freedom from danger, care intimidation, apprehension, the feeling or assurance of safety, peace of mind or absence of fear, and the certainty or assurance of the good life or welfare – constitutes one of the fundamental objectives and indeed the foremost responsibility of every government and the state. In Nigeria, the constitution unequivocally spelt out as a fundamental objective and directive principle of state policy that “the security and welfare of the people (of Nigeria) shall be the primary purpose of government” (Section 14 (2) (b) Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999). Nigeria in recent times has witnessed an unprecedented level of insecurity. No wonder national security has become an issue for government, prompting huge allocation of the national budget to security. According to Azazi (2011), in order to check the crime rate in Nigeria, the federal government has embarked on criminalization of terrorism by passing the anti-terrorism Act in 2011, installation of computer-based Closed Circuit Television cameras (CCTV) in some parts of the country, enhancement of surveillance as well as investigation of criminal related offences, heightening of physical security measures around the country aimed at determining or disrupting potential attacks, strengthening of security agencies through the provision of security facilities and the development and broadcast of security tips in mass media. Despite these efforts, the level of insecurity in Nigeria is still high and the country has been consistently ranked low in the Global Peace Index (GPI, 2012), signifying poor state of insecurity in the country as indicated.</p> <p>The term security has been used to mean protection against or safety from a future risk of severe deprivation, injury or death and requires rules, order and impartial adjudication and application. Security according to Achumba, Ighomereho &amp; Akpo-Robaro (2013) refers to a situation that exists as a result of the establishment of measure for the protecting of persons, information and property against hostile persons, influences and actions. It is the existence of conditions within which people in a society can go about their normal daily activities without any threat to their lives or properties. It embraces all measures designed to protect and safeguard the citizenry and the resources of individuals, groups, businesses and the nation against sabotage or violent occurrence (Achumbo et al, 2013). Security is the protection against all forms of harm whether physical, economic or psychological. It is however argued that security may not be absence of threats or security issues but the ability to rise to the challenges posed by threats with expediency and expertise. Security cannot therefore exist without provision for national security. Aggressive and repressive states can be major sources of human insecurity and a greater source of human suffering.</p> <p>National security is concerned about those governmental institutions that seek to ensure the physical protection and safety of their citizens, their equal access to the law and protection of from abuse. There are two sets of government systems and institutions concerned with national security. The first component consists of the traditional instruments of national security, namely: the criminal justice system (police, justice and correctional services/prisons) the military and the intelligence community. The second and more important, relates to the nature of governance, its institutions and rules, norms and values that underpin it – as well as the efficacy thereof (Thamos, 2008).</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Fulani herdsmen attack and farmers clashes has brought a lot of problems to our society including Nigeria. These include death, tears, destruction and so on. The way it is it seems our government has not acted significantly to put this security challenges to an end. Ese Otite of Nigerian National News asked “is the government waiting for all her citizens to fizzle out, before they can take a decisive step to curb the activities of this extremist group? What are the security agencies doing? Or do we say maybe those in power have not been affected either because they and their families move about with convoys filled with security personnel?”</p> <p>Nigeria is going down a path never seen in her history. It’s a pretty dangerous path, one that the whole world is watching. People are afraid of their safety. At a time, we taught our problem was corruption and power failure, but now security has taken over. With what is happening the President should come out strong and call the shots, he has to face the security challenges. It is very clear that not enough is being done to address their security menaces of the Fulani herdsmen.  All they now do is to promote their own religion instead of protecting Nigeria. This government should as a matter of national urgency overhaul our security system. Nigeria occupies an enviable position in the world with abundant natural and human resources. The government should look deeper in order to find a lasting solution to this carnage. Moreover, the truth must be told, we lack the sophisticated weapons to suppress the crisis in the custody of the extremists/criminals. Also, there is inadequate manpower; the number of the extremists/criminals is insignificant.</p> <p><strong>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is to ascertain the level of government Strategies and the management of security challenges in Nigeria: a case study of Fulani Herdsmen. While the specific objectives were:</p> <p>1.    To examine the effect of adoption of close circuit television on the management of security challenges in Nigeria</p> <p>2.    To examine the effect of community security watch on the management of security challenges in Nigeria</p> <p>3.    To examine the effect of surveillance on the management of security challenges in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The following research questions will be answered:</p> <p>1.    What is the effect of adoption of close circuit television on the management of security challenges in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.    What is the effect of community security watch on the management of security challenges in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.    What is the effect of surveillance on the management of security challenges in Nigeria?</p> <p><strong>1.5    RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>The following research hypotheses will be tested:</p> <p>1.    There is no significant effect of adoption of close circuit television on the management of security challenges in Nigeria</p> <p>2.    There is no significant effect of community security watch on the management of security challenges in Nigeria</p> <p>3.    There is no significant the effect of surveillance on the management of security challenges in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>1.6  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is expected to be of immense help to the government, security personnel and Nigerian Security Council as well as policy makers. It may also be of help to improve upon security management in our society in Akwa Ibom State. The result of this study is expected to provide data for planning, as well as provide additional stock of security data for other researchers, who might find it relevant and useful in their enquiries.</p> <p>The study will fill the gap of knowledge of what has not been done by the past researchers who conducted almost similar study with regard to security management. The researcher will offer solutions to some practical or theoretical problems. This work also will be of benefit to the tertiary institution students, Ministry of Education and teachers, Parents and Guardians.</p> <p><strong>1.7   SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study was delimited to government Strategies and the management of security challenges in Nigeria a case study of Fulani Herdsmen. However, the study used Itu Local government as a study area.</p> <p><strong>1.8   LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Difficulty in gathering materials especially relevant to the study was a challenge since the study is not common. This caused scarcity of relevant research materials from local papers. Hence, the researcher had to rely greatly on the foreign materials in order to put up this work.</p> <p>Another challenge faced by the researcher was lack of fund and limited time for the undertaking and submission of this work.</p>\n\nGOVERNMENT STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT OF SECURITY CHALLENGES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " GOVERNMENT STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT OF SECURITY CHALLENGES IN NIGERIA", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong> INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Nigeria in recent times has witnessed an unprecedented level of insecurity. This has made national security threat to be a major issue for the government and has prompted huge allocation of the national budget to security. In order to ameliorate the incidence of crime, the federal government has embarked on criminalization of terrorism by passing the Anti-Terrorism Act in 2011, installation of Computer-based Closed Circuit Television cameras (CCTV) in some parts of the country, enhancement of surveillance as well as investigation of criminal related offences, heightening of physical security measures around the country aimed at deterring or disrupting potential attacks, strengthening of security agencies through the provision of security facilities and the development and broadcast of security tips in mass media (Azazi, 2011). Despite these efforts, the level of insecurity in the country is still high. In addition, Nigeria has consistently ranked low in the Global Peace Index (GPI, 2012), signifying a worsened state of insecurity in the country. Hence, Adagba, et al (2012), Uhunmwuangho and Aluforo (2011) are of the view that the efforts of government have not yielded enough positive result.</p> <p>With the lingering security challenges and the inability of the security apparatus of the government to guarantee safety and security in the country, the question that borders everyone in Nigeria today is that “can there be security?” Is security of lives and properties achievable? Apparently, the security situation in Nigeria appears or at least have remained insurmountable and many people have argued that government at all levels has not done enough by not confronting the situation head on and dealing with it decisively, others have argued that the situation has a political undertone or inclination calculated to serve the interest of certain political gods, who have been dissatisfied and disgruntled about the political manifestations in the country.</p> <p>Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to provide a synthesis of existing knowledge on insecurity by integrating diverse explorations and to propose a strategy for security management. In the following sections, we examine first, the concept of insecurity, the causes of insecurity in the country so as to provide a background for understanding and appreciating the enormity of the problem and our proposed model for security management in Nigeria. This is followed by an exploration of the connection between security environment and business activities and an evaluation of the Nigerian security situation and its implications for business and sustainable development. Finally, in consonance with the call on everyone by government, to contribute to the war against insecurity, the paper proposes a security management model that could assist in managing security challenges in the country.</p> <p>1.                    The Concept of Insecurity</p> <p>The concept of insecurity would be best understood by first presenting the concept of security. In the view of Akin (2008) security refers to “the situation that exists as a result of the establishment of measures for the protection of persons, information and property against hostile persons, influences and actions”. It is the existence of conditions within which people in a society can go about their normal daily activities without any threats to their lives or properties. It embraces all measures designed to protect and safeguard the citizenry and the resources of individuals, groups, businesses and the nation against sabotage or violent occurrence (Ogunleye, et al, 2011). According to Igbuzor (2011) it demands safety from chronic threats and protection from harmful disruption.</p> <p>Security however, can be described as stability and continuity of livelihood (stable and steady income), predictability of daily life (knowing what to expect), protection from crime (feeling safe), and freedom from psychological harm (safety or protection from emotional stress which results from the assurance or knowing that one is wanted, accepted, loved and protected in one’s community or neighbourhood and by people around. It focuses on emotional and psychological sense of belonging to a social group which can offer one protection). This description structured the concept of security into four dimensions. However, these dimension can be weaved together to give a composite definition of security as the protection against all forms of harm whether physical, economic or psychological. It is generally argued however that security is not the absence of threats or security issues, but the ability to rise to the challenges posed by these threats with expediency and expertise.</p> <p>Insecurity on the other hand, is the antithesis of security. However, because of the very many ways in which insecurity affects human life and existence, the concept of insecurity has usually been ascribed different interpretations in association with the various ways which it affects individuals. Some of the common descriptors of insecurity include: want of safety; danger; hazard; uncertainty; want of confidence; doubtful; inadequately guarded or protected; lacking stability; troubled; lack of protection; and unsafe, to mention a few. All of these have been used by different people to define the concept of insecurity. These different descriptors, however, run into a common reference to a state of vunerability to harm and loss of life, property or livelihood. Beland (2005) defined insecurity as “the state of fear or anxiety stemming from a concrete or alleged lack of protection.” It refers to lack or inadequate freedom from danger. This definition reflects physical insecurity which is the most visible form of insecurity, and it feeds into many other forms of insecurity such as economic security and social security.</p> <p>Two views are of essence to this paper. These are (1) Insecurity as the state of being open or subject to danger or threat of danger, where danger is the condition of being susceptible to harm or injury, and (2) Insecurity as the state of being exposed to risk or anxiety, where anxiety is a vague unpleasant emotion that is experienced in anticipation of some misfortune. A major point about insecurity implied in these definitions is that those affected by insecurity are not only uncertain or unaware of what would happen but they are also not able to stop it or protect themselves when it happens. It is in this view that we would describe insecurity in this paper as: ‘not knowing, a lack of control, and inability to take defensive action against forces that portend harm or danger to an individual or group, or what make them vunerable’. ‘Vunerability’ is the situation that we do not know and we cannot face or anticipate. It is also something we may know would happen but we are not able to face it.</p> <p>2.                    Sources of Insecurity in Nigeria</p> <p>To tackle insecurity, a key starting point should be to understand the causes of insecurity as well as to investigate their sources of social disorder and instability. As Andrew and Kennedy (2003) pointed out, it is necessary to distinguish between different causes as each may require different remedy. Besides, it is to provide a holistic view to the suggestion or recommendations of solutions. More often, however, policy makers are disinclined to isolate and clarify particular causes. They prefer blanket references, with the consideration that the causes of insecurity are interwoven and contributory to one another. Like in many other societies, the sources of insecurity in Nigeria have been traced to a number of factors and explained by different people. These factors have been classified or grouped into external and internal factors. Beyond the external-internal dichotomy, sources of insecurity have also been classified as either remote or proximate and immediate sources/causal factors. In Nigeria, the challenge is not so much about insecurity of external sources, but rather that of internal sources. Hence, our focus in this paper is on the internal sources. We recognize that some internal factors have been enhanced and strengthened by the presence of external forces, but, there is no doubt that, if the internal situations did not present themselves, the external forces would be unable to infiltrate. We present the internal causes of insecurity in Nigeria using the dichotomy of remote and immediate factors.</p>\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES IN NIGERIA AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SECURITY CHALLENGES IN NIGERIA AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT", "id": 31}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The rate at which corruption spread among political leaders in Anambra state has frayed nerves and subjected the people to fear and trepidation. Avarice, greed and the get-rich quick syndrome have been identified as major causative factors. Hence the topic, “The role of the Churches in combating Corruption among Political leaders in Anambra State, Nigeria. The methods of data collection for the study include both primary and secondary sources. Primary data were obtained through oral interview. For the secondary sources the study relied on academic books, journal articles, newspapers, magazines, unpublished project works and periodicals, including internet materials. The historical and descriptive analytical approach was adopted in the analyzing of the data because it entails the interpretative understanding of the substance of various forms of communication, whether written, oral or symbolic. In the result, the work revealed that there are overt causes of corruption among political leaders in Anambra state arising from avarice and greed. This has affected the well-being of individuals and retarded progress in the state. The study also established that embezzlement of public fund, rigging of elections, kidnapping of political opponents, thuggery and politically motivated killings formed the core of activities of some of the political leaders. It was also discovered that the church has used preaching, prayer, social action, exemplary lifestyle and sacrifice as strategies against corruption. In conclusion, there is a fundamental and innate relationship between the Church and the State. The Church is playing her expected role, thereby challenging political leaders to engage in the activities that are for the interest of social progress in Anambra state.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE <br/><br/> INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/></p> <p>In Nigeria, bribery and corruption are hydra-headed twins that have eaten deep into the fabrics of the society. Starting from the colonial era of Nigeria, bribery and corruption have made steady and seemingly unstoppable progress up to the present. Whether during the colonial era, or when Nigeria gained her independence in 1960 or for the long years of military rule, bribery and corruption have become a recurring decimal (Achunike, 2006: 162). Chuta (2004: 17, 39) traced the problem of corruption from the pre-colonial to the colonial and self­government era. He further traced corruption to the First Republic (1960-1966) down to the different stages of military era, even to the second and third republics. In all these cases, Chuta stood on the assertion that majority of Nigerian’s have been corrupt. Ugwu (2002: 16) traced corruption to colonial period when he posited that:It has been argued that the major roots of corruption were sown during the colonial period when a lot of structures were created for the purpose of administration. The pro-colonial society knew little or nothing about corruption but soon after Nigeria’s independence in 1960 and shortly afterwards in 1963 after Nigeria had become a republic, there grew in galloping proportions corruption in every sphere of human life.</p> <p>Kalu (2007: 2) posited that the under privileged are the victims of corruption while the ruling class hypocritically engaged in the condemnation of acts that benefit its fold. Over the years, the vast majority of Nigerians have</p> <p>learned and experimented on bribery and corruption. Corruption therefore, seemed to have become part of the daily life of Nigerians. This is so because the situation most Nigerians find themselves today makes corruption easy and it is only when good and responsible governance prevails that corruption will recede. Not many Nigerians think that hard work pays. Equally not many think that honesty is worth trying (Achunike, 2006: 163). Madu (2003: 1) opined that hardwork has been scarified at the altar of easy ways of making money like 419, ritual murders and corruption in its different ramifications. That materialism has gone deep into the psyche of people that spiritual values are de-emphasized, as even, one can discern from the prosperity sermons of many of the anointed men of God and their materialistic life-styles. Meanwhile, twenty-two years ago Achebe (1983:1) observed that: The trouble with Nigeria is simply and squarely, a failure of leadership. There is nothing basically wrong with the Nigerian land and climate or water or air or anything else. The Nigerian problems are the unwillingness or inability of its leaders to rise up to the responsibility, or the challenge of personal example, which are hallmarks of true leadership.</p> <p>From the observation of Achebe, it is understood that the common man</p> <p>looks up to the rulling elite to learn and be directed to avoid corruption. But such expectation from the leadership in Nigeria has failed. Democracy which supposed to be the government of the people, has failed in Nigeria. When the first generation rulers in Nigeria became corrupt, Major Chukwuma Nzogwu and his military colleagues struck. Nzogwu in his broadcast pointed out that they have come to save Nigerians from the hands of inept and corrupt leadership. Nzeogwu cited by Uju in (Ugwu, 2002: 3) opined that “Our enemies are the political profiteers, the</p> <p>swindlers, the men in high and low places that seek bribes and demand 10 percent, those that have corrupted our society and put the country back by their words and deeds”.The above statement was contained in the national broadcast of Chukwuma Nzogwu on 15th January 1960.The aim therefore was to give good governance to the vast majority of Nigerians. However, the military consistently failed to salvage the masses in their political governance.Corruption and abuse of power has long been features in Nigeria. Joseph, R. S and Taylor, A. A. (1996: 9) has described Nigeria as an “unfinished state and as a truculent African state tragedy”. (Ayittey, 2006: 2) posited that in the midst of abundant human and material resources, efforts at building a democratic polity further entrapped it at the “political cross­roads”. Yet, with enormous wealth from oil resources, economic endowment, social and political strength, Nigeria has not qualified to be called the giant of Africa. Kew (2006: 12) has noted that: The giant was brought to its Knees by 20 years brutal and corrupt military rule, which left a legacy of executive dominance and a political corruption in the hands of Nigeria’s so- called “godfathers” powerful political bosses sitting a top vast patronage networks who view the government primarily through the lens of the own personal enrichment.</p> <p>As a result of the instability, the focus of the leadership became parochial</p> <p>with the overriding consideration for personal survival rather than national development. Attempts at promoting “democratic consolidation” were hampered by the personality cult of the emerging political gladiators who exploited the instrument of state power to promote their personal agenda.</p> <p>Nigeria’s political elite, as Skiar (2006: 3) observed</p> <p>Vie for power and control over the vast spoils of office”. The centralized political and economic structures “made the military and civilian individuals who controlled key state posts fabulously wealthy, while 70% of Nigerians fell into abject poverty.</p> <p>Poor leadership has led to stagnation, and alienation of the citizenry, causing</p> <p>a low level of sense of belonging and none identifying with the political system (Mayer,  1996: 10). According to Kew (2006:21): The Nigerian government remains distant from serving the interest of its people. The powerful mandarin who built vast patronage networks during the military days and their personal fortunes dominates politics at the federal state, and local levels of the Nigerian federation. Moreover, many of those so-called “godfathers” have been cultivating personal militias to secure their positions, promoting a local arm race in some regions. even though several governors one under indictment for money laundering abroad and others are being investigated at home. The bonanza continues at public coffers for these power holders, while basic infrastructure in many parts of the country remains as dilapidated as it was under military rule.</p> <p>It is the situation that Ake (1995: 2-5) indicated as the product of the pattern of state affairs in the developing world. According to him, the high premium on political power, and the attendant intense struggle for it, further hinders national development for the promotion of the personal interests of the political leaders. Eke further observed that:</p> <p>Besieged by a multitude of hostility forces, most of the leaders in Africa are political insecure. They are as completely engrossed in the struggle for survival that they are hardly able to address the problem of development.</p> <p>Skiar (2006: 3-4) noted that the leadership problem in the Nigerian polity</p> <p>was a manifestation of the dysfunctional pattern of the years of military interregnum. The leadership pattern in Nigeria lacks the necessary focus capable of instilling national development and promotes political stability. Rather,</p> <p>Nigerian leaders are preoccupied with their desires for the appropriation and privatization of the Nigerian state. The fall of the second Republic, for instance, was precipitated by the pervasive corruption and, the attendant political violence that greeted electoral manipulations, in a bid to stick to power (Ayeni, 1988: 30).</p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF THE CHURCHES IN COMBATTING CORRUPTION AMONG POLITICAL LEADERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF THE CHURCHES IN COMBATTING CORRUPTION AMONG POLITICAL LEADERS", "id": 32}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The current study aims to increase understanding of influences on and consequences of self-regulation in adolescence. Previous work has shown that higher levels of self-regulation are associated with greater social competence and lower levels problem behaviors. Past studies have posited that parenting and interparental conflict are linked to self-regulation and adjustment in childhood and adolescence. However, the mechanism underlying the potential effects of specific parental behaviors and interparental conflict on self-regulation and their unique effects on adjustment have been largely unexamined. It was hypothesized that parental psychological and behavioral criminal control and interparental conflict would be indirectly associated with adolescent outcomes via self-regulation abilities. Besides, differential impacts of parental criminal controlling behaviors on self-regulation were also explored. The study involved a sample of 300 students in the 6th and 7th grades and their mothers. Students completed self-report questionnaires on parental criminal control behaviors, self-regulation abilities, and academic self-concept. Furthermore, mothers completed questionnaires including parental criminal control, interparental conflict, self-regulation abilities of adolescents, and adolescent adjustment (i.e., hyperactivation/inattention, emotional, and prosocial behaviors). The mediational hypothesis was largely supported. Results suggested that perceived parental psychological criminal control and interparental conflict predicted low levels of self­regulation and in turn, this predicted adolescent adjustment. Parental behavioral criminal control predicted self-regulation abilities in adolescent-reported model only. As predicted, different parental psychological criminal control dimensions had divergent impact on adolescent outcomes. Specifically, love withdrawal/irrespective parenting was associated with the highest adolescent adjustment. Results also showed that the interplay between paternal guilt induction/erratic emotional behaviors and monitoring was significant in predicting prosocial behaviors and perseverance of adolescents. Similarly, the significant interaction between maternal love withdrawal/irrespective and knowledge suggested that high maternal withdrawal combined with high parental knowledge may result in hyperactivation/inattention problems among early adolescents. Finally, two U-shaped curvilinear relationships were found between psychological criminal control and adjustment variables. Accordingly, the relationship between paternal guilt induction/erratic emotional behaviors and low perseverance/monitoring; and maternal love withdrawal/irrespective and Turkish academic self-concept had curvilinear relationship. Theoretical, methodological, cultural, and practical implications of the findings were discussed considering previous literature.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE<br/></strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br/><br/><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/></p> <p>Primary concern of parents is to promote their children’s well-being and to prevent negative outcomes in their developmental trajectory. However, past studies have documented that the ability to regulate, alter or criminal control one’s own behavior or emotion is the main protective factor that prevents children from risky behaviors or maladaptive outcomes (Sethi, Mischel, Aber, Shoda, and Rodriguez, 2000; Tangney, Baumeister, &amp; Boone, 2004). High levels of self-regulation ability has also been linked to social and cognitive competence (Barkley, 2004), while low levels of self-regulation have been found to be associated with problem behaviors in childhood and adolescence (Tangney, Baumeister, &amp; Boone, 2004). However, the majority of previous work regarding the association between self-regulation and psychological adjustment has focused primarily on adolescents (Tangney, Baumeister, &amp; Boone, 2004; Moilanen, 2007). In contrast, research regarding the effects of contextual and familial effects (e.g., parenting) on self-regulation has mainly conducted on children (Finkenauer, Engels, &amp; Baumeister, 2005; Grolnick, &amp; Ryan, 1989). For instance, there is not adequate research on how parenting during adolescence is associated with self-regulation. Besides parenting behaviors, the impact of the family context variables on the self-regulation ability of adolescents has also not been examined systematically in previous studies. Therefore, this study aims to examine the interplay among specific parenting behaviors, marital conflict as an indicator of family context and adjustment among adolescents using a conceptual model. Detailed rationale of the study and related literature review will be presented in the following sections.</p> <p><strong>1.2   THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/></p> <p>The current study aims to examine a proposed mediational model in which self-regulation abilities of adolescents mediate the relationship between family context variables and adolescent outcomes (See Figure 1). This study also aims to investigate individual pathways of the antecedents and consequences of self­regulation abilities among early adolescents. Specifically, the purposes of this study are two-fold. First is to identify the associations between parental criminal control behaviors, family context and adolescents’ adjustment including self-regulatory abilities, problem behaviors, and academic self-description and second is to examine different dimensions of parental criminal control and its relevance with adolescent self­regulation.</p> <p>Adolescent self-regulation is an area in which different theoretical perspectives have been used to explain numerous factors, including parenting having effects on self-regulation skills. The theoretical background behind this study is a synthesis of two models: contextual family variables including parental criminal control and interparental conflict which have been shown to be critical elements in adolescents’ self-regulation (Brody &amp; Ge, 2001; Finkenauer, Engels, &amp; Baumeister, 2005), and its related behavioral outcomes (Mischel, Shoda, &amp; Rodriguez, 1989). As shown in Figure 1, it is anticipated that contextual family variables will have an impact on adolescent outcomes through their effects on the self-regulatory skills of adolescents. Direct effects of parenting and marital conflict on adolescent outcomes will decrease when self-regulation abilities added to the model.</p> <p>Figure 1. The Hypothetical Model of the Predictive Relationship between Parental Criminal control, Marital Conflict, Self-Regulation Abilities, and Adolescent Adjustment</p> <p>In this study, parenting is conceptualized as the specific parenting behaviors, including parental criminal control behaviors. It is also aimed to examine the effects of different dimensions of parental criminal control on adolescent self-regulation. Previous research indicated that both parenting and self-regulation have a unique (independent) impact on adjustment. These studies, however, have not investigated the unique contribution of specific dimensions of parental criminal control on self-regulation and adjustment behaviors. Specifically, it is expected that parental psychological criminal control would have a negative effect on adolescent adjustment especially by increasing emotional and conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer problems and by decreasing prosocial behaviors and academic self-concept. Based on the past literature and culture-specific expectations, it is also assumed that parental criminal control and adjustment may have a curvilinear association. Whereas low and high levels of parental criminal control would be associate with worst adjustment, moderate level of criminal control might be related with the optimum level of adolescent functioning as well as positive academic self-concept. In the current study, multiple sources of informants, including mothers and adolescents will be used to test these assumed links. Relevant literature on self-regulation and parenting variables will be summarized below.</p> <p>1.2         Reviews of the Literature on Self-Regulation</p> <p>In the following section, the various definitions of self-regulation as well as main theoretical perspectives will be presented. The possible outcomes of self­regulation and the risk factors associated with the lack (or low levels) of self­regulation abilities will also be reviewed. This section will be concluded with a brief discussion on the associations among self-regulation, parenting, and interparental conflict.</p> <p>Because the term self-regulation refers a complex psychological process related to socialization, there is no one standard definition describing self­regulation. Conventional definitions of self-regulation focus on the behaviors such as the ability to comply with requests (for children especially adults’) or the ability to adapt one’s behavior to particular situations. Other definitions of self regulation focus more on the criminal control of cognitive systems, such as the ability to criminal control attention, to demonstrate effective thinking and problem solving behavior or to be able to engage in independent activities. In the literature, the concept of self­regulation across theoretical perspectives encompasses the criminal control of emotions and behaviors as well as cognitive processing and ability to engage in prosocial behavior appropriate to a given age (Bronson, 2000).</p> <p>According to Baumeister and Vohs (2003), the self has an executive function that takes action, chooses an option among many alternatives, filters irrelevant information, and determines appropriate responses. The self exerts criminal control over itself by using both automatic and conscious processes to criminal control and understand external world. How people resist temptations, effortfully persist, and carefully weigh options to select the most optimal course of action in order to reach their goals are main questions of the recent self-regulation theories. Different from Baumeister and Vohs’s (2003) conceptualization, Kopp (1982) defines the concept self regulation with respect to external behaviors. According to Kopp;</p> <p>Self regulation is defined as an ability to comply with a request, to start and cease acts according to situational demands, to adjust the strength, incidence, and duration of acts in social settings, to delay desired object or goal, and to perform socially accepted behaviors in the absence of external monitors (pp.190).</p> <p>However, self-regulation is not only an internalization of external expectations, but it also includes the self-initiated behaviors and goals (Fitzsimons &amp; Bargh, 2004). Although some researchers draw distinction among the concepts of self-regulation, self-criminal control, and self-discipline, these terms are often used interchangeably. Self-regulation is generally referred the broadest meaning, as it is comprised of both conscious and nonconscious forms of altering the self.</p> <p>The term self-criminal control has also been used close to the term of self-regulation, although it implies more deliberate and conscious process of altering the self. Self­criminal control refers to the processes by which the self inhibits unwanted responses. It is also related to self-discipline, even though self-discipline is a much narrow concept referring to individual’s intentional plans in order to improve themselves in different domains (Baumeister, &amp; Vohs, 2003).</p> <p>The reviewed definitions of self-regulation have focused on the specific aspects of self-regulation construct with respect to their theoretical background. A complete review of existing conceptualizations is beyond the scope of the current study, but two basic perspectives will be reviewed briefly; the processes and the products (outcomes) of self-regulation.</p> <p>1.3           Self-Regulation Process: Conscious or Automatic Responses?</p> <p>1.3.1     Delay of Gratification</p> <p>The questions of what self-regulation is and what it involves depend on the theoretical perspective adopted. From the social and motivational psychology perspectives, an answer could be the ability to criminal control and determine one’s own behaviors consciously and intentionally. The concept “delay of gratification” is one of the forms of self-regulation. According to Mischel and Ayduk (2004), the delay of gratification represents motivational process and the early form of self­regulation. The process of delaying gratification involves resistance to immediate temptation and regulation of impulsive behaviors typically in the context of more rewarding long-term goals. According to Funder, Block, and Block (1983), delay of gratification can be considered as a sub-form of the more general concept which is named as ego-criminal control. Those with high ego-criminal control can restrain or inhibit their impulses and postpone immediate gratifications. Without the ability to postpone the immediate gratification for the sake of eventual goals, people can not make plans for future, or work for long-term goals (Funder, Block, &amp; Block, 1983). Fundamentally, this ability has an impact on self-regulation skills at the later period of life.</p> <p>The delay of gratification ability has been used as the indicative of criminal control and different experimental paradigms were developed to assess this ability. The delay of gratification paradigm has been conventionally measured by using the two- choice delay tasks. In these tasks, children are asked to make a choice between an immediately available treat and a more attractive treat at a later time. For example, a child may have to choose between a small toy and a larger, more attractive one, depending on her/his willingness to wait before reaching them. The longer the child is able to wait, the larger her/his reward will be. Another form of two-choice task is called “waiting game” in which while sitting in front of the two rewards (exposed or covered), the child is told to wait until the experimenter returns to the room. If </p> <p>the child successfully waits for the experimenter to return, s/he will get the larger and more preferred reward. If the child cannot wait the experimenter, he/she may ring the bell to call experimenter, but he/she will only receive the small and less desirable reward. Although these experimental paradigms could be effectively used for younger children (from 1 to 7-years of age), these paradigms are usually ineffective or even problematic for the older children.</p> <p>There are several reasons regarding why the delay of gratification abilities of older children hasn’t been tested successfully. First, it is relatively difficult to have realistic and non-trivial incentives for older children and early adolescents. Second, the meaningful delay intervals for the older group can span for days or weeks rather than a few minutes used for delay tasks in young children. Therefore, the delay of gratification abilities of adolescents and adults, as the indicative of self­regulation, is rarely studied in the previous studies. The delay of gratification abilities were measured only in a few studies during late childhood. Wulfert, Block, Ana, Rodriguez, and Colsman (2002) measured delay of gratification abilities of early adolescents from 14 to 17 years old using monetary incentives. Employing the experimental procedure used by Funder and Block (1989), researchers offered adolescents repeated choices between immediate payments of $4 after each session or a whole payment ($28), including interest payment at the end of the study. They found that, compared to adolescents who could delay gratification, those who choose the immediate payment showed more self-regulatory deficits. According to authors, however, in money incentive procedure, because participants might not trust the experimenter and wanted to save money owed them; they might have chosen the immediate offering (less money) rather than long-term reward (more money) (Wulfert, Block, Anna, Rodriguez, and Colsman, 2002).</p> <p>To better explain the delay of gratification process, Carver and Scheider</p> <p>(1998) posited feedback loops in which individuals must become consciously aware</p> <p>of the discrepancy between the current and desired self-states, then intentionally</p> <p>choose to engage in action to ease this discrepancy. In a similar vein, in their “hot-</p> <p>cool system” model, Metcalfe and Mischel (1999) stated that individuals must</p> <p>consciously and intentionally attempt to criminal control their responses to overcome the</p> <p>influences of the current environment. According to Metcalfe and Mischel (1999),</p> <p>these two types of cognitive processing, namely hot and cool systems, involve</p> <p>distinct but yet interacting systems. The cool cognitive system is composed of a complex spatiotemporal and episodic representation and thoughts. It is also called as “know system”. The hot emotional system called “go system” involves quick emotional processing and responding on the basis of unconditional and conditional stimuli. Authors assert that self-regulation and goal-directed volition can be seen as the interaction between these two systems. The hot memory systems are activated and the cool systems are deactivated by a threatening stimulus. As a result, for example, when the hot system is activated by the delicious food cues for dieters, it is more difficult to postpone gratification.</p> <p>1.3.2        Self-Regulatory Strength Model</p> <p>A well-developed form of self-regulation involves a deliberate and conscious alteration of the self responses, such as making choices, inhibiting a tempting response, or making and carrying out plans. These actions and intensions require a source. According to the self-regulatory strength model proposed by Baumeister and colleagues (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, &amp; Tice, 1998; Baumeister, Heatherton, &amp; Tice, 1994), these acts of the self requires some form of energy or strength which is limited in capacity. Each act of self-criminal control consumes some of this limited resource and leaves less amount of available energy for the subsequent acts. When this limited resource is depleted (referred to as the “ego depletion” state), self-regulation failure becomes more likely. The core premise of the self-regulatory strength model is that people depend on a limited resource to engage in the acts of self-criminal control. When this resource is reduced, the individual gets in a state of ego- depletion which makes him or her susceptible to self-regulation failure if the resource is not somehow replenished (Baumeister &amp; Vohs, 2003).</p> <p>The following two-task paradigm is used to manipulate self-regulatory strength in several “ego depletion” studies. Individuals in the ego depletion condition are asked to engage in two subsequent tasks both of which require the exertion of self-criminal control, such as resisting the temptation of eating delicious chocolate candies and eating radishes instead (the first task) and then trying to solve a difficult puzzle (the second task). In contrast, for the participants in the criminal control condition, only the second task that requires self-criminal control exertion is used (e.g., eating chocolates instead of radishes in the first task and working on a difficult </p> <p>puzzle in the second task). Participants in the criminal control condition are expected to perform better than the ego depletion condition group in the second task. Experiments using this paradigm have demonstrated that ego-depletion impairs physical endurance, persistence, and emotion regulation; hampers reasoning on complex cognitive tasks; increases alcohol consumption; lets to fewer constructive responses to romantic partner’s destructive behaviors, and increases self-serving biases and attraction to an alternative partner in romantic relationships (see; Baumeister &amp; Vohs, 2003; Rawn &amp; Vohs, 2006, for extensive reviews).</p> <p>In addition to the state depletion of regulatory resources, individuals may differ in terms of their chronic tendencies to exert self-criminal control. In the trait perspective, the ability to alter one’s behaviors by criminal controlling thoughts, emotions, impulses, and performance is termed as the trait self-criminal control (Tangney, Baumeister, &amp; Boone, 2004). Tangney et al. reported that trait self-criminal control was positively associated with psychological adjustment, self-esteem, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, family cohesion, secure attachment, forgiveness, empathic concern, and perspective taking. Although the individual correlates of the trait self-criminal control have been studied extensively, a few studies have examined the antecedents of self-criminal control abilities (Finkenauer, Engels, &amp; Baumeister, 2005).</p> <p>1.3.3        Self-Regulation as an Automatic Process</p> <p>The second theoretical view on self-regulation, which is called as automatic self-regulation, was advanced by Fitzsimons and Bargh (2004). These authors have proposed that self-regulation is the capacity of individuals to guide themselves toward important goal states. Thus, regulation of self involves a wide range of cognitive and motivational actions, such as acting quickly to reach goals, ignoring distractions, taking appropriate positions in response to different situations, and overcoming obstacles. Because of the wide range of the actions, it is concluded that self-regulation is more than willpower or a goal pursuit alone.</p> <p>Bargh (1990) suggested an auto-motive model of self-regulation as an alternative (or complementary) model to the classic self-regulation theories focusing on conscious choices. According to this model, goal pursuit process which is an important part of the self-regulation process can proceed without any conscious awareness and guidance. A critical question here is that how can goals operate our behaviors without our knowledge or awareness. First, Fitzsimons and Bargh (2004) proposed that the goals are assumed to be represented in the cognitive system as well as other cognitive constructs (see also Gollwitzer &amp; Bargh, 2005). Second, since goal representations are capable of being activated automatically by the features of one’s environment, mere presence of situational cues that strongly associated with the pursuit of these goals. The auto-motive model assumes that similar to other cognitive structures (e.g., attitudes, stereotypes etc.), goals can be automatically activated in the mere presence of relevant environmental cues (Fitzsimons &amp; Bargh, 2004; Greenwald, Banaji, 1995). Auto-motive model states that the automatic self-regulation can occur in the realms of cognition, emotion, and behavior.</p> <p>Attention allocation and the capacity of working memory are assumed to be an important component of self-regulation success (Fitzsimons &amp; Bargh, 2004). Past studies have demonstrated that even basic cognitive processes, such as attention and working memory can be regulated automatically. In their study, Chartland and Bargh (1996) showed that participants primed with impression formation goal did recall more behaviors performed by the target than those primed with a memorization goal. Consequently, results supported the expectation that the effect of activated goals is the same whether the activation is nonconscious or through an act of will. In addition to the automaticity of attention and memory, selective remembering and forgetting have also been subjected to regulation by nonconscious processes (Mitchell, Macrae, Schooler, Rowe, &amp; Milne, 2002). Evidence from these studies indicates the key role of automatic processes on regulating and guiding cognition.</p> <p>Although relatively a few studies have examined nonconscious emotion regulation processes, past studies have also demonstrated that individuals are able to regulate their emotions automatically (Gross, 1998, 1999). Using a process model of emotion regulation, Gross (1998; 1999) argues that emotion regulation activity may occur without conscious awareness, such as well-practiced routines that become automatic by time. Habits, for example, that reduce anxiety such as nail biting (Fitzsimons &amp; Bargh, 2004) or smoking cigarette (Gross, 1999) are examples of automatic emotion regulation. Because of its repetition in lifespan, these emotion-laden processes can be automatised by using minimal attentional capacity. However, it is unclear that whether activation of emotion regulation goals is possible and if so, whether they consume cognitive sources that are limited. Even though there are limited numbers of studies, there has been extensive research on nonconscious behavioral regulation.</p> <p>As shown in previous studies, goals influencing social behavior can also be directed by nonconscious processes. In their study, Brandstatter, Lengfelder, and Gollwitzer (2001) showed that behavioral goals were activated by subliminal priming of goal cues. After being exposed to the achievement related words subliminally, participants performed better at a word-search puzzle. Similarly, after subliminal presentation of cooperation-relevant words, participants behaved more cooperative in a dilemma game than did non-primed ones (cited in Bargh &amp; Chartland, 1999). Automatic processes of regulation cognition, emotion, and behavior have been shown consistency with the auto-motive model of Bargh (1990). However, the question of where these nonconscious regulation sources come from is still unanswered. According to auto-motive model, goals become associated with properties of specific circumstances as a result of their frequent and consistent occurrence. Consequently, mere the presence of environmental cues can activate goals people pursuit (Bargh, 1990; Fitzsimons &amp; Bargh, 2004). Nevertheless, these are not the only necessary conditions for automatic regulation.</p> <p>Implementation intentions (e.g., \"If I encounter Situation X, then I'll perform Behavior Y\") are also assumed to initiate automatic actions (Gollwitzer, 1993, 1999). Individuals construct a mental schema relating environmental cues and goal directed behavioral responses. When a situation occurs, the pre-set behavior is performed automatically without any conscious choice. By implementation intentions, people develop a mental set providing them automatic self-regulatory behaviors without any need for frequent and consistent experiences (Fitzsimons &amp; Bargh, 2004).</p> <p>Nonconscious self-regulation can function similar to conscious self­regulation, but more efficiently and consistently, and may also complement conscious kinds of self-criminal control with an additional mechanism. Bargh and colleagues (2001) found that nonconscious goal pursuit possesses as similar to the key characteristics of conscious goal pursuit. People persist toward the goal progress even when obstacles arise; they increase their goal strength when their goals are unfulfilled; and they tend to resume the goal pursuit after disruption. Alternative goals are automatically inhibited in order to maintain focus on the goal being pursued, and temptations seem automatic to activate higher order goals with which they interfere, reminding individuals of their important goal pursuits. Whether it is conscious or automatic process, exhibiting self-regulation always lead to certain consequences, which can be positive or negative in its nature for individuals.</p> <p>1.4         Consequences of Self-Regulation Success and Failure</p> <p>Past studies have examined the potential benefits and the costs of self­regulation processes. In an extensive study by Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone</p> <p>(2004)       , participants who scored low in self-criminal control reported a wide range of negative outcomes including addiction, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, eating disorders and binge eating, unwanted pregnancy, AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, debt and bankruptcy, lack of savings, violent and criminal behavior, underachievement in school and work, procrastination, smoking, and lack of exercise. Authors concluded that all of these negative outcomes could be reduced or eliminated if people criminal controlled their behavior better. Specifically, people with high self-criminal control (self-regulation ability) had better grades, as compared with people low in self-criminal control. People with high self-criminal control have also been found to show fewer impulse criminal control problems, such as binge eating and alcohol use (Tangney, Baumeister, &amp; Boone, 2004). It is also found that people with high self-criminal control reported better psychological adjustment with respect to psychopathological symptoms including somatization, obsessive-compulsive patterns, depression, anxiety, hostile anger, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism. They also reported higher self-acceptance and self-esteem. In addition to the individual difference variables, self-criminal control has been found to be related with interpersonal functioning. For example, Eisenberg et al. (1997) found that high social functioning quality was predicted by high self-regulation. Moreover, research on early form of self-regulation; delay of gratification suggest a similar pattern in which effective capacity to delay gratification at early age predicted better interpersonal relationships in early adulthood (Sethi, Mischel, Aber, Shoda, and Rodriguez, 2000).</p> <p>Other studies have extended these findings for different outcomes, such as the costs of self-regulation. For example, Tice and Baumeister (1997) found that procrastinators (who regulate their time-limited performances ineffectively) suffered greater stress and health problems than other students and also ended up with poorer grades. Similarly, Engels, Finkenauer, den Exter Blokland, and Baumeister (2000) found that adolescents with low self-criminal control were more likely to engage in delinquent behaviors, such as fighting, vandalism, and petty theft, and they also had reported worse relationships with their parents.</p> <p>Up to now, literature on self-regulation was reviewed and it has been showed that when studying self-regulation, researchers usually tend to focus on either the processes of regulation, such as the motivation to self-regulate or using specific techniques for regulation or the outcomes of self-regulatory actions implying the degrees of success or failure associated with self-regulation. The current study will mainly focus on the outcomes of self-regulation.</p> <p>1.5         Development of Self-Regulation and Implications for Parenting</p> <p>Self-regulation ability is assumed be highly sensitive to developmental changes. In her review, Kopp (1982) summarized developmental path of self­regulation process. According to Kopp, the growth of self-regulation begins in infancy approximately from second month on and five stages were proposed for the development of self-regulation.</p> <p>The first stage, called neurophysiological modulation, refers to the organization of reflex movements and the arousal states as well as modulation of external stimulus. The infant’s behaviors become more predictable starting from two to three months. In this stage, the caregiver’s role is viewed as an assisting one, responding to the infant’s varying states and proving external support and modulation.</p> <p>The second stage of self-regulation development involves sensorimotor regulation. Kopp (1982) asserted that infant develops the ability to alter behavior in response to events occurring in the environment at approximately from three months to 12 months. Although this type of regulation is not intentional or driven </p> <p>by any motivational processes, altering behaviors are discovered accidentally. Associations between these altering behaviors are strengthened through conditioning. According to Kopp (1982), caregiver’s sensitivity and responsiveness are also critical during this period. The reactions of caregiver during this period are typically in response to the basic habits of the infant (e.g., thumb sucking). Throughout this period, infant becomes highly dependent on the caregiver’s impressions.</p> <p>Kopp’s (1982) third phase involves the beginning of the awareness of social demands, as well as some criminal control skills from age 12 to 18 months. By this stage, the child starts to perform the ability to initiate, and stop activity in response to external demands. The key achievements during this stage are compliance with the demands of caregivers, and ability to initiate behavior. In this stage, child gains language skills, the caregiver is more of an organizer in directing the child’s behaviors (see also McCabe, Cunnington, and Brooks-Gunn, 2004).</p> <p>In the fourth stage, self-criminal control involves development of representational thinking and recollection of memory from the age of 18 to 24 months According to Kopp (1982), these cognitive developments provide child to remember previous events and modulate behaviors as a result. The child can also remember socially acceptable behaviors even in the absence of caregivers or other significant external criminal control images. But there is limited flexibility in applying these memories to new situations.</p> <p>In the fifth stage, Kopp (1982) proposed that the child starts to display clear evidence of self-regulation around the age of 2 years as the child’s awareness of self emerges. In her review, she distinguished between self-criminal control and self­regulation and claims that self-criminal control precedes self-regulation by emphasizing on the contingency rules. She stated that:</p> <p>Self-regulation in contrast to self-criminal control involves the ability to use numerous contingency rules to guide behavior, to maintain appropriate monitoring for appreciable lengths of time and any number of situations, and to learn to produce a series of approximations to standards of expectations. The shift from self­criminal control to self-regulation, though probably quite subtle and gradual, parallels the growth of cognitive skills that is also gradual in the early preschool period (Kopp, 1982; pp 210).</p> <p>However, Kopp (1982) suggests that true self-regulation cannot emerge until the preschool years when the child becomes capable of complying with others’ requests and behave appropriately in the lack of external monitoring. During these years, children are increasingly capable of internal self-regulation using rules, goal- directed plans and are expected to be able to regulate their own emotions and behaviors in an appropriate way (Grolnick, Deci, and Ryan, 1997). Sethi, Mischel, Aber, Shoda, and Rodriguez (2000) claimed that children at preschool years are expected to “delay, defer, and accept substitutions without becoming aggressive or disorganized by frustration, challenge or fatigue”. Although several studies have emphasized young child’s self-regulation skills, few studies have focused on regulation abilities of early adolescences (Finkenauer, Engels, &amp; Baumeister, 2005). Considering these fragile years, youth’s failure and success of self­regulation carry an important role. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the self-regulatory abilities during early adolescences.</p> <p>The quality of caregiver-child relationship during the preschool years impacts the maturation process of regulatory abilities. There is a consensus in the literature that self-regulation follows a pathway from external to internal criminal control during early childhood (Kopp, 1982). The child learns self-regulatory skills from their caregivers, especially from their mothers. Therefore, the influence of caregivers in the development of self-regulation is of utmost importance. Development of self-regulation during childhood is frequently attributed to parental socialization through which individuals adopt and internalize beliefs, worldviews, and behaviors consistent with their parents’ values (Kopp, 1982).</p> <p>According to socialization theories on parenting, children’s socialization is facilitated by various parental behaviors, skills, and attitudes which are embedded within the broader context of interparental and parent-child relationships (Laible &amp; Thompson, 2007). Parents’ actions communicate the limits of acceptable behavior and model regulatory strategies, while the relational context may increase or decrease the likelihood that children will adopt behaviors prescribed by caregivers. For example, a mother’s repeated attempts to model strategies for criminal controlling negative emotions in public may be ignored if the mother-child relationship is highly hostile or distant. The role of the parental behaviors and interparental context in self-regulation will be briefly reviewed in the following section.</p> <p>14</p> <p>1.6         Parenting as a Socialization Instrument</p> <p>Children’s socialization is facilitated through discrete parenting behaviors (e.g., positive reinforcement for acceptable behaviors, or harsh punishment for unacceptable emotional displays), which are embedded within the broader context of parent-child relationships characterized by mutually-responsive interactions, or nonsynchronized, unfulfilling exchanges (Darling &amp; Steinberg, 1993)</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF PARENTAL CONTROL, CRIMINAL AND MARITAL CONFLICT ON ADOLESCENTS’ SELF-REGULATION AND ADJUSTMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF PARENTAL CONTROL, CRIMINAL AND MARITAL CONFLICT ON ADOLESCENTS’ SELF-REGULATION AND ADJUSTMENT", "id": 33}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong><br/></p> <p>The purpose of the study was to establish the significant relationship between poverty and crime in Owerri district of Western Province of Nigeria. The objective of the study was to investigate the influence of poverty on crime amongst the residents of Owerri District in Western Province. The research design for the study was survey research design in which 5 point likert scale questionnaire on poverty and crime was used study to collect data from the respondents. The sample for the study consisted of 124 persons (Male 90 and Female 34). Data collected was analyzed using chi-square statistical method. Results indicated that there was significant relationship between poverty (financial standing, employment, family structure, social support, level of education and poverty) and tendency to commit crime among the people of Owerri district. The recommendation of the study is that improved systems of education and economic empowerment of the people should be enhanced by the government in order to reduce crime in the region among the 240,000 inhabitants of Owerri in Western Nigeria</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE  </strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/></p> <p>Owerri District has a population of over 240,000 people, 60% of this population live below the poverty line of less than 1 US dollar per day leading to poor standards of living. There is massive population explosion and pressure on the meagre resources like land, water, health, education, infrastructure, agriculture and some micro-finance enterprises in the region.</p> <p>Due to the vicious cycle of poverty, there is gross violation of human rights as per the Geneva Convention that every person has the right to life, liberty and security. Other fundamental human rights violated in Owerri District included article 2 where men and women are to be treated equally which is not the case, instead they are subordinates and not allowed in decision making especially on assets. The area has been a high population growth of youths (70%) who have neither trained, completed school or dropped out of school due to unemployment have resulted to violent crimes in the area such as murder, assault, rape, prostitution, theft, burglary, armed gangsters, banditry, trade in illicit rugs like bhang, changaa (local beer). Article 5 of the Declaration of Human Rights the states that no one shall be subjected to torture cruel inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, economic or political liberty. The rights of the inhabitants of Owerri have been highly contested leading them to fall into traps of violent crimes in the region..</p> <p>Poverty as a social phenomenon has affected the entire population in the region, poverty and inequality often results due to social instability, diseases, environmental degradation, struggle for natural resources and constraints on the basic needs in the society. In 1992 it was estimated that 42% of the approximately 525 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa lived below the poverty line of US $ 370 per capita and the number was expected to increase by 50% in the year 2000. It is noted that women, children, old age, disabled and the orphans are the most affected with poverty. The unstable micro-economic environment, poor development policies which yield to low economic growth not consistent with economic growth, poor infrastructure, dependency ratio in the area is also high. There is need for proper planning, decision making and economic empowerment of Owerri people to alleviate poverty in the region. The District budget allocation should be allocated, reviewed and strategic plans made to oversee the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) Local Government Transfer Fund (LATF), Women Development Fund, and Youths Fund to help improve the income of the people for better standards of living. “People must not be allowed to be come so poor that they offend or are hurtful to the society. It is so much that misery and plight of the poor but the discomfort and the costs of the community which is crucial to the view of the poverty. Poverty due to low income creates problems for those who are not poor”. (Martya 1981)[1]</p> <p>Crime as an act of sufficient challenges to the people of Owerri District has created fear for development and investment in the area which has no industry and processing services to bring income and employment to the area. Most of the businesses in the major towns are grocery, and casual labour especially in</p> <p>Luanda, Esibuye, Kilingili, Khumusalaba, Mwichio. Most of the occupation of Owerri is subsistence farming on small holdings mainly done by women to subsidize the family income. There are many crimes counted in the area such as juvenile delinquency as crimes counted be of children less than 18 years who make gangsters/ banditry, rape and murder people in the villages I.e. the Town Down gangsters of Luanda Town, the 42 brothers, and Musumbiji and others. Acts of crime, gambling, prostitution, vagrancy, homosexual are notorious to control in the District and thus referred to as victimless crimes. White collar crimes are committed by respectable persons through corruption. The purpose of this study is to investigate and establish the relationship between poverty and crime in Owerri District and recommend ways on reduction of crime.</p> <p>The purpose the study was to establish the relationship between poverty and crime and make recommendations of helping the Abanyole people of Owerri and the government to alleviate poverty and crime in the area of study. The research is to generate ways of solving poverty through proper planning on investments, implementation of government projects solve unemployment, land tenure problems and enact a good policy legal framework to curb crime in the area.</p> <p>Information from this study will be used by Governmental Departments i.e. Constituency Development Fund (CDF), Youth Fund, District Budgetary allocations, Education Offices, Provincial Administration and Non-Governmental Organizations to make right decisions to empower the economic status of the area to alleviate poverty and violent crimes as well as gross violation of human rights. The Ministry of Planning and National Development, Ministry of finance, The Office of the President and Provincial Administration to promote food security, health and sanitation services, investment and cur b violent crimes in the region. The study will be useful in investigating and establishing factors leading to poverty and how to curb them through the recommendations of the study in accordance to Malthusian’s population Theory on Fundamental Human rights and conflicting theory on crime issues. The findings of this study will enable to put down factors leading to poverty and come up with strategic plans to help reduce it engage the entire population towards positive economic development of the area.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/></p> <p>Poverty has a great influence on the crime rate in Owerri district of western Nigeria. Poverty can be in state of absolute where there is lack of the basic resources needed to maintain minimum of the physical health, normally calculated in calories, while relative poverty has quantitative dimensions which refer to general standard f living in different societies due to cultural sensitivity and variations between and within societies over time. Poverty is due to massive inequality due to poor allocation of investment, education, planning and policy implementation, inadequate health facilities, human rights violations such as economic empowerment, right for protection, security, children’s rights, and right to life.</p> <p>Owerri area with a population of over 240,000 suffers from poverty and crime due to underdevelopment and expansive population which constraints the meagre available natural resources. There are no investments in the area apart from some small micro-finance investment Nigeria Women Finance Trust (KWFT) which are created to help women start small business holds. The Constituency Development Fund (CDF) is also geared towards enhancing small microfinance projects in education, infrastructure, youths, markets, farming in the area to alleviate poverty. There are conflicts over the scarce resources like land ownership, safe drinking water, streams, food, education, health which results into conflicts and criminal activities and offences due to poverty. Crime and violent conflicts is growing due to disparities in wealth, increasing unemployment among the youths, population press he on land and resources leading to environmental degradation which provokes social discontent, polarization leading to social strife in the region. According to vigorous approach theory societal conditions of deep spread and deep poverty is essentially deprivation suffered by a large segment of some important essentials for sustenance such as sufficient income to provide housing, clothing, food and education, health facilities adequate opportunities for production employment which leads to societal stress. Stress leads to increasing the anger and frustration of the poor suffering who are then exploited by violence promoting war bent demagoguery. Indeed scarcities of the basic needs amongst the population causes social segmentation, group formation and strengthen groups identity which creates violent collective action which takes forms from rime war, terrorism, riots, civil insurgencies, political repressions to its ultimate forms.</p> <p>Most of the inhabitants of Owerri live on subsistence farming on small holdings of less than Mi an acre and with poor farming methods, lack of farm inputs and technical agricultural know-how have lessen the yield to sustain the family needs. The are no income generating investments as factories, plantations (cash crops) to employ the youths and e working population in the areas leading to severe unemployment and crime in the region. In 1991 the United Nations crime prevention journals stipulated that crime has accelerated far beyond the current reach of international community. Crime is particularly serious impediment to harmonious development. It dissipates or misdirects the gains of economic growth and impairs the quality of life; crime threatens safety well being a d personal integrity of us all. (United Nations: 1991) Some other criminal offences conducted in the region is chang’aa brewing (local illicit brew)., substance abuse like bhang, cocaine, processor and trafficking of drugs in towns like Luanda, Kima, Ekwanda, Esibuye, Kilingili, Khumusalaba, and Esirulo has granted more crime impediment to investment in the region leading to absolute poverty. The study seeks to address the influence of poverty on crime, the consequences to the population in Owerri District and hence recommends ways to curb the menace.</p> <p><strong>1.3  PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/></p> <p>The purpose the study was to establish the relationship between poverty and crime and make recommendations of helping the Abanyole people of Owerri and the government to alleviate poverty and crime in the area of study.

It is on this premise that the study bases its emphasis on the Nigerian police force to appraise and ascertain efforts and limitation encountered in providing adequate security to Nigerians. The subject matter is both timely and pivotal in this era when Nigeria’s image and freedom internationally and locally is deteriorating due to the pervasive insecurity being experienced today. This has bedeviled the Nations march towards socio-economic growth and development. The study however, focuses on the causes and effect of insecurity in Nigeria, factors that have inhibited the Nigerian police force in performing its statutory functions and steps to be made to enhance greater security in Nigeria and to make the Nigeria police force more responsive to her duties. This work also gave a chronological historical antecedent of insecurity in Nigeria. It also delves into the purview of the history, structure, mission and vision of the Nigerian police force. Moreover, the study revealed that the relevance of the Nigerian police force in relation to the security of the country is incapacitated by the inability of the government to address root causes of insecurity and proffer solution to these root causes. This is manifested in the inequality and high rate of poverty currently experienced in the country even in the midst of plenty. The chapters in the study address various aspect of the problem. The revelation and recommendation made in this work will be invaluable and important to the Nigerian police, government, private and corporate organization, as well as, researchers in proffering solution that will boost security in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/> INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In recent times, Nigeria has witnessed an unprecedented plaque of crisis and insecurity, each leading to loss of lives and destruction of properties. According to Ezeoha (2011:38) in Causes and effects of insecurity in Nigeria, “Security means stability and continually of livelihood, predictability of relationships, feeling safe and belonging to a social group. Internal security, or IS, which is related to security can be seen as the act of keeping peace within the borders of a sovereign state or other self-governing territories. This is done generally by upholding the national law and defending against internal security threats. Those responsible for internal security may range from police to paramilitary forces, and in exceptional circumstances, the military itself.</p> <p>Insecurity on the other hand, is the antithesis of security which is the concept of insecurity. It has been ascribed different interpretations in association with the various ways which it affects individuals. Some of the common descriptors of insecurity include: want of safety; danger; hazard; uncertainty; want of confidence; doubtful; inadequately guarded or protected; lacking stability; troubled; lack of protection; and unsafe, to mention a few. All of these have been used by different people to define the concept of insecurity. These different descriptors, however, run into a common reference to a state of vulnerability to harm and loss of life, property or livelihood. Beland (2005) defined insecurity as “the state of fear or anxiety stemming from a concrete or alleged lack of protection.” It refers to lack or inadequate freedom from danger.</p> <p>In the same token, Oshodi (2011) argues that one sure way of tackling the insecurity situation in Nigeria is to accord the field of psychology a pride of place in policy formulation and implementation to promote national cohesion and integration.</p> <p>However it can be clearly stated that Nigeria has remained more insecure especially during and after the April 2011 presidential elections and has suffered more than ever in history, a battery of ethno-religious-political crises, taking the shape of bomb blasts sponsored by the Boko Haram religious sect.</p> <p>The unparalleled spate of terrorism, kidnappings and other violent crimes is to say the least, alarming. Religious leaders, churches, mosques etc are not spared in this onslaught. There is no gainsaying the fact that Nigeria is at a cross-road and gradually drifting towards a failed state if this insecurity trend continues.</p> <p>According to Bavier, a writer who is a frequent visitor to the northern region, told CNN that the</p> <p>Federal government has completely lost control of the north-east, despite deploying thousands of troops and establishing a Joint Task Force. Now, he says, it looks like this insurgency has broken out of the north-east”. And what’s worrying, he says, is that there’s “not a whole lot of visible effort from the federal government to calm things down (Lister, 2012:14).</p> <p>From the aforementioned one can posit that Nigeria has witnessed an unprecedented level of insecurity. Inter and intra- communal and ethnic clashes, ethno religious violence, armed robbery, assassination, murder, gender-based violence, and bomb explosion have been on the increase leading to enormous loss of life and property and a general atmosphere of siege and social tension for the populace (Ibrahim and Igbuzor, 2002:2). Furthermore between 2009 to date over 3,000 souls both military and civilians have been lost in the purported “holy” crusade; this have further paralyzed government plans in mapping out an efficient strategy in combating insecurity. Despite soaring security budget, insecurity still pervades the country.</p> <p>Consequently, Insecurity has taken various forms in different parts of the country. In the South-West, armed robbers have taken over, while in the North, cross-border bandits operate with the ease. However in the South-South there are rampant cases of kidnapping. Also the incessant wave of crime and armed robbery attacks, all point to the fact that insecurity is fast becoming a norm in Nigeria and have somewhat suddenly become attractive to certain individuals in seeking to resolve issues that could have ordinarily been settled through due process. The end-products lead to the decimation of innocent lives, disruption of economic activities, and destruction of properties among others.</p> <p>Just last year and early this year, the Emir of Kano-Alhaji Ado Bayero narrowly escaped death by the whiskers. His driver and two others were not lucky as they were hacked to death by the assailants. Somewhere in Okene, Kogi State, gunmen said to be sympathetic to the Cause of Islamic rebels in Mali were said to have ambushed and opened fire and killed two soldiers on their way to been deployed to Mali. A faceless new group known as ‘Vanguard for the Protection of Moslems in Black Africa” has claimed responsibility for this attack. Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iwela’s mother-Prof. Mrs. Kaneme Okonjo was also kidnapped a while ago. It took a demonstration of federal might-deployment of troops for her abductors to free her. Also of recent the mother of Bayelsa State House of Assembly was also kidnapped. These are prominent cases; so many other incidents go unreported probably because the victims lack a voice.</p> <p>In an interview with Guardian Newspaper in united kingdom, marking late Prof. Chinua Achebe’s 80th Birthday, he was quoted as saying, “Nigeria is on the brink of a precipice” and that “we urgently have to face up to our responsibilities before it is too late”.</p> <p>Accordingly, Ogebe (1991) observed that the current problems facing Nigeria is not the only rising incidence in crimes, but also the gradual shift in the categories of crimes committed from less serious to a more serious and heinous crimes of violence. This poses a great challenge to the police as well as raises questions of the police accountability and effectiveness.</p> <p>The Nigerian police have been highly criticized for its inability to stem the rising tide of crimes in Nigeria because of series of endemic problems in recruitment, training and discipline and lack expertise in specialized fields. Corruption and dishonesty is also widespread in the police force thereby engendering a low level of public confidence by the public, leading to failure to report crimes, and tendencies to resort to self-help by the public. Ash (1971) observed that perhaps the police performance has been entirely dissatisfactory because there is confusion concerning what police men actually do on the job and what they reasonably can be expected to do to achieve a more effective police force. The range of services that police provide are vast and crime prevention account for only 20 to 30 percent of police work. In many cities today police work often seem to consist mainly of reaction to emergencies. It sometimes appears that the original emphasis on crime prevention has been lost (Awake, 2000). This has greatly accounted for the alarming rate of crimes in the country.</p> <p>Corroborating the aforementioned, a total of sixteen (16) policemen were arrested of recent in Gusau, the Zamfara State capital by the Inspector General of Police Anti-robbery Squad for allegedly releasing Police weapons and ammunition to armed robbers terrorising people of the state. The affected police officers are from various ranks, especially Inspectors and Sergeants attached to Zamfara State Police Command. In the same vein, the squad arrested a retired military officer based in Gusau who specialized in selling ammunition and other sophisticated weapons meant for the security personnel in the state to armed robbers and people of Plateau and Kaduna States.</p> <p>Subsequently, Aside from the bad eggs in the Nigerian police force, the poor welfare of the police, military and paramilitary personnel, with lack of adequate working tools, inadequate personnel is another factor that promotes insecurity in Nigeria. Olonisakin (2008:20) captures this when he posited that the police- population ratio in Nigeria is 1:450. At a minimum, citizens ought to have easy access to the police and feel safer as a result of the protection they offer. Yet Nigeria has failed to meet the standard set by the United Nations for effective policing.</p> <p>Today the incidence of police brutality, corruption, violence murder and abuse of power has punctuated almost every aspect of the society. Armed robbery in Nigeria operate almost freely in the society, using deadly weapons without being challenged and detected by the police and where the police are dully informed, they give flimsy excuse that they do not have weapons to fight armed robbers. Even the ordinary man on the street who is expected to be supportive of the police often have serious misgiving when confronted with the massive mutual aids granted to the criminals by the police force. Apart from the aforementioned, Incidence of shooting of innocent people in retaliation to policing policies has also constituted a serious problem that has impeded police efforts in crime prevention in Nigeria.</p> <p>Research have shown that most of police work is taken up in responding to crime after it has taken place and the police force do not have the resources to intervene in the circumstances which lead to crimes being committed. The traditional approaches to crime prevention also do little to address the causes of crime. They assume that the high rate of crime is inevitable and that the public must endeavor to defend itself against it.</p> <p><strong>1.2  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Insecurity which is a feature of the Hobbesian state of nature, when life was said to be solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short, and the weak and common man lived at the mercy of the strong. This trend is exactly the case in the country today, if not close. According to Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) In his book entitled Leviathan and published in 1651, he explicitly stated that in the state of nature nothing can be considered just or unjust, and every man must be considered to have a right to all things, even the right to take other people’s lives. Hobbes says that the State of Nature is a hypothetical state of affairs existing prior to the formulation of 'society' (which arises with the signing of the hypothetical 'Social Contract').In the State of Nature, Hobbes thinks everyone acts selfishly. He calls it a war of all against all.</p> <p>The book looks at the structure of the society and legitimate government, and is regarded as one of the earliest and most influential examples of social contract theory. Leviathan ranks as a classic western work on statecraft comparable to Machiavelli's The Prince. Written during the English Civil War (1642-1651), Leviathan argues for a social contract and rule by an absolute sovereign. Hobbes wrote that civil war and situations identified with a state of nature and the famous motto Bellum omnium contra omnes (\"the war of all against all\") could only be averted by strong central government. Having rightly observed Thomas Hobbes writings, it can be said then that Nigeria’s central government is porous and weak to tackle her insecurity challenges which have been endemic and endless, that is why there have been a lot of clamor for state police in other to spread the security base of the Nation.</p> <p>Furthermore Thomas Hobbes work, explains why the police and Successive Nigerian Government see Insecurity as a bane to the Nation’s economic and political development and have at different times devised various means to curb its menace. Consequently, these various means have not yielded satisfactory result. The newest security challenge is the boko haram militant Islamist organization, which have taken numerous lives and properties. The battle between the federal government and this group began on 26 July when Boko Haram attacked a police station in retaliation for the arrest of its leaders. Police responded with their own retaliation and a curfew fell on the area. The attacks spread and by the next day corpses were located around the police stations. Nigerian troops then surrounded the home of the leader of the sect, Mohammed Yusuf in Maiduguri on 28 July after his followers barricaded themselves inside. However the worst happened when Mohammed Yusuf was later extra judiciously killed by the Nigerian police and ever since then Nigerians have not known peace.</p> <p>The socio-political implication of this development can only be imagined, given the risks and agonies survivors are currently going through.</p> <p>According to Egburonu (2012:20)</p> <p>We are afraid of Boko Haram. Daddy and Mummy keep awake all night in case the attackers decide to invade our home. They would lock all the doors tightly, pray all Night and ask us to sleep. But we never can, for we don’t know what will happen next... They said we would soon go home, so we are waiting</p> <p>That was how Miss Agnes Agwuocha, a 17-Year old student in Kano, described the terror she and the members of her family have been passing through since the terrorist group had given the affected non indigenes a mere three-day ultimatum, and since after the expiration, had followed it up with pockets of attacks and killings in Yobe, Niger, and Borno states. But though these previous Boko Haram attacks in several cities across the north have affected mainly Igbos and other Christians and southerners.</p> <p>To this end, the research work therefore intends to find out answers to the following problems identified as follows:</p> <p>i.      What are the causes and effects of insecurity in Nigeria?</p> <p>ii.    Is the Nigerian police force equipped and properly empowered</p> <p>to provide security to Nigerians?</p> <p>iii.          What are the factors that have inhibited the Nigerian police force in performing its statutory functions?</p> <p>iv.          Is the Nigerian police force relevant in combating insecurity in Nigeria?</p> <p>v.             What are the steps to be made to enhance greater security in</p> <p>Nigeria and to make the Nigeria police force more responsive to her duties?</p> <p><strong>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objectives of this study are:</p> <p>i.              To find out the specific causes and fundamental effects of</p> <p>Insecurity in Nigeria.</p> <p>ii.            To ascertain the extent to which Nigerian Police force is</p> <p>equipped and empowered to provide security to Nigerians.</p> <p>iii.           To identify the challenges that has inhibited the Nigerian</p> <p>police in performing its statutory functions.</p> <p>iv.           To explore the relevance of the Nigerian police force in</p> <p>combating insecurity in Nigeria.</p> <p>v.             To seek out solutions to insecurity in Nigeria and corrections</p> <p>that can be made to better the Nigerian police force.</p> <p><strong>1.4   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Considering the crucial role of security in any government, especially a democratically elected government, a study like this has become necessary. The task of eradicating insecurity in Nigeria is never a rosy affair but a Herculean task.</p> <p>Insecurity in Nigeria has become so widespread and has taken so many lives on the daily basis.

These two states was chosen because we believe that we can get those who really know much about the Insecurity challenges in the country and how the Nigeria police force have been able to combat it so far. In this vein, the researcher will be able to gather enough data that will definitely aid the study.</p> <p>Apart from the inability of the researcher to cover all members of the envisaged sample, the researcher faced some limitations in retrieving some of the research instruments administered to respondents especially police respondents because of the nature of their job and their general lack of appreciation of the value of social research. Also the police</p> <p>stations visited were hesitant in giving out some sensitive statistical details and information to back up the research project. All these constituted a constraint to the research endeavor.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the above noted Constraints, the researcher made tremendous effort to make the study a Success.</p>\n\nEFFECTS OF INSECURITY IN NIGERIA: THE CHALLENGES AND RELEVANCE OF THE NIGERIAN POLICE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF INSECURITY IN NIGERIA: THE CHALLENGES AND RELEVANCE OF THE NIGERIAN POLICE", "id": 35}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The inability of the Nigerian Police to control the increasing wave of crime has led to proliferation of vigilante groups in contemporary Nigeria.</p> <p>This study was initiated to investigate the impact of vigilante groups on crime control in contemporary Nigeria, particularly in Udenu L.G.A of Enugu State. Seven hundred and twenty (720) respondents were sampled from Udenu Local Government Area of Enugu State. Multi-stage, cluster and simple random sampling methods were used as the sampling techniques. Questionnaires were administered to respondents by six (6) research assistants whereas interviews were conducted with two (2) traditional rulers, chairman of Udenu L.G.A vigilante group, chairman of vigilante monitoring group and 24 vigilante group members.</p> <p>The result indicated that Nigeria Police is ineffective with regard to crime control and vigilante groups in its current form sprang up to make up for this ineffectiveness. It also showed that vigilante groups are gaining prominence as agents of crime control in contemporary Nigeria, particularly, Udenu L.G.A of Enugu State. The result equally revealed that vigilante group members are recruited and monitored through their communities and that they are effective in crime control. Also, the result indicated that the best way of solving the problem of crime in Nigeria is by increasing the activities of vigilante groups. Howbeit, lack of fire arms, poor funding, lack of patrol vehicles are the major problems confronting vigilante groups. More so, based on the major findings, it was recommended that vigilante group members should operate within the frame work of law. Finally, security committees should be established at the local government level and these committees should meet periodically to discuss security matters in their areas.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/></p> <p>Provision of adequate security is a social pre-requisite for the survival of any society. Every society takes appropriate measures to protect the lives and property of people living within its boundaries. Business and social activities may not go on freely without adequate security. This fundamental essence of security may be the reason why societies from time immemorial made efforts to police their neighbourhoods in order to secure them from criminal victimization. Security has to do with the act of preventing and protecting in order to ensure that certain facilities, equipment, persons or activities are safe from damage, pilferage, destruction, murder or disruption. The history of crime control dates back to the period when public order was the responsibility of appointed magistrates, who were unpaid private individuals. The first paid public police officer was the praeffectus urbi, a position created in Rome in approximately 27 C (Roberg and Kuykendall, 1993). After the fall of the Roman Empire and the subsequent anarchy that followed, kings began to assume the responsibility for legal administration by strengthening the night watch. Roberg and Kuykendall, (1993) also pointed out that in the twelfth century in England, through Trankpledged’ system which was based on an organization of tithings (ten families) and hundreds (ten tithings), men over the age of fifteen formed a posse comitatus, a group called out to pursue fleeing felons. Thus, the sheriffs who ensured that this Frankpledge system worked were responsible for policing the country.</p> <p>However, as societies became increasingly complex, social life was disrupted. Existing systems of law enforcement were inadequate to respond to the problems associated with these</p> <p>changes. As a result, night watch system was introduced. This system involved bellmen who walked round the city, ringing bells and providing policing services. The bellmen were later replaced by untrained citizens and much later by paid constables. However, in 1829, Sir Robert Peel established the first modern uniformed police force, the metropolitan police of London, whose primary responsibility was the prevention of crime. (Roberg and Kuykendall, 1993, Reid 5th ed..) Vigilantism is not a recent development. Before 1900, many vigilant groups were formed in frontier areas of the United States. In 1851 and 1856, concerned citizens in San Francisco organized vigilante committees that forcibly restored peace and order. (world book encyclopedia, u-v20:318, Encyclopedia Americana, vol.24:204). In south Africa, vigilante activity is frequently justified as ‘filling a policing gap’ due to police inefficiency, corruption and conspiracy with criminals, practical failing in the criminal justice system. In Sierra- Leone, vigilante activities have been explained in terms of police ineffectiveness in combating crimes (Brownyn, 2001).</p> <p>In Nigeria, vigilantism existed in the pre-colonial era. Human Right Watch and Center for law enforcement and education report, (2002) noted that “vigilante and other self - defense groups currently operating in Nigeria have roots that reach deep into the country’s history. In the colonial era, some though not all independent local communities, especially in the South east maintained their own standing Army to defend their territory against the threat of invasion from neighbouring communities. Although there was no equivalent modern day structure at that time, some parallels can be drawn between these groups which were created by local communities for their own protection, and the more recently formed self -defense groups”. This is also true in Udenu Local Government Area of Enugu State where vigilantism was used as a means of both social and crime control before the advert of colonial rule.</p> <p>The proliferation of vigilante groups in contemporary Nigeria particularly in Udenu Local Government area of Enugu State is a response to crimes and criminality that have not only increased in degree, scope and volume but also have witnessed an unprecedented change in techniques, mode of operation and sophistication between 1998 and 1999 (wake of fourth republic) and the apparent failure of the Nigeria police to rise up to the occasion. Igbo (2001:219) has stated that “the apparent failure of Nigeria police to control the increasing wave of crime has led to unilateral public action against crime and criminals in some major cities of Nigeria particularly in the South east of the country”.</p> <p>This is true in Udenu Local Government Area, where, presently, vigilante groups are used as a means of crime control due to increasing crime wave and the inability of the formal agents of crime control to bring them under control. In view of this, this study examined the contributions of vigilante groups in controlling crime in contemporary Nigeria, particularly in Udenu Local Government area of Enugu State.</p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/></p> <p>In recent years, many communities in Nigeria have witnessed crimes of various descriptions. Udenu Local Government Area of Enugu State is not an exception. Thus, crime is becoming a serious problem in contemporary Nigeria. The police who are the primary agent in the fight against crime are ineffective. Their ineffectiveness may be as a result of the fact that they are under-staffed, under-equipped, corrupt and lacked public cooperation. These have created problem of under policing in Nigeria including Udenu Local Government Area of Enugu State. Thus, violent and property crimes are committed on daily basis without detection and prosecution. Many people are being dispossessed of their valuable property and others are killed or maimed for life by armed bandits. Many people hardly sleep in their houses at night for fear of criminal victimization. Those who sleep in their houses at Night do so at their own peril. Consequently, Udenu Local Government Area has of recent been gripped by insecurity and lawlessness as armed robbery and other violent crimes reached unprecedented levels.</p> <p>Hence, this situation of insecurity and lawlessness began to affect more than just the population of Udenu Local Government Area as traders from the neighbouring communities who come to Udenu to transact business in Obollo-Afor and Orie Orba, began to stay away from these towns out of fear. As a result, business and other social activities were paralyzed.</p> <p>A local newspaper (Starlite) report captioned “Girl, 18 killed at Obollo-Afor described how Miss Ifeyinwa Ugwueje was gruesomely murdered in Oba Guest inn on Wednesday 18 November, 2006. The same newspaper reported that “at Orba in Udenu Local Government Area of Enugu State, the spirit of communalism, oneness, good rapport as well as peaceful co-existence seem to have eluded the people for some time following the rampant killings everywhere including the brutal murder of shinkaffi who was said to be a famous and powerful youth leader. (The Starlite, 2006:5 and 13).</p> <p>The increase in crime wave and the inability of the Nigeria police to deal with the situation effectively have given rise to the emergence of vigilante groups in its current form. These vigilante groups are to ensure the safety of both their lives and property and that of their families. Eke, (2002) noted that “from time immemorial, ordinary men and women have made several sacrifices to ensure the safety of both their lives and that of their families. That human impulse is not only common in Nigeria. Government in Western Europe, in Africa, and else where was originally set up to offer protection to their subjects”.</p> <p>Thus vigilantism seems to be gaining more prominence as agent of crime control in Udenu Local Government Area. Several vigilante groups now operate in both rural and urban areas in Nigeria. Residents see vigilante groups as an outfit they can always rely on in terms of security. Put differently, the public is skeptical about the ability of Nigeria Police to provide adequate security services alone without the involvement of the public.</p> <p>This study, therefore, aimed at finding out the impact of vigilante groups on crime control in Udenu L.G. A of Enugu state.</p> <p><strong>1.3     RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/></p> <p>1.       What is the rate of crime in Udenu L.G.A ?</p> <p>2.       To what extent does crime constitute a social problem in Udenu L.G.A ?</p> <p>3.       To what extent has vigilantism helped in controlling crime in Udenu L.G.A ?</p> <p>4.       To what extent have police controlled crime in Udenu L.G.A. ?</p> <p>5.       What is the relationship between the police and vigilante groups in Udenu L.G.A. ?</p> <p>6.       what is the community perception of vigilante groups in Udenu L.G.A. ?</p> <p>7.       What is the relationship between the police and the public in Udenu L.G.A. ?</p> <p><strong>1.4     OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/></p> <p>The broad objective of this study is to examine the contributions of vigilante groups in crime control in Udenu Local Government Area of Enugu State.</p> <p>The specific objectives are:-</p> <p>1.       To highlight the rate of crime in Udenu L.G.A.</p> <p>2.       To find out the extent crime constitutes a social problem in Udenu L.G.A</p> <p>3.       To determine the extent vigilantism has help in controlling crime in Udenu L.G.A</p> <p>4.       To find out the extent the police have controlled crime in Udenu L.G.A</p> <p>5.       To find out the relationship between the police and vigilante groups in Udenu L.G.A.</p> <p>6.       To determine the community perception of vigilante groups in Udenu L.G.A.</p> <p>7.       To find out the relationship between the police and the public in Udenu L.G.A.</p> <p><strong>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong>    <br/></p> <p>This study has both theoretical and practical significance.

A crucial part of an entity’s corporate governance is its internal audit function. At the same time, there has been significant public concern about the level of fraud within organizations. The purpose of this study is to assess whether organizations with an internal audit function are more likely to detect fraud than those without.the technique to be employed in testing the hypotheses is the chi-square (X2) distribution, data analysis is done with technical precision so as to avoid erroneous inferences which could affect the objective of the study. The main objective is to determine the views of the respondents on the questions contained in the questionnaires. </em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>            Financial audits may be performed for Government sectors, registered charities, some governmental and public entities certain forms of Government sectors are required to have an external audit. Government sectors typically request financial audits year after year because lenders may have required an audit or owned may want to have external unbiased eyes look at the financial statements to determine if the company is complying with all the required accounting principles charities would require a financial audit to show the financial status of the organization to potential donors. Private businesses are required to be audited by status to determine if all the money budgeted has been properly spent. Government financial reports are not always audited by outside auditor, but Government sectors are. It is the duty of the auditor to examine the financial statement and consequently form an opinion of their fairness in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. As a secondary function, it is also his duty to uncover any act of omission, which in view is fraudulent in nature. It is alarming to state here that private liability companies have become a target of the fraudsters who take advantage of the irregularities and professionalism of the Government sectors to perpetrate their nefarious deeds. There is a long list of Government sectors with publicized fraud cases in various degrees which are hundreds of millions, they include uni-petrol and Agip Company now known as Oando Company, Total company Swallowed ELF, Oceanic bank and intercontinental bank e.t.c. Even the government ministries and parastals are not spared. Auditing has over the years gone considerably to a commendable length to expose various fraudulent practices both in private and public sector. One of the primary reasons for an independent audit is the inherent potential conflict between an entity’s management and users of its financial statements. Management has an incentive to the information presented in financial statements since it is the means used to evaluate management’s performance. Management exercises a great deal of discretion in preparing financial statements and in using resources entrusted in it’s operating the entity. An audit provides reasonable assurance that management’s representations on these activities are liable. Thus, audit has value because management’s representatives on its performance and stewardship are examined and reported or by expert outside management’s control. The purpose of audit therefore, is to provide assurance to the shareholders’, bankers, creditors, government agencies and authorities, investors, and the public at large. These people need confidence that the picture of the company as given by the directors to obtain a second opinion from an expert (the auditor). Other than exposing errors and fraud and testing the reliability of a firm’s controls financial audits can alert management to weaknesses in the firm’s control as well as suggest operational improvements that could be undertaken. These are highlighted in the management letter from the auditors. Strategic systems auditors provide a top down approach to auditing by first examining a firm’s business strategy and keys to competitive advantage. </p> <p>            It has become inevitably necessary to critically evaluate the role of auditors in fraud prevention particularly in the Government sectors. It is not misleading to categorically say here that the cause of the companies’ woes and problem has its roots from the numerous fraudulent activities perpetuated by so many of the shareholders and mangers. These managers accounted for the unimaginable amount of money running into billions of naira squandered and stored away in foreign bank accounts. The most vocal of such recent cases of fraudulent acts by banks is that of five (5) bank CEO’S operated without identified values and they are Mrs. Cecilia Ibru of oceanic bank accrued 278.20 billion, Mr. Erastus Akingbola of intercontinental bank with N210.9 billion, Mr. Sebastian Adigwe of Afri bank owes N141.86 billion, Barth Ebong of Union bank owes N73.58 billion and Mr. OkeyNwosu of Fin bank recorded N42.45 billion, who had to face the music for their appropriating temporarily bank funds.</p> <p>            Since 357 of the companies and Allied matter Decree of 1990 (CAMD) requires that out registered limited liability companies both private and public must have their financial records audited annually by external auditors so appointed. It is the duty of the auditors in the cause of their work to uncover any fraudulent practice either by omission or commission. </p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>            Since the early 80’s the country has been experiencing increase fraudulent practices in Government sectors despite the fact that these companies are annually subjected to audit. The bureaucratic nature of Government sectors causes a lot of unnecessary delays, which allows enough space and time for fraud to be conceived and perpetrated. Some of the fraudsters take advantages of this set back to explore all avenues that will help them succeed in their shameful acts. Inefficiency of company staff results in improper book- keeping system and in cases where they refuse to co-operate fully with the auditor’s, vital information may elude him and consequently he is left cross road. </p> <p>            One cannot also ignore the great threat posed to be the auditor by the manipulation of money as a form of “settlement”. Nigeria’s banking sector was rocked in August, when the regulatory bank initially injected over N400 to bail out five (5) banks considered distressed. Unfortunately, IMO STATE UNIVERSITY OWERRI convocation and bank managements are generally unwilling to release details of fraud that may have been perpetrated for fear of losing their corporate image.</p> <p><strong>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong> </p> <p>       This research work is aimed at achieving the following:-</p> <p>1.  To identify the causes of fraud in Government sectors. </p> <p>2.  To examine the statutory principle of auditors in relation to fraud. </p> <p>3. To seek how the scope of present day audits can be entered to include prevention and not only discovery of fraud. </p> <p>4. To suggest solution for combating fraud in Government sectors.</p> <p><strong>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>            The role of the auditor and his influence on the decisions made by users of financial statement cannot be over emphasized. Shareholders, bankers, creditors, government agencies, and private investors’ e.t.c all rely on the auditor’s report to base their investment decisions. They require that they are not being mislead by the financial statements and this assurance be provided by the auditor (external) who in his capacity is viewed to be an expert in the impartial and above all independent. The big question remains, why is fraud on the increase in Government sectors despite the continuous audit of financial statements? The contribution of this study is to the improvement of the role of auditor’s in the prevention and total eradication of fraud in Government sectors. Audit will no longer be a periodic affair but a routine exercise which will keep every employee, not only financial staff as in case of normal audit aware that any deed within and outside the working environment is being monitored. </p> <p>            It is placed that at the end of this study, the following resultant benefits will accrue to companies, shareholders, other researchers and the Nigerian economy at large. </p> <p>(i)   Further classification on the role of auditors in fraud prevention and detection as these had been a prolonged mis conception by many that is the duty of the auditors to prevent and detect fraud. </p> <p>(ii)        Users of financial statement will after the study know whom to hold responsible for any loss/losses incurred upon reliance on audited financial statements. </p> <p>(iii)       Suggest ways to make auditors more relevant in fraud prevention and detection. </p> <p>(iv)       Further encirclement of available literature on the subject matter and other related works. </p> <p><strong>1.5    RESEARCH HYPOTHESES </strong></p> <p>            The following hypotheses were postulated as a guide to the researcher </p> <p>Hypothesis one </p> <p>Ho: Auditing cannot truly prevent fraud in public enterprises </p> <p>Hi: Auditing can prevent fraud in Government sectors</p> <p>            Hypothesis two </p> <p>Ho: Effective auditing does not control fraud. </p> <p>Hi: Effective Auditing controls fraud. </p> <p><strong>1.6   THE SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>            Fraud occurs in Government sectors with reckless abandon. This study is to cover areas as it concerns auditors (both internal and external) and fraud prevention.

Some blame it on defective family structure or arrested personality adjustment. Others emphasize factors such as inequality, environmental influence, poor socialization process (Henslin,2006). In this regards, criminal acts may be induced by many unforeseen factors and circumstances. Crime, according to Taylor (2006) could be seen as a fault of the social system whose institutions do not work equally for all its members. Sociologists look at the social in which individuals find themselves. Could it be that the problem lay not with the individual but in the social condition under which the individual live? The concern here is why people should exhibit behavior that is in violation of established norms, violations that may ultimately result in their being labeled as criminal behavior in terms of social processes.</p> <p>Mostly, persons known to commit street crimes as reported in the crime index are poor, uneducated, often unemployed and residents of low income neighborhoods (Anasi, 2010). Would a socially and economically sound person turn out to be criminal? In this research work, there is need to understand the socio-economic background of most juvenile and criminals in order to draw correlations or otherwise between low socio-economic status (poverty) and criminal behavior.</p> <p><strong>1.2   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/></p> <p>The objectives of this study include the following:</p> <p><strong>1.                          </strong>To  give an empirical analysis of the role of poverty on criminal behavior.</p> <p>ii.                          To  examine the circumstances that make youths participate in crime.</p> <p>iii.                        To  find out why crime participation is high in certain areas and among certain             groups in the</p> <p>society.</p> <p>iv.                        To identify some ways in which the society can be able to tackle the problem of crimes.</p> \n\nAN ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT OF POVERTY ON CRIMINAL BEHAVIOUR AMONG YOUTHS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT OF POVERTY ON CRIMINAL BEHAVIOUR AMONG YOUTHS", "id": 38}]
