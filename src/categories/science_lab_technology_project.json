[{"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study was conducted to assess the relationship between fake drug (FD) use and people’s attitude towards healthcare delivery system (HCDS). Participants (n = 103) were both healthcare providers (56) and consumers (47). 36 were males and 67 were females above eighteen years. They were selected through a random sampling technique. The mean ages were 37.2, 34.2 and 42.8 for all the participants, female participants and male participants respectively. All testing took place in Onitsha General Hospital, Community Pharmacies, medical Laboratories and classroom environments in Onitsha urban. Results revealed significant relationships (r = 0.6, p &lt; 0.05). People’s attitude (selection, organization, and interpretation of health related information to form a meaningful picture of their health care needs) were considerably affected by the use of FD in HCDS.</p> </div> <div> <p> <strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The usefulness of a good health care delivery system to any population is an obvious fact that cannot be over emphasized. A healthy individual is a valuable asset not only to himself, to his family, but also to his society.</p> <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) (1948) defined <strong>health</strong> as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.</p> <p>In 1986, the WHO in the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion said health is \"a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living. Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities.\" Overall health is achieved through a combination of physical, mental, emotional, and social well-being.</p> <p>To achieve an overall health, we need health care delivery systems (HCDS) that can provide high quality medical care, that are responsive to the health needs and expectations of the populations they are intended to serve, and at affordable costs.</p> <p>On the other hand, the efforts geared toward achieving overall health, that is, <strong>health care</strong> <strong>delivery </strong>is the prevention, treatment, and management of illness and the preservation of mentaland physical well-being through the services offered by the medical, nursing, pharmaceutical, dental, clinical laboratory sciences and allied health professions (Wikipedia, 2009).</p> <p>According to WHO, health care delivery embraces all the goods and services designed to promote health, including “preventive, curative and palliative interventions, whether directed to individuals or to populations”. The organized provision of such services constitutes a <strong>health care</strong> <strong>delivery system</strong>. When fake drugs are used in health care delivery the main purpose of healthcare delivery system, which is an overall health will not be achieved.</p> <p>The relationship between fake drug use in healthcare delivery system and how people perceive health care delivery system will better be appreciated by looking at the levels of health care delivery systems. All health care systems contain four essential levels of care (Lunde, 1990):</p> <p>1.  Lay self-care</p> <p>2.  Primary professional care.</p> <p>3.  General specialist care, that is, secondary care.</p> <p>4.  Super specialist care, that is, tertiary care.</p> <p>And there is a fifth level of care – quaternary care.</p> <p>The WHO defines <strong>self – care</strong> as “activities individuals, families, and communities undertake with the intention of enhancing health, preventing disease, limiting illness, and restoring health. These activities are derived from knowledge and skills from the pool of both professional and lay experience. They are undertaken by lay people on their own behalf, either separately or in participative collaboration with professionals.” The skills and knowledge of self – care will be manifested in an individual’s ability to take appropriate action(s) to achieve overall health. Such actions include the ability to know when to seek for professional care, gather information on what type of care to seek for and where to get desired medical service.</p> <p> Reports of the media (print and electronic), and lay information on incidences and effects of fake drugs can influence an individual’s decision on how to access health care. Therefore, it becomes necessary to determine the relationship between fake drug use in HCDS and how such use affects people’s perception of HCDS.</p> <p> <strong>Primary health care </strong>(PHC) as defined in Alma – Ata Declaration (1978), is essential health carebased on practical, scientifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that the community and the country can afford to maintain at every stage of their development in the spirit of self-determination.</p> <p>Primary health care is promotive, preventive, and rehabilitative. Health services based on PHC include at least immunization against the major infectious diseases: measles, whooping cough, diphtheria, polio, tetanus, and tuberculosis and other components of National Health Policy.</p> </div> <div> <p>When fake vaccines were used and no immunity conferred on the immunized, such individuals would be highly disposed to developing the specific disease.</p> <p>The term <strong>secondary health care</strong> is a service provided by medical specialists who generally do not have first contact with patients, for example, cardiologists, urologists and dermatologists. A physician might voluntarily limit his or her practice to secondary care by refusing patients who have not seen a primary care provider first, or a physician may be required, usually by various payment agreements, to limit the practice this way (Wikipedia, 2009).</p> <p><strong>Tertiary health care </strong>is a specialized consultative care, usually on referral from primary orsecondary health care personnel, by specialists working in a centre that has personnel and facilities for special investigation or diagnosis and treatment ( Wikipedia, 2008).</p> <p><strong>Quaternary health Care </strong>–Quaternary health care is the advanced level of medicines which arehighly specialized and not widely used (Intota, 2009). It is the provision of health care to patients in cardiac care, orthopedic, neurosciences, oncology, renal care, and so forth.</p> <p>Given the present situation in Nigeria, the environment is intensely stressful and virtually everyone's health is dangerously threatened in one way or another. In periods like this, our health care delivery system should provide relief to Nigerians, so many of whom are daily on edge (Adelusi-Adeluyi, 1995). Unfortunately, this painful situation has been compounded by the use of fake drugs in our health care delivery. It is worthwhile to note that decisions as to the genuineness of drugs one consumes, appropriateness and competence of both the health care facilities and personnel deserve a great attention.</p> <p>In Nigeria, because of chaotic drug distribution, possibility of one becoming a victim of counterfeit drugs is very high. After all, it is more difficult to secure a house with over a thousand doors than the one with one or two doors. There are so many handlers (intermediaries) in drug distribution in Nigeria. Each intermediary is a potential entry point for fake drugs.</p> <p>According to WHO (2006), “a counterfeit drug is one which is deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled with respect to identity and / or source. Counterfeiting can apply to both branded and generic products and counterfeit products may include products with the correct ingredients or with the wrong ingredients, without active ingredients, with insufficient active ingredients or with fake packing.” In the Nigerian counterfeit and Fake Drugs and Unwholesome Processed Foods (Miscellaneous Provisions) Decree 1993 as amended, a fake drug is defined as</p> <p>“a. Any drug or drug product which is not what it purports to be;  or</p> <p>b. Any drug or drug product which is so colored, coated, powdered or    polished that the damage is concealed or which is made to appear to be better or of greater therapeutic value than it really is, which is not labeled in the prescribed manner or which label or container or anything accompanying the drug bears any statement, design or device which makes false claim for the drug or which is false or misleading; or</p> <p>c.  Any drug or drug product whose container is so made, formed or filled as to be misleading; or</p> <p>d.   Any drug product whose label does not bear adequate directions for use and such adequate warning against use in those pathological conditions or by children where its use may be dangerous to health or against unsafe dosage or methods or duration of use; or</p> <p> e.    Any drug product which is not registered by the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) in accordance with the provisions of the Food, Drugs and related products (Registration, etc).</p> <p> The consumption of counterfeit drugs is worst error that can occur in HCDS. It is an error because both the health care provider and consumer do not know they are using the wrong drug. Fake drugs are eroding both the essence of health care delivery system (HCDS) and confidence people have in the system. Counterfeiters are into everything the pharmaceutical industry produces – from life saving drugs, for example, HIV/AIDS, antituberculosis, anticancer, antidiabetic, antihypertensive to recreational drugs. The existence and functionality of our HCDS is being threatened, as many pharmaceutical manufacturers who spend large amounts of money on research, production and supply of genuine drugs are being edged out of business by fake drug manufacturers.</p> <p>The relationship between fake drugs and people’s perception of health care delivery system can be looked at from two perspectives:</p> <p> Health care consumers’ perspective</p> </div> <div> <p> Health care providers’ perspective</p> </div> <div> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Counterfeit drugs are believed to be poisonous, toxic, threats to life, health risks, without therapeutic usefulness, with insufficient therapeutic benefits; and can cause treatment failures, death, disease complications, worsening of disease conditions, development of drug resistance, delayed recovery and human organ damage. Because of these effects, the confidence of both the health care professionals and consumers in our health care delivery system is in doubt.</p> <p>In the past, Nigerian government through her regulatory agencies such as NAFDAC had made serious efforts toward solving this problem. The regulatory agencies have increased public awareness on fake drugs, ensured that drugs in use in Nigeria are approved and registered, known fake drug manufacturers are banned from marketing their products in Nigeria, re-inspection of production facilities to ensure that such facilities still conform to appropriate standards, and persons caught with fake drugs were made to pay heavy penalties. Also, the agencies have interacted with some foreign governments to ensure that such countries’ pharmaceutical industries export to Nigeria only genuine products.</p> <p>This study will investigate the relationship between fake drug use in health care delivery system and people’s perception of health care delivery system.</p> <p><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong> </p> <p>We might have heard, we might have observed, and we might have read reports on problems of fake drugs. Unfortunately, what is known to the public as regards to the problem of fake drugs is a tip of the ice bag. The true situation is far from known or reported. The cause(s) of most deaths are not identified or confirmed through autopsy.</p> <p>But how do these problems affect people’s perception of our health care delivery system? This question is what this study intends to answer.</p> </div> <div> <p> <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p> It is my belief that this study will</p> <ol><li>Increase the level of commitment of people to their health care needs.</li> </ol><ol><li>Motivate people to ensure that the quality of drugs, health care services and qualification of their health care providers are as prescribed and regulated by government.</li> </ol><p>3. Encourage people to acquire self – care knowledge and skills that they need to</p> <p>participate more actively in fostering their own health and in shaping conditions that influence their own health.</p> </div>\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FAKE DRUGS AND PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN ONITSHA URBAN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FAKE DRUGS AND PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN ONITSHA URBAN", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Wine can be produced from paw-paw carioca papaya.

The results showed that cucumber have the moisture content of 96% and spinach 95%, fat content 2.4% on cucumber while spinach leaves 4.6%, crude fiber content on cucumber 44% and spinach 41.5%, Ash content of cucumber 99% and spinach leaves 138.9 respectively. Base on these finding, cucumbers and spinach are good source of vitamins and minerals needed for building of the body.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0     </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     </strong><strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Spinach is vegetable fruit which can be produce fresh. Many fruits that are in a botanical sense are true fruits that are actually treated as vegetables, these culinary vegetables include cucurbits, e.g (Squash, cucumber and spinach). The spinach is thought to have originated in India -where it is found wild and is cultivated in many diverse forms. Accessions of cucumis satinus L. Var hardwickl is related to the original ancestors of the spinach Maynard et al., (2000). Secondary centers of diversity for the spinach exist in China and near east. Species are cucumis hystrix from China and the African. Cucumis hystrix from china and the African cucumis, such as cucumber (Spinach and Wild relative (Douglas et al., 2010).</p> <p>Spinach and cucumber were probably domesticated in Asia and then introduces in the 1700s. Cucumbers were brought to America by Christopher Columbus. The spinach is grown for its fruit which are eaten fresh or picked in most countries but which are also eaten fried. Bater et al (1990) slicing and picking of spinach and cucumber fruits are mostly water but they provide some vitamin A and C, especially when picked with dill and other species. Spinach and cucumber are the ideal food for people having trouble with body weight because it is mostly water and some fibers and few calories cucumber cause barging and mild stomach upset in people when eaten raw but not when soaked in vinegar or pickled before eating.</p> <p>Spinach (Spinacia Oleracea) is an edible following plant in the family of Amaranthaceae. It is native to central and south western Asia. It is an annual plant (rarely biennia), which grows to a height of up to 30cm. Spinach may leaves are alternate, simple, ovate to triangular-based, very variable in size from about 2 – 30cm long and 1.15cm broad, with large leaves at the base of the plant and small leaves higher on the flowering stem. The flowers are inconspicuous. Yellow green, 3 – 4mm diameter maturing into a small, hard, dry, lumpy fruit eluster 5 – 10mm across containing several seeds )Common spinach, spinacia oleracea, was long considered to be in the chinopodiaceae family, but in 2003 the chinopodiaceae family was combined with the Amarantuaceae family under the family name ‘Amarantuaceae’ in the order caryophyllaes.</p> <p>Within the Amaratuaceae family there are now a subfamily Amaratuoldeae and a subfamily chenopodioideae, for the amaratus and the chenopods, respectively (Rosemary et al, 1995).</p>\n\nPROXIMATE COMPOSITION AND ANALYSIS OF CUCUMBER AND SPINACH LEAVES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROXIMATE COMPOSITION AND ANALYSIS OF CUCUMBER AND SPINACH LEAVES", "id": 3}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>PRODUCTION OF BAR SOAP</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p> The Production of Bar Soap is aimed at producing a cleansing agent which is capable of removing stains or dirt in man and his environment so as to reduce the population size of pathogenic micro-organisms. Soaps are salts of fatty acids. It is obtained by treating oils and fats with a strong alkaline solution. This brings about a chemical reaction called saponification, which is the mixture of alkali with fats to form crude soap. A mixture of the strong alkali solution (caustic soda) and water was poured into a bowl containing oil which stirred continuously until saponification occurred in the mixture. Then, other necessary ingredients were added to the mixture and was stirred to ensure thorough mixing of the solution. The mixture was poured into a mould and was allowed to cool and solidify. It was removed from the mould after solidification and was cut in bars. The product served the specific function of cleansing as it can be used domestically, industrially and otherwise to proffer hygiene good health and long lasting of objects.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>Title page         -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       i</p> <p>Certification    -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       ii</p> <p>Dedication       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       iii</p> <p>Acknowledgement   -       -       -       -       -       -       -       iv</p> <p>Abstract  -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       v</p> <p>Table of contents     -       -       -       -       -       -       -       vi</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.0      Introduction    -       -       -       -       -       -       -       1</p> <p>1.1      Background of the study        -       -       -       -       1</p> <p>1.2      Aims of the study    -       -       -       -       -       -       4</p> <p>1.3      Significance of the study         -       -       -       -       5</p> <p>1.4      Statement of the Research problems      -       -       5</p> <p>1.5      Limitations of study        -       -       -       -       -       7</p> <p>1.6      Definition of terms -       -       -       -       -       -       7</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p>2.1      Literature Review    -       -       -       -       -       -       9</p> <p>2.2      Functions and uses of Bar Soap    -       -       -       14</p> <p>2.3      Types of soap   -       -       -       -       -       -       -       16</p> <p>2.4      Properties of soap    -       -       -       -       -       -       18</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p> <p>3.0   Materials and methodology    -       -       -       -       21</p> <p>3.1      Materials         -       -       -       -       -       -       -       21</p> <p>3.2      Chemistry of soap production        -       -       -       22</p> <p>3.3      Production procedure     -       -       -       -       -       23</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></p> <p>4.0      Results and Analysis      -       -       -       -       -       27</p> <p>4.1      Results    -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       27</p> <p>4.2      Chemical Analysis of soap      -       -       -       -       28</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></p> <p>5.0      Summary, Recommendation and conclusion        31</p> <p>5.1      Summary        -       -       -       -       -       -       -       31</p> <p>5.2      Recommendation    -       -       -       -       -       -       32</p> <p>5.3      Conclusion      -       -       -       -       -       -       -       33</p> <p>References       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       35</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0     </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE SUBJECT MATTER</strong></p> <p>Soap has been a product with over a 5000 years history. It has remained an essential ingredient in modern living. It is used daily for medicinal and for laundry purposes; for household cleansing and for personal hygiene. There is an ongoing demand for bar soap as a cleaning agent despite the rolls made by modern detergents and soap powders (Barthelemy, 1883).</p> <p>Industrial manufactured bar soaps first became available in the late eighteenth century. This happened when advertising campaigns in Europe and the United States, promoted popular awareness of the relationship between cleanliness and health. Until recently, the production of bar soap remained a primitive art, its manufacture being essentially the treatment of fat with alkali, a chemical process which is the same whether the production is done in a backyard or in a factory. The simplicity of the process of production of soap has led to is world wide practice as a small business operation.</p>\n\nPRODUCTION OF BAR SOAP<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PRODUCTION OF BAR SOAP", "id": 4}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>COMPARATIVE ESTIMATION OF ASCORBIC ACID CONTENT IN SOME NGERIA FRUITS VIZ: (ORANGE) CITRUS SINESIS,(PINEAPPLE) ANANAS COSMOSUS</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>A comparative analysis of the ascorbic acid (vitamin C) content of some Nigerian fruits were carried out.

It can also be defined as organic compounds which occur in natural foodstuffs, either as such or as utilizable precursors, and which are necessary usually in minute’s amounts, for normal growth maintenance, reproduction and health in animals.</p> <p>They differ from other organic compounds of the diet in that they do not enter in to the structure of tissues (at least in the normal sense, although certain of them may function by stabilizing the integrity of cell membranes) nor do they undergo metabolism to provide energy. The discovering of vitamins the so-called accessory food factors is one of the great achievements of the 20th century. This great contribution to the science of animal and human nutrition was, in the main, conceived in terms of some what nebulous food principles brought to function in terms of modern chemistry and production virtually with the spam of one generation. Although nutritional deficiency diseases such as scurry and rickets has been down for centuries, their causes were either unknown or wrapped in mystery and also their treatment remain empirical.</p> <p>However, even in the 18th and 19th centuries, it was recognized that some diseases were related to diet.</p> <p>Dumes J.B.A (18000 to 1884) seems to have been the first practical scientist to question the adequacy of human diet based solely on protein, fats, carbohydrates and minerals. By 1900, several scientists all over the world carried out experiments that led to the conclusion that purified diets were unable to support life and production in animals as diverse as rats, chicks and dogs. It seemed clear that certain foodstuffs must contain small amount of substances essential for vital processes.</p> <p>In 1906, Hoiptins F.G in Cambridge, England stated this idea in clear scientific terms. The classic work of Eijkman on rice and of Osborn and Mendel on milk eventually led Funk, in 1902, to propound, for the fruit time, the theory that beriberi, scurvy, pellagra and perhaps rickets were nutritional diseases caused by a lack of special substances which are of the nature of organic bases, which were called vitamins.</p>\n\nCOMPARATIVE ESTIMATION OF ASCORBIC ACID CONTENT IN SOME NGERIA FRUITS VIZ: (ORANGE) CITRUS SINESIS,(PINEAPPLE) ANANAS COSMOSUS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMPARATIVE ESTIMATION OF ASCORBIC ACID CONTENT IN SOME NGERIA FRUITS VIZ: (ORANGE) CITRUS SINESIS,(PINEAPPLE) ANANAS COSMOSUS", "id": 5}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>BACTERIAL CONTAMINATION ASSOCIATED WITH POULTRY FEEDS FROM THREE DIFFERENT COMPANIES (VITAL FEED, GUINEA AND TOP FEED)</strong></p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>Title page         -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       i</p> <p>Certification    -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       ii</p> <p>Dedication       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       iii</p> <p>Acknowledgement   -       -       -       -       -       -       -       iv</p> <p>Table of content      -       -       -       -       -       -       -       vi</p> <p>List of table             -       -       -       -       -       -       -       vii</p> <p>Abstract -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       viii</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE:</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0  INTRODUCTION   -      -      -      -      -      -      1</strong></p> <p>1.1      Objective of study   -       -       -       -       -       -       3</p> <p>1.2      Aims of study -       -       -       -       -       -       -       3</p> <p>1.3      Statement of problem     -       -       -       -       -       3</p> <p>1.4      Limitation of the study   -       -       -       -       -       4</p> <p>1.5      Significance of study       -       -       -       -       -       4</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO:</strong></p> <p><strong>2.0  LITERATURE REVIEW -             -      -      -      5</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE:</strong></p> <p><strong>3.0  MATERIALS AND METHODS  18</strong></p> <p>3.1      Materials (see appendix)         -       -       -       -       18</p> <p>3.2      Methods -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       18</p> <p>3.2.1        Sterilization        -       -       -       -       -       -       18</p> <p>3.2.2        Sources of sample       -       -       -       -       -       18</p> <p>3.2.3        Preparation of media -       -       -       -       -       19</p> <p>3.2.4        Preparation of sample         -       -       -       -       19</p> <p>3.2.5        Gram staining and microscopic -       -       20</p> <p>3.2.6        Biochemical test for identification of bacterial isolates     -       -       -    -       -       -       -       21</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR:</strong></p> <p><strong>4.0  RESULTS       -      -      -      -      -                    23</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE:</strong></p> <p><strong>5.0  </strong><strong>DISCUSSION CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 28</strong></p> <p>5.1   Discussion      -       -       -       -       -       -       -       28</p> <p>5.2   Conclusion      -       -       -       -       -       -       -       30</p> <p>5.3   Recommendations  -       -       -       -       -       -       31</p> <p>References       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       32</p> <p>Appendix-       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       35</p> <p><strong>LIST OF TABLE</strong></p> <p>Table 1:   Plate count of bacterial from the three different feed samples examined                         23</p> <p>Table 2:   Preliminary identification of bacterial</p> <p>Isolates                                                    24</p> <p>Table 3:   Biochemical tests for the identification of bacterial isolates for the three different poultry feed                                                            25</p> <p>Table 4:   Average count per ml and types of bacterial isolated from the three different poultry  feed 27</p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The bacteria contamination associated with poultry feeds from three different companies (vital, Guinea, and Top) were studied using streak plate techniques.

To ascertain the microbial safety of poultry feeds, to identify the bacterial types and to determine the microbial load of poultry feed. The microbial mean count was highest in vital feed as 1700 per ml followed by Guinea feed having mean count of 1490 per ml and least microbial mean count was got in top feed. Having 1070 per ml. The study revealed <em>Staphylococcus</em><em>aureus</em> as the most predominant bacteria organism. Followed by<em>Salmonella</em> <em>typhi,</em> The next bacterial organism isolated was<em>Bacillus cereus </em>with and the least was <em>Pseudomonas</em> <em>aeruginus</em>. Also vital feed has the highest isolation of <em>Staphylococcus</em><em>aureus.</em> The result showed that the poultry feeds in general had bacterial contamination.</p> <p>But the microbial load was minimal increasing with decrease in acidity.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE:</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0  INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Poultry are collection of birds raised domestically for meat, egg and feathers, chickens, clucks, turkeys and geese are fowl and squabs are chiefly of local interest. These birds are source of income and food to the rarer. In the past, only hens that could no longer produce eggs were killed and sold for meat but by the mid – 20th century, meat production had outstripped egg. Production as a specialized industry (Barnes, K. 1993)</p> <p>Today, poultry production in the country is increasing at a tremendous rate and yet cannot meet the demand because of population growth and the awareness created by the campaigns for the need of animal protein in the diet</p> <p>There are different types of feeds given to poultry birds depending on the purpose, these different types are the breeders, starters, growers and layers feeds. The percentage of each ingredient in the feed varies depending on the type of feed. The ingredient includes ground yellow corn, ground oats.</p> <p>Poultry have been found to be susceptible to infection due to certain microorganisms and man may be secondarily infected through heavy contaminated food such as poultry meat and eggs. Microorganisms that contaminate feed include,<em>Enterobacter, Escherichia coli, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Salmonella, Shigella, Probidence,</em> (Leonard, 1981).</p> <p><strong>1.6     </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objective of this study is to ascertain the microbial safety of poultry feeds production by companies (Vital, Guinea, and Top).</p> <p><strong>1.7     </strong><strong>AIMS OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>To isolate bacteria that contaminant poultry feeds.</p> <p><strong>1.8     </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Poultry feed is known to contain <em>Salmonella </em>and other microorganisms.

(Mead, 1993) This is due to the relatively high contamination with various food-borne infection agents present on and in the product. More than 27 different species of bacteria have been isolated from normal, ready to cook, poultry meat a large number of publications incriminate poultry as origin of food-borne infection out-breaks.</p> <p>Modern production facilities for poultry tend to be large and intensive. A very large number of birds are maintained in each production unit. Under these conditions, it is nearly impossible to present the spread of a microorganism (such as Salmonella, Listeria, and Campylobacter) are aimed, inter-alias, towards prevention of the infection or colonization of the birds on the farm by various means of inhibiliting possible entrances of disease producing agents into the farm. High priority is given to decontamination of poultry feed, since all means employed to prevent infection will fail unless a supply of decontaminated feed is ensured.</p> <p>The role of animal feed as a vector of pathogenic microorganisms, in particular Salmonella has been well documented in the literature of the last decades, (Lapidot 1998). Feed ingredients of animals origin, such as fish meal, meat and bone meats, slaughter ofals and feather meals are reported to be usually contaminated. However, ingredients of plant origin, such as oil-seed lake meals, are also reported to be contaminated, albeit at a relatively lower frequency.</p>\n\nBACTERIAL CONTAMINATION ASSOCIATED WITH POULTRY FEEDS FROM THREE DIFFERENT COMPANIES (VITAL FEED, GUINEA AND TOP FEED)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " BACTERIAL CONTAMINATION ASSOCIATED WITH POULTRY FEEDS FROM THREE DIFFERENT COMPANIES (VITAL FEED, GUINEA AND TOP FEED)", "id": 6}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>NATURAL RESOURCES, THEIR IMPORTANCE AND WAYS OF CONSERVATION</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Natural resources are nature’s gift to man, to maintain comfortable and peaceful life. Human beings have the responsibility of conserving the resources by taking the right steps. This will help to maintain the environmental balance and satisfy the needs to the fullest. For this reason it is important to convey to people by arranging seminar and conference, in order to educate the public by environmental experts. Fast depletion of the resources such as forests, natural gas, wildlife, oil, petrol etc is the biggest concern. The reason for this depletion is the improper and excessive use and the growing population, that put a tremendous strain on the nature. A planned and prudent use can protect the resources from getting extinct. A nation resource often determines its wealth and status in the world economic system, by determining its political influence. Resource are known as capital converted to commodity inputs to infrastructural capital processes. A wide range of industrial material and biological material from plant and animal, directly or indirectly are used in production and in manufacturing of medicine.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.0      <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>       Natural Resources can be defined as what occur in nature in original untouched form, unless man disturbed it. Natural resources consist of all things that do not come under man-made creations. It can also be referred to those resources that are seen around the environment that take its form without human intervention. The earth is abound at with different natural resources which develop out of the natural environmental surrounding such as rivers,, mountains, precious stone and mineral (Sourabh, 2012).</p> <p>       The natural resources of a country influence not only the economic growth, but also the economic structure. The type of natural resources available in a country sequel to its quantity, quality and distribution within the different regions of the country determine the type and scale of industries that can be developed. It also increases the economic growth in terms of rise in market productivity which enhances economic and social-wellbeing of people (Robert,1997).</p> <p>       The growth rate of the country’s economy is determined by how human activities and institution try to conserve and manage the resources found in the country. Management refers to the decision taken on a daily basis in the use of natural resources, its harvest and utilization and how it affects the long term sustainability of the resources. This involves the proper monitoring of the resources in respect to present needs and future use. When natural resources are wisely used in a sustainable manner, it gives a tremendous potential to accelerate economic development (Sourabh,2012).</p> <p>       To control and maintain economic development and social-wellbeing of the people, there must be some laws that guild the use of natural resources. The Federal Environmental Protection Agency Decree Number 59 of 1992 gave a comprehensive national policy for protection of the natural environment. The impact of the policy brought about the assessment and designing of any development project by the Environmental Agency (Babangida, 1992).</p> <p>       The constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as the National Legal Order, recognizes the importance of improving and protecting the environment and made provision for it. Relevant sections in section 20 made it an objective of the Nigerian State to improve and protect air, land, water, forest and wildlife of Nigeria (Terry,2001).</p> <p>       Natural Resources in Nigeria that need to be protected can be found in different regions and locations. Some of the States where oil and gas are found are Cross-River, Rivers State, Akwa-Ibom, Imo, Delta etc,. Coal is found in Enugu, Cocoa is found in Ondo and Iron is found in Ajaokuta. Cement is found in Nkalagu, Kwekoro, Calaba etc, (Roosvelt, 1993).</p> <p><strong>CHPATER TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>TYPES AND BENEFITS OF NATURAL RESOURCES</strong></p> <p><strong>2.1  TYPES OF NATURAL RESOURCES</strong></p> <p>Forest Resources, Timber</p> <p>Animal Resources</p> <p>Land Resources</p> <p>Water Resources</p> <p>Air, Wind Energy</p> <p>Sunlight, Tidal Energy</p> <p>Precious Stone such as Gold, Diamond</p> <p>Lime Stone, cement, gravel</p> <p>Fossil fuel such as coal, petroleum, natural gas</p> <p><strong>       Classification of Natural Resources: </strong>can bedone in different criteria, such as the basis of origin. The two categories of resources are biotic and abiotic resources. Biotic resources extracted from the biosphere can be obtained in the raw forms or by means of cultivation through agriculture. Most of the biotic resources are non-renewable in nature, such as petroleum and natural gas which formed through years of decomposition of organic matters. The organic matter can be known as the remains of plants and animal. Examples of biotic resources are Timber, Petroleum, Fruits, Natural gas and wax etc, (Thompson,, 2003).</p> <p>       Abiotic resources are the non-living and non-organic materials which are in different forms, such as crud, coal, diamond, air, water, gravel, salt, etc. Natural resources can also be classified in a manner that helps to know the fast-depleting nature of the resources. Some natural resources can be renewed while some cannot be renewed. The renewable resources are the ones that can be produced again such as plants and animals. Whereas non-renewable resources are those which cannot be produced again, such as fossilfuel timber etc, (Darner, 2009).</p> <p>       Natural Resources can be classified on the basis of the stage of development which is known as potential resources. Potential resources are those that exist in region and may be used in the future. An example of such is mineral oil, that are found in sedimentary rocks, but until the time it is dilled out and put into use, it remains a potential resources. Most of the resources are materials in the environment which have the potential to satisfy human needs, but there is no appropriate technological means to access it. These resources are hydrogen and oxygen which are two inflammable gasses present in water, but there is no technology to use it from water (Sourabh,2012).</p> <p><strong>2.2  BENEFITS OF NATURAL RESOURCES</strong></p> <p>Natural resources provide and solve daily needs of man such as clothing, shelter, and food, through farming and rearing of animal for domestic and commercial uses. Man can earn, invest and save money from farm produce. Agricultural productivity have unlimited access to improved proper managed irrigation (Lekwa, 1996).</p> <p>       Proper managed irrigation makes agriculture an unseasonal phenomenon and this enhance sufficient production of agricultural goods such as crops, grains, nuts, rubber. Natural resources also contribute immensely to the boosting up of the national economy in the sense that the national income is increased. Examples of such product are cocoa, rubber, coal, wild managa etc, which can be exported to foreign countries. The availability of such product in the country will also attract foreign investors and this create employment opportunities (Terry,2001).</p> <p>       There are different variety of natural resources which can be used in different ways. Most plants and animals have medicinal value that can be used to manufacture drugs. A significant proportion of drugs are derived directly or indirectly from biological source that are found in natural compound from plants and animals. Medicinal drugs derived from natural souces make important global contribution to health care of the people. Many of these natural chemicals cannot be manufactured synthetically (Heasman, et al 1985).</p>\n\nNATURAL RESOURCES, THEIR IMPORTANCE AND WAYS OF CONSERVATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " NATURAL RESOURCES, THEIR IMPORTANCE AND WAYS OF CONSERVATION", "id": 7}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>DETERMINATION OF CYANIDE CONTENTS IN CASSAVA</strong></p> <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p>The cyanide Levels in two cassava varieties and some derived products was investigated.

In addition the sampling of derived products was carried out by product types (chip dried, Garri and flour). Cyanide Contents were determined. Results showed that whatever the variety considered, there was no significant difference between the total HCN content in cassava slices (1/4; ½ ; ¾ ). Similarly, results from different layers did not highlight radial variability of the total HCN content. The variable cyanide content (MgHCN/kg fresh material) in cassava varieties showed:104.3 ±3.9;171.6±5.4 for Kombo and Nwangbisi respectively. The detoxification processes (gari and flour) indicated a reduction rate in excess of 80% and may be effective to reduce cyanide content in cassava root down to a tolerable level (&lt; 50mgh/kg).  </p> <p><strong>TABLE CONTENT</strong></p> <p>Title Page                                                       i</p> <p>Certification                                                    ii</p> <p>Dedication                                                      iii</p> <p>Abstract                                                         iv</p> <p>Table of content                                              v</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.1 Introduction                                              1</p> <p>1.2 Aim of the study                                        3    </p> <p>1.3 Statement of problem                                 3</p> <p>1.4 Significance of the study                             4</p> <p>1.5 Limitations of the study                              5</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p>2.0 Literature Review                                       6</p> <p>2.1 Cyanide toxicity                                         6</p> <p>2.2 Effect of Chronic exposure to cyanigenic glycoside containing food stuffs                                            7 2.3 Biochemical basis for Cyanide poisoning                 8</p> <p>2.4 Cyanide as plant defence mechanism                10</p> <p>2.5 Methods for reducing or elementary Cyanide Exciting                                                              11</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p> <p>3.0 Experimental Design                                             13</p> <p>3.2 Preparation of derived products                       13</p> <p>3.3 Samples preparation and Cyanide measurements                                                                         15</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></p> <p>Results and Discussion                                    </p> <p>4.1 Total Cyanide contents in cassava slices and varities                                                             20</p> <p>4.2 Total Cyanide contents in Cassava layers                22</p> <p>4.3 Cyanide contents in cassava and some derived products                                                               24</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></p> <p>5.1 Conclusion                                                   27</p> <p>5.2 Recommendation                                       28</p> <p>Reference                                                       29         </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.1      <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is an extensively cultivated tuber crop and a staple food for millions of people in the tropical regions of Africa, Latin America and Asia. Globally, in terms of annual production, it is the fifth most important food crop after maize, rice, wheat and potato. Despite all the usefulness of cassava, its use as a food source is limited by its perishability, its low protein content and its potential toxicity. Cassava contains two cyanogenic glucosides, linamarin and a small amount of Lotaustralin, which are catalytically hydrolyzed to release toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN) when tine plant tissue is crushed. Several varieties of cassava have been identified and grouped into bitter and sweet depending on the quantity of Linamarin in the tuber. The consumption of cassava and its derived products which contain Large amounts of HCN may be responsible for such visible manifestations as goiter and cretinism, tropical ataxic neuropathy,(Bradbury, 2004).</p> <p>In some countries such as cote d’ivoire, Benin and Nigeria, people have quickly recognized the need to transform cassava into derived products (fufu, Garri, Tapioca) whose gain is usually higher than the fresh roots. The processing methods used traditionally are sun drying, soaking and fermentation followed by cooking. These processing methods could lead to reduce the cyanide content in cassava products to improve its palatability and convert it into a storable form, Ernesto <em>et al</em>, (1998).</p> <p>The aim of this study was to estimate the rate of cyanide in three cassava varieties and assess some cassava detoxification processes.       </p> <p>1.2      <strong>AIM OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of the study is as follows:</p> <p>i.            To estimate the rate of cyanide in three cassava varieties.</p> <p>ii.           To assess some cassava detoxification processes.</p> <p>1.3      <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM.</strong></p> <p>Liberation of hydrogen HCN and cyanogenic glycosides (CNGs) usually occurs after mastication and ingestion and arises from enzymatic degradation of the Latter to produce HCN. Resulting in acute or chronic cyanide poisoning.</p> <p>Problems associated with chronic exposure to food containing cyanogenic glycosides (CNGs) have been linked to several diseases primarily affecting the central nervous system. Tropical ataxic neuropathy (TAN) describes several neurological symptoms affecting the mouth. Goitre and cretinism attributed to iodine deficiency can be exacerbated by chronic consumption of inadequately processed cassava. Cyanogenic glycoside are converted to thiocyanate during the detoxification process, which reacts with iodine which is subsequently unavailable to the thyroid, increasing the dietary requirement for iondine these statement prompted the need for a project work on the determination of the amount of Hydrogen cyanide present in cassava which can cause/Lead to poisoning of the system.     </p> <p>1.4      <strong> SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The result of the project work would reveal hydrogen cyanide (HCN) of cassava. The result would equally reveal if the hydrogen cyanide of cassava was high or low and if the cyanides were poisonous or toxic. And the if the cyanide content is high, then proper detoxification, fermentation and cooking should be encouraged during cassava processing or the consumption of cassava products should be discouraged because of the posionous and toxic effects of hydrogen cyanide in the living system.</p> <p>1.5      <strong>LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The project work is Limited to the Determination of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in cassava associated with its toxicity. I had a hardicarp in carrying out this project due to low financial status, on my part as a student. The cost of the chemicals for the analysis and some other materials was high, thus limiting the number of sample run for the project work.  </p>\n\nDETERMINATION OF CYANIDE CONTENTS IN CASSAVA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DETERMINATION OF CYANIDE CONTENTS IN CASSAVA", "id": 8}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>PRODUCTION OF DISINFECTANT</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Disinfectants are antimicrobial agents that are applied to non-living objects to destroy micro-organisms that are living on the object.

Disinfection does not necessarily kill all microorganisms, especially resistant bacteria spores; it is less effective than sterilization, which is an extreme physical and or chemical process that kills all types of life (http://www.cdc.gov).</p> <p>        Disinfectants are different from other antimicrobial agents such as antibiotics which destroy microorganisms within the body and antiseptics, which destroy microorganisms on living tissue. Disinfectants are also different from biocides-the latter are intended to destroy all forms of life, not just microorganisms. Disinfectants work by destroying the cell wall of microbes or interfering with the metabolism. Sanitizers are substances that simultaneously clean and disinfect (Cleaning and disinfecting, 2009).</p> <p>        Disinfectants are frequently used in hospitals, dental surgeries, kitchen and bathrooms to kill infectious organisms. Bacterial endospores are more resistant to disinfectants, but some viruses and bacteria also possess some tolerance. In waste water treatment, a disinfection step with chlorine, ultraviolet (UV) radiation or ozonation can be included as tertiary treatment to remove pathogens from waste water, especially if it is to be reused to irrigate golf course  (Cleaning and disinfecting, 2009).</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>Disinfectants are ideal for the killing of this microorganism.

This result of the heavy metal determination of Onu-asata well water revealed that the concentration of lead in the water is 2.2mg/L, iron (5.3mg/L), Zinc (2.1mg/L), Copper (O.5m/L), Nickel  (O.2mg/L), Cadmium (O.001mg/L), manganese (0.130mg/L), and chromium (0.02mg/L). The result of the analysis has shown that some of the heavy metal concentration in the water is within the limit of WHO and SON while some such as lead, and iron is above the limit stated by WHO and SON. Adequate treatment measure must be carried out on the water before using them so as to reduce the concentration of lead and iron in the water, hence with the result of the heavy metal concentration of the well water the water is not ideal for drinking, but it can be used for mixing of concrete and washing.      </p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT</strong></p> <p>Title page                                                    i</p> <p>Certification                                                        ii</p> <p>Dedication                                                   iii</p> <p>Acknowledgement                                        iv</p> <p>Abstract                                                      v</p> <p>Table of content                                           vi</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.0 Introduction                                           1</p> <p>1.1 Background of the study                          1    </p> <p>1.2 Statement of problem                             5</p> <p>1.3 Objectives of the study                                   6    </p> <p>1.4 Significance of the study                          7</p> <p>1.5 Scope of the study                                         7</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p>2.0 Literature Review                                    8</p> <p>2.1 Water quality                                         8</p> <p>2.2 Anthropogenic impact on water quality      10  </p> <p>2.3 Heavy metals                                         11</p> <p>2.3.0 Arsenic                                               12</p> <p>2.3.1 Exposure route for Arsenic to the environment and well water                                                      13</p> <p>2.3.2 Health effect of Arsenic                         15</p> <p>2.3.3 Lead                                                   17</p> <p>2.3.4 Exposure route for lead to the environment and well water                                                   18</p> <p>2.3.5 Effect of lead on Aquatic life                  20</p> <p>2.3.6 Health effect of lead                             21</p> <p>2.3.7 Mercury                                              22</p> <p>2.3.8 Exposure route for mercury to the environment and well water                                                     29</p> <p>2.3.9 Health effect of mercury                        30</p> <p>2.4.0 Cadmium                                            34</p> <p>2.4.2 Exposure route for cadmium to the environment and well     water                            37</p> <p>   2.4.2 Health effect of the cadmium                     38</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p> <p>3.0 Material and method used</p> <p>3.1 Material</p> <p>3.1.1 Equipment/Apparatus</p> <p>3.1.2 Reagents</p> <p>3.1.3 Sample collection and treatment</p> <p>3.2 Method</p> <p>3.2.1 Sterilization of glassware</p> <p>3.2.2 Determination of lead</p> <p>3.2.3 Determination of zinc</p> <p>3.2.4 Determination of Nickel</p> <p>3.2.5 Determination of copper</p> <p>3.2.6 Determination of iron</p> <p>3.2.7 Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer Analysis of Cadmium, Manganese and Chromium.</p> <p> <strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></p> <p>4.0 Result                                     </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></p> <p>5.0 Discussion, Conclusion and Recommendation</p> <p>5.1 Conclusion                                            </p> <p>5.2 Recommendation                                   </p> <p>Reference                                                   </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Water is essential to all forms of life and make up 50-97% by weight of all plants and animal and about 70% of human body (Allan, 1995). Water is also a vital resource for agriculture, manufacturing, transportation. Despite its importance, water is the most poorly managed resource in the world (Chutter, 1998). The public health significance of water cannot be over emphasized. Many infectious diseases are transmitted by water through the fecal oral route. Diseases contacted through drinking water kills about 5million people annually and make 1/6th of the world population sickness (WHO, 2004). Water is vital for the existence of life and its importance in our daily life makes it imperative that thorough microbial, physico-chemical and heavy metal examination of water should be concluded on water used for various purposes to reduce the risks of water borne diseases emanation from such water. Portable water is the water that is free from disease–producing micro-organisms chemical substances that are dangerous to health (laminkera, 1999). In Nigeria, majority of the in the rural and urban area do not have access to portable water and therefore depend on well, stream and river water for domestic use. The bacterial and heavy metal content of well water in Nigeria have been reported to be unsatisfactory; with coliform count exceeding the recommendation by WHO (Edema et al; 2001). Water is the second important resource to human life after air. Man can survive longer without food than without water. Water is an important constituent of biotic community, it occurs naturally on land, underground, in the atmosphere and biomass (Narayanan, 2007). Water pollution should be a concern to every citizen because water accounts for about 70% of the weight of a human body, out of the estimated.</p> <p>1,011 million km3 of the total water present on 400m3 is available for drinking, agricultural purposes, domestic and industrial uses. The rest of the water is locked up in ocean of salt underground.</p> <p>These qualities of water and its effect are characterized by its physical, chemical and microbial properties (Narayanan, 2007).</p> <p>The problem associated with chemical constituents of drinking water arises primarily from their ability to cause adverse health effects after prolonged period of exposure of a particular contaminant that have cumulative toxic properties such as heavy metals and substances that are carcinogenic (Uduma ,2014).</p> <p>Heavy metals are chemical elements with a specific gravity (S.G) at least 5 times that of water. The specific gravity of water is I at 4oC. Some well known toxic metals with a specific gravity of 5 or more than that of water are cadmium</p> <p> (8.65), iron (7.9) Lead (11.34) and mercury (13.546), (Lide, 1992).</p> <p>Heavy metals are produced from varieties of natural and anthropogenic (man-made activities like mining, disposal of effluents from industries and indiscriminate use of fertilizers and pesticides in cultivation (Amman et al, 2002).</p> <p>Investigation of the spatial distribution of levels of arsenic, lead and cadmium in Rivers, in kumasi (Ghana) revealed that most of the aquatic life have gone extinct due to the toxicity of the heaving metal to the aquatic organisms in the water (arpong et al; 2009).</p> <p>In aquatic ecosystem, heavy metal pollution can result from atmosphere deposition of geological weathering or through the discharge of waster. Metals like CU, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn are essential micronutrients for life processes in plants and micro organisms while other many metals like Cd, Cr and pb have no known physiological activity, but have been proved to be detrimental beyond certain levels (Marschner, 1995)</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Many androgenic activities have been going on almost at all points in obiagu, Enugu. Onu-Asata being the peak of them all is where many toxic chemicals are produced; by these activities, they are leached into the well water used in this area, which has prompted for this research works on the determination of heavy metal contamination of well water; heavy metals such as pb, Fe,Zn,Cu,Ni,Cd,Mn,Cr.</p> <p>1.3 <strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>To determine the heavy metal contaminants such as pb, Fe, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd, Mn,and Cr in well water sample collected from onu-asata, obiagu, Enugu.</p> <p>To ascertain the level of heavy metals contaminants in the well water sample.</p> <p>To educate the people using the water on the health impacts of the water depending on the level of heavy metals present in it.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The result of this research work would be useful in the determination of heavy metals in well water samples, it also would disclose the level of heavy metal contaminants in the well water sample collected from Onu –asata thereby creating awareness on the health implication of using the well water.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Due to some financial constraints, this research work is limited to the determination of heavy metal contaminants such as Pb,Fe,Zn,Cu,Ni,Cd,Mn and Cr  in Onu-asata well water.   </p>\n\nHEAVY METAL CONTAMINATION OF WELL WATER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " HEAVY METAL CONTAMINATION OF WELL WATER", "id": 10}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>PRODUCTION OF FACIAL POWDER USING CORNCOB</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Face powder is a cosmetic powder applied to the face to set a foundation after application. It can also be reapplied throughout the day to minimize shininess caused by oily skin. There is translucent sheer powder, and there is pigmented powder. Certain types of pigmented facial powders are meant be worn alone with no base foundation. Powder tones the face and gives an even appearance. Besides toning the face, some powders with sunscreen can also reduce skin damage from sunlight and environmental stress. It comes packaged either as a compact or as loose powder. It can be applied with a sponge, brush, or powder puff. Uniform distribution over the face is achieved more easily when a loose powder is applied. Because of the wide variation among human skin tones, there is a corresponding variety of colors of face powder. There are also several types of powder. A common powder used in beauty products is corncob (or baby powder), which is absorbent and provides toning to the skin.</p> <p>It can also be applied generously to the higher points of the face to brighten, colour correct and highlight, through a technique termed baking (aka cooking). this technique also helps to increase the coverage of the make-up whilst helping the makeup stay in place for longer.</p> <p>A corncob, also spelled corn cob, is the central core of an ear ofmaize (<em>Zea mays</em> ssp. <em>mays</em>). It is the part of the ear on which thekernels grow. The ear is also considered a \"cob\" or \"pole\" but it is not fully a \"pole\" until the ear is shucked, or removed from the plant material around the ear.</p> <p>Young ears, also called baby corn, can be consumed raw, but as the plant matures the cob becomes tougher until only the kernels are edible.</p> <p>When harvesting corn, the corncob may be collected as part of the ear (necessary for corn on the cob), or instead may be left as part of the corn stover in the field.</p> <p>The innermost part of the cob is white and has a consistency similar to foam plastic.</p> <p>Cosmetics are referred to as substances that make the face, body and hair look more attractive; generally, the study of cosmetology came into existence in the year 1895, in Chicago. Cosmetology is a branch of applied science, which deals with the external embellishment of the human, through the use of cosmetic products.</p> <p>Cosmetics are of different types and are divided into hair care, body care, and make-up. Concisely, hair care cosmetics are referred to as the shampoo, Relaxers, conditioners, styling gel, pink oil, etc. Thus, there are used to beautify the hair. The body care cosmetics are the body creams and body lotions; they are cleansing creams and moisturizers, which are used for the body (Skin) Beautification.</p> <p>Make-up cosmetics are referred to as powders, lipsticks, Wet-lips, cortex etc. powder is one of the cosmetic product that is widely used and very important to man since individuals want to promote their beauty.</p> <p>Thus, powders are chemical formulation which are used on the external part of the skin e.g. face.</p> <p>         Powders are classified into three different types which are known as     the simple powders, Antiseptic/Medicated powders, and Brown powders. Though, generally, the various powders are being applied on the skin but two of the powders named are basically for face beautification e.g Simple powder and Brown powder. The Antiseptic/Medicated are being applied on the body (Skin), when there is prickly heat rashes on the skin in other to inhabit or eliminate the micro-organisms that are infectious or causes infection to the human skin.</p> <p>The qualities of the different powder products depends on the active ingredients and  other additives added to it during it’s formulation. No single powder contains all the desired qualities needed by man and as such different powder cosmetics products exist in the market so as to meet the choice of individuals and as to such any of the product becomes medicated/Antiseptic powder when it contains germicidal or Antiseptic compounds including materials like Irzasan DP 300, Triclosan, menthol etc.</p> <p>Any antiseptic added to powder  must have selective toxicity so that it can only affact the particular micro-organisms activity to be controlled or eliminated and do not have any negative effect when applied on the skin (face or any part of the body.).</p> <p>Hence, the brown powder (pan-cake or pressed powder) are pro duced purposely for the compliment of the skin colour.</p> <p>Though, they vary in colours they are produced through the same medium the brown powder  has three different colours namely colour 1</p> <p>Colour 2,  colour 3. Basically, colour 1 is produced for those with white skin  colour people, colour 2 is produced for chocolate colour people, and colour 3 is produced for black skin colour people. Thus, the production of the brown powder is more tedious when compared to simple and Antiseptic/Medicated powders. Due to the process it under goes during the production. Thus, the simple powder is the most easiest and cheapest  to produce among the three different types of powder.</p> <p>Generally, in the production of various powders, the materials used are the corncobum, Zinc-oxide, Perfume, Menthol, Mineral oil, Irgasan DP 300, but not all the materials named above are used in the production of the different powders, like the simple powder, Corncobum, Perfume and Zinc oxide; if the need arise but it can be produced using Corncobum and perfume. The Antiseptic /Medicated powders, Irgasan DP 300,Corncobum are used in the production process, while the brown powders zinc state, corncobum mineral oil, colour and perfume are used during the production.</p> <p>Hence, in the production of powder, there are some quality control the producer must adhere to during production, the powder materials must be smooth and very fine in texture, in other words, there should not be particles in the powder and furthermore, the oil level must not exceed the normal quantity and a good oil should be used and the mineral oil should be very pure (Technical oil) that is a purified oil.</p> <p><strong>Aims/Objectives</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research work is to produce facial powder using corncob. The specific objectives of this study include the following;</p> <p>1.   To produce facial powder with a corncob.</p> <p>2.   To examine the quality of facial powders marketed in market.</p> <p>3.   To examine the benefits of facials powder on human skin.</p>\n\nPRODUCTION OF FACIAL POWDER USING CORNCOB<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PRODUCTION OF FACIAL POWDER USING CORNCOB", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>        CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>This chapter introduces the work under the following sub-headings: background of the study, statement of the problem, purpose of the study, research questions, research hypotheses, and significance of the study, delimitation of the study, limitation of the study and definition of terms.</p> <ul><li><strong>Background of the study</strong></li> </ul> <p>The current shift in emphasis in science curricula objective reflecting student-centred process approach to science is a radical departure from the traditional emphasis on teacher-centred product approach. This new trend requires that the students should be actively involved in the learning process through adequate and meaningful hands- and- minds – on activities during every classroom instruction in science. However, research reports show contrary to the demands of the new science curricula in Nigeria, our science teachers still decide to split science instructions into theory and practical (Njoku, 2004 and Uzoechi, 2004). The results have been students’ persistent poor performance in science subjects, which necessitate laboratory teaching and Basic Science and Technology as a core science subject at the Basic Education level is not an exception.</p> <p>The teaching of science in the laboratories has been a controversial issue. Laboratory work is both times consuming and expensive compared with other methods of instruction. Hence, the efficiency of such a method of learning should justify the additional time and cost of using it, especially in primary and secondary education (Sabri and Emuas, 2006). In other words, the increase in the educational budget for using laboratories as a model of teaching should be more efficient in accomplishing the objectives of teaching science through laboratories needs, therefore to be constantly evaluated using one or more of the following methods stated below according to Sabri and Emuas (2006).</p> <p>There should be a comparison of the academic achievement of students who are taught through the laboratory method compared with the achievement of students taught with other models. Harty and Al-Felah (1983) in Sabri and Emuas (2006) indicated that students exposed to laboratory- based education exhibited significantly greater chemistry achievement than students in comparable lecture/demonstration groups on both immediate and delayed post tests. Zitoon and Al-Zaubi (1986) in Sabri and Emuas (2006) concluded that the laboratory teaching method is more efficient compared with traditional method in developing the skill of scientific thinking for science secondary school students. Low achieving students using laboratory method performed better than their counterparts who received the lecture method (Odubunmi and Balogun, 1991). In opposition to this, other studies have not found any significant differences in achievement between laboratory and lecture methods.</p> <p>There should be emphasis on the availability, functionality and accuracy of laboratory equipment in other to achieve the aims of using the laboratory. The Basic Science and Technology for instance, is facilitated by adequate supply of functional laboratory equipment. It requires practical to enhance conceptual understanding as this is crucial to students learning. The quality of functional laboratory equipment a school has is an important aspect for facilitating the knowledge of Basic Science and Technology among learners (Etiubon, 2010). As Wasagu (2008) puts it- “laboratories, workshops and studies blistering with technology and state of art equipment assisted with multimedia technology will boost academic progress”. Aladejana (2007), Balogun (2000) and Mayer (2004) in Etiubon (2010) opined that available functional laboratory equipment promote students’ participation during laboratory activities which in turn enable them identify problems, pose relevant questions, perform efficient and effective experiments, make judgements on alternative hypotheses and interpretation of data. Students therefore learn to discover, learn from discovery and learn by discovery.</p> <p>The extent to which laboratory instruction, experiments, and textbooks are congruent with expected objectives of teaching sciences should be investigated. Tamir and Lunetta (1981), in Sabri and Emuas (2006) reported that laboratory handbooks do not provide students with expected opportunities to investigate and use the scientific inquiry method of teaching. Lunetta (2003) reported that laboratory instruction may play an important part in the achievement of some science teaching goals, but not incorporated laboratory goals in their instruction and evaluation systems. The discrepancies between teaching goals and laboratory handbooks instructions also were shown by Fuhrman (1982) in Sabri and Emuas (2006).</p> <p>There should be investigation on gender inequality in science. Over the years, there exists gender inequality in science achievement among secondary school students (Olatoye, 2008). Chyton (1986) in Utuk (2006) reported that boys achieved better than girls in examinations involving laboratory work. Tamir (1988) in Utuk (2006) says that in Israel, boys performed better than girls only in Physics while their achievement in Biology and Chemistry were similar.</p> <p>The management of student groupings and tasks in laboratory experiments should be examined for their effect on students’ performance. Niaz (1995) in Sabri and Emuas (2006) concluded that students who perform better on problems requiring conceptual understanding also perform significantly better on problems requiring manipulation of the data in chemical experiments. Lawrenz and Munch (1984) in Sabri and Emuas (2006) showed that grouping students in the laboratory on the basis of their formal reasoning ability affected the science content achievement of students and the relationship between individuals in a particular group. On the other hand, Kyle (1979) in Sabri and Emuas (2006) concluded that there is significant difference in the behaviours of students (listening, observation and writing notes) enrolled in introductory level and advanced laboratories in five science disciplines at the University of Iowa from the behavior of their cohorts who did not enroll in laboratory class.</p> <ul><li><strong>Statement of the study</strong></li> </ul> <p>There is a general paucity on research information on the influence of laboratory method on students’ academic achievement in Basic Science and Technology and science in general. The phenomenon of poor performance in Basic Science and Technology examination has become a source of worry to education stakeholders and the general public (Igba, 2009). One of the leading causes of students’ poor performance in Basic Science and Technology and science as a whole according to Igba (2009) has to do with instructional models used by teachers. Eze (2009) also found that many Nigerian Basic Science and Technology teachers and science teachers in general mostly use the expository/lecture method that centres on the teachers, textbooks, chalk and the blackboard.

Typical flooded panel – type LED indicators look good at 10MA forward current on a board inside an instrument one can usually get away with 2.5MA, particularly if one use a narrow-angle LED. When forward biased it emits red, yellow or green light depending on its exact composition. No conductor or light emission occurs for reverse bias which if it exceeds 5V, may damage the LED.</p> <p><strong>B.        LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY (LCO)</strong>: - This is a display that is usually is a driven by an a.c wave form otherwise their liquid guts (contents) are ruined. However, it driver chips have some way to generate a square – wave segment drive, synchronized to the LED backplane wave form. An example is the HC4543, the LED cousin of the HC4511 LED latch/decoded driver. LCD come in rather large panels that can display a line or two or text i.e they have ability to store several message and communicate via serial ports.</p> <p><strong>C.        LOW – BATTERY INDICATOR USES FLEA POWER: - </strong>This is a low indicator that consumes as little power as possible for a 9V, 450-MAhr alkaline battery, a 50 – PA low battery indication can by itself run the battery down in a little more than a year battery – powered devices that need to run continuously for a long time require battery indicators that consume minimal power. </p>\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF LOW POWER INDICATOR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONSTRUCTION OF LOW POWER INDICATOR", "id": 13}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE</strong> <strong>NUTRITIONAL COMPOSITION OF PLANT MILK (SOYA</strong> <strong>BEAN)</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong><br/><em>Nutritional composition of Soymilk showed that it contained moisture content of 90.54%, ash content of 0.82%, protein 4.2%, carbohydrate 0.75%, crude fibre, ether extract 3.6% and Nitrogen free, extract 0.88% and the total carbohydrate is 0.88%.

The rapid growing population fo the developing countries is facing acute shortage of protein, Soy bean is rich protein content and contains fiber.<br/>Soybeans are the least processed form of Soy protein, its available in most grocery stores, they can be purchased in fresh, frozen or roasted forms. These beans can be eaten alone, like peas or added to salads and stir fies. <br/>Tofu: Curdling Soy mil with a coagulant makes tofu or bean curd its available in both soft and firm forms, tofu can be used in a variety of recipes to partially replace either meat or diary product due to the common use of calcium sulphate as the curdling agent, Tofu can also be a good source of calcium (Chdi wenm <em>et al</em>; 2000).<br/>Soymilk: Soymilk is another high quality source of Soy protein that is an alternative of diary animal milk and available in variety of forms including plain, vanilla and chocolate, it can also be used to replace milk added to coffee, tea or cereal.<br/>Human beings are the only species to consume milk past childhood. We are also the only species to consume the milk of another species. There are some great nutritional benefits to milk, for example milk naturally contains a readily absorbable form of calcium and has higher quality protein than soy milk. In this condition known as lactose intolerance, it causes unpleasant abdominal symptoms including stomach cramps, flatulence and diarrhea. Lactose intolerance is reality for 75% for the world population, even though consuming diary is unnatural and problematic for many people. There are many people who cannot drink cow milk because of a milk allergy or out of a values choice like vegan. Soymilk is a healthy drink and is important for people with above problems and had been the first production ever prepared and consumed by human since long ago. Soymilk not only provides protein but also is a source of carbohydrate, lipid, vitamins and minerals.<br/>Milk composition describes the chemical and physical properties and effect of pasteurization on the compound in milk. The variation in milk composition are:</p> <ul><li>Carbohydrate (Lactose)</li> <li>Fat/Oil</li> <li>Protein</li> <li>Vitamins and minerals.</li> <li>Enzymes.</li> </ul> <p><strong>How the body digests foods and absorbs nutritional components </strong><br/>Food undergoes mechanical, chemical and enzymatic digestion as it travels from the mouth from the mouth to the stomach to the intestines. Many chemicals, enzymes, hormones, glands and organs are involved in the absorption of nutrients from food. <br/>The first step is mechanical digestion in the mouth chewing food to break it into small pieces. Saliva, secreted by the salivary gland, contains water that helps dissolve food to make it easier to swallow. Saliva contains the enzyme amylase that begins to break down larger carbohydrate molecules, which makes them easier to digest in the small intestine. Mechanical digestion continues in the stomach as it churns the food and mixes it with gastric juice. The stomach contains hydrochloric acid that dissolves additional foods components that didn’t dissolve in saliva. The highly acidic environment in the stomach causes protein to unfold (denature) so that they can interact with the enzyme pepsin, which breaks down proteins into smaller molecules (peptides) for easier digestion in the small intestine. Gastric lipase begins to break down fats in digestion in the small intestine. <br/>The majority of food digestion occurs in the small intestine, the duodenum. As food leaves the stomach and enters the duodenum, hormones signal the pancreas to release sodium bicarbonate to neutralize the stomach acid so that digestive enzymes can act. The pancreas releases enzymes for the digestion of all major food components. Proteases to break down proteins into small peptides, amylases to break down fats. Hormones trigger the release of bile that is produced in the liver and stored in the gall bladder to aid in emulsification of fats for digestion and absorption. Breakdown of peptides into amino acids and small carbohydrate into individual sugar molecules occurs by enzymes that are secreted by the intestinal cells.<br/>The main carbohydrate in milk is lactose which is a molecule that must be broken down (hydrolyzed) into its two individual sugars (glucose and galactose) before absorption. Lactose is broken down by the enzyme lactase that is secreted by the intestinal cells. Lactase often decrease as people age or may be deficient in some populations which can result in lactose mal absorption or lactose intolerance.<br/>Absorption of nutrients occurs in the second and third section of the small intestine, the jejunum and ileum. Proteins, carbohydrate, fats, fat-soluble vitamins, water soluble vitamins and mineral are absorbed by diffusion across the cell membranes, other require transporters on binding proteins the absorption of fats involves a complex network of lipid carriers. <br/>After absorption of nutrients in the small intestine, the remaining mass moves into the large intestine. The function of the large intestine is to absorb water and sodium and prepare the remaining mass for excretion by the body.</p> <p><strong>1.1    IMPORTANCE OF MILK</strong><br/>Milk is one of the greatest blessings that is given to human by nature. Milk is considered a complete and great food. People is past used milk and things made by it most of the time like cheese, butter in subcontinent. According to research of health experts the secret behind long ages and good health of people of subcontinent in past was use of milk.<br/>Milk is proved a complete food from latest scientific researchers, all the important elements that are needed for body are in milk. Milk has hundreds of benefits to our bodies, health and mind, specially the milk of cow and goat as many benefits. The milk of cow keeps the stomach system of old people and kids strong, most of the people drinks milk while sleeping but its not the correct time of drinking it. The correct time of drinking milk is in morning. Milk even powdered milk is a nutritious, cost, efficient source of protein minerals and vitamins, milk is now often pushed aside to make space for excessively sugary sodas, juice and sports drinks that contribute empty calories to diets already so full of unhealthy choices that many populations are now experiencing unmatched levels of diet-related obesity, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.<br/>Teenagers also should replace sugared beverages with milk. Because adolescents undergo extra ordinary physiological changes, the required energy and nutrient-dense foods for optimal development of hormonal, muscular, circulatory and reproductive systems. Teen’s calcium intake must be accompanied by physical activity to optimize bone-calcium integration and that adolescence is the best time to increase bone density to thwart later life bone fragility and osteoporosis. Without calcium, vitamin D and phosphorous, adults of all ages risk bone degeneration, so milk remains essential. Other calcium rich, non dairy foods such as tofu, broccoli and spinach but some contain compounds that compromise the absorption of calcium. Spinach is high in oxalates, which hinder calcium absorption and the calcium in other vegetables such as broccoli, is not as readily absorbed as the calcium in milk.<br/>Children should be served milk, not high sugar beverages milk’s outstanding protein is built from balanced amino acids that are biologically available that is easily absorbed and used. Milk’s Calcium fortifies a child’s developing bones, teeth and brain tissue and contributes to chemical reactions at the cellular level that govern muscle and neurological function. Fortified milk also provides vitamin D, a critical vitamin that helps the body absorb both calcium and phosphorous for bone integrity, promotes red blood cell production, aids digestive and nerve processes and supports immunity.<br/>Milk and diary products contain many nutrients and provide a quick and easy way of supplying these nutrients to the diet within relatively few calories. <br/>Milk, cheese and yougurt all provide the following beneficial nutrients in varying quantities.</p> <ul><li>Calcium – for healthy bones and teeth.</li> <li>Phosphorous – for energy release.</li> <li>Magnesium – for muscle function</li> <li>Protein – for growth and repair</li> <li>Vitamin B12 – for production of healthy cells.</li> <li>Zinc – for immune function</li> <li>Riboflavin – for healthy skin</li> <li>Folate – for production of healthy cells.</li> <li>Vitamin C – for formation of healthy connective tissues.</li> <li>Iodine – for regulation of the body’s rate of metabolism.</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.2    PRESERVATION OF MILK</strong> <br/>Milk is a perishable commodity and spoils very easily. Its low acidity and high content make it the perfect breeding ground for bacteria including those which cause food poisoning (pathogens). Bacteria from the animal, utensils, hands and insects may contaminate the milk and their destruction is the main reason for processing. This preservation of the milk can be achieved by fermentation, heating, cooling, removal of water and by concentration or separation of components to produce foods such as butter or cheese. <br/>The degree to which milk consumption and processing occurs will differ from region to region. It is dependent upon a whole host of factors, including geographical and climatic conditions, availability and cost of milk, food taboos and religious restrictions, where processing does exist, many traditional techniques can be found for producing indigenous milk products.  These are more stable than raw milk and provide a means of preservation as well as adding variety to the diet. In addition, the introduction of western style diary products and the subsequent setting up of small scale dairies has provided more choice of diary products to the consumer. Infections in the animal which cause illness may be passed directly to the consumer through milk, it is therefore extremely important that quality control tests are carried out to ensure that the bacterial activity in raw milk is of an acceptable level and that no harmful bacteria remain in the processed products. Routinely is necessary to check the microbiological quality of raw milk using either methylene blue or resazurin dyes, these tests indicate the activity of bacteria in the milk sample and the result determine whether the milk is accepted or rejected. The type of animal its quality and its diet can lead to differences in the colour, flavour and composition of milk. Infections in the animal which cause illness may be passed directly to the consumer through milk. It is therefore extremely important that quality control tests are carried out to ensure that the bacterial activity in raw milk is of an acceptable level and that no harmful bacteria remain in the processed productions. Milk can be kept for longer periods of time if it is heated to destroy the bacteria remain in the processed productions. Milk can be kept for longer periods of time if it is heated to destroy the bacteria or cooled to slow their growth. Pasteurization an sterilization are the two most commonly used heat treatments. Technically, it is possible for both to be carried out on a small scale, but they are most usually performed on a larger industrial scale due to the need for qualified, experienced staff and accurate and strictly controlled hygienic processing conditions.<br/>Milk can also be preserved from homogenization which breaks up the oil droplets in milk and prevent the cream from separating out and forming a layer. This is of particular importance of sterilized milk which has a long-shelf life and when the formation of a cream layers is not desired. Additional changes include increased viscosity and a richer taste. Homogenizers are more usually designed for industrial scale production. Pasteurization is a relatively milk heat treatment (usually performed below 100oC) which is used to extend the shelf life of milk for several days. It preserves the milk by the inactivation of enzymes and destruction of heat sensitive micro-organisms, but causes minimal changes to the nutritive value or sensory characteristics of a food. Some heat resistant bacteria survive to spoil the milk after a few days, but these bacteria do not cause food poisoning.</p> <p>          The time and temperature combination needed to destroy target micro organisms will vary according to a number of complex inter-related factors. For milk, heating time and temperature is either 630C for 30 minutes or alternatively 720C for 15 seconds. Sterilization is a more severe heat treatment designed to destroy all contaminating bacteria. The milk is sterilized at a temperature of 120C maintained for 15-20 minutes, this can be achieved using a retort or pressure cooker unlike pasteurization, this process causes substantial changes to the nutritional and sensory quality of the milk. Pasteurization does not destroy all the micro-organisms, therefore milk has to be cooled rapidly to prevent the growth of surviving bacteria. Cooling can be achieved on a small scale by using a bottle – cooling system and should be packaged in sealed bottles and stored at room temperature, sterilized milk should have a shelf life in excess of six months</p>\n\nTHE NUTRITIONAL COMPOSITION OF PLANT MILK (SOYA BEAN)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE NUTRITIONAL COMPOSITION OF PLANT MILK (SOYA BEAN)", "id": 14}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> <p>            Samples of water from the different hostels in campus II and other source of water production namely Ajali-owa water, from bore hole 9th mile and spring water from GRA water board were water collecterd and analysed using total plate count and multiple tube fermentaton techniques coliform.  The results shows no coliforms in production water from Ajali-owa and in GRA spring water reservaiour and no coliform in 9th mile bore hole water, 14 organism and 149 cfu/ml plate counts were obtained from tap water in IMT campus II hostel 7 coliform and Tocful / ml plate count from well water and 28 coliform and 280 cfu/ml plate count from spillage waste water.  These results obtained show that tap water  consumed in IMT campus II did not meet with NAFDAC and WHO standards.  Preventive measures such as proper treatment of these water should be encourage and all pipes in campus II should be checked for leakages</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0       CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p> Introduction              </p> <p>1.1       Aims / objectives of the study                       </p> <p>1.2       Statement of problems                                   </p> <p>1.3       Hypothesis                                                                 </p> <p>1.4       Scope of limitation                 </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p>Literature review        </p> <p>2.1              The major group of biological Pollutions of water                            </p> <p>2.2       Source of water supply                                  </p> <p>2.3       Source of water pollution                              </p> <p>2.4       Treatment of water sample                </p> <p>2.5              International standard for drinking water                                         </p> <p>2.6              Diseases from water                           </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p> <p>3.0       Materials &amp; methods</p> <p>3.0       Materials                                                                    </p> <p>3.1       Media preparation                                          </p> <p>3.2       Collection of samples                                     </p> <p>3.3       Collection of samples                                     </p> <p>3.4       Methods of water analysis                             </p> <p>3.5       Determination of PH                                     </p> <p>3.5.1        Determination of bacteria of the coliform                             </p> <p>3.5.2        Culture techniques                                         </p> <p>3.5.3        Plate count technique                                     </p> <p>3.5.1        Presumption coliform (multiple tube fermebtation                </p> <p>3.5.4    Confirmatory test                                           </p> <p>3.5.5    Completed test                                                           </p> <p>3.5.6    Test for indole                                                </p> <p>3.5.7    Methyl red test                                                           </p> <p>3.5.8    Sugar test                                                                   </p> <p>3.5.9    Oxidase test                                                               </p> <p>3.5.10 Catakase test                                                   </p> <p>3.5.11 The slide cougulase test                                  </p> <p>3.5.12 Gram stain techniques                         </p> <p>3.5.13 Detection of faecal stredtococci         </p> <p>3.5.14 Detection of escherichi coli test          </p> <p>3.5.15 Organism suspected after gram staining                                             </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></p> <p>RESULTS                              </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></p> <p>Discussion</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER SIX</strong></p> <p>6.1       Conclusion</p> <p>6.2       Recommendation</p> <p>References</p> Appendix CHAPTER ONE  <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Water is a liquid mineral.  It consist of two atoms of hydrogen combined with one atom of oxygen. Water is a tasteless, odourless and colourless mobile liquid except in large volume where it appears blue.  It has a melting point of OoC (320f) and a boiling point of 1000C (2120f).  water is a basic necessity of life, in the absence higher animals survive only but a few hours or days.  It has several uses such  as  washing  cooking, food  processing ,swimming, and  among  others. Out  of   these  uses, drinking  of  water  seems  to  be  the  most   sensitive  as  it  could  have  a  direct   deleterious  impact  on  health  of  human  beings.</p> <p>            Therefore, drinking  water  should  be  potable  free  diseases, or  toxic  substance (Beren 1991) .</p> <p>            Water is portable when it is colourless.  Odourless, or tasteless and also free from poisonous, corroding, staining substances as well as disease casuiong oirganisms (Cruich 1972).  The problem of providing safe and adequate water is as old as life on earth.  Water can be made unifit or unsafe for drinking it contamination occurs either by nature or activities of human beings.    </p> <p>            Perhaps the greatest danger associated with drinking water is contamination by human  excrement (Forest 1979).  In most cases, the pollution/contamination is hardly severe and is not particularly detrimental to health.</p> <p>            Thus a few substances and microbes that are health hazard do occur in water, and can cause illness or even death.  From microbiological point of view, the pathogens most frequently transmitted through water supply ranges from ultrasmall

INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Banana may be defined as a personal seed plant that produces an edible fruits, usually seedless, belong to the species M.  acuminata, or are hybrids M. acuminata, M. balbisnna.  They are perennial herbs with long, the bases of these leaves (petioles) remain tightyly fused and form the trunk (Pseudostem) of a plant 2-9m (6-30-ft) in height (Ploetz, 1994),</p> <p>            “Banana” is a general term embracing a number of species or hybrids in the genus musa, family musceae. In some areas of the world bananas are grown only as ornamental plants or for fiber.</p> <p>            It is found in tropical regions.  The banana is monocarpic, flowering and setting fruit once before sit dies.  The inflorescence protective flag leaf.  The flower stalk of most banana varieties  is positively geotropic and bends from the vertical until its stip points towards vertical flower stalks are from 30 – 90 cm (1-3ft) along, tapered and covered in a sheath of over- lapparing bracks the flower are parthenogenic (self-fertile).  And occur in group of 12-20 beneath the bracks.</p> <p>            At first, individual fruiots called fingers, make up the groups (hands) which are arranged in a spiral around the flower stalk, forming a bunch.</p> <p>            At fruit set, a healthy banana plant will have 8-12 leaves, fruits mature in 60-100 days after flowers first appears depending on the season and cultivan.  New banana plants arise as suckers from an underground rhizone.  As old planted die and new sucher are formed the rhizome expands and is called a mat.  Banana are propagated by suckens, pieces of the Bluzome and by tissue culture  (Ploetz 1994)</p> <p><strong>USES</strong>   </p> <p>Bananas contain about 74% waterm 23% carbohydrate, 1% protein and 0.5 %.  A 4 – ounce banana without the peel is a good source of  vitamin Bb, Potassium, and fiber.</p> <p>Banana fruit may be   eaten raw or as a cooked vegetable.   The fruit can also be processed for a number of food products.</p> <p>            Ripe fruits can be pulped for puree for in a variety of products including ice cream, yoghurt, cake, bread, nectar, and baby food.  Ripe banabas can be dried and eaten, or sliced canned with syrup, and used in bakery products, fruits salads and stoppings.  Green (unripened) bananas can be sliced and fried as chips. Whole green fruits can also be dried and ground into flour. Vinegar and alcoholic beverages can be made from fermented ripe bananas. Other parts of the banana plant are consumed besides the fruits. The heart of the growing pseudostem is eaten in India.   In Southeast Asia, the male bud is eaten as a boiled vegetable.</p> <p>            The banana leaves are not eaten but may be used for wrapping food in cooling. The banana foliage and pseudostems are used as cattle feed during dry periods in some banana producing areas.  Culled bananas are used sto feed cattle and hogs.  Bananas are a good energy source but need to be supplemented with  protein.  But not all micro-organisms associateeed with fruits are harmless”.  This  includes the lactic acid bacteria, coryne forms, pseudomonads, xanthomonads  micrococci, amny fungi and coliforms.  These microorganisms do play an important role in the spoilage of food and dictate the shelf life of fresh fruits. Most healthy raw produce will have on them anywhere from a  few thousand to millions of miucroorganisms per gram.  The presence of many of these microorganisms is a concern for causing product spoilage. </p> <p>            Food spoilage is a major problems in all societies especially fruits, because  they provide nutrients for us, also are excellent environment for the growth of micro-organisms.  Microbial growth as  well as spoilage is controlled by factor related to the food itself or intrinsic factor and also to theenvironment where the food is being stored or what are described as    extrinsic factors.  Food composition is critical intrinsic factor that influences microbial growth, if a food consider primarily  of carbohydrates, spoilage does not result in major odours.  Thus, foods such as some fruits e.g. banana show spoilage by fungal growth.  Also, PH of a food also is critical because a low PH a food also is critical because a low PH favours the growth of yeasts and mold.  This is the case in banana fruit because it has PH of 2-5 physical structure of a food also can affected the course and extension of spoilage.  Banana fruits has outer  skin (peels) that project them from spoilage.</p> <p>            Often, spoilage micro-organisms have specialized enzymes that help them weaken and penetrate protective peels, especially after the fruits has been bruised.  Temperature and relative humidity are important extrinsic factors in determining whether a fruit (banana) will spoil.  At higher relative humilities, microbial growth is  initiated more rapidly even at lower temperatures.</p> <p>            The atmosphere in which the fruit is stored is also important as this plays a crucial role in its spoilage.  Because fruits are such excellent sources of nutrients, If the intrinsic and extrinsic conditions are appropriate, micro-organisms grow rapidly and make what once was an attractive and appealing fruits into a sour, foul-smelling or fungus – covered mass suitable only for the garbage car.</p> <p>Microbial spoilage in Banana can lead to visible challenges, including a variety of colours caused by spoilage organisms.</p> <p>               Bacteria do not seem important in the initial spoilage of whole fruits like banana instead such spoilage often is initiated  by molds.  These organisms have enzymes that contribute to the weakening and penetration of the protective outer skin.  Many microorganisms have been isolated from banana, actually spoilt banana. These micro-organisms have been associated with moko disease, or moko de Guineo, or marchites bacteriana, is caused by the bacterium, pseudomonas solanacearum, resulting in internal decay.  It  has become one of the western hemisphere and has seriously reduced production in the leading area as of Colombia. It attacks Heliconia species as well.  It is transmitted by insects, machetes and with the roots of sick plants.  There are said to be 4 different types transmitted by different means.  Efforts at control include covering the male and bud with plastic to prevent insects from visiting its mucilaginous excretion, debudding, disinfecting of cutting tools  with formalde hyde in water 1:3, disinfection of  planning material; disposal of infected fruits and plant parts: infection of herbicides into seemingly healthy neighbouring plants. if The organism is vriant SFR, all adjacent plants. If the organism is variant SFR, all adjacent plants within a radius replanted for 10 to 12 months for this variant persists in the soil that long.  If it is variant B, the plants within 32.8 ft (10m) must bee injected and the area not replanted for 18 months.</p> <p>            In either case the soil must be kept clear of broad leaved weeds that may serve as hosts.  In Colombia, there are 12 species of weeds that serve as hosts or “carriers:” but only 4 of these are themselves susceptible to the disease.  Crop rotation is sometimes resorted to the only sure, defense is to plant resistant cultivans.  Such as the ‘pelipita’ plantain.</p> <p>            Black-end arises from infection by the fungus arises from infectrion by the fungus Glocosporium musarum, of which Glomerella cingulata  is the perfect  form.  It causes authracuose on the plant and attacks the stalk and stalk – end of the fruits  forming dark, sunken lesions on the peel, soon penetrating the fresh and developing dark, watery, soft area in severe cases, the entire skin turns black and the flesh rats.  Very young fruits shrived and mummify. This fungus is often responsible for the rotting of bananas in storage.  Immersing the green fruits in hot water. 131of (55oc) for 2 minutes before ripening greatly, reduces spoilage.</p> <p>            Sigar-tip rot, or cigan-end disease, stachylidium (verticillium) theobromae begins in the flowers and extends to the tips of the fruits and turns sthem darks the peel darknens, the flesh becomes Fibrous. One remedy is to cut off withered flowers as soon as the fruits are formed and apply copper fungicides to the cut surfaces.  Unlike most other fruits, banana develop their best eating quantity after they are harvested. This allows bananas to be shipped great distances.  Almost our entire supply of banabas, available year-round is imported from central and south america.  Bananas are sensitive to cool temperature and will be induced in temperatures below 550f for this reason, they should never be kept in the refrigerator.  The ideal temperature for ripening bananas is between 60 and 700f.  higher temperature cause them to repen too rapidly.</p> <p>            However, Bananas which are firm, bright in appearance, and free from repeness is indicated by skin colour.  Best eating quality has been reached when the solid yellow colour is specked with brown.</p> <p>            At this stage, the flesh is mellow and the flavour is fully developed.  Bananas with green stips or with practically no yellow colour have not developed their full flavour potential.</p> <p><strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>1.      it shows the amount of bacteria present in the decay of banana</p> <p>2.      it also shows the amount of yeast and mold present in the decay of banana</p> <p>3.      it provides a basic understanding of the physical, chemical and microbiological principles underlying the psreervation of foods and also provide as a basic understanding of the study of food microbiology from farm to consumer.</p> <p>4.      It provide students with an understanding of the physical and chemical characteristics which influence the formation, stability and texture of food systems</p> <p><strong>1.3       SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>            This study is done to find out how similar or different microorganisms associated with the spoilage of bananas are: it brings to fore a good number of   microorganisms associated with that or bring about the spoilage of banana (musa acuminata).  The significance of this study can never and will never be over emphasized.  This is because banana is a fruit of choice and spoils easily.  As a result of this, a knowledge of the microorganisms that are involved in its (banana) spoilage is essential.</p> <p>            Also, this study gives an insight into the conditi ons as well as factors that result in the spoilage of this  attractive fruit, not to mention the nature or group of microorganisms that are associated with such a fruit.  The significance of this study is seen in the light of having a good understanding and showing the comparism of the spoilage microorganisms of banana.</p> <p><strong>1.4              </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>A study of this nature must have problems which result in it.  This problem will result from how these microorganisms are being  associated with the spoilage of banana a fruit and cause decay to these banana and make it undesirable for human consumption.  This microorganisms associated  with the spoilage of banana includes yeast and mold, {uedomonas species, micrococcus species,  bacterial and fungal species.  Looking at many banana sold in the market today, most of them are infected with these microorganisms or other microorganisms like the soft rot, crown rot bacteria and soft rots which infect and make these fruit unattractive  for human consumption and may cause problems to human being as well as animal.  </p> <p><strong>1.6       HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>Ho       =          Microorganisms are associated with the spoilage of

special method such as Garri, fufu etc.  It may be partially or completely backed or precooked ready for eating and serving.  During preparation, food may be contaminated with microorganisms.  Unless the growth and metabolism of this microorganism are controlled, they are capable of altering the condition of food resulting in food spoilage.  Microorganism are organisms that cannot be seen by an invaded eyes, their size are within the range of (NM) micrometer to (nm) Nanometre and their activities on food produce food poisoning food poisoning ie an illness that result from the consumption of contaminated food containing toxin screted into it by contaminated microorganism or contaminated by microorganisms when the body release their toxin (Okoli, 1991).  Also the (Kay and Dennis 1986) defined food poisoning as any substance applied to the body externally or taken internally that can cause injury to any part of the body or cause death.</p> <p>            In Garri preparation the cassava is pealed, washed, grated then follow by dehydration under pressure, finally frying, packaging and storage.  These process if not handle in a good hygiene condition or good environment, microorganism will contaminated it and will result in food can lead to the death of many people which can reduce the working force and increase poverty rate due to heavy hospital bills.  To avoid this problem, this research work is designed to know the microbial organisms of Garri in Ogbete market.  The microbial organisms present will be analyzed to see if it can cause food poisoning.  From the analysis the list of microorganism present or microorganism contamination on garri can be control effectively and our Garri will be save  for consumption at anytime.</p> <p>            The intoxication from nature source is that found naturally in contain plants or animals (Frazien and Westhof. 1978).  The intoxications caused by bacterial are of two types by clostridium botulinum, staphylococcal intoxication, caused by a toxin in the food produced by staphylococcus aureus.  In the production of food, such as in the fermentation of garri, the fermentation reduced the cyanile toxicity  in the cassava which if present in large quantity causes food poisoning.  The processing of cassava involves the contamination of the cassava if it is not properly processed.</p> <p><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>To evaluate he microbial organisms of garri in Ogbete market.  Ot characterize for microbial organism of

Some sellers have some infection which are contagious and can contaminate the Garri on sale</p> <p>4.                  Open air  exposure and duration of sale past production. The microbial load in the air can raise above toxic level became of some air borne organism and if Garri is kept in such environemnt it will be contaminated.</p> <p>5.                  Storage for longtime may enhance deterioration.  Keeping Garri in storage room for longtime will affect the nature of the Garri.</p> <p><strong>1.4              </strong><strong>HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> HO      the Garri on sale at Ogbete market have no microbial lead Hi        The Garri on sale at Ogbete market have some bacterial load. 15        SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY <p>            This study is based on the fact that Garri which is the staple food of man may caused a lot of harm to his life.  This is due to the unhygienic condition of the environemnt during processingg, storage and further exposure to  the market in which Garri is sold.  These microbes can leads to food poisoning and other intoxication (ailment) which can lead to loss of man power and  loss of life. Therefore this work is to stem down ugly trend which may even affect our socioeconomic life by educating the people that are involved inteh processing, storage and selling of Garri about personnel hygiene on the product and how it can be store.</p> </div>\n\nTHE EVALUATION OF MICROORGANISMS ON GARRI AT OGBETE MARKET<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EVALUATION OF MICROORGANISMS ON GARRI AT OGBETE MARKET", "id": 20}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>   </p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>The term poultry used in agriculture generally refers to all domesticated birds kepts for egg or meat production. These includes chickens (domestic fowls), Grallus domestics, turkeys, ducks and geese. This project will deal largely with the chicken which are the most common domestic fowl. The species of poultry are aptable or can survive in different environments therefore, they are widely distributed in the world, with great increase in population, the demand for goods especially protein food become acute. To meet the demand for animal protein and its development, rapid multiplying ones becomes very necessary. Poultry has so many advantages over other domesticated animal whose production is very much hindered by lack of money, high temperature, disease and lack of good at certain periods of the year.<br/>The diseases of poultry is like the disease of other animals may be caused by: a. pathogenic organisms like bacteria and viruses, protozoa, worms and some members of arthropods<br/>b. Nutritional deficiency, (c) From wound or cannibalism<br/>The following diseases are usually associated with the fowls locally<br/>1. New castle disease<br/>2. Chronic respiratory diseases<br/>3. Fowl typhoid<br/>4. Coccidiosis<br/>5. Fowl pox<br/>The incidence of salmonella and Escherida coli simply means the extent to which the enteric organisms (Escherichia coli) that are part of the normal flora and incidentally causes disease and pathogenic organism (salmonella) affect the poultry feeds. Hill, D.H; and Davis, O.s; (1962). Shoening et al 1942). Defined diseases as any abnormal condition of the tissue of the body, the cells that make up the various tissue have specific functions to perform. Pekzar et al (1977) defined Salmonell is as a disease of the chick fowl and swim bird cause by some species or Salnaonells. <br/>Anon (1963) described pullorum disease as an actute infection disease of body chicks caused by salnonella pullorum. Infection is the entering of the disease produces organisms into the animal. <br/>Livestock (Poultry )gets infected when pathogenic organisms passes to the susceptible animal through the through the following avenues. Esmat.omar 1977.<br/>1. Feeds and contaminated water feed or water containing droppings or waste products of diseased animal will help spread the organisms to fresh hosts. The feeding troughs and watering vessels aso spread the diseases if not seperated.<br/>2. Dropping or excretes: These material are the gateway out for some stages of oarganisms to go out of the host and get to fresh animal hosts.<br/>3. Close contact – some disease spread by contact. Their agents may be external parasites or air borne in which case nearness to the superior’s birds increase the changes of getting the organisms<br/>4. To or event the disease pathogenic organism from getting into the body of poultry, attention should be payed to those factors that influence their infections and spread. First and foremost, they should have disease resisting stock, provide good shelter, clean range, proper feeding and practise separating the unhealthy ones from the healthy poultry, quarantining new stock. In case of poultry, the brooder house should be 30m to 48m from old birds. Such that they gets good feed and sunlight. They should act be allowed to get in contact with their droppings or excretes since their dropping carry the pathogenic organisms. Sanitation is very important in poultry management by cleaning of water cans and feed troughs and finally disinfecting the stock to help reduce organic matter.</p> <p><strong>1.1 JUSTIFICATION</strong><br/>This study has been justified by the need and safety of consuming children (white meat) which has low cholesterol but rich in protein than beef which has high cholesterol. Also human beings and the world at large, benefit from our poultry farms where we have the layers (Egg producing Chiks) and the broilers (Heavy chicks) for consumption.<br/>The poultry (chicken) are rich in protein and amino acid needed for growth. Livestock feeds are formulated to a ratio for different species and classes of poultry. These are also feed additive, which may be added to the feed to prevent disease or make animals utilize feed better. Some ingredient concentrate is added to nourish the feed.</p> <p><strong>1.2 AIMS AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>1. To highlight the varius importance of the livestock (poultry) t human and our industries.<br/>2. To determine the incidence of bacteria infection such as balmonella <br/>and Escherichia coli which cause health hazard to the poultry (Chiken).<br/>3. To isolate and deduce effect of salmonella specie and Escherichia coli <br/>in livestock (poultry) and their feeds.<br/>4. To advice poultry farmers on how to preserve and handle their farms <br/>feeds from infections diseases to the birds.</p> <p><strong>LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong><br/>This research work will be limited to the available materials for carrying out experimental work and also due to cost of transportation. This work will be limited to Enugu metropolis.</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS</strong><br/>HYP. 10:- Salmonella and Escherichia coli are the major causes of bacteira infection found in livestock (poultry) feeds.<br/>HYP. II: - salmonella only is the infection that effects the livestock (poultry) feeds.<br/>HYP. II0:- Escherichia coli only is the bacteria infection that effects the livestock (poultry) feeds.)</p> <p><strong>STATEMNET OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>1. poultry feeds are infected during procession by handling, mixing of ingredient and exposing the raw materials and furnished products to the atmospheric micro organism.<br/>2. Poultry (birds) are being infected through the consumption of the contaminated feeds and unpurified water<br/>3. Also when the healthy and unhealthy birds are fed together from the some feeding trough and water vessels, eventually the pathogenic and the enteric organisms from infested ones may widely spread<br/>4. Salmonella and Escherichia coli as the bacterial organisms effects the essential requirement of the body such as water, carbohydrate, fats, vitamin, minerals and protein thereby reducing the content of the nutrient needed for the food to the palatable and easily digestible<br/>5. Consumers (humans) get infected by the in take of uncooked and half done chicken.</p>\n\nINCIDENCE OF SALMONELLA AND ESCHERICHIA COLI IN LIVESTOCK (POULTRY) FEEDS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INCIDENCE OF SALMONELLA AND ESCHERICHIA COLI IN LIVESTOCK (POULTRY) FEEDS", "id": 21}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  ABSTRACT </p> <p>The antibacterial activity of three type of medicate soap on staphylococcus aureus isolated from wound infections was conducted. Fifty individual with would infection within the age range of 9-73 years were sampled. Swabsticks were used to collect specimens from wound infection. each swabstick was streaked separately over plates of nutrient   and  macconkey agar and later incubated at 370c. out of the fifty (50) individuals sampled 25(50%) were mostly infected with staphylococcus aureus followed by pseudomonas acruginqu (22%)  staphylococcus epidermis (10%) least by Exchericha coli b(12%) The organisms occur within the age range 9-13 years with 8 (16%) followed by 14-18 years 4(8%) next by the age range of 19-23 years 3(6%) followed by 24-28 years with 2(4%) followed 24-28 years with 2(4%) and the heart in the age range are 29-33,34-38,39-43,44-48,49-53,54-58 64-68 with 1(2%) each while there was no isolation in the age range 59-63. The study also revealed that all the staphylococcus aureus isolated were sensitive to the three medicated soap. The means of inhibition was highest in Aleppo medicated soap with 12.92 mm followed by temperate medicated soap with 11.2mm and least in carat medicated soap with 10.56 mm. Also the staphylococcus aureus isolated were also sensitive to the commercial autibutics used as couplers the means zones of inhibition was highest in ampiclox with 12.8 mm followed by gentamyain with 12.04 mm and the heart in penicillin with 10.4 mm. there was a close relationship in the zenes of inhibition between the three medicated soap and the commercial antibiotics used as coconutrels. The result showned that medicated soaps were effective against staphylococcus aureus involved in would infection in humans and  are comparable to commercial antibiotics. There fore medicated soap can be used in cleaning the skin particularly in the affected part of the skin during the time one has hurt or cut on the  skin.</p>\n\nTHE ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY OF THREE TYPES OF MEDICATED SOAPS ON STARHYROCOCCUS AUREUS  FORM WOULD INFECTIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY OF THREE TYPES OF MEDICATED SOAPS ON STARHYROCOCCUS AUREUS  FORM WOULD INFECTIONS", "id": 22}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER   ONE</p> <p>1.0     <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>1.1     <strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br/>Soap is the earliest detergent know to man and apparently was first made by the Romans from animal fats and oil and wood ash which is an alkali that contains potassium carbonate, sodium, potassium hydroxide called potash leached from the wood ash (Robert, 1994).  It is also an unsaturated ester since an ester can be split into an alcohol and a carboxylic acid by hydrolysis.  Meaning that it does not contain all the solutes that can be dissolve at a particular temperature (Kirt Othmer, 1994).  Also soap is a metallic salt of a fatty acid because if a metallic base is used in the hydrolysis instead of water, the metallic salt of the carboxylic acid is obtained, not the acid because carboxylic acid are weak acid which dissociates only slightly in solution <br/>(Hou, 1992).</p> <p>1.2     Soap can be defined as the sodium or potassium salt of fatty acids, made by heating fats and oil with caustic soda or caustic potash respectively (Cook 1990).<br/>Most soap was manufactured by an alkaline hydrolysis reaction called the Saponification, which is the reaction of fats and oil with alkali.<br/>C3H5 (COOR)3   +   3KOH                3KOOCR   +   C3H5  (OH)<br/>(where R – represent the hydrocarbon chain) also according to the equation above, soaps was made in huge keittes into which fat and oil and alkali were piped and heated until it boils vigorously. <br/>Saponification is the process used in making soap since ancient times, soaps have been made from vegetable and animal oil and fats looked in alkali (Kott, NaoH) (Steiner, 1990).  Soap and detergent are both cleaning agents and both work in the same way, but soap cleanse with the natural occurring materials such as animal fat and wood ash.</p> <p>1.3     <strong>TYPES OF SOAP</strong><br/>In the world of soap manufacturing, there are basically three types of soap, under them they are classified according to their categories:<br/>(1)     <strong>Foreign Soap</strong><br/>These are soap that is medically investigated to cure a skin diseases.  Examples:</p> <p>(a)     <strong>Medicated soap</strong><br/>i.        Antiseptic soap<br/>ii.       Germicidic soap<br/>iii.      Herbal soap</p> <p>(b)     <strong>Tablets Soap</strong><br/>These are soap that is operated and purified, dyes and perfumed added, to make the skin mild.<br/>Example:    i.        Toilet Soap<br/>ii.       Bar Soap<br/>(c)      <strong>Local Soap</strong><br/>These are meant for a purpose not medically investigated but meant for cleaning ability.<br/>a.       Black soap<br/>b.       Sida Soap.</p> <p>But here we are basically on the one made from Local raw material, which is the black soap (Ncha Nkota).</p> <p>1.4     <strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVES</strong><br/>I.       <strong>AIM</strong><br/>Preparation of soap using local raw materials.<br/>II.      <strong>OBJECTIVES</strong><br/>1.       To prepare local soap with woodash derived from the calyx and the corolla of palm flower (Ejeasis Guineensis), which serves as an alkali.<br/>2.       To know the trees in which caustic alkali can be obtained apart from palm tree (EleasisGuineensis).<br/>3.       To improve the properly preparation of local soap and high quality local soap.<br/>4.       To educate some illiterate local soap producers on how to set a standard in the production of local soap and still retain its effectiveness and for a wider acceptability.<br/>5.       To create awareness on the need and importance of locally made soap analysis.<br/>6.       To make known to or enlighten especially the local soap producers (both urban and rural manufacturers) on the best and exact quantity or raw materials and methods to use to achieve better results in their products.</p> <ol><li>This research project could as well as form basis for further research work on local soaps analysis in this institution.</li> </ol> <p>1.5     <strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong><br/>The problems why people are no longer interested in the local soap is because it causes irritation of the skin; Reason, because they are not medically investigated and are not dirtiness causes dust, grief and stiffs on fabrics in the heading process becaus3 of the inaccurate measurement of the alkali and inability to bring out the purest form of the alkali.  Also some smokes and wood particles enter into the pot of soap on stirring because of inability to maintain a hygienic on cooking and on stirring.</p> <p>1.6              <strong>HYPOTHESIS</strong><br/>H1              :         Raw Materials can be used in making local soaps<br/>Ho              :         Raw materials can not be used in making local soap.</p> <p>1.7     <strong>SIGNIFICANCE</strong><br/>This soap includes “Builders” as alkaline compound, which improve the cleansing efficiencies, example, in washing of cloth, washing of plate and washing of kitchen utensils. </p> <p>1.8     <strong>LIMITATION OF THESE STUDIES</strong><br/>This research work is limited by the extraction of alkali to manufacture good quality local soap with the leaching process and filtration method and it’s cr6stallization.</p>\n\nPREPARATION OF LOCAL SOAP WITH WOODISH DERIVED FROM THE CALYX AND THE COROLLA OF PALM FLOWER (EJEASIS GUINEENSIS)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PREPARATION OF LOCAL SOAP WITH WOODISH DERIVED FROM THE CALYX AND THE COROLLA OF PALM FLOWER (EJEASIS GUINEENSIS)", "id": 23}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p> <p>In comparing the antimicrobial strength of three most common antibiotics, which includes: streptomycin chloranphenicol and gentarccin. <br/>Samples of urine and high vaginal swab (H.V.S) were collected from park lane Enugu.

A fermented cereal product is known as paplogi).  Corn is processed into traditional food such as paplogi) Umo and fields 1981).</p> <p>        Pap is a fermented non-alcoholic starchy food and is a major staple food widely consumed in west Africa.  It is a sour fine past beverage which when cooked produces a thin semi solid porridge. Pap (Ogi) porridge has a smooth texture and a sour taste resembling that of yoghurt,.  In Nigeria, some states such as Anambra, Imo, Enugu and Abia refer to it as Akamu but Ogi is a Yoruba name but most state of Nigeria, it refers to maize pap.  On the other hand, sorghum pap is known as Ogi baba while millet pap is known as Ogi gero in Yoruba (Banigi 1977, Onyekwere and Akinrele 1977).</p> <p>        Pap logi) can be consumed with variety of other product including with bread, steamed been cake (moi-moi), fried bean cake (Akara), fried yam and plantain etc.  it is used as a main meal for adult and sick patients and it is suitable for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Pap is widely used as the first native food given to babies at wearing to supplement breast milk and is a major breakfast cereal for pre-school children and adults.   It is consumed as a main meal for convalescing patients because it can easily be digested.  As a wearing food, it is utilized mainly by low income earners category, it is estimated that about 25 million or more adults eat it about 4-5 days weakly (Banigo 1972).  Milk and sugar may be added to improved the taske and nutritional quality.  Pap is cooked and turned into a stiff gel called Agidi which is similar to kenkey, a fermented shanian product (Muller 1988, withby 1968).  Some Yoruba indigens beliwved that pap is capable of stimulating the production of breast milk in Nursing mother (Bassir 1962).  However, there  has been no qualitative evidence of support of this belief.</p> <p>        In spite of it’s important in the Nigeria diet, pap manufacture is essential a home based industry.  There are at present no large scale factory operation for the production of pap.  The manufacture is carried out on a small scale by some house wives as a commercial venture in many parts of the country.  The cleaned grain free of dirt and impurities steeped in eastern ware, plastic or enamel pot for 1-3 days at room temperature, this is followed by wet milling and sieving.  Twenty-four (24) hours of sleeping leads to a greater depletion of the fermentable carbohydrate.  After sieving, the coarse material obtained is wash with water to separate more of the starch.  The filtered slurry is allowed to sediment and undergo further fermentation for 1-2 days at room temperature.  The coarse matter which is separated is used ad animal feed while the sediment (Pap) is boiled to obtain.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Microorganisms are involved in the processing of pap especially during fermentation and equally during storage.  Few organisms are found in the pap, if it is properly stored.  Their presence in pap during storage leads to irregular of flavour and loss of nutrients (van veen and steinkrans 1990).  This is the result of their metabolic activity in the stored pap.</p> <p>        The tradiitonal method of pap production using various grains encourage significant nutrient losses, Losses m,ay occur during steeping, milling and sieving.  Large parts of the protein in the grain is located in the testa and germ that are shifted off during processing.</p> <p>        Losses of fibre, protein, ash as well as some vitamins have been reported by Banigo and Muller (1972). Losses in nutrients could be minimized by using an improved wet milling method devised by Banigo and Muller (1972).  At the end of this work, the microorganisms found in stored pap was isolated and characterized.</p> <p><strong>1.3    AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STDU</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to isolate and characterize micro-organisms from stored pap.</p><p> SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ARE </p> <p>i.             To isolate and characterize bacterial contaminants from stored pap</p> <p>ii.            To isolate and characterize fungal contaminants from stored pap</p> <p><strong>1.4    HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p><strong>          HI:    </strong>Bacteria and fungi are involved in the fermentation and storage of maize pap.</p> <p><strong>1.5    JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Not very much work has been done in this in recent times, with reference to the microbiology of the process.  Some of the earliest workdone in this include those of Akiurele (1970-1977) and Barigo (1969, 1970, 1972, 1977).</p> <p><strong>1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Pap stored improperly for a relatively length of time is likely to develop microorganisms.  Therefore, the study is carried-out to identify this organisms and properly advice on the proper way of storing pap.</p>\n\nISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF MICROORGANISMS FROM STORED PAP (OGI)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF MICROORGANISMS FROM STORED PAP (OGI)", "id": 27}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>This project work is carried at the isolation and characterization of pathogenic bacteria from hawked suya meat,  were bought in full from the sellers and was collected in raps of aluminum foil.

This is also primarily a compact energy store (there are exception: because carbohydrate tend to be used by human is continuously glocueogaenic. Glucose is transported from the infer shine or liver to body cell via the blood stream and is made available for cell absorption via the hormone insulin (a peptide hormone produce beta cell of the pancreas and it central to regulate carbohydrate and fat metabolism in the body) produced in the body primarily in the pancreases. The mean normal blood glucose level in human is about 5.5moll or 100 mg/df. Howeverthis level fluctuate through at the day.</p> <p>Glucose levels are usually lowest in the morning before the first meal of the day (term fasting level) and rise after meal for an hour of two by a few. The normal blood glucose level (fasted while fasting  for non-diabetics, should be between 70 and 100mg/df, and blood sugar level for those without diabetes and who are not fasting should be below 129mg/df</p> <p>According to American Diabetes Association the blood glucose target range for diabetes should be 70-130(mg/df) before meals and less than 150mg/df after meals (as measure by a blood glucose monitor)</p> <p>Blood sugar level outside the normal range may be and indicator or a medical condition.</p> <p>A persistently high level glucose is referred to as Hyperglycemia, low level are referredto as Hypoglycemic.

In order to know if in determing whether the mean sample drawn from the normal population delicate significantly from the Reflation plus machine value varies a student test method was adopted, it show an individual being diabetic or not depend on whether or not the blood sugar level is low, option or high condition mast the associated with such variation. From the hypothesis drawn since the + cal value is greater than the tab, the null hypothesis is rejected. These implies that there is no significant difference between the glucose content of male and female.                     TABLE OF CONTENT Pages  Title         -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       - Dedication -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       - Certification        -       -       -       -       -       -       -       - Acknowledgment        -       -       -       -       -       -       - Abstract     -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       - Research article -       -       -       -       -       -       -       - CHAPTER ONE Introduction       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       Statement of the problem    -       -       -       -       -       -       Aim of the study         -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       Research question      -       -       -       -       -       -       - Limitation of the study         -       -       -       -       -       -       - Definition of term/analyms   -       -       -       -       -       -       CHAPTER TWO Background information      -       -       -       -       -       -       -       Blood sugar/importance       -       -       -       -       -       -       - Causes of blood sugar         -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       How sugar are processed in the body   -       -       -       -       -       Effect of blood sugar   -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       Hypoglycemia and cause     -       -       -       -       -       -       -       Sign and symptom or adrenergic manifestation      -       -       -       -       Treatment and prevention   -       -       -       -       -       -       - Hyperglycemia and causes -       -       -       -       -       -       - Symptom/adrenergic manifestation       -       -       -       -       -       -       Treatment and prevention   -       -       -       -       -       -       -       Diabetes and types     -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       Remedial measures     -       -       -       -       -       -       -       - Literature review         -       -       -       -       -       -       -       - CHAPTER THREE Material and method   -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       Material used     -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       - Sampling technique    -       -       -       -       -       -       -       - Method adopted         -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       Students test     -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       - Chapter four Result and discussion -       -       -       -       -       -       -       - Result       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       Discussion         -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       - Chapter five Summary and recommendation    -       -       -       -       -       -       Summary   -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       - Recommendation        -       -       -       -       -       --      -       -       -       - References        -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       - Appendix                         CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION The blood sugar concentration or blood glucose level is the amount of glucose (sugar) present in the blood of human or animals. The body naturally lightly regulate blood glucose level as a part of metabolic homeostatic (property of a system to regulate it internal environment and tends to maintain a stable, relatively constant condition such as temperature) glucose is the primary source of energy, for the body’s cell, and blood lipid. This is also primarily a compact energy store (there are exception: because carbohydrate tend to be used by human is continuously glocueogaenic. Glucose is transported from the infer shine or liver to body cell via the blood stream and is made available for cell absorption via the hormone insulin (a peptide hormone produce beta cell of the pancreas and it central to regulate carbohydrate and fat metabolism in the body) produced in the body primarily in the pancreases. The mean normal blood glucose level in human is about 5.5moll or 100 mg/df. Howeverthis level fluctuate through at the day. Glucose levels are usually lowest in the morning before the first meal of the day (term fasting level) and rise after meal for an hour of two by a few. The normal blood glucose level (fasted while fasting  for non-diabetics, should be between 70 and 100mg/df, and blood sugar level for those without diabetes and who are not fasting should be below 129mg/df According to American Diabetes Association the blood glucose target range for diabetes should be 70-130(mg/df) before meals and less than 150mg/df after meals (as measure by a blood glucose monitor) Blood sugar level outside the normal range may be and indicator or a medical condition. A persistently high level glucose is referred to as Hyperglycemia, low level are referredto as Hypoglycemic. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia , it result in the inability of pancreas to produce enough insulin and intake of alcohol causes an initial surge in blood surgeand later tends to cause level to fall also certain drugs can increase or decrees glucose level. www.wikipedia.org/wiki/blood.sugar    AIM OF THE STUDY To identify the optimal blood glucose target for glycemic control The relationship of high blood glucose with age The mean random glucose level of apparently healthy adult To compare the mean value for men and women.        RESEARCH QUESTION What is the physiological effects of blood glucose What are the hormonal regulation of blood glucose What is the health risk of high blood glucose Best time to check blood glucose.</p>\n\nFASTING BLOOD SUGAR ANALYSIS AND BLOOD SUGAR REGULATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FASTING BLOOD SUGAR ANALYSIS AND BLOOD SUGAR REGULATION", "id": 29}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p><em>This study produced bio-lubricant with palm kernel oil and compared its quality with Tonimas Oil ( A commercial lubricating oil in the market).

The quality of the lubricant produced was compared with Tonimas oil using the following parameter; kinematic viscosity at 40oc and 100oc, specific gravity at 15oc and flash point. Result of the tests carried out showed that the PKO based oil has KV at 100oc and 40 oc of 11.6cst and 128.00cst respectively, Specific Gravity at 15 oc of 0.8817 and flash point of 242 oc while Tonimas Oil has KV at 100 oc and 40oc of 12.06cst and 131.00cst respectively, Specific Gravity at 15 oc of 0.8985 and flash point of 262 oc. Comparison with Tonimas Oil showed that Tonimas Oil has better properties, However the tested quality parameters of the PKO based oil lie within the acceptable standard for lubricating oils by ISO.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0     </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     </strong><strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Fossil fuels are formed by natural process such as Anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms. The age of the organisms and their resulting fossils is typically millions of years and sometimes exceeds 650 million years (Tulsa and Tan, 2009)</p> <p>        Fossil fuels are non-renewable resource because they take millions of years to form and reserves are being depleted much faster than are being made. Fossil fuels such as petroleum, coal, natural gas and synthetic gas, which have been used to meet the energy needs of man, are associated with negative environmental impacts such as global warming (Munack, Schroder, Karh And Bunger 2001).</p> <p>        Besides, supply of this non-renewable energy resources is threatening to run out in a foreseeable future. More so, the use of fossil fuels contributes in the emission of green house gas, combustion of fossils also produce air pollutants such as Nitrogen oxides. Before now fossil fuel has been a raw material for producing lubricants and material like petroleum, diesel and graphite. Having seen all the negative environmental impact of fossil fuels, search for renewable energy resource and sources for energy and other application, like lubricants continuous to attract attention.</p> <p>        Lubricant is a substance capable of reducing friction by making surfaces smooth or slippery. Renewable energy resources like vegetable oils have been used to produce lubricants which are known as bio-lubricants. Bio-lubricants are prepared because they are biodegradable, non-toxic cheaper and have renewable resources unlike conventional mineral-base oils (Bandles and Bjorklund, 1992).</p> <p>        Bio-lubricants formulated from plants oils have the following advantages derived from the chemistry of the bases stock;</p> <p>Higher lubricity leading to lower friction losses.</p> <p>Lower volatility resulting in decreased exhaust emissions.</p> <p>Higher viscosity index</p> <p>Vegetable oil as a bio-lubricant has very low volatility due to the higher molecular weight of the triglyceride molecule. They have different unique properties compared to mineral oils, due to their unique chemical structure. Vegetable oils have a greater ability to lubricate and higher viscosity index. Superior anticorrosive properties are observed in vegetable oil and are induced by greater affinity for metal surface. High flash point over 300oc classify vegetable oils as non-flammable liquids.</p> <p>        However, the applicability of vegetable oils in lubrication is partly limited as this oil tends to show low oxidative stability and higher melting points. Production of vegetable oils is an attractive way of solving these problems (Meier, Mertzger and Schubert 2007) vegetable oil include groundnut oil, palm kernel oil, castor oil, palm oil, coconut oil etc.</p> <p>        Palm kernel oil (one of the vegetable oils) is an edible plant oil, from kernel seed (Elaesis guineensis), (Kwasi, Stein and Bunger, 2003).</p> <p>        Bio-lubricant are biodegradable, renewable, have higher viscosity and greater affinity for metal surface thereby lubricating the surface better. Palm kernel oil is composed of fatty acids esterified with glycerol just like any ordinary fat, it is high in saturated about 80% (Faessler, Peter and Less 2007).</p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>Statement of the Research Problem</strong></p> <p>At present the base oil for most lubricating sold in the market are obtained from petroleum which takes millions of years to form despite the fact that it is continuously being explored. This non renewable form of the major raw material for the production of lubricating oil necessitates research for renewable alternatives. Again lubricating oil from petroleum is not biodegradable and renders farmlands useless as it militates against the growth of growth of weeds and grasses let alone farm crops. This research is therefore geared towards producing a lubricant from a renewable source which will be more environmentally friendly and at the same time have acceptable quality. </p> <p><strong>1.3 Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p> The aim of this study is as follows;</p> <p>i.            To produce lubricant from palm kernel oil.</p> <p>ii.          To determine the quality parameters of the lubricant namely; flash point, viscosity at 40oc and 100oc and specific gravity</p> <p>iii.        To compare the quality of the lubricant produced with that of a commercial lubricant (TONIMAS Lubricant)</p> <p><strong>1.4 Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p> This study will be beneficial in the following ways;</p> <p>i.    The drivers will benefit from this work, in the sense that it will help to prolong the life span of the their vehicles.</p> <p>ii.  This work will be beneficial to the general public as it produced a bio-degradable and environmental friendly lubricant.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p> This study is limited to the following</p> <p>i.            Production of lubricant from palm kernel oil</p> <p>ii.          Comparative analysis of palm kernel lubricant and Tonimas lubricant.</p> <p>iii.        Carryout full analysis of Palm kernel oil, viscosity, flash point and specific gravity.</p>\n\nCOMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT OF LUBRICANT PRODUCE FROM PALM KERNEL OIL AND TONIMAS LUBRICATING OIL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT OF LUBRICANT PRODUCE FROM PALM KERNEL OIL AND TONIMAS LUBRICATING OIL", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0     </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   </strong><strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Proteins are essential nutrients for the human body (Hermann, 2002). They are one of the building block of the body tissue, and also serve as a fuel source. As a fuel, protein contain 4kcal 7kj) per gram, just like carbohydrates and unlike lipids, which contain 9kcal (37kj) per gram. The most important aspect and defining characteristics of protein from a nutritional stand point is its amino acid composition (Laurence, 2000).</p> <p>Proteins are polymer chains made of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds. During human digestion, proteins are broken down in the stomach to smaller polypeptide chain via hydrochloric acid and protease actions. This is crucial for the synthesis of the essential amino acids that cannot be biosynthesized by the body (Genton, 2010). There are nine essential amino acids which humans must obtain from their diet in order to prevent protein-energy malnutrition. They are phenylalanine, valine, lysine, leucine, threonine, tryptophan, methionine, isoleucine and histidine (Laurence, 2000). There are five dispensable amino acids which humans are able to synthesize in the body. These five are alanine, aspartic acid, sernine, asparagines and glutamic acid. There are six conditionally essential amino acids whose synthesis can be limited under special pathophysiological conditions, such as prematurity in the infant or individuals in severe catabolic distress (Laurence, 2000). These six are argnine, cysteine, glycine, glutamine, proline and tryrosine (Laurence, 2000). Sources of protein include grains, legumes and nuts, as well as animal sources such as meats, dairy products, fish and eggs (Young, 1994).</p> <p>African breadfruit (<em>Treculia Africana Decne) </em>belongs to the mulberry family. Moracceae, which is of African origin but now grown in the most tropical and sub-tropical countries (Agu and Nwabueze, 2007). African breadfruit or wild jack fruit in some areas, is a neglected and under exploited tropical tree (Osuji and Owei, 2010). </p> <p>According to Okonkwo and Ubani (2012), it is a common forest tree called various names among different tribes in Nigeria, such as “Ukwa” (Igbo), “afon” (Yoruba), “eyo” (Igala), “barafuta” (Hausa), “Ize” (Benin) and “edikang” (Efik). The tree crop is widely grown in the southern state of Nigeria where it serves as low cost meat substituent for poor families in some communities (Badifu and Akuba, 2001; Ugwu, et al, 2001). the plant produced large, usually round, compound fruit covered with pointed outgrowths and the seeds are buried in the spongy pulp of the fruits (Nwokolo, 1996). the seeds are seldom eaten raw but can be baked, roasted or fried before consumption, or they can be ground into flour in bakery products (Agu et al, 2007; Ijeh et al, 2010). African breadfruit seeds are highly nutritious and constitute a cheap source of vitamins, minerals, proteins, carbohydrates and fats.</p> <p>Brown beans (<em>Phaseolus Vulgaris) </em>is a herbaceous annual plant grown worldwide for its edible dry seeds (Known as just ‘Beans”) or unripe fruit (Green beans). It’s leaf is also occasionally used as a vegetable and the straw as fodder. It’s botanical classification, along with other phaseolus species, is as a member of the legume family fabaceae, most of whose members acquire the nitrogen they require through association with rhizoidal, a species of nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Edet, 1982). Beans are grown in every continent except Antarctica. Brazil and India are the largest producers of dry beans, while china produces by far, the largest quantity of brown beans. Worldwide, 23 million tones of dry common beans and 17.1 billion tones of green were grown in 2010 (Philips, 2010). Similar to other beans, the brown beans is high in starch, protein and dietary fiber, and is an excellent source of iron, selenium, potassium, molybdenum, thiamine, vitamin B6 and folate (Paul, 1998) .</p> <p>The soybean (<em>Glycine max </em>(L.) Merrill family Leguminosae, subfamily Papilionoidae) originated in Eastern Asia, probably in north and central china. It is believed that cultivated varieties were introduced into Korea and later Japan some 2000 years ago. Soybeans have been grown as food crop for thousands of years in China and other countries of East and South East Asia and constitute to this day, an important component of the traditional popular diet in these regions (William, 2003). Although the U.S.A and Brazil account today for the most of the soybean production of the world, the introduction of this crop to Western agriculture is quite recent. Soybeans are primarily, an industrial crop, cultivated for oil protein. Despite the relatively low oil content of the seed (about 20% on moisture-free basis), Soybeans are the largest single source of edible oil and account for roughly 50% of total oil seed production of the world (Singh, Nelson and Chung, 2008). With each ton of crude soybean oil, approximately 4.5 tons of soybean oil meal with a protein content of about 44% are produced. For each ton of soybeans processed, the commercial value of the meal obtained usually exceeds that of the oil. Thus, soybean oil meal cannot be considered by-product of the oil manufacture. The soybean is, in this respect, an exception among oil seed (Shurtleff; Steenhuis and Spiers, 2013). It can be calculated that the quality of protein in the yearly world production of soybeans, if it could be totally and directly utilized for human consumption would be sufficient for providing roughly one third of the global need for protein (William, 2003). This makes the soybeans one of the largest potential source of dietary protein. However, the bulk of soybean oil meal is used in animal feed for the production of meat and eggs. Despite considerable public and commercial interest in soybean products as food, the proportion of soybean protein consumed directly in human nutrition is still relatively small (Smith, 1972). </p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>It has been scientifically proven that every variety of beans is rich in protein and contains such amount of carbohydrates that is good for diabetic patients. This not the case with African breadfruit, while some say that it is highly protein ones other say it contains mostly carbohydrates. This controversy has created confusion to many especially diabetic patients who are cross road whether to keep eating it or not. This research is therefore aimed at setting the controversy.   </p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong>Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>The general objective of this present work is to determine and compare the protein content of breadfruit, brown beans and soybean.

It is a volatile flammable colorless liquid. It is a powerful psychoactive drug and one of the oldest recreational drugs. It is best known as the type of alcohol found in alcohol beverages and thermometer. In common usage, it is often referred to simply as alcohol or spirit (Brain and Allan, 2005).</p> <p>        Alcoholic beverages are divided into three general classes, beer, wines and spirits. They are legally consumed in most countries and over 100 countries have laws regulating their production and consumption. In particular, such laws specify the minimum age at which a person may legally buy or drink the minimum age varies between 16 and 25 years, depending upon the country and the type of drink. Most nations set it at 18 years of age. Alcohol beverages are valued on account of their flavour and their stimulating effect and hardly at all as a source of energy; nevertheless, it is worth nothing that the energy value of dry wine is about equal to that of milk. The three classes of alcoholic beverages are all made from carbohydrate materials by fermentation and their particular ingredient used and the way in which it is processed chiefly determines the character of the drink. The starting material used depends upon the product required. For example whisky is made from grain, Rum from molasses, wine from grapes, beer from malt and cider from apples (Morris Jacobs, 2009). The production and consumption of alcohols occurs in most cultures of the world, from hunter gatherer people to nation states.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of the Problem.</strong></p> <p>        Alcoholic beverages are often an important part of social event in these cultures. In many cultures, drinking plays a significant role in social interaction-mainly because of alcohol’s neurological effects. Alcohol is a psychoactive drug that has depressant effect. A high blood alcohol content is usually considered to be legal drunkenness because it reduces attention and slows reaction speed. Alcohol can be additive, and the state of addition to alcohol is known as alcoholism (Bamforth, 2006).</p> <p>        Alcohol-specifically ethanol (ethyl alcohol, EtOH, CH3CH2OH) is the most socially accepted additive drug, which can have life threatening health hazards, its pleasures are very widely acknowledged and form a bond of community for the majority of adults in Western countries. References to those pleasures from a kind of “standing joke” physical and mental discordination (disorientation are viewed with bemused affection). </p> <p><strong>1.3   Objectives of the study</strong></p> <p>The main objective is to analyze and determine the level of ethanol beverages made in Nigeria. </p> <p>The specific objective that will achieve the following</p> <p>1.  To ascertain the quality of alcoholic beverages produced in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To identify if there is proper monitoring and quality control </p> <p>Alcoholic beverages are a standard lubricant (anxiety-reliever) at social gatherings and those who refuse to consume ethanol run the risk of being social outcasts.</p> <p><strong>1.4   Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>        Health benefits are frequently claimed for alcohol when consumed in moderation. Most of the claimed benefits are associated with reducing cardiovascular disease. However alcohol health implication vulmently out weights its health benefit.

The yam tubers were bought from Eke Oko Market, in Orumba North L.G.A. Anambra State. The tubers were peeled and the peels washed, milled &amp; weighed. To 1000g of the powdered wort, distilled water was added, mashed &amp; filtered. Yeast &amp; malt were added to the filtered wort and allowed to stand for three days for fermentation. The fermented wort was distilled to collect a colourless liguid as the distillate. This distillate was neutral to litmus test, soluble in water, forms esters with acetic acid and positive to lucas test showing it to be a primary alcohol-ethanol.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Yams (Discorea spp) of the family Diocoreaceae are members of the flowering plant. They are monocots, related to palms, grasses and archids. Most yam species grow in the tropics and subtropics area with fairly heavy total annual rainfall, but with a definite day season. During the rainy season, they produced one or more underground tubers to store food and water through the dry season the tubers are thickened stems. Most yam plant have small flower with one plant having only male or female flower (Kay, 1987).</p> <p>The tubers of most species of yam are poisonous to humans. The cultivation of most yams is very labour intensive. Cultivated yams generally do not produce seed and so tubers or pieces of tuber must be planted in prepared soil, most often in wounds to grow new plants.</p> <p>Yams are nutritious food, providing carbohydrate, some protein, and mineral like phosphorus and potassium besides the use as food, yams have been symbolically associated with culture and ritualism in some parts of Africa, Asia and Latin Americas.</p> <p>According to Ogbuka (2005) Ethanol can be produce from starch –containing substances like maize, cassava and yam. Ethanol is a monohydric alcohol that is colourless and flammable, it is a 2 –carbon alcohol with molecular formular CH3 CH2 OH, its empirical formular is C2H6O. An alternative notation is CH3CH2 OH which indicates that the carbon of a methyl group (CH3) is attached to the carbon of an ethylene group (CH2-) which is attached to the oxygen  of a hydroxyl group (OH). Ethanol is a colourless liquid that burns with a smokeless blue flame. It has a choking smell and a boiling point of 780c. They are characterized by the possessing of phydroxyl group (OH) as their functional group. Alcohols can be classified as primary, secondary and tertiary. The primary alcohols have only one or no alkyl group attached to the hydroxyl bonded carbon atom, the secondary alcohol contain two alkyl group attached to the hydroxyl bonded carbon atom while the tertiary alcohol contains three alkyl groups but no hydrogen attached to the hydroxyl- bonded carbon atom while the tertiary alcohol contains three alkyl groups but no hydrogen attached to the hydroxyl-bonded carbon atoms:</p> <p>According to West et.al (2007) ethanol is a principle fuel that can be used as petrol substitute for vehicles. It is a renewable energy source produced mainly by sugar fermentation process.

It is a parasitic disease carried by fresh water snail infected with one of the five varities of the parasite schistosoma. Found predominantly in tropics and sub-tropical climates. (Chitsulo, 2000), schistosoma ranks second only to malaria as the most occurring parasitic disease in the tropics (chitsulo, 2000).</p> <p><strong>1.1                           BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        The schistosomes or blood flukes belong to the class trematoda of the phylum platyhelmintes. They are parasites of the blood stream of warm blooded vertebrates. The species which infect man are schistosoma haematobium, s mansoni, s intercalum and s japonicum. They cause the disease known as schistosomiasis or bilharziasis (uyaeme, 2011).</p> <p>        Urinary schistosomiasis caused by fluke worm s haematobium is one of the most common tropical olisease which poses serious health hazard due to its associated morbidities. Globally, over 153 million people are infected with this parasitic infection (WHO1999). In Nigeria, a good number of foci infections have been documented in various parts of the country (Egwunyenga et al, 1994).</p> <p>        In developing countries, the true epidemiological picture appears difficult because of inadequate researches in this direction despite its relevance in planning and control in any locality. This problem is compounded by the poor habits of people in developing countries in visiting hospital, for treatment. Also, self medication is still practiced as manifested by anti-helmintic abuse. This act is worsened by presence of inadequate health facilities. One of the consequences of the self-medication of the anti-helminthics abuse includes the suppression of the egg laying capacity of the worms. The net effect is erroneous diagnosis using ova in urine in any locality. This may also become evident in sub clinical cases and period of immaturity of the worms when they are yet to commence egg laying. Another obvious difficulty occurs during the early stages of infections. Although the uses of serological diagnosis are available, poverty poses a serious impediment to the applications of serology in the epidemiological work in these countries.</p> <p>The spined eggs are laid in water, the eggs hatch into ciliated miracidia which bore into the tissues of certain fresh water snails, the intermediate host. Within the snail, each miracidium forms a sporocyst which reproduces asexually to give rise to cercariae (Raven and Johnson, 1996 cercariae production may continue for several weeks, over 300 being produced each day from a single sporocyst. The cercariae leaves the snail and swim in the water. They gain entry into man, the final host, by penetrating the skin. once in the body system, the cercariae develop into the adult fluke where they cause schistosomiasis.</p> <p><strong>Characteristic /features</strong></p> <p>1.  They are dioecions i.e sexes are separate and there is sexual dimorphism</p> <p>2.  The male and female always occur together and the larger male carries the slender female in it’s ventral groove or gynaecophoral canal.</p> <p>3.  They live in the blood stream of vertebrates.</p> <p>4.  The eggs are not operculate and are usually armed with a spine.</p> <p>5.  The furcocerous cercariae penetrates directly through the skin into the definitive host</p> <p>6.  It is a water-borne disease with water snails as the intermediate host.</p> <p>7.  There are two suckers, an oral and a ventral sucker (acetabulum).</p> <p>8.  The alimentary canal consists only of intestinal caeca without an anus. (Uyaeme, 2011).</p> <p>Habitat.</p> <p>Schistosoma haematobium occurs in the veins of the vessical plexus surrounding the urinary bladder of man. it is found throughout Africa, middle East and India. the skin or integument is spined. The snail hosts are members of the genius Bulinus which are fresh water snail. it is the agent of haematuria and in renal schistosomiasis, the eggs are voided via urine (Uyaeme, 2011).</p> <p>Raven and Johnson (1996) stated that the wide spread, introduction of irrigation in the tropic has contributed greatly to the spread of this serious disease, by spreading habitats for the snails that carry the worms. The disease is an occupational hazard because people are infected due to the type of occupation (job they do). It is water borne, people that frequent stagnant water bodies like lakes, streams, ponds, dams e.t.c are at risk of being infected. The presence of the appropriate snail host in a habitat is also important in the disease transmission. Pollution of water with human faeces and urine due to bad sanitary habits or disposition of human wastes in water bodies is also important.</p> <p><strong>Economic importance</strong></p> <p>Schistosoma haematobium causes schistosomiasis also known as Bilharzia. Hosts of the parasites are humans and affect about 200 million people worldwide and is considered one of the most serious pathogenic infections today (chitsulo, 2000).</p> <p>S  haematobium is pathogenic to humans and causes spot of blood in the urine and sometimes in the stool, this leads to haematuria (Uyaeme, 2011).</p> <p>S haematobium causes cough, fever, skin inflammation and tenderness of the liver because the spined eggs attach to vital organs and cause tissue degeneration. Later stages may cause swelling and damaging of the liver and other organs. the eggs of S haematobium can clog the bladder neck and cause infection chronic schistosomiasis raises the incidence of bladder cancer in many middle eastern countries (Roberts et al, 2000).</p> <p>Calcified eggs embedded in the bladder wall increase the chances of blockage of the vessels. Although other species of schistosoma are also of medical importance.</p> <p>S haematobium is the only species that affects human urinary system (Baschi, 1991).</p> <p>Considering the high morbidity and mortality associated with Schistosoma infection in man, it is important that before any control measures can be attempted, a thorough knowledge of the disease pathogen, the epidemiology, the life cycle and the economic importance as well as the egg shape must be well understood.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>There are reports of urinary schistosomiasis all over Nigeria, which constitute a public health problem particularly among children. (Sulyman et al, 2009). The distribution of the disease is focal, aggregated and usually related to water resources and development schemes such as irrigation projects, rice/fish farming and dams.(mafe et al, 2000). This disease is predominant in Agulu owing to the fact that this town is surrounded by a lake and the inhabitants frequents the lake, while some always get in contact with water because farming is their major occupation.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>        The significance of this study is to determine the incidence of urinary schistomiasis among the inhabitants of Agulu. The importance of this study extends to revealing the contributory risk factors of the disease in Agulu and to suggest ways to control or prevent the disease. </p> <p><strong>1.4 Objectives of the study</strong></p> <p>i. Determining the incidence of urinary schistosomiasis among the inhabitants of Agulu.</p> <p>ii. Determining the socio-economic and environmental factors that can lead to urinary schistomiasis among the inhabitants of Agulu.</p> <p>iii. Developing strategies to control the disease in the town.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Scope of the study</strong></p> <p>        This research work has been limited within Agulu and its environs. There are many school but only three primary school has been used. With this perspective, the analysis of the incidence of urinary schistomiasis among both male and females of different ages in Agulu must not be neglected for a better result.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Limitations of the study</strong></p> <p>        As a result of inadequate information, coupled with time and financial constraints, the study was not an easy one. Most of the inhabitants had the expression that giving out their urine should be seen as exposing themselves to danger hence their refusal to give out the sample, few refused as a result of ignorance and formal education.</p>\n\nINCIDENCE OF URINARY SCHISTOSOMIASIS AND THE CONTRIBUTORY RISK FACTORS AMONG SCHOOL CHILDREN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INCIDENCE OF URINARY SCHISTOSOMIASIS AND THE CONTRIBUTORY RISK FACTORS AMONG SCHOOL CHILDREN", "id": 34}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This work is aimed at determining the incidence of bacterial injections such as Salmonella and Escherichia coli which cause health hazards to the poultry in their feeds.

The samples were screened for total aerobic bacteria count, total coliform count and the characterization of the bacteria isolates carried out while indole test and citrate test were used to confirm the presence of Escherichia coli. The confirmation of salmonella isolates on Mac conkey agar was also done.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>The term poultry used in agriculture generally refers to all domesticated birds kepts for egg or meat production. These includes chickens (domestic fowls), Grallus domestics, turkeys, ducks and geese. This project will deal largely with the chicken which are the most common domestic fowl. The species of poultry are aptable or can survive in different environments therefore, they are widely distributed in the world, with great increase in population, the demand for goods especially protein food become acute. To meet the demand for animal protein and its development, rapid multiplying ones becomes very necessary. Poultry has so many advantages over other domesticated animal whose production is very much hindered by lack of money, high temperature, disease and lack of good at certain periods of the year.<br/>The diseases of poultry is like the disease of other animals may be caused by: a. pathogenic organisms like bacteria and viruses, protozoa, worms and some members of arthropods<br/>b. Nutritional deficiency, (c) From wound or cannibalism<br/>The following diseases are usually associated with the fowls locally<br/>1. New castle disease<br/>2. Chronic respiratory diseases<br/>3. Fowl typhoid<br/>4. Coccidiosis<br/>5. Fowl pox<br/>The incidence of salmonella and Escherida coli simply means the extent to which the enteric organisms (Escherichia coli) that are part of the normal flora and incidentally causes disease and pathogenic organism (salmonella) affect the poultry feeds. Hill, D.H; and Davis, O.s; (1962). Shoening et al 1942). Defined diseases as any abnormal condition of the tissue of the body, the cells that make up the various tissue have specific functions to perform. Pekzar et al (1977) defined Salmonell is as a disease of the chick fowl and swim bird cause by some species or Salnaonells. <br/>Anon (1963) described pullorum disease as an actute infection disease of body chicks caused by salnonella pullorum. Infection is the entering of the disease produces organisms into the animal. <br/>Livestock (Poultry )gets infected when pathogenic organisms passes to the susceptible animal through the through the following avenues. Esmat.omar 1977.<br/>1. Feeds and contaminated water feed or water containing droppings or waste products of diseased animal will help spread the organisms to fresh hosts. The feeding troughs and watering vessels aso spread the diseases if not seperated.<br/>2. Dropping or excretes: These material are the gateway out for some stages of oarganisms to go out of the host and get to fresh animal hosts.<br/>3. Close contact – some disease spread by contact. Their agents may be external parasites or air borne in which case nearness to the superior’s birds increase the changes of getting the organisms<br/>4. To or event the disease pathogenic organism from getting into the body of poultry, attention should be payed to those factors that influence their infections and spread. First and foremost, they should have disease resisting stock, provide good shelter, clean range, proper feeding and practise separating the unhealthy ones from the healthy poultry, quarantining new stock. In case of poultry, the brooder house should be 30m to 48m from old birds. Such that they gets good feed and sunlight. They should act be allowed to get in contact with their droppings or excretes since their dropping carry the pathogenic organisms. Sanitation is very important in poultry management by cleaning of water cans and feed troughs and finally disinfecting the stock to help reduce organic matter.</p> <p><strong>1.1 JUSTIFICATION</strong><br/>This study has been justified by the need and safety of consuming children (white meat) which has low cholesterol but rich in protein than beef which has high cholesterol. Also human beings and the world at large, benefit from our poultry farms where we have the layers (Egg producing Chiks) and the broilers (Heavy chicks) for consumption.<br/>The poultry (chicken) are rich in protein and amino acid needed for growth. Livestock feeds are formulated to a ratio for different species and classes of poultry. These are also feed additive, which may be added to the feed to prevent disease or make animals utilize feed better. Some ingredient concentrate is added to nourish the feed.</p> <p><strong>1.2 AIMS AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>1. To highlight the varius importance of the livestock (poultry) t human and our industries.<br/>2. To determine the incidence of bacteria infection such as balmonella <br/>and Escherichia coli which cause health hazard to the poultry (Chiken).<br/>3. To isolate and deduce effect of salmonella specie and Escherichia coli <br/>in livestock (poultry) and their feeds.<br/>4. To advice poultry farmers on how to preserve and handle their farms <br/>feeds from infections diseases to the birds.</p> <p><strong>LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong><br/>This research work will be limited to the available materials for carrying out experimental work and also due to cost of transportation. This work will be limited to Enugu metropolis.</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS</strong><br/>HYP. 10:- Salmonella and Escherichia coli are the major causes of bacteira infection found in livestock (poultry) feeds.<br/>HYP. II: - salmonella only is the infection that effects the livestock (poultry) feeds.<br/>HYP. II0:- Escherichia coli only is the bacteria infection that effects the livestock (poultry) feeds.)</p> <p><strong>STATEMNET OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>1. poultry feeds are infected during procession by handling, mixing of ingredient and exposing the raw materials and furnished products to the atmospheric micro organism.<br/>2. Poultry (birds) are being infected through the consumption of the contaminated feeds and unpurified water<br/>3. Also when the healthy and unhealthy birds are fed together from the some feeding trough and water vessels, eventually the pathogenic and the enteric organisms from infested ones may widely spread<br/>4. Salmonella and Escherichia coli as the bacterial organisms effects the essential requirement of the body such as water, carbohydrate, fats, vitamin, minerals and protein thereby reducing the content of the nutrient needed for the food to the palatable and easily digestible<br/>5.

The organism isolated were gram positive rod and gram positive cocci. The antimicrobial activity of chewing stick was performed from isolates gotten from the teeth. The organisms included are gram positive cocci and gram positive rod, decoction method was used for the extraction of the active compounds from the plant. The result revealed that the chewing stick showed activity against gram positive rod at the concentration of 62.5mg/ml with the zone of inhibition of 7mm and 5mm. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC mg/ml) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC mg/m) was determined to show that the extract exhibited the growth of the test organism with the MIC between 62.5mg/ml. </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></em><br/>The use of chewing sticks has been documented since ancient times. This kind of tooth brushing has been used by the Babylonians some 7000 years ago (Enwonwu et al, 2002) in many traditional cultures, there are no plastic-bristle brushes, rather, the use of herbal chewing sticks for rehiring dental problems is common. The cleansing efficacy of chewing sticks is attributed to the mechanical effects of its fibres release of beneficial chemicals or a combination of both (EL. Said et al, 1976). Some African chewing sticks are also reported to contain fluoridations, silicon, tannic acid, sodium bicarbonate and other natural plague inhibiting substances that can reduce bacterial colonization and plague formation (Pathol 1997).<br/>Tannin exerts an astringent effect on the action of glucosyltransferase thus reducing the clinically detectable gingivitis. Tannins also inhibit the action of glucosyltransferase this reducing plague and gingivitis (Almas &amp; Allafl 1995). Resumes forms a layer over the enamel and this protects against caries. Alkaloids exert bactericidal effect in the oral cavity (Gerrit 1993) Essential (volatile) oils possess characteristic normal and exert antiseptic action (Almas East 1993). They would have their East sulphur compounds have a bactericidal action (Aklitar M.S. 1981). Vitamin C is antioxidant and helps in the repair of tissues. Sodium bicarbonate has abrasive properties and is, thus, used as dentifrice in addition to having a mold germicidal action (Hardy J. 2003). The high concentrations of chloride inhibit calculus formation (Darout .A. 2000) and help in the rerouting of stains from the teeth (Almas East 2003) saturation of saliva, which inhibits demineralization and promotes remineralization of tooth enamel. <br/>A great number of these plant species have related medicinal properties that may be antibacterial D. benthamianusis rich in flavonoid compound (Ghawla, 1983) such as oxyayain A, oxyayain B, Ayanin and Distemonantin. These components have been implicated in anti-tumor activity, antioxidative activity (Rubola &amp; Tanaka, 1993), antiarenergic activity and treatment of bacteria, fungi and viral (Chawla, 1983). Anogeissuleicarpus is also another plant species used in traditional medicine as a remedy for many ailments of livestock and man, which include helminthosis, schistomiasis, leprosy, diarrhea and psoriasis (El Mostehy and Dorner WG, 1981). In addition to these applications, Hollist (19) reported that A. Leiocarpusis one of the major plants commonly used as chewing stick in Nigeria. Fagarazanthoxyloides is also widely distributed in Africa countries. The root-back extract is used in treating elephantiasis, toothache, sexual impotence, gonorrhea malaria, dysmenorrhoea and abdominal (George et al ,1985). Many studies have demonstrated the antimicrobial, anticarries, anti-therapeutic and antifungal properties of both aqueous and ethanolic extracts of various chewing stick.(Mohammed A, Turner JE,1983). There are documented reports on the antimicrobial activity of a Leicarpuson oral-microflora. (kubotak et al 1988) reported the antimicrobial effects of its root extract on Staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeroginosa (Al Lafit, Ababreh H 1995). Workers in west Africa have also reported the anti-sickling and antimicrobial activity of the extracts of fagarazanthoxyloides (Hattab FN, miswak,1997). Water extracts from the plant showed activities against bacteria significant to periodontal disease (Hardy j&amp; Ezirmly,1997).The antimicrobial activity of the methanolic extract of the root bark of F. zanthoxyloides was also reported (Ndungu et al,1990) and it is a very popular anthelmintic amongst the various tubes in Uganda. It has also been found that the alchoholic extracts of the root-bark possesses considerable antibacterial (Acta odontal,scand 1989). An anti-sickling agent (AL-Otaibi 2003) and anti-inflammatory amide were isolated from the plant. Therefore, this paper examines the inhibitory activity of some selected Nigerian chewing stick extracts against selected and clinical isolates of candida species.</p>\n\nEFFICACY OF THE EXTRACT OF CHEWING STICK ON THE AGENTS OF DENTAL CARRIES ISOLATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFICACY OF THE EXTRACT OF CHEWING STICK ON THE AGENTS OF DENTAL CARRIES ISOLATE", "id": 36}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This work was done in order to investigate the microbial content of some bolted soft drivels sold in Enugu interlopes.

The food and drug administration standard of identity for carbonated soft drink define them as a class of beverage made by absorbing carbodiocide in potable water. The amount of carbonhdioxide used is not less than that which well be absorbed by the beverage at a pressure of one atmosphere and a temperature of 60F. these drinks contain no alcohol, or only such alcohol (not in excess of 0.5% by weight of the finished beverage) as is contributed by the flavoring ingredient that may be use in carbonated soft drinks in such properties are reasonable required to accomplish their intruded effects. These include nutritive sweeteners flavoring ingredient natural and antificial colour additive acidifying agent buffering agent emulsifying stabilizing or viscosity producing agent foaming agent caffeine and chemical preservatives the beginning of the carbonated beverage (soft) drinks) as recorded by Resrosier (1977) date back to the closing years of the eighteen (18th ) century <br/>Morris (1959) defined micro organisms as plant or animal organisms of microscopic or submicroscopic dimensions. Plant microorganisms are generally classified into three major groups, namely fungi bacteria and Algae as for as beverage manfacture is concerned the fungi are the most important group of spoilage organisms because yeast and mould belong to this group. The protozoa are the most important of the animal microorganisms. <br/>Actually individual microorganisms are microscopic in size they can form colonies clouds precipitates sediments and scums with time and these are visible to the naked eyes and are the direct signs of the presence of microorganisms.<br/>The microbiological safety and ratability of the diverse type of soft drinks products depend on their formulation (including) the use of chemical preservative carbonation low PH values and pasteurization) this was stated by ganglion (1982). Batchelor (1985) put it that the inter related environmental factors that determine the microbial load of product or the susceptibility of a product to microbial spoilage are intrinsic and Extrinsic factors. <br/>Intrinsic factor are derived from the product and its formulation according to pauezai comments they are not easy to change Extrinsic factor are variable introduced during processing packaging distribution and storage. They should be easier to change and control. Girighano further recorded that control should be by application of the air Hazard Analysis critical Control point (HACCP) system to raw material formulating processing condition and packaging examples of such control would be :<br/>a. Measurement of temperature during heat treatment of pasteurized product <br/>b. Measurement of carbonation level by routine monvtorning of carbendioxide pressures in carbonated products <br/>c. Measurement of pH water activity product viscosity and preservatives in combination with other formulation parameters <br/>d. Maintenance of good hygienic practice to prevent the building up of spoilage organisms on the plant equipment and in the production areas. <br/>Most microbiological problem arise because of poor quality of raw material (eg fruit concentrates sugar and syrup) poor processing hygiene packaging material and storage condition and these lead to over coming of the preservation system applied drinking manufactures or production of the beverages (soft drinks) by the micro organisms.</p> <p><strong>JUSTIFICATION</strong><br/>Soft drink are consumed in large quantities by the massed both male and female cutting across different age group adult and children of different classes of people all oven the state. This is aided by the general availability of these drinks almost every place where people gather for work or recreational activities so it is necessary to let the people taking this soft drinks know the consequences of leaving their drink open there by allowing some microorganisms which grow in the presence of air (acropea or acrophile organisms) to gain their way into the drink. Also for then to know the implicated organism in the soft drink thereby helping them to reduce their soft drink intake.<br/><strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVES</strong><br/>Aim and objective of this project is to investigation the microbial content of bottled soft drinks by:<br/>i.

In all, the results show that they correspond to the WHO/NAFDAC standard for chlorine content in drinking water.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.0            INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1     Background of the study </p> <p>`        Chlorine is a greenish-yellow gas that dissolves easily in water.  It has a pungent, noxious colour that some people can perceive smell at concentrations above 0.3 part permillion.  Chlorine is an excellent disinfectant commonly added to drinking water supplies to kill harmful micro-organism.  Chlorine is not  only an effective disinfectant but it also reacts with ammoniamiron and other metal  s and  some organic compounds to improve overall water quality (white, 2000).</p> <p>          In parts of the world when chlorine is not added to drinking water, thousands of people die each day from waterbone disease like typhoid and cholera according to (Darnail 1999).  However, the addition of chlorine in water has its limitations but its dangers, are relatively shortlived compared to the dangers of most other highly poisonous substances.  Rideal et al, (2005) suggests that  this is because chlorine reacts quickly with other substance in after (and  forms combined chlorine)  or escapes  as a gas into the atmosphere.  The free chlorine test measures only the amount of free or dissolved chlorine in water, but the total chlorine test measures both free and combined of chlorine.</p> <p>          According to Richardson et al (2007), if the water contains a lot of decaying  materials, free chlorine can combine with them to form disinfection –by- products like  tribhalomethanes.  Though there is a limit to the use of chlorine as negative results are possible with the addition of too odour in water are often enhanced.</p> <p>          Fair et al, (2000) states that less than one half (0.5mg/L) of free chlorine is needed to kill bacterial without causing water to smell or taste unpleasant. Most people cannot detect the presence of chlorine on water  amount (1.0mg/l).  although 1.0mg/l chlorine in water is not harmful to people, it does cause problems to fish and other aquatic animals when they are expose to it over along period of time.  It is very important for  water suppliers to monitor closely the level of chlorine present in the water (Hodges 1997).</p> <p><strong>RISK OF WATERBORNE DISEASE</strong></p> <p>          Where adequate water treatment is not readily available, the impact on public health can be devastating (White, 2002), would.  Worldwide, about 1.2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water and twice that number may have adequate sanitation (Christian et al, 2001).  As a result the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.4 million people mostly children die, every year from water related diseases.  Ridealetal (2005). Even where treatment is widely practiced constant vigilance is required to guard against  waterborne disease outbreaks.</p> <p>          Well known pathogens such as Ecoli are easily controlled with  chlorination but  can cause deadly outbreak give condition if inadequate  or disinfection (Richardson, et al 2007).  Some emerging pathogens like osporiolianare resistance to chlorination and can appear even in high quality water supplies.  Cryptosporidium was the cause of the longest reported drink water in United state (Craun et al, 2002).  The new regulation from U.S Environmental Protection Agency will require water system to monitor cryptosporidium and adopt a range of treatment options based on source water cryptosporidium concentrations.  Most water systems are expected to meet EPA  requirement while continuing to use chlorination.</p> <p><strong>1.2            </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>There has been high prevalence of water borne disease in <br/> Enugu metropolis judging from the hospital statistics hence the need to know if the cause has been from the method of water treatment employed in the purification of drinking water supplied to the municipality.</p> <p><strong>1.3            </strong><strong>AIMS  OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>·        To determine the chlorine content to water from Ajalli water source.</p> <p>·        To compare the chlorine content in the drinking water in Enugu metropolis with World Health Organization standard.</p> <p>·        The study will also evaluate the effect of bad water chlorination and the harms of indisinfecter drinking water.</p> <p><strong>1.4            </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCES OF THESTUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work is meant to elucidate the actual concentration of chlorine in Enugu drinking water and to make known the processes or steps taken in the treatment of the water.  Also to establish whether some prevalent disease could be traced to the way drinking water in Enugu is treated.</p> <p><strong>1.5     SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work is limited to the determination of the chlorine content in raw Ajalli water source the treatment of water and the tap water within Enugu.</p>\n\nDETERMINATION OF CHLORINE CONTENT IN WATER FROM AJALLI SOURCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DETERMINATION OF CHLORINE CONTENT IN WATER FROM AJALLI SOURCE", "id": 38}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This project work is carried at the isolation and characterization of pathogenic bacteria from hawked suya meat,  were bought in full from the sellers and was collected in raps of aluminum foil.

Ten juvenile fishes were introduced in each aquarium, and  held for 24hours in the laboratory, inside these aquaria, filled with 10 litres of unchlorinated well water. After 24hours, fuel and  kerosene (500ml each) were introduced in each of the aquaria, while the third was used as control. Packed cell volume (PCV) values of the fish in fuel was 28.66+7.10a and was found lower than that in kerosene which was 29.67+ 71a . Hb reported in this study were 10.33+0.62a and 10.92 +0.51a  for the fish in fuel and kerosene respectively.  White blood cell recorded during this study was 188.98+4.88a and 190.01+ 3.20a  for fish in fuel and kerosene respectively are lower in control which was 290 +2.78a. Red blood cell values obtained from the fish in kerosene (2.96 +022a) in this study was higher than that observed in fish in fuel (2.42 +0.12a .The Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) values observed in this study (117.68+ 4.83a   and  120.20+ 2.01a) for the fish in fuel and kerosene respectively are lower than the control 132.20 +3.82a (fl). Mean cell haemoglobin values observed in this study were 42.65+1.99a  and 45.41 +0.02a for the fish in fuel and kerosene respectively. The higher lymphocytes (190.71 +5.23a) was observed in C. gariepinus  in than the fish in fuel which has lymphocyte level of  185.65+5.13a  these two compared to the control which has lymphocytes of 210.33 +7.05. However, all the blood parameters of fish species recorded during this study were within the healthy ranges for fish but suggest that morality depends on concentration. <br/><br/></div> <div> <div><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/><br/></strong></div> Title page                                        i<br/>Approval                                         ii<br/>Certificate                                     iii<br/>Dedication                                     iv<br/>Acknowledgement                                 v<br/>Table of contents                                 vi<br/>List of table                                     viii<br/>Abstract                                         x<br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER ONE <br/>1.0    Introduction                            <br/></strong>1.1   Background of studies                     <br/>1.2  Statement of problem                       <br/>1.3  Objective of the study                        <br/>1.4  Significance of study                          <br/>1.5  Limitation of the study                     <br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER TWO <br/>2.0 Literature review                              <br/></strong>2.1 The African catfish (Clarias gariepinus)        <br/>2.2  Eco¬nomic im¬por¬tance  of african catfish for hu¬mans     <br/>2.3  Petrochemicals                               <br/>2.4  Sources of petrochemical spill on aquatic Environment                               <br/>2.5  Toxicity of petrochemicals(petrol) on  fish          <br/>2.6  Haematological examination of the effect of petroleum by-products     on african catfish<br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0 Materials and method                            </strong><br/>3.1  Materials used for the experiment                <br/>3.2  Methods of sample collection                   <br/>3.3  Method sample analysis                        <br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong><br/>4.0 Presentation And Analysis Of Result                <br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>5.0    Discussion, Conclusion and recommendation         <br/></strong>5.1    Discussion                                 <br/>5.2    Conclusion                                 <br/>5.3    Recommendation                             <br/><strong>Reference                                     </strong><br/><br/><br/><strong>LIST OF TABLES</strong><br/><strong>Table 1:  </strong>  Blood profile of the Juvenile catfish Clarias gariepinus exposed to fuel, kerosene and the control.</div>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF PETROLEUM BY-PRODUCTS (FUEL AND KEROSENE) ON THE HAEMOGLOBIN OF AFRICAN CAT FISH (CLARIAS GARIEPINUS)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF PETROLEUM BY-PRODUCTS (FUEL AND KEROSENE) ON THE HAEMOGLOBIN OF AFRICAN CAT FISH (CLARIAS GARIEPINUS)", "id": 42}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Garlic (Alliums Sativum) and Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is hardy perennial of Asiatic origin, belonging to the plant family liliaceae.

The aim is to prepare cleansing cream of better quality than the available ones in the market. The study explores the work done by some eminent scholars in connection with cream and preparation of cleansing cream. Cream can be defined as an article intended to be rubbed, sprinkled, sprayed on, or otherwise applied to the human body or any part there of, for beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or attiring the physical appearance of the skin, leaving it soft and smooth, thereby making the body look younger. Creams are of different types which include: cleansing cream, eye and lip cleanser, floral oil, nourishing cleansing milk, and softening lotion etc. the present investigation revealed that temperature and concentration of materials have the most crucial effect on creams as manifested by precipitation, and separation and also loss of creamy effect. Cream emulsion containing hydroquinone, lightens and bleaches the skin while cream emulsion containing benzoic acids are agents against microbial attacks on the skin. The materials used in cleansing cream preparation include: paraffin wax, liquid paraffin, stearic acid, borax, and water. Finally, the performance was incorporate into the cream at the temperature of 450C and a white fine cream was obtained as the result of the analysis.</div> </div> <div> <div><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></div> <div>Title page</div> <div>Approval page </div> <div>Dedication</div> <div>Acknowledgment </div> <div>Abstract</div> <div>Table of contents</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div>1.1 Introduction</div> <div>1.2 Aim and objectives of the study </div> <div>1.3 Statement of problem</div> <div>1.4 Significance of the study</div> <div>1.5 Hypothesis</div> <div>1.6 Limitation of the study</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></div> <div>2.0 Literature review</div> <div>2.1 Definition of cream</div> <div>2.2 The historical background of cream</div> <div>2.3 Classification of cream</div> <div>2.4 Emulsions</div> <div>2.5 Emulsifying agents</div> <div>2.6 The colloid state</div> <div>2.7 Features of colloidal system</div> <div>2.8 Types of colloidal system</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></div> <div>3.1 Materials</div> <div>3.2 Method</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></div> <div>Result</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></div> <div>5.1 Conclusion</div> <div>5.2 Recommendation</div> <div><strong>Bibliography</strong></div> </div>\n\nPREPARATION OF CLEANSING CREAM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PREPARATION OF CLEANSING CREAM", "id": 44}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> The hardness of well water in Enugu metropolis (Asata, Coal Camp and New Haven) was determined using complexometric titration with EDTA (Ethylene Diaminetetracetic Acid) which is the most widely used complexing agent for the analysis of water hardness. During titration, indicator such as Erichrome Black-T was used which acts a triprotic acid. The following result were revealed after the analysis. The average amount of calcium and magnesium are as follows respectively. In Asata, it was 2.48mg/L for calcium and magnesium was 0.592mg/L = 3.072mg/L. Coal camp for calcium was 2.68mg/L and magnesium 2.68mg/L = 5.36mg/L whereas in New Haven, calcium was 2.48mg/L and magnesium 0.46mg/L = 2.94mg/L. With the results of the analysis shown, it was found that coal camp has high well water hardness because of its high degree of soil texture and soil pH. It can be vividly conclude that calcium and magnesium concentration in the water samples from these areas under study are above the standards set by World Health Organization and Water Quality Association. These increase result to soap solution forming a white precipitate instead of producing lathers when washing, this is because the 2+ ions destroy the surfactant properties of the soap. Continuous consumption of these hard waters may increase the rate of cardiovascular disease and mortality among people due to the high presence of calcium and Magnesium.     <br/><br/></div> <div> <div><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/><br/></strong></div> Title page <br/>Certification<br/>Dedication <br/>Acknowledgement <br/>List of tables<br/>Table of contents <br/>Abstract<br/><strong>CHAPTER ONE <br/>1.0    Introduction</strong><br/>1.1    Background of the study <br/>1.2    Statement of the problem <br/>1.3    Objective of the study<br/>1.4    Limitation of the study <br/>1.5    Signification of the study <br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER TWO <br/>2.0    Literature Review </strong><br/>2.1    Functions of Water <br/>2.2    Chemical Properties of Water<br/>2.3    Hardness of Well Water <br/>2.4    Causes of Hardness of Water<br/>2.5    Types of Hardness of Water <br/>2.6    Effect of water hardness on Material <br/>2.7    Effect of Water Hardness on Aquatic life<br/>2.8    The Concept of EDTA Method of Hard water Analysis<br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0    Methodology </strong><br/>3.1    Materials <br/>3.2    Water Sample Collection <br/>3.3    Reagent Preparation <br/>3.4    Water Analysis <br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong><br/>RESULTS<br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER FIVE </strong><br/>5.0 Discussion, Conclusion and Recommendation <br/>5.1 Discussion<br/>5.2 Conclusion <br/>5.3 Recommendation <br/><strong>References<br/>Appendix </strong><br/><br/><br/><strong>LIST OF TABLES</strong><br/><strong>Table 1:</strong> magnesium hardness in Asata<br/><strong>Table ii: </strong>Magnesium Hardness in Coal Camp<br/><strong>Table iii:</strong> Magnesium hardness in New Haven<br/><strong>Table iv:</strong> Summary of Magnesium Hardness in Well Water <br/><strong>Table v: </strong>Calcium Hardness in Asata<br/><strong>Table vi:</strong> Calcium Hardness in Coal Camp<br/><strong>Table vii: </strong>Calcium Hardness in New haven<br/><strong>Table Viii:</strong> Summary of Calcium Hardness in Well Water</div>\n\nDETERMINATION OF HARDNESS OF WELL WATER SUPPLY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DETERMINATION OF HARDNESS OF WELL WATER SUPPLY", "id": 45}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <br/>    In the work, samples of Garri obtained from Ogbete market were evaluated for microbial contamination.

In order to obtain the requires data, the researcher use some selected tertiary institutions in Enugu State with a total population of 610 respondents, 400 respondents were used as the sample size while instrument for data collection were questionnaire, text books and personal observation. Three research questions were formulated for the study.<br/>    The findings showed that:<br/>Enough equipment were not provided for imparting of the course.<br/>The financial involvement of the course is very high.<br/>Most of the students were not properly, guided by guidance and counsellors before enrolling into the department.<br/>The researcher finally made some useful suggestions and recommendation on the provision of required equipment for department of secretarial studies, that Government should come to the aid of tertiary institutions that are running this course since the equipment are very expensive. The researcher also recommended that guidance and counsellor services should be given to the students before choosing their courses also that there must be good report between students and lectures.   <br/><br/></div> <div> <div><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></div> <br/>Title page                        <br/>Approval page                        <br/>Dedication                        <br/>Abstract                            <br/>Acknowledgement                    <br/>Table of content   <br/>                 <br/><strong>CHAPTER ONE<br/>Introduction</strong><br/>1.1    Background of the study            <br/>1.2    Statement of problem            <br/>1.3    Purpose of the study            <br/>1.4    Significance of the study        <br/>1.5    Scope of the study                <br/>1.6    Research  questions     <br/><strong>       <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Literature review          </strong>          <br/>2.1    Definition an historical Background of a secretary    <br/>2.2    Distinguish between a Secretary and other categories Of clerical staff<br/>2.3    Duties and qualities of a secretary<br/>2.4    Difficulties faced by a Secretary<br/>2.5    Derision of a secretary<br/>2.6    Motivation factors of Secretaries<br/>2.7    Provision of adequate facilities equipments<br/>2.8    Importance of guidance and Counselling before choosing a career<br/>2.9    Summary of literature reviewed<br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER THREE<br/>Research design and methodology</strong><br/>3.0    Research method<br/>3.1    design of the study<br/>3.2    Area of the study<br/>3.3    Population of the study<br/>3.4    Sampling of the study<br/>3.5    Sampling techniques<br/>3.6    Discrimination of the instrument for data collection<br/>3.7    Validation of instruments<br/>3.8    Administration of instruments<br/>3.9    Techniques for data analysis<br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong><br/>Presentation and analysis of data<br/>4.1    Testing of research questions<br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>Summary of the findings conclusion, and recommendation</strong><br/>5.1    Summary of findings<br/>5.2    Conclusion<br/>5.3    Recommendations<br/>5.4    Suggested areas for furthers study<br/>5.5    Limitations  of the study<br/><strong>References<br/>Appendix<br/>Questionnaires</strong></div>\n\nAN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES OF STUDENTS POOR ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE STUDY OF SECRETARIAL ADMINISTRATION IN TERTIARY INSITUTIONS <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES OF STUDENTS POOR ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE STUDY OF SECRETARIAL ADMINISTRATION IN TERTIARY INSITUTIONS ", "id": 49}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PRODUCTION OF MOSQUITO REPELLENT USING ORANGE PEELS<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Mosquito repellents are substances that can be used to repel mosquitoes which are a vector that transmits malaria. A typical example of a mosquito repellent is mosquito coil which drives away mosquito when it is ignited. The smoke that is emitted from burning a mosquito coil contains active ingredients used to prevent mosquito from biting particularly during the hour of sleep having been designed to burn for hours. These active ingredients have known to act as repellent agent which cause a distasteful environment for the mosquito and act as agents of immobilization which disturbs the food searching mechanism of the mosquito. Orange peels (Cestrum) contain oil known as Limonene oil which has a lethal effect on mosquitoes and some other insects. It can be used as active ingredient to produce mosquito coil, which when ignited, will repel mosquitoes within the limits of the smoke.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER  ONE<br/>1.0    Introduction <br/>1.1    Background of the study <br/>1.2    Statement of the problem <br/>1.3    Objective of the study <br/>1.4    Significance of the study <br/>1.5    Scope of the study <br/>1.6    Research question  <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0    Literature Review <br/>2.1    Sources of vitamin c <br/>2.2    Functions of Ascorbic Acid <br/>2.3    Factors affecting ascorbic acid utilization <br/>2.4    Ascorbic acid determination <br/><br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0    Materials and method <br/>3.1    Apparatus <br/>3.2    Preparation of  Reagents <br/>3.5    Procedure <br/>Reference  <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>   INSECTICIDES (General Overview)<br/>Insecticide is a substance or a mixture of substances used for killing insects[1]. It is well known fact that many protozoal bacteria diseases are transmitted from man to man by insects. One may combat these diseases not only by means of prohylactic drugs but also by the destruction of the insects carriers.<br/>Insecticide is a chemical compound that is lethally toxic to insects either by ingestion or by body contact. It is applied to vegetation, crops and insect breeding areas either as liquid spray or as dry powder[2].<br/>They are used in agriculture, medicine, industry and household. The use of insecticides is believed to be one of the major factors behind the increase in agricultural productivity in 20th century.<br/>Nearly, all insecticides have the potential to significantly affect ecosystem, many are toxic to human and others are concentrated in food chains. It is necessary to balance agricultural needs with environmental and health issues when using insecticides. It is crucially important that all the rural derive in Nigeria are  educated on the need to eradicate insects especially mosquitoes that might breed  in their environment and transmit malaria to people living within the enclave. <br/> If insects becomes a problem despite the measures that must have been taken, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) seeks to control them using the safest possible methods targeting the approach to the particular pest. Years now, effort are geared towards controlling malaria infestation both in urban and rural areas a lot of measures are being take to reduce the number of death as a result of malaria. <br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Recent studies showed that the smoke generated form burning mosquitoes coil is of certain health concerns. A person being exposed to the smoke coming from the coil may suffer severe headache, nausea and vomiting, the condition will be severe among asthmatic patients. The emission from one burning coil can be as high as that released from 51 burning cigarettes. This is because of the chemicals found in mosquito coils out of natural ingredients may remove these problems. <br/>1.3    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>    The purpose of this work is to produce mosquitoes repellent using orange peels (cestrum) wastes perse, which will save the cost of production and purchase, thereby increasing it’s availability especially in the rural areas.<br/>If the work is successful, production of mosquitoes repellents using orange peels will provide source of employment to our teaming youths.<br/>Also make mosquito repellent within the reach of everybody.<br/>Thereby reducing the number of death due to malaria caused by mosquito bite.  <br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The importance of my project work is the producing of a mosquito coil that is not harmful to our health and killing mosquito that are vector carriers of malaria sickness and is environmental friendly. <br/>1.5    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>Orange peels (cestrum) will be collected and used for the production of mosquito coil. The produced coil will be tested for effectiveness performance and cost analysis should also be carried out to know if mass production will be encouraged. <br/><br/>\n\nPRODUCTION OF MOSQUITO

(Ugba) and Eleasis guineensis (Nkwu) as the source for the caustic alkali were compared for performance.  The woody tissue of the local trees were burnt at the temperature of 250 \" 700oc for a period of 3½ - 4 hrs.  But the optimum temperature for maximum extraction of the alkali from the ash is 600oC for a period of 45 \" 1hr 30 min.  Caustic alkali free from impurities was obtained by leaching the ash with water in a special fabricated filtrations apparatus.  And this by hot process by which the filtrate was decanted to another container and filtered through a filter paper placed inside the funnel for filtrations and the presence of Alkali was tasted by the action on litmus paper.  Change of damp red litmus paper to blue.</div> <div>Recall that soap is manufactured by the alkaline

materials. Paint simplified is a material which may be applied to surfaces in relatively thin layers and which changes to a solid and may occur by evaporation of solvents, by chemical reaction or by combination of the two. Artist paint is the paint used by artists to do their paintings. These paints comprises of the water color paint, poster color paint, oil paint, acrylic paint and so on. The method generally used in this work was first, the collection of pigment of different colors, grinding the gypsum and then mixing of the substances. After which the substances was thoroughly stirred for proper mixture and so as to obtain finely non-granulled paint. The product is much highly efficient than individual paints. And it is cheaper to operate from this project. It is quite possible to harness our natural endowment that will compete prodigiously with one produced abroad, hence, our artists will do her expensive painting and the need to import artist's paints will be avoided.  </div> </div> <div> <div><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></div> <div>Title Page</div> <div>Certification </div> <div>Dedication</div> <div>Acknowledgement </div> <div>Abstract </div> <div>Table of Contents</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0 Introduction</strong></div> <div>1.1 Properties of Artist Paint</div> <div>1.2 Aim and Objective </div> <div>1.3 Statement of Problem</div> <div>1.4 Justification of Study</div> <div>1.5 Limitation of the Study</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></div> <div><strong>2.0 Literature Review</strong></div> <div>2.1 Kinds of Artist Paint</div> <div>2.2 Properties of the Backbone Composition of Artist Paint</div> <div>2.3 The Backbone Composition</div> <div>2.4 The Characteristics Features of the Backbone Composition of Artist Paint</div> <div>2.5 Principles Guiding an Effective Artist Paint Formulation</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></div> <div>3.0 Methodology</div> <div>3.1 Raw Materials and Equipment</div> <div>3.2 Formulation</div> <div>3.3 Percentage Measurement of Materials Used</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></div> <div><strong>4.0 Results/Discussion</strong></div> <div>4.1 Results</div> <div>4.2 Discussion</div> <div>4.3 Observations</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></div> <div><strong>5.0 Conclusion and Recommendation</strong></div> <div>5.1 Conclusion</div> <div>5.2 Recommendation</div> <div><strong>5.3 Reference</strong></div> </div>                                                         \n\nFORMULATION OF ARTIST PAINT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FORMULATION OF ARTIST PAINT", "id": 53}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>The aim of this project is to designed and fabricate a machine that will automatically and simultaneously seal and cut sheets of polyphone into a required from.

Among these diseases is glaucoma which is the result of too much pressure in the eye. It is usually believed to begin after the age of 40 (forty) years and is a common cause of blindness (Mohammed, 2001).<br/><br/>Responsibility for health care in Nigeria is shared among the constitutional tiers of government: federal, state and local. The local governments are supposed to take care of the primary level (emphasizing preventive Medicare), while state governments are responsible for the secondary level (emphasizing curative Medicare), and the federal government is in charge of the tertiary level of care (emphasizing referral Medicare) to which teaching and specialist hospitals belong. This implies that there are basically three health care levels in Nigeria: primary, secondary and tertiary health care levels. (Anyanwu, Oyefusi, Oaikhegn, &amp; Dimowo 1997: 608).<br/><br/>In Nigeria, glaucoma constitutes a medical, public health and socio- economic problem. This is because Nigeria is found to be one of the most endemic countries in the world, accounting for a sizeable proportion of the global cases, with about 6.7 million patients with glaucoma worldwide (WHO, 1992). The damaging and insidious nature of glaucoma make it spread gradually without being noticed but causes serious harm.<br/><br/>The Basic Health Service (BHS) scheme formed an important health programme of the Third Development Plan (1975-1980) and Fourth Development Plan (1981-1985) of the Federal Government. Under the BHS the government intended to significantly improve the modern health care system of the country within the framework of a three-tier national comprehensive health care delivery system mentioned earlier. Record achievement from the implementation of the BHS shows increases in personnel and institutions. For example, the number of registered medical practitioners in Nigeria rose from 10,399 in 1981 to 16,145 in 1987 (Mbanefo, Soyibo &amp; Anyanwu) 1996.<br/><br/>However, the unsuccessful implementation of the BHS programme made the federal government to embark on a new direction health care delivery which makes Primary Health Care (PHC) the focus. There was need for close involvement of the local governments, local communities, and individuals in the implementation of the PHC in collaboration with the other two tiers of government. Activities that formed part of the PHC include: National Programme on Immunization (NPI), Campaign against River blindness, Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT), among others (FMH, 1988).<br/><br/>The incidence of glaucoma among adult patients refers to the rate of occurrence of this disease. In epidemiology the interest is in the number of new cases arising in a given period of time in a specified group of people.<br/><br/>The American Academy of ophthalmology (1983) notes that an estimated 2 million people have been identified as having glaucoma. Of these 889,000 are visually impaired, 67,150 are legally blind and each year an additional 5,500 people become blind from glaucoma. Equally, in 1997 glaucoma caused 36,000 hospital admission in America, 25 million office visits and more than $440 million spent on direct health cost on glaucoma.<br/><br/>It is from the implication of the data as given above and the fact that glaucoma is one of the avoidable causes of blindness that the need to maintain adequate and effective health care delivery system becomes imperative. Therefore this study examines the factors responsible for the occurrence of glaucoma among adult patients in Anambra state (2002- 2006).<br/><br/>Statement of the Problem<br/><br/>For Nigeria to achieve the state of complete physical, mental and social well-being of the population there is need to create awareness and stimulate actions from the community to achieve health. This can be accomplished through an effective health education which according to Onukwubiri (1994), bridges the gap between health information and health practices. It is any combination of methods designed to facilitate voluntary change of behaviours of individuals or groups to promote health.<br/><br/>In Anambra state there seems to be no relationship between health practices and the information available on people’s health. The researcher observed during her clinical posting to Eye clinic at the General Hospital Enugwu-ukwu that most adult glaucoma patients reported to the clinic when their eye conditions had deteriorated. Furthermore, the adults suffering from the disease are not aware of the disease occurrence.<br/><br/>The central focus of this study therefore borders on identifying the factors responsible for the spread of glaucoma in Anambra State. In other words what are those constraints to effective primary health care delivery and health education in the state. This is done by studying the records of adult patients in the three General Hospitals in Anambra State with functional eye clinics for the period between 2002 – 2006.<br/><br/>Purpose of the Study<br/><br/>The broad purpose of the study is to examine the factors influencing the incidence of glaucoma among adult patients (in general hospitals) in Anambra state (2002 – 2006) and to highlight the problems resulting from lack of information on factors influencing the incidence of glaucoma.<br/><br/>The specific objectives of the study include:<br/><br/>To determine the incidence of glaucoma among adult patients in Anambra state between 2002 – 2006.<br/><br/>To verify the incidence of glaucoma in relation to family history in Anambra state between 2002 – 2006.<br/><br/>To identify the incidence of glaucoma in relation to gender in Anambra state between 2002 to 2006.<br/><br/>To identify other factors influencing the incidence of glaucoma in adult patients in Anambra state from 2002 – 2006.<br/><br/>To ascertain the number of people affected by glaucoma in relation to age from 2002 – 2006.<br/><br/>To determine the relation between health information and incidence of glaucoma in Anambra State, and<br/><br/>To examine the level of awareness of the glaucoma in Anambra state.<br/><br/>Significance of the Study<br/><br/>The result of the study will be of immense benefit to health institutions, community members, researchers and government. The study on the factors influencing the incidence of glaucoma will give a preview of the level of incidence for intervention strategic planning.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this research will help to create awareness of the disease to the community members, as well as serve as related literature to other researchers by providing a fore-knowledge of what is obtainable and available on the ground as it concerns the area of study.<br/><br/>Scope of Study<br/><br/>The study is a determination of the factors influencing the incidence of glaucoma in adult patients in Anambra state between 2002 and 2006. This means that only available data on adult patients who visited the General Hospital in Awka, Enugwu-ukwu and Onitsha are used for the study. Another delimitation is that adults between the ages of 40 years and above and studied as our interest is mostly on open angle glaucoma.<br/><br/>Research questions<br/><br/>What is the incidence of glaucoma among adult patients in Anambra state between 2002 and 2006?<br/><br/>What is the incidence of glaucoma in relation to family history in Anambra state from 2002 – 2006?<br/><br/>What is the incidence of glaucoma in relation to gender in Anambra state from 2002 – 2006?<br/><br/>What other factors influence the incidence of glaucoma in adult patients in Anambra state from 2002 – 2006?<br/><br/>What is the number of people affected by glaucoma in relation to age from 2002 – 2006?<br/><br/>How does health information effect the incidence of glaucoma in Anambra state?<br/><br/>What is the level of awareness of glaucoma in Anambra state?<br/><br/>Hypotheses of the Study<br/><br/>Ho1: There is no significant relationship between the incidence of glaucoma disease among different age groups of the study from 2002 – 2006.<br/><br/>Ho2: There is no significant difference in the incidence of glaucoma between males and females of the study group from 2002 – 2006.<br/><br/>Ho3: There is no significant difference in the incidence of glaucoma and hereditary among the study group from 2002 – 2006.<br/><br/>Ho4: There is no significant relationship between health information and the incidence of glaucoma in Anambra state.</p>                                                         \n\nFACTORS INFLUENCING THE INCIDENCE OF GLAUCOMA AMONG ADULT PATIENTS IN GENERAL HOSPITALS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FACTORS INFLUENCING THE INCIDENCE OF GLAUCOMA AMONG ADULT PATIENTS IN GENERAL HOSPITALS", "id": 57}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>A method to measure the real time temperature distribution along an interferometer path based on the propagation of acoustic waves is presented. It exploits the high sensitivity of the speed of sound in air to the air temperature. In particular, it takes advantage of a special set-up where the generation of the acoustic waves is synchronous with the amplitude modulation of a laser source. A photodetector converts the laser light to an electronic signal considered as reference, while the incoming acoustic waves are focused on a microphone and generate a second signal. In this condition, the phase difference between the two signals substantially depends on the temperature of the air volume interposed between the sources and the receivers. The comparison with the traditional temperature sensors highlighted the limit of the latter in case of fast temperature variations and the advantage of a measurement integrated along the optical path instead of a sampling measurement. The capability of the acoustic method to compensate the interferometric distance measurements due to air temperature variations has been demonstrated for distances up to 27 m.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>A temperature is an objective comparative measure of hot or cold. It is measured by a thermometer, which may work through the bulk behaviour of a thermometric material, detection of thermal radiation , or particle kinetic energy Several scales and units exist for measuring temperature, the most common being Celsius (denoted °C; formerly called centigrade), Fahrenheit (denoted °F), and, especially in science, Kelvin (denoted K).</p> <p>The coldest theoretical temperature is absolute zero, at which the thermal motion in matter would be zero. However, an actual physical system or object can never attain a temperature of absolute zero. Absolute zero is denoted as 0 K on the Kelvin scale, −273.15 °C on the Celsius scale, and −459.67 °F on the Fahrenheit scale.</p> <p>The kinetic theory offers a valuable but limited account of the behaviour of the materials of macroscopic systems, especially of fluids. It indicates the absolute temperature as proportional to the average kinetic energy of the random microscopic motions of their constituent microscopic particles such as electrons, atoms, and molecules.</p> <p>Temperature is important in all fields of natural science, including physics, geology, chemistry, atmospheric sciences, medicine , and biology—as well as most aspects of daily life. Many physical processes are affected by temperature, such as physical properties of materials including the phase ( solid , liquid , gaseous or plasma), density , solubility, vapour pressure , electrical conductivity rate and extent to which chemical reactions occur the amount and properties of thermal radiation emitted from the surface of an object speed of sound is a function of the square root of the absolute temperature.</p> <p>Temperature scales differ in two ways: the point chosen as zero degrees, and the magnitudes of incremental units or degrees on the scale.</p> <p>The Celsius scale (°C) is used for common temperature measurements in most of the world. It is an empirical scale. It developed by a historical progress, which led to its zero point 0 °C being defined by the freezing point of water, with additional degrees defined so that 100 °C was the boiling point of water, both at sea-level atmospheric pressure. Because of the 100 degree interval, it is called a centigrade scale. [1] Since the standardization of the kelvin in the International System of Units, it has subsequently been redefined in terms of the equivalent fixing points on the Kelvin scale, and so that a temperature increment of one degree Celsius is the same as an increment of one kelvin, though they differ by an additive offset of 273.15.</p> <p>The United States commonly uses the Fahrenheit scale, on which water freezes at 32 °F and boils at 212 °F at sea-level atmospheric pressure.</p> <p>Many scientific measurements use the kelvin temperature scale (unit symbol K), named in honour of the Scottish physicist who first defined it. It is a thermodynamic or absolute temperature scale. Its zero point, 0 K, is defined to coincide with coldest physically-possible temperature (called absolute zero). Its degrees are defined through thermodynamics. The temperature of absolute zero occurs at 0 K = -273.15 °C (or −459.67 °F), and the freezing point of water at sea-level atmospheric pressure occurs at 273.15 K = 0 °C.</p> <p>The International System of Units (SI) defines a scale and unit for the kelvin or thermodynamic temperature by using the reliably reproducible temperature of the triple point of water as a second reference point (the first reference point being 0 K at absolute zero). The triple point is a singular state with its own unique and invariant temperature and pressure, along with, for a fixed mass of water in a vessel of fixed volume, an autonomically and stably self-determining partition into three mutually contacting phases, vapour, liquid, and solid, dynamically depending only on the total internal energy of the mass of water. For historical reasons, the triple point temperature of water is fixed at 273.16 units of the measurement increment.</p> <p>In physics, sound is a vibration that propagates as a typically audible mechanical wave of pressure and displacement, through a medium such as air or water. In physiology and psychology, sound is the reception of such waves and their perception by the brain.</p> <p>Sound can propagate through compressible media such as air, water and solids as longitudinal waves and also as a transverse waves in solids (see Longitudinal and transverse waves, below). The sound waves are generated by a sound source, such as the vibrating diaphragm of a stereo speaker. The sound source creates vibrations in the surrounding medium. As the source continues to vibrate the medium, the vibrations propagate away from the source at the speed of sound, thus forming the sound wave. At a fixed distance from the source, the pressure, velocity, and displacement of the medium vary in time. At an instant in time, the pressure, velocity, and displacement vary in space. Note that the particles of the medium do not travel with the sound wave. This is intuitively obvious for a solid, and the same is true for liquids and gases (that is, the vibrations of particles in the gas or liquid transport the vibrations, while the average position of the particles over time does not change). During propagation, waves can be reflected, refracted, or attenuated by the medium.</p> <p>The behaviour of sound propagation is generally affected by three things:</p> <p>A relationship between density and pressure this relationship, affected by temperature, determines the speed of sound within the medium.</p> <p>The propagation is also affected by the motion of the medium itself. For example, sound moving through wind.

It is measured by a thermometer, which may work through the bulk behaviour of a thermometric material, detection of thermal radiation , or particle kinetic energy Several scales and units exist for measuring temperature, the most common being Celsius (denoted °C; formerly called centigrade), Fahrenheit (denoted °F), and, especially in science, Kelvin (denoted K).</p> <p>The coldest theoretical temperature is absolute zero, at which the thermal motion in matter would be zero. However, an actual physical system or object can never attain a temperature of absolute zero. Absolute zero is denoted as 0 K on the Kelvin scale, −273.15 °C on the Celsius scale, and −459.67 °F on the Fahrenheit scale.</p> <p>The kinetic theory offers a valuable but limited account of the behaviour of the materials of macroscopic systems, especially of fluids. It indicates the absolute temperature as proportional to the average kinetic energy of the random microscopic motions of their constituent microscopic particles such as electrons, atoms, and molecules.</p> <p>Temperature is important in all fields of natural science, including physics, geology, chemistry, atmospheric sciences, medicine , and biology—as well as most aspects of daily life. Many physical processes are affected by temperature, such as physical properties of materials including the phase ( solid , liquid , gaseous or plasma), density , solubility, vapour pressure , electrical conductivity rate and extent to which chemical reactions occur the amount and properties of thermal radiation emitted from the surface of an object speed of sound is a function of the square root of the absolute temperature.</p> <p>Temperature scales differ in two ways: the point chosen as zero degrees, and the magnitudes of incremental units or degrees on the scale.</p> <p>The Celsius scale (°C) is used for common temperature measurements in most of the world. It is an empirical scale. It developed by a historical progress, which led to its zero point 0 °C being defined by the freezing point of water, with additional degrees defined so that 100 °C was the boiling point of water, both at sea-level atmospheric pressure. Because of the 100 degree interval, it is called a centigrade scale. [1] Since the standardization of the kelvin in the International System of Units, it has subsequently been redefined in terms of the equivalent fixing points on the Kelvin scale, and so that a temperature increment of one degree Celsius is the same as an increment of one kelvin, though they differ by an additive offset of 273.15.</p> <p>The United States commonly uses the Fahrenheit scale, on which water freezes at 32 °F and boils at 212 °F at sea-level atmospheric pressure.</p> <p>Many scientific measurements use the kelvin temperature scale (unit symbol K), named in honour of the Scottish physicist who first defined it. It is a thermodynamic or absolute temperature scale. Its zero point, 0 K, is defined to coincide with coldest physically-possible temperature (called absolute zero). Its degrees are defined through thermodynamics. The temperature of absolute zero occurs at 0 K = -273.15 °C (or −459.67 °F), and the freezing point of water at sea-level atmospheric pressure occurs at 273.15 K = 0 °C.</p> <p>The International System of Units (SI) defines a scale and unit for the kelvin or thermodynamic temperature by using the reliably reproducible temperature of the triple point of water as a second reference point (the first reference point being 0 K at absolute zero). The triple point is a singular state with its own unique and invariant temperature and pressure, along with, for a fixed mass of water in a vessel of fixed volume, an autonomically and stably self-determining partition into three mutually contacting phases, vapour, liquid, and solid, dynamically depending only on the total internal energy of the mass of water. For historical reasons, the triple point temperature of water is fixed at 273.16 units of the measurement increment.</p> <p>In physics, sound is a vibration that propagates as a typically audible mechanical wave of pressure and displacement, through a medium such as air or water. In physiology and psychology, sound is the reception of such waves and their perception by the brain.</p> <p>Sound can propagate through compressible media such as air, water and solids as longitudinal waves and also as a transverse waves in solids (see Longitudinal and transverse waves, below). The sound waves are generated by a sound source, such as the vibrating diaphragm of a stereo speaker. The sound source creates vibrations in the surrounding medium. As the source continues to vibrate the medium, the vibrations propagate away from the source at the speed of sound, thus forming the sound wave. At a fixed distance from the source, the pressure, velocity, and displacement of the medium vary in time. At an instant in time, the pressure, velocity, and displacement vary in space. Note that the particles of the medium do not travel with the sound wave. This is intuitively obvious for a solid, and the same is true for liquids and gases (that is, the vibrations of particles in the gas or liquid transport the vibrations, while the average position of the particles over time does not change). During propagation, waves can be reflected, refracted, or attenuated by the medium.</p> <p>The behaviour of sound propagation is generally affected by three things:</p> <p>A relationship between density and pressure this relationship, affected by temperature, determines the speed of sound within the medium.</p> <p>The propagation is also affected by the motion of the medium itself. For example, sound moving through wind. Independent of the motion of sound through the medium, if the medium is moving, the sound is further transported.</p> <p>The viscosity of the medium also affects the motion of sound waves. It determines the rate at which sound is attenuated. For many media, such as air or water, attenuation due to viscosity is negligible.</p> <p>When sound is moving through a medium that does not have constant physical properties, it may be refracted (either dispersed or focused).</p> <p>1.2.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM:</p> <p>The following forms the problems that necessitated the research of this project work.</p> <p>i.The lapses found with other means of measuring temperature.</p> <p>ii.The difficulties involved in using other means of measuring temperature.</p> <p>iii.The high cost of other means of measuring temperature.</p> <p>1.3.OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY:</p> <p>The following forms the objective of this study:</p> <p>1.To show that the use of sound for the measurement of temperature is faster and more accurate than the other methods already known.</p> <p>2.To determine temperature by measuring the speed of sound in air.</p> <p>3.To minimize the cost of measuring temperature using the other methods that are expensive by introducing the measurement of temperature using sound.</p> <p>1.4.SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:</p> <p>The significance of this study is focused on its intent to portrait the essence of measuring temperature using sound through showing its speed, accuracy, reliability etc. this was achieved by using air as an example.

Growth can be defined as a process by which a plant increase in the number and size of leaves and stems (Rayburn, 1993). Growth is also defined as an irreversible change in the size of a cell, organ or whole organism (Janick; 1979). Growth is an irreversible increase in body size and weight due to incorporation of new protoplasm in the body (sarojini et al; 1991). Growth is a physiological activity involving the enlargement and elongation of an organism  due to the incorporation of more protoplasm within the organism(Okeke; 2014). Cell theory states that new cells are formed from the pre-existing ones by division. When one   cell divides by mitosis, two new cells results. The two new cells put together are equal in volume or mass of the cells even though growth takes place in the number of cells. It is when the new cell grows to the maximum size of the parent cell that growth in volume is achieved. If those two new cells are arranged linearly, there will be an increase in length. The growth of both plant and animals require energy. Animal get their energy by digesting the plant they eat while plants get their energy from the sun through photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process where the green plant pigment in the plant leaf (chlorophyll) absorbs energy from sunlight and using the energy, water and carbon(iv)oxide to produce oxygen and simple sugar.</p> <p>        The plant then uses these sugars to make more complex sugars and starches from storage as energy reserves, to make cellulose and hemicelluloses for cell wall or with nitrogen, to make protein. The way these plants uses energy depends on the developmental stage of the plants and environmental conditions.</p> <p>        When leaves are removed from a grass or clover plant, new leaves develop and grow from buds on the crown or stems of the plants. This growth requires energy which comes from reserve carbohydrates (Sugar and starches) or from actively photosynthesizing leaves remaining on the plants. At some point, photosynthesis is great enough to produce more sugar than is needed for growth. This results in an increase in the reserve carbohydrate in the plant. As the leaf area increase further, leaves start shading one another and net growth shows as older leaves in shape do not get enough sunlight and begin to die. Root growth determines the ability of the plant to take up nutrient and water. Root growth determined by the plants activity photosynthesizing leaf area since the root depends on energy captured by leaves. Therefore roots receive energy only when more energy is produced by photosynthesis than is being used by top growth.</p> <p>However, under drought conditions, the lack of water may reduce top growth while photosynthesis remains active. This results in accumulation of carbohydrate. The stems and roots have epical meristems responsible for extension growth which usually remains permanently embryonic and capable for growths for long periods (watering and Phillips 1970).</p> <p>The effects of cool weather in the spring or fall are similar, cool temperature produces plant growth rate more than photosynthesis.</p> <p>This calls for an increase in reserve carbohydrate in the plant and higher foliage quality. As plant matures, it increases in fibres and decrease in digestibility, crude protein and intake by livestock (Rayburn, 1993). In biology, everything that has life must grow and every living organism that grows must come to a peak or climax of the growth, death of old age will occur (Delvin, 1975).</p> <p>        Sometimes, living organism such as plants and animals die before that maturity or old age due to certain circumstances that affects growth. Some of the factors that cause this premature death also affect the growth rate of plants and animals </p> <p><strong>1.2  Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>        In this research, attempt is made to establish the relationship between the soil type and NPK fertilizer on the productivity of tomato in Nigeria and West Africa in order to improve the yield of tomato.

Production as a specialized industry (Encycloparredia Britaimca, 1988).  Heavy breed poultry animals are used for meat white light bread chickens are primarily for the production of eggs (Mc Graw Hill encydopaedia 1992).  The meat and eggs produced from poultry are important sources of dietary portion.  In Africa, animal protein foods from all sources contribute between 7g and 15g daily per person to the total food intake (Oyenyga, 1974).  Today, Poultry production in the country is increasing at a tremendous rate and yet cannot meet the demand because of population growth and the awareness created by the campaigns for the need of animal protein in the diet.</p> <p>          The growth and well-being of organisms are to a large extent dependent on the mount and type of food they receive and the manner or rate at which they receive it. The food should contain nutrients such  as water, carbohydrates, fats, protein, minerals, vitamins and added growth factors improper balance.  Each of these nutrients has a major role to play concerning growth, maintenance and productivity of the poultry.  According to Leonard 91981), nutritional deficiency or inbalance. These diseases may include rickets, perosis, and nutritional roup, curly the paralysis etc.  These diseases could result due to deficiency in vitamins D, Manganese, vitamin A, vitamin E and riboflavin.  Improper sanitation and inadequate management play major roles in disease.  Outbreak and productivity of the desired products.  In developing     countries like Nigeria, the cost of feeding, especially the monogastries continues to escalate primarily in response the soaring cost of the conventional feed ingredients.  This phenomenon is precipitated by under production and importation of some food stuff coupled with the competition between man and farm animal for energy and protein concentrates.</p> <p>          The use of agro-industrial by-products towards reducing food cost has been widely recognized (EshieH and Ademosun, 1981; Atteh and Oloagbenla, 1993). Chicken and turkeys satisfy their energy needs provided the ration a allows them to do so (Church, 1988).  The are of course exceptional to this rule particularly where heavy breed layers are concerned, when birds have a tendency to over-eat.  Where this is a problem, it is general practice to subject the birds to some degree of food restriction during the growing  and production periods. The major ingredients that are integral parts of poultry rations at the present time in the USA are corn, as the primary source of energy and soybean meal as the major protein supplement (Roland et  al    1972), while in Nigeria, Udedibie et al (1988) and Nwokon (1993) produced poultry offal meal (P.O.M) and chicken offal meal (COM) respectively from waste product similar to poultry visceral Offal (PVO) according to these authors POM has been used to replace ground nut cake in layer and broiler finisher diets and COM has been used along with  fish meat and blood meat as sources of methodize and lysine in the starter diets of lockerels.  These major ingredients, usually available in plentiful supply, allow rapid growth or high egg production with very efficient conversion.  However, corn-soy rations are deficient in some nutrients for chickens and these nutrients are normally supplied by other poultry meal.</p> <p>          There are different  types of feeds given to poultry brids depending on the purpose.  These different types of feeds given to poultry birds depending on the purpose.  These different types are the breeders’ starters, growers’ and layer’ feeds. The percentage of each ingredient in the feed varies depending on the type of feed. The ingredient include ground yellow corn, ground oats or barley, Alfata meat, Fish meal, Oystershell, managised salt, vitamin A, vitamin D, and coccidiostat (which is given in form and at the level recommended by the manufacturer). The different percentage of each ingredient varies depending on the kind of feed for example, ground yellow corn in starter and grower feed is 25% and 22% in breeder and layer feeds. There could be the same percentage of a particular ingredient in different feeds as in the case of a alfafa meal which constitutes 10% inall the feed types. Some ingredients could be absent in a particular feed but present in the others as in the case of riboflavin supplement which is absent in starter feed and present at the levels of 2 and 5% in rower, layer and breeder feeds respectively.</p> <p>          To maintain healthy birds, the feeds are kept fresh as much as possible at all times.  The amount of feed in feeders are limited to the extent necessary to avoid wastage.  It is a good practice to fill hanging feeders – only three quarter full, and trough feeders only two third full (Graham, 1977). Checking the weight of the birds and its feed consumption is very necessary.  A drop in feed intake usually is the first indication of trouble, a disease outbreak, molt, stress or poor management (Graham, 1977).  Most poultry feed are prepared in dehydrated forms and because of this, there is the need to store them properly  to avoid moisture uptake and damage by heat.  In this way,. They can remain safe for a considerable period of time without loosing their safeness and value.  The feed should be stored in a suitable place where it will not be attacked by microorganisms, insects, rodents, etc.  Air tight storage is not advisable because offensive odour might result when there is obstruction of out flow and inflow of air (Leonard, 1981).  High temperature and oxidation destroy certain vitamins, therefore, care must be taken in the  preservation and storage of feeds to protect the vitamins they contain (Mc Graw – Hill encyclopaedia 1992). The condition of feed storage and handling could be a source of contamination.  When feeds are unhysgenically handled and stored, there could be a buildup of microbial contaminants.</p> <p>          Poultry have been found to be susceptible to infection due to certain microorganisms and man may be secondarily infected through heavy contaminated food such as poultry meat and eggs (Gorden and Tucker, 1965, Hall, 1977, and Barrell, 1982).  Micro-organism that may contaminate feed include the following general another disease caused by salmonella infections is paratyphoid. Paratyphoid is an infection disease of chi, Entherobacter,  Escherichia,  Protens,Pseudomonas, staphylococcus, salmonella, shigella, providencia, serratia, Klebsiella,streptococcus, clostridium, Aspergillus and Erysiphelothrie (Leonard, 1981). Typically, in some countries, about 50% of all outbreaks of salmonellosis in man are caused by infections derived from these sources and the incidence of salmonella in poultry carcasses has, in certain cases been found to be 7% or more (Van schothorst Notermans, 1980).  Okongi (1984) examined poultry feed and found that salmonellawas present in the sample.  Another disease caused by salmonella infections is paratyphoid, Paratyphoid is an infections disease of chicken, turkeys, ducks and other birds.  Bofulism another kind of disease occurs in both young and adult poultry birds.  It is caused by a bacterium, Clostridium Botulinum. This organism grows in decaying plants and animals materials. Birds feeding material containing the toxins produced by the bacteria lose control of their neck muscle (Leonard, 1981).</p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY:</strong></p> <p>The objective of this study is to ascertain the microbial safety of commercial poultry feeds produced by companies.</p> <p> AIMS OF THE STUDY </p> <p>i.                   To isolate micro-organisms that are contaminants of poultry feeds.</p> <p>ii.                 To identify the bacterial types</p> <p>iii.              To determine the microbial load of poultry feed.</p> <p> STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </p> <p>          Poultry feed is known to contain salmonella, and other microorganisms are also implicated in poultry feeds, (Klinger and Ladidot, 1993).  It is therefore pertinent to carry out microbiological examination of commercially prepared poultry feeds to ascertain their safety to livestock.</p> <p> HYPOTHESIS <strong>HO:-  Poultry feeds are associated with bacterial contaminants</strong> H1:-   Poultry feeds are not associated with bacterial contaminants </p> <p>HII:-  Poultry feeds do not have enough bacterial contaminants to cause infection in poultry</p> <p> LIMITATION OF THE STUDY </p> <p>This work is limited to bacteria contaminants associated with poultry feeds from three different companies.</p><p>   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>As the end of the project work, the results will be a guide to the  microbiological safety or otherwise of the commercially prepared poultry feeds.</p>                                                           \n\n BACTERIA CONTAMINANTS ASSOCIATED WITH POULTRY FEEDS FROM THREE DIFFERENT COMPANIES <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  BACTERIA CONTAMINANTS ASSOCIATED WITH POULTRY FEEDS FROM THREE DIFFERENT COMPANIES ", "id": 60}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Proteins are essential nutrients for the human body (Hermann, 2002). They are one of the building block of the body tissue, and also serve as a fuel source. As a fuel, protein contain 4kcal (17kj) per gram, just like carbohydrates and unlike lipids, which contain 9kcal (37kj) per gram. The most important aspect and defining characteristics of protein from a nutritional stand point is its amino acid composition (Laurence, 2000).</p> <p>Proteins are polymer chains made of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds. During human digestion, proteins are broken down in the stomach to smaller polypeptide chain via hydrochloric acid and protease actions. This is crucial for the synthesis of the essential amino acids that cannot be biosynthesized by the body (Genton, 2010). There are nine essential amino acids which humans must obtain from their diet in order to prevent protein-energy malnutrition. They are phenylalanine, valine, lysine, leucine, threonine, tryptophan, methionine, isoleucine and histidine (Laurence, 2000). There are five dispensable amino acids which humans are able to synthesize in the body. These five are alanine, aspartic acid, sernine, asparagines and glutamic acid. There are six conditionally essential amino acids whose synthesis can be limited under special pathophysiological conditions, such as prematurity in the infant or individuals in severe catabolic distress (Laurence, 2000). These six are argnine, cysteine, glycine, glutamine, proline and tryrosine (Laurence, 2000). Sources of protein include grains, legumes and nuts, as well as animal sources such as meats, dairy products, fish and eggs (Young, 1994).</p> <p>African breadfruit (<em>Treculia Africana Decne) </em>belongs to the mulberry family. Moracceae, which is of African origin but now grown in the most tropical and sub-tropical countries (Agu and Nwabueze, 2007). African breadfruit or wild jack fruit in some areas, is a neglected and under exploited tropical tree (Osuji and Owei, 2010).</p> <p>According to Okonkwo and Ubani (2012), it is a common forest tree called various names among different tribes in Nigeria, such as “Ukwa” (Igbo), “afon” (Yoruba), “eyo” (Igala), “barafuta” (Hausa), “Ize” (Benin) and “edikang” (Efik). The tree crop is widely grown in the southern state of Nigeria where it serves as low cost meat substituent for poor families in some communities (Badifu and Akuba, 2001; Ugwu, et al, 2001). the plant produced large, usually round, compound fruit covered with pointed outgrowths and the seeds are buried in the spongy pulp of the fruits (Nwokolo, 1996). the seeds are seldom eaten raw but can be baked, roasted or fried before consumption, or they can be ground into flour in bakery products (Agu et al, 2007; Ijeh et al, 2010). African breadfruit seeds are highly nutritious and constitute a cheap source of vitamins, minerals, proteins, carbohydrates and fats.</p> <p>Brown beans (<em>Phaseolus Vulgaris) </em>is a herbaceous annual plant grown worldwide for its edible dry seeds (Known as just ‘Beans”) or unripe fruit (Green beans). It’s leaf is also occasionally used as a vegetable and the straw as fodder. It’s botanical classification, along with other phaseolus species, is as a member of the legume family fabaceae, most of whose members acquire the nitrogen they require through association with rhizoidal, a species of nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Edet, 1982). Beans are grown in every continent except Antarctica. Brazil and India are the largest producers of dry beans, while china produces by far, the largest quantity of brown beans. Worldwide, 23 million tones of dry common beans and 17.1 billion tones of green were grown in 2010 (Philips, 2010). Similar to other beans, the brown beans is high in starch, protein and dietary fiber, and is an excellent source of iron, selenium, potassium, molybdenum, thiamine, vitamin B6 and folate (Paul, 1998) .</p> <p>The soybean (<em>Glycine max </em>(L.) Merrill family Leguminosae, subfamily Papilionoidae) originated in Eastern Asia, probably in north and central china. It is believed that cultivated varieties were introduced into Korea and later Japan some 2000 years ago. Soybeans have been grown as food crop for thousands of years in China and other countries of East and South East Asia and constitute to this day, an important component of the traditional popular diet in these regions (William, 2003). Although the U.S.A and Brazil account today for the most of the soybean production of the world, the introduction of this crop to Western agriculture is quite recent. Soybeans are primarily, an industrial crop, cultivated for oil protein. Despite the relatively low oil content of the seed (about 20% on moisture-free basis), Soybeans are the largest single source of edible oil and account for roughly 50% of total oil seed production of the world (Singh, Nelson and Chung, 2008). With each ton of crude soybean oil, approximately 4.5 tons of soybean oil meal with a protein content of about 44% are produced. For each ton of soybeans processed, the commercial value of the meal obtained usually exceeds that of the oil. Thus, soybean oil meal cannot be considered by-product of the oil manufacture. The soybean is, in this respect, an exception among oil seed (Shurtleff; Steenhuis and Spiers, 2013). It can be calculated that the quality of protein in the yearly world production of soybeans, if it could be totally and directly utilized for human consumption would be sufficient for providing roughly one third of the global need for protein (William, 2003). This makes the soybeans one of the largest potential source of dietary protein. However, the bulk of soybean oil meal is used in animal feed for the production of meat and eggs. Despite considerable public and commercial interest in soybean products as food, the proportion of soybean protein consumed directly in human nutrition is still relatively small (Smith, 1972).</p>                                                          \n\nCOMPARATIVE DETERMINATION OF THE PROTEIN CONTENTS OF BREADFRUIT, BROWN BEANS AND SOYABEANS SEMINAR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMPARATIVE DETERMINATION OF THE PROTEIN CONTENTS OF BREADFRUIT, BROWN BEANS AND SOYABEANS SEMINAR", "id": 61}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Growth is the irreversible increase in volume (size) number of part, length and weight of an organism (Umeh, 2004).

Root growth determined by the plants activity photosynthesizing leaf area since the root depends on energy captured by leaves. Therefore roots receive energy only when more energy is produced by photosynthesis than is being used by top growth.</p> <p>However, under drought conditions, the lack of water may reduce top growth while photosynthesis remains active. This results in accumulation of carbohydrate. The stems and roots have epical meristems responsible for extension growth which usually remains permanently embryonic and capable for growths for long periods (watering and Phillips 1970).</p> <p>The effects of cool weather in the spring or fall are similar, cool temperature produces plant growth rate more than photosynthesis.</p> <p>This calls for an increase in reserve carbohydrate in the plant and higher foliage quality. As plant matures, it increases in fibres and decrease in digestibility, crude protein and intake by livestock (Rayburn, 1993). In biology, everything that has life must grow and every living organism that grows must come to a peak or climax of the growth, death of old age will occur (Delvin, 1975).</p> <p>        Sometimes, living organism such as plants and animals die before that maturity or old age due to certain circumstances that affects growth. Some of the factors that cause this premature death also affect the growth rate of plants and animals </p> <p><strong>1.2  Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>        In this research, attempt is made to establish the relationship between the soil type and NPK fertilizer on the productivity of tomato in Nigeria and West Africa in order to improve the yield of tomato.

The three tooth pastes are close up, Dabur  herbal tooth past and oral B. the mouth swap was cultured using Nutrient medium and MacConkey medium. The bacteria organisms isolated were <em>Streptococcus mutan </em>and Lactobacillus spp. The chief dominant bacteria causing dental caries and bleeding gum is<em>Streptococcus mutan. </em>based on the analysis the inhibitory effect of oral B is the highest since it have up to 7.omm clear zone followed by Dabur herbur tooth paste which also have clear zone of about 4.2mm.

Tooth ache is mostly caused by tooth problems like; dental cavity, a cracked tooth, an exposed root or gum disease. Dental caries (also known as tooth decay or cavity) results in tooth ache. It is an infection of bacterial origin that causes demineralization and destruction of hard tissue (enamel, dentin and cementum), usually by production of acid by bacterial fermentation of the food debris accumulated on the tooth surface. If this remineralization exceeds, saliva and other demineralization factors such as from calcium and fluoridated tooth pastes, these hard tissues progressively break down, producing dental caries ie cavities, holes in the teeth.</p> <p>       The bacteria most responsible for dental cavities are the mutants streptococci most prominently <em>Streptococcus</em> <em>Mutans</em>, <em>Streptococcus</em> <em>Sobrinus</em>and <em>Lactobacilli. </em>If left untreated, the infection or disease can lead to tooth pain, tooth loss and infection.</p> <p>       John et al (2009), Bleeding gum generally indicates gum disease or risk of gum. This occurs when gums get swollen and tender either due to infection or irritation, they can form bleed plague buildup on gum causing bacteria to grow in the gum. This leads to gingivitis or inflammation of the gums. Gums can also bleed due to imitation caused by chewing certain foods, improper brusting, Hormonal changes during pregnancy, improperly fitted dentures, thyroid disorders, Leukemia and bleeding disorder.</p> <p><strong>1.2  AIM AND OBJECTIVE</strong></p> <p>       To know or determine the bacterial organisms associated with toot ache (dental caries) and bleeding gum.</p> <p>       To be able to isolate those bacterial organisms that causes bleeding gum and dental caries.</p> <p>       To know the effect of some tooth pastes especially (maclean on the tooth problems.</p> <p>       To educate people (both young and old) on how to take proper care of their teeth and maintain a good oral hygiene and make a wise choice of the type of food to go for so as to maintain a healthy teeth.</p> <p><strong>1.3  STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>       The high rate of dental damages and bleeding gum among people of all ages. These damages have caused a lot of loss of teeth, eruption of the affected teeth and even change of colour of teeth among the young beautiful and handsome youths and old adults. Many old people in the vikages cannot comfortable chew hard, hot, and cold foods because of dental problems. Some young people whose teeth have a bad look cannot boldly open their moth publicly and talk. Yet the cause of the high rate of these dental damages was not clearly understood and hence, the topic. To determine and isolate those bacteria that are capable of causing dental problems (tooth ache), particularly dental caries and bleeding gum.</p> <p><strong>1.4  THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>       This work is highly beneficial to those who suffer from dental caries (tooth ache) and bleeding gum by providing a guild on how to control the disease and stop further spread and damages. Those who are at risk of getting this diseases because of their choice of food and poor oral hygiene, thereby exposing their teeth to bacterial contamination. They are educated to reduce the frequency of their surgar intake as this is the cause of dental problems foods like vegetables, cheeses, milks, yogurt etc are preferable. The world at risk can also maintain proper oral hygiene by brushing and flushing their teeth every morning and at night before bedtime and possible after every meal. People who just pick any tooth paste without considering its composition or content can now look for those tooth pastes that have fluoride content and those produced from natural herb extracts.</p> <p>       The knowledge of the type of micro-organisms associated with dental caries and bleeding gum will help to find out adequate drugs that can quire the diseases.</p> <p><strong>1.6  LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>There is lack of adequate financial support which resulted in some difficulties in carrying out the practical, such problems are buying of materials needed for carrying out the practical, transportation the Laboratory where the practical is being carried out and provision.</p> <p>       Also during the collection of the sample, some micro- organization in the mouth and those around the teeth were introduced in the sample and as the suspected micro- organisms were growing these surrounding micro- organisms also grew and there was difficulty in differentiating between them.       </p>                                                            \n\nISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF BACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH (TOOTH ACHE) DENTAL CARIES AND BLEEDING GUM AND THE EFFECT OF SOME TOOTH PASTES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF BACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH (TOOTH ACHE) DENTAL CARIES AND BLEEDING GUM AND THE EFFECT OF SOME TOOTH PASTES", "id": 63}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The seeds of pawpaw and orange are generally discarded.

The specific gravity, iodine value, acid value, peroxide value, saponification value and moisture content of pawpaw seed oil were determined and the result are 0.85, 30.20, 47.12, 48.60, 79.38, and 0.18 respectively. Similarly, the following results were obtained for the orange seed oil; 0.47, 24.6, 51.40, 250.70, 194.24 and 6.43 respectively.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Orange is from the citrus family, the fruit’s size varies with cultivars and crop load, but most often measure between 2.5-4 includes in diameter. The shape of the fruit is spherical to oblong, with a peel thickness between that of grape fruit and tangerine and it is either smooth or rightly pebbly. The presence and amount of seed, depends on the cultivar (Nwobi et al, 2006).</p> <p>Papaya (carica papaya) is a plant that grows wild in many part of the tropics. papaya is important for its fruit and it is cultivated mainly for this purpose (Puangsri et al, 2005). It varies in size, most are oblong, globular or round, often five angled and narrowed at the tip. Inside hollow of the fruit is lined with numerous dark grey seeds. The seed of papaya and orange fruits are generally discarded.</p> <p>However in other to make a more efficient use of papaya and orange, it is worth investigating the use of the seeds as a source of oil. The extraction and use of vegetable oil has for centuries played an important role in the manufacture of large number of industrial product and food items (puangir et al, 2005)</p> <p>Kar and Mital (1999) reported that shear butter is a natural fat obtained from the seeds of the shea tree <em>Butyrespermum park</em>: the shea butter fat was extracted from the seeds with various organic solvents such as petroleum ether, n- hexane, chloroform and benzene. It is concluded that these solvents, particularly petroleum ether and n-hexane, could be used for the extraction of shear butter that is free from any oxidized fat and coloring impurities. Akpan et al (1999) carried out extraction and characterization of castor seed oil and reported that tested parameters which include specific gravity, refractive index, acid value, saponification value, and iodine value for both crude and refined castor oil product were of good quality.</p> <p>Oil yielding crop plants are actually very important for economic growth of agricultural sector. The oil seeds containing unusual fatty acids are very important for industry, they can be used in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics detergents, soaps, textiles, surfactants (Hosamani and Sattigerir 2000). On the other had no oil from a single source has been found to be suitable for all purposes because oils form different sources generally differ in their composition. This requires the search for new sources of novel oils. Several plants are now grown, not for food and fodder but also for a striking range of products with an industrial application (Miladi et al, 2007). The extraction and commercialization of those oils will reasonably enhance the profits status of most fruit juice making industries and encourage the sustenance of the cultivation of the seedy species of sweet orange fruits. The extraction and characterization of oils from fruit seeds have been carried out extensively, but not much data is available on the physio chemcial properties of the oil from the seed of African sweet orange, despite an initial attempt by some authors who worked on the seed of orange and closely related lime seeds (Nwobi et al, 2005). The chemical composition of the orange seed oil extract consequently gives a qualitative identification of oils and is very important area in the selective application guide for the commercialization and utility of the oil products. Fats and oil are also very important indigenous raw materials for many edible and nonedible purposes (Abbas Ali et al, 2008).</p> <p>The medicinal values are antiseptic, antidepressant, antiplasmodic, anti inflammatory, carminatives, diuretics, choalagogue, sedative and tonic.</p> <p><strong>1.1  Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>Orange seeds and paw paw seeds are normally discarded and assumed to be a waste product, but the oil from the seed of paw paw and orange has been reported to be useful in pharmaceutical industries, consumerist soaps, textile and detergent industries.

The samples comprised that of men , woman and children 200 in numbers, all patient of orthopedic Hospital Enugu. Laboratory investigation done were this HBs  tested which 110 patient out of the 200 patients tested positive,  and liver function tests found abnormal in almost all the patients that tested positive to HBsAG routine test. The commonest clinical presentations were fever and jaundice seen in Jo patient out of the 110 patients. The infection was  highest amongst young adult 21-30 years of age. This accounted for 17.5% of the positive patients population it was lowest amongst children 1-10 and old people 60-70 which  made up 5% of the infected population. The study also gave the general view of the group of individual affected whether children or adult, and the wid expired of the repetitious B. Hepatitis B one of the major cause of human suffering in the world despite a though understanding of its transmission and prevention and control by use of vaccine was found to be prevalent in National Orthopedic Hospital Enugu among the patients.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     INTRODUCTION TO HEPATITIS B</strong></p> <p>Viral hepatitis is a disease as old as the history of Medicine. Hepatitis was described in the Babylonian Talmud in the fifty century BC, and was referred to by Hippocratic over 2000 years ago. Despite this ancient knowledge, it was not until 1963, that the first human Repetitious virus was isolated, Hepatitis B. This was followed quickly by the purification of Hepatitis A in 1973, and more recently by the isolation of viruses C, D, E and G. These viruses are known to infect the human liver (Anderson et al; 2001).</p> <p>However, there are more than twenty other viruses, which infect the human liver. These are not considered “Repatitis viruses” as these other viruses tend to infect organs other than the liver more seriously’. These include common viruses such as Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Mumps, Rubella, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as well as rare ones such as Rassa fever and yellow fever viruses.</p> <p>Any infection that results in inflammation of the liver is called Repatitis (Greek Repaticus, liver). Incidentally, not all “hepatitis” is caused by viruses. “HEPATITIS” means “inflammation of the liver”, and can be caused also by other types of infection (bacteria fungi etc); toxic drugs; poisons; alcoholism and so on (Drexott etal; 2005).</p> <p>But of interest is one Repatitis virus – one of the most common infections diseases, causing an estimated 1.5millon deaths world wide each year – Hepatitis B. Hepatitis B is caused by the Repatitis B virus (HBV), a double – stranded circular DNA virus of complex structure. Hbv is class ivied as an orthoropadnavirus within the family hepadnaviridae. HBV was originally recognized as the age responsible or serum Repatitis the most common form of partially transmitted viral Repatitis and an import cause of acute and chronic infection of the liver. This why hepatitis b is some times called seum Repatitis. The virus was formerly and anilines referred to as Australian antigen. The reason being that it was first isolated room the blood of an Australian aborogie and is associated with HBV. (procott et al 2005.</p> <p>Hepatitis B remain one of the major cause of human suffering in the world despite a through understanding of its transmission and prevention. Serum form undivided infected with hepatitis B contains three district antigen  particles: a spherical 22nm particle, a 42 nm  spherical particle ( counting DNA  and DNA polymer able) called  the Dane particle, and tubular or filamentous particles that vary in length. The small spherical and tubular particles  are the unassembled component of the Dane particle- the infective form of the virus. The unassembled particles. Contain hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) whose presence in the blood is (a) an indicator of Repatitis B infection (b) the basis for the large scale screening of blood for the hepatitis B virus, and (c) the basis for the first vaccine for human use developed by recombinant DNA technology (Evans, 1997</p> <p>The Hepatitis B virus is normally transmitted through blood transfusion, contaminated equipment, drug users unsterile needles, or any body secretion (saliva, soren, sweat, breast milk, urine)  The virus also can pass from the blood of an infected mother through the placenta to infect  the fetus. Each year an estimated 200, 000 people in Nigeria are infected with Australian Antigen (HBV) about 1000 person die yearly from hepatitis related cirrhosis and about 5000 die from HBV related liver cancer. (HBV is second only to tobacco as a known cause of rumen cancer). Worldwide, HBV infects over 200 million people (Schlesinger &amp; Schlesinger, 2001). The clinccal signs of Repatitis B vary widely, most cases are symptomless. However, sometime fever, loss of appetite, abominal discomfort, nausea, fatigue, and other symptoms gradually appear following an incubation period of 1 to 3 months. The virus infects liver Hepatic cells and causes liver tissue degeneration and the release of liver associated enzymes (transaminases) into the blood team. This is followed by jaundice, the accumulation of bilirubin (a breakdown product of raemoglobin in the skin and other tissue with a resulting yellow appears. The distinctive yellow jaundice the Hepatitis B usually imparts to its victims  skin has  made it an rasity detectable disease through recorded history. Frequently, acute hepatitis B in anicteric and symptomatic, although acute liver failure may develop. The virus persists in about 10 percent of infected immouno compent adults, and in as many 90 percent of infants infect peninatally depending on the ethnic group of the mother. About 350 million people worldwide are persistent carries of hepatitis B. actually one in twenty infection results in chronic hepatitis, defined as persistent hepatitis virus six mouths after the onset of the acute illness. Chronic HBV infection can be entirely begin with normal liver blood tests (“Chronic Carrier State”) or may be an aggressive inflammatory process (“Chronic active hepatitis”), which can lead to severe scarring (“Cirrhosis).</p> <p>Approximately 25 percent of all patients with chronic hepatitis will progress to cirrhosis and about 20 percent of those with cirrhosis will develop hepatocellular carcinoma. That is to say, the risk of liver cancer (hepatoma) is high in cirrhosis caused by HBV.</p> <p>Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common cancers worldwide (Seeger &amp; manor; 2000)</p> <p>During the first phase of chronicity, virus replication continues in the liver and replicative intermediates of the viral genome may be detected in DNA extracted from liver hiopsies. Makers of virus replication in serum include HBVDNA (this indicated virus presence and activity), DNA polymerize (determines the presence of HBVDNA in liver cell, and a soluble antigen, hepatition.be antigen (HbeAG), which is secreted by productively infected hepatocytes. In those infected at a very going age this phase may persist for life but, more usually, virus levels decline over time. Eventually, in most individuals, there is immune clearance of infected hepatocytes associated with seroconverision low replication, the viral senome may integrate into the chromosomal DNA of some hepatocytes and these cells may persist and expand closely. Rarely , seroconversion to anti-HBs follows clearance of virus replication but, more frequently, HBSAg persists during a second phase of chronicity  as a result of the expression of integrated viral DNA.   </p>                                                            \n\nPREVALENCE STUDY OF HEPATITIS B<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PREVALENCE STUDY OF HEPATITIS B", "id": 65}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This project is aimed at producing a solar charger controller which help to improve the steady power supply in department of science laboratory technology IMT Enugu the smart charge controller is designed, so that the battery does not get over charged thereby ensuring no reduction of durability of the battery.

The oil were extracted using solvent extraction method. Two different solvents were used in the extraction namely: Ethane and N-hexane to compare their yield, physical and chemical properties. The extraction was carried out using 320g of size-reduced Soybeans. At the end of the extraction operation, the amount of oil-extracted using N-hexane was observed to be far greater than the amount of oil extracted using ethanol.           </p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p><p> CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION Extraction other-wise called leaching is the preferential solution of one or more constituents of a solid mixture by contact with a liquid solvent. This unit operation, is one of the oldest in the chemical industries, the have been given many names, depending to some extent upon the technique used for carrying it out extraction of oil from Soybeans seeds can be carried out using any of the two solid-liquid extraction methods namely: mechanical extraction method or the used of solvent other- wise called mass-transfer method. The yield of the second method is higher but contains more impurities than the first method and it requires another unit operation (distillation) in purifying it better. The success of an extraction and the technique to be used will vary frequently depending upon any prior treatment which may be given to the solid. In some instance small particles of the soluble material are completely surrounded by a matrix of insoluble matter. The solvent must then diffuse into the mass, and the resulting solution must diffuse out before a separation can result. Crushing and grinding of such solids will greatly alliterate the leaching action, since then the soluble portions are made more accessible to the solvent. Seeds like Soybeans seeds and other vegetable seeds are cellular in structure, and the natural products to be leached from this material are usually found inside the cells, if the cell walls remain intact upon exposure to a suitable solvent, the leaching involves osmotic passage of the solute through the cell walls. This may be slow, but is impractical and sometime undesirable to grind the material small enough to release the contents of individual cells. One constitutes a well-defined class of neutral organic substance, which are essential constituents of all forms of plant and animal life. They are soluble in other and organic solvents but not in water. Commercial oils are however from a relatively few member of the plant and animal kingdom available forms. They are primary a product of agriculture although these is also a considerably production from uncultivated - tropical plants and from mature animals. Oil can be grouped into edible and non-edible depending on the amount of unspecified matters and impurities. Owing to the fact that the use of oil from crop seed as a major raw materials has increased, in recent years their has been the need for extended and numerous research works based on the extraction of these oil. From its seeds as economically efficiently as possible. The only possible way of obtaining large quality of oil from oil being vegetable or plant materials is by extraction and this could best be achieve using leaching process. This process can be accomplished by a variety of ways but as might be expected its efficiency depends to an extent and obtaining intimate contact between the liquid solvent and the solid containing the solute. Leaching reduces the oil content in the residue to about 0.5-1.5 percent as compared. With about 5-9 percent by mechanical process. The types of solvent available for leeching include 17-hexane, petroleum, ether, benzene ethyl ether etc which are high petroleum fractions. The choice of a solvent for extraction is a function of its volatility and relative volatility for easy separation by distillation.  Soybeans oil is used primary in homes for cooking and also as an industrial raw material for other usefully products. 1.2    AIMS/ OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT To extract oil from Soybeans seeds and compare the yields obtained using different solvents and standard. Also the project is aimed at characterizing the extracted oil by determining the physical and chemical properties of the oil. </p>                                                           \n\nEXTRACTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF OIL FROM SOYBEANS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EXTRACTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF OIL FROM SOYBEANS", "id": 67}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The percentage phytochemical composition of the leaves of pawpaw, bitter kola, tetrapleura, neem and ginger was investigated using the methods of the association of analytical chemists, harbone and the Alkaline picrate method. The saponin content of papaw, though not significantly different from bitter kola, was the highest among other plants while ginger had the least. Papaw and ginger whose tannin contents were statistically the same contained higher quantities of tannins than other plants while bitter kola contained the least. Results show that the cyanogenic glucoside contents of the plants were below the toxic level for man.

They contribute to the color, flavour, and smell of plants. In addition, they form part of a plant’s natural defence mechanisms against diseases. Their therapeutic values to human health and disease prevention have been reported (Okwu, 2004)</p> <p>Pawpaw (<em>Carica papaya</em>) is a plant that belongs to the family of caricaceae. It is a herbaceous succulent plant with self-supporting stems. Elizabeth (1994) has   reported that unripe pawpaw fruits has therapeutic potential on patients with ulcer and impotence. Pawpaw plants produce natural compounds (Annonaceous acetogenins) in leaf bark and twig tissues that posses both highly anti-tumor and pesticide properties. It has been suggested that a potentially lucrative industry based simply on production of plant biomass could develop for production of anti-cancer drugs, pending food and Drug Agency approval, and natural pesticides. The high level of natural self-defence compounds in the plant makes it highly resistant to insect and disease infestation. Pawpaw leaf extract has been reported as a tumor-destroying agent (Walter, 2008).</p> <p>Fresh green papaw leaf possesses antiseptic properties, while the brown, dried leaf can serve as a tonic and blood purifier. Chewing the seeds of ripe pawpaw has a therapeutic value due to its antiseptic quality. It cleans the intestines from bacteria, more so that only a healthy intestine is able to absorb vitamin and minerals, especially vitamin B12. Tea, prepared with the green papaya leaf, promotes digestion and aids in the treatment of ailments such as chronic indigestion, overweight, obesity, arteriosclerosis, high blood pressure and weakening of the heart (Mantok, 2005). Although there is sufficient information on the phytochemical constitutes of the fruits, there is scarcity of such information on the leaves.</p> <p>Biter Kola (Garcinia cola) is also known as an Africa wonder nut.  It comes from Garcinia cola trees, which belong to the family of Clusiaceas and it grows in the coastal rainforests in the south western and south Eastern parts of Nigeria. Traditionally these nuts   were chewed as a masticatory substance, to stimulate the flow of saliva (Leakey, 2001) but are now widely consumed as snack in West and central Africa. The kernels of the nuts are widely traded and eaten as a stimulant. Bitter kola is believed to clean the digestive system, without side effects such as abdominal problems, even when a lot of the nuts are eaten. In folk, G. Kola is used in folklore remedies for the treatment of ailments such as liver disorders, hepatitis, diarrhea laryngitis, bronchitis and gonorrhea (Iwu, 1993). The seed is masticatory and also used to prevent and relieve colic, chest colds, cough and can as well be used to treat headache. This plant can be used for the treatment of jaundice, high fever and as a purgative. The plant is also found useful in the treatment of stomach ache and gastritis.</p> <p>The phytochemical compounds isolated from G. Kola include Oleoresin, tannins, saponins, alkaloids cardiac glycosides. Other phytochemical compounds so far isolated from G. Kola seeds are biflavonoids such as kola flavone and 2-hydroxybi-flanoids (Okunji et al, 2002). However, there is paucity of such information on the leaves.</p> <p>Tetrapleura tetraptera, one of the medicinal plants in Nigerian, is known in the South eastern Nigeria as “Uhiokiriho”. The documented biological or pharmacological activities are found to be molluscidal, cardiovascular, neuromuscular, hypotensive, anti conversant, anti-ulcerative, anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial. The pods notably have an appealing culinary use for mothers from the first day of delivery to post parturition and as a lactation aid. The dry fruit has a characteristic pleasant aroma which makes it a popular seasoning spice in the southern and Eastern Nigeria (Essient et al, 1994). At the same time, most of the folkloric chains agree in the traditional use of the fruit for management of convulsion, leprosy, inflammation and rheumatoid pains.</p> <p>Neem (<em>Azdirichta inidca</em>) commonly called “Indian Lilac” belongs to the family “Meliaceae”. In Nigeria, the plant is known by the name “Dogonyaro”. Neem possesses maximum useful non-wood products (leaves, bark, flowers, fruits, seed, gum, oil, and neem cake) than any other three species. These non-wood products are known to have anti-allergenic, anti-dermatic, anti-feedent, anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-pyorrhoeic, antiscabic, diuretic, insecticidal, larvicidal, nematicidal, spermicidal and other biological activities. Because of these activities, neem has found enormous applications making it a green treasure. The extracts from neem are recommended in ancient medicinal texts for gastrointestinal upsets, diarrhea and intestinal infections, skin ulcers and infections, and malaria (Schmutterer, 1995).</p> <p>Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) is a widely used herb and food – flavouring agent. Its neutraceutical properties have long been of interest to the food processing and pharmaceutical industries. The roots are commonly used as spices. It is medicinally used for its antioxidants, androgenic and hypoglycemic actions.</p> <p>This work is thus targeted at investigating the phytochemical constituents of the leaves of these five Nigerian plants. Pawpaw, tetraplaura, Bitter kola, Neen and Ginger.</p> <p><strong>1.2  Aims of the Study</strong></p> <p>The aim of this work is to investigate the chemical compounds present in the leaves of these medicinal plants.</p> <p><strong>1.3  Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>Before the advent of drugs, barks of trees, leaves, roots, etc have been used to cure ailments. Then I want to carry out analysis to know the constituents of these plants that helps to heal ailments, and as well to know if these chemical compounds present in these leaves have any side effect on those that consume them.</p> <p><strong>1.4  Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This work will help the general public</p> <p>·        To know the constituents of these plants</p> <p>·        To know the type of ailment each plant can heal</p> <p>·        To know if it has any side effect on the consumer</p> <p><strong>1.5  Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The area this work mostly covered is Aku in Igbo Etiti Local Government Area in Enugu State where these leaves were collected for analysis.</p> <p><strong>1.6  Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>This work was carefully researched, but due to financial problem and power failure, the work could not go the way I planed.

The water samples were spring water, well water and surface tank reservoir of rain water from Enugu metropolis of Aqua Rapha in a sterile container. Using pour plate plating techniques 0.1ml of water sample was pipette into Petri-dishes and the already prepared agar (nutrient agar and MacConkey) was poured into Petri-dishes, swirled for and homogenous mixture, allowed to solidify and incubated at 370C for 24hours. Presumption coliform counts was carried out by using double strength lactose and single strength lactose broth, the test in tubes incubated for 370C for 24hours. The result showed that high counts microorganisms were present in the well water, spring water has a lesser counts and reservoir has a low count. The bacterial isolated are Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella. These showed that well and spring water contained bacteria contaminant and there should be need for adequate treatment of water to avoid water borne diseases e.g. Cholera, Salmonella and streptococcus.    </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Water is one of the most common indispensable resources for the continual existence of all living thing including man. Good quality of water is odorless, tasteless, and free from fecal pollution. Water covers about 71% of the entire areas of the earth’s surface and is found in oceans, rivers, lakes, ponds, streams and springs (Ogunji et al., 2010).</p> <p>Industries and farms Harigan and Macance, 2009, reported that water sourced from rivers, streams and lakes are subjected to a lot of contaminated water ranges from dissolved salts such as carbonates, bicarbonates, chlorides and sulphate of calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium. The most deadly contamination of water is faecal contaminated water bodies gotten from contaminated feaces of human during activities such as defecation, these kind of defecate wash swim in water bodies. Moreover, the bursting of soaking pit into water bodies are also common both in rural and urban areas (Cifluent et al., 2012).             </p> <p>The inadequacy of pipe borne water in most cities in Nigeria is almost endemic. These inadequate in quality and quantity have spontaneously increased the consumption of “sachet water” and “Bottle water”. This water is packed in polythene (nylon) sachet of about 60cl for sachet water while for bottle water; the water is packaged in light plastic bottle of a varying size which compresses on applying of pressure against the bottle. In the above form they are sold to the public for consumption (APHA, 2009).</p> <p>A review of studies carried by the World Bank gives the evidence that incidence of water borne disease are related to the quality and quantity of water and sanitation available to users. Iken et al., 2008 highlights that in a contaminated water organisms especially of the Enterobacteri accence group e.g Escherichia coli, Enterbacter, Georgenes, Klebsiella, salmonella typhi Yersinia enterolitica are highly contaminated in the water.</p> <p>In order to prevent the outbreak of the water there are needs to preserves and treat water supplied to towns and cities (Cabell, 2007). The methods of treatments of water are thus; boiling of water at 1000C. This prevents the growth of pathogenic organism, boiling of water does not get rid of spore forming organism. Water treatment such as chlorination, sedimentation of water and other process that ensures the neutralization of chemical contained in water killing of pathogen organisms.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>In urban communities’ drinking water are sourced from wells, spring, rainfall etc. This water before taken is not given any form of treatment. These have caused the high rate of water borne disease. Ikeh et al., 2008 explains that the outbreak of water borne disease in urban communities is alarming and these has resulted to death of the infected individuals as a result of poor response by medical practitioners to these problem. He further states that an outbreak of water borne disease is gradually becoming an epidemic if adequate steps are not taken to combat it. Apart from urban communities people also in rural areas do not have good source of water borne disease. These statements thereby prompt the need for an analysis to be conducted of water supplied to urban areas.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>Aim of the Study</strong></p> <p>1.      To identify the bacterial organism in sachet and bottled water.</p> <p>2.      To determine the bacterial load of microorganism in the sourced water.   </p> <p>3.   To ascertain the level of the borne disease in these area.</p> <p><strong>1.4   Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>Ho:          Sachet and bottled water cannot be contaminated by bacteria.</p> <p>Ho:           Sachet and bottled water can be contaminated by bacteria.</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The result of the bacteriological examination of sachet and bottled water in Enugu Metropolis (9th mile) would determine the prevalence of water borne disease in these area and I would ensure that prevention and techniques such as boiling water, adequate treatment of water borne disease patient, thereby ensuring the control for its emergences.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong><strong>Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>Lack of finance in purchase of reagent and material that were non-existence in the laboratory and this affect the source of information thereby limiting the scope of the project work.</p> <p>This project work is limited only to identify and determines the bacterial load and organisms responsible for contamination of sachet and bottled water in 9th mile, Enugu.</p>                                                          \n\nBACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF SACHET AND BOTTLED WATER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF SACHET AND BOTTLED WATER", "id": 69}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The collection, identification and preservation of medical plants native in Enugu state were carried out between June and July 2005.

The use of these plants for is called herbalism. Medicinal plants contain and produce a variety of chemical substances that act upon the body. Herbal medicine is the primitive man observed and appreciated the great diversity of plants available to him and the plants provided food and medicine to him.</p> <p>The medicinal uses of plant seen have been developed through observation of wild animals and by trial and error. As time went on each tribe, added the medicinal power of herbs in the area of its knowledge base, for example the foxglove plant has been in use since 1775 and at present, the ear deal stimulant of the plant serves as treatment to millions of heart patient. Medicinal plants are in use throughout the globe over the time; even in Nigeria as a country and Enugu state appreciate the use and importance of herbal medicine.</p> <p>The world health organization (WHO) estimates that 4 billion people (80%) of the worlds population presently, use herbal medicine for some aspect of primary health care. In resent estimate suggests that over 9,000 plants have known medicinal application in various cultures and countries.</p> <p>The parts of plants that are used or that are involved include the following: bark, leaves, roots, flowers and saps.</p> <p>Dr. Thumberg took the trouble to identify botanically twenty-four plants, which are medicinal in nature in 1780 by the natives of South Africa, and he was convinced of their value. Over five thousand distinct species are known to occur in forest regions alone and most of them have been used for several centuries in traditional medicine for the prevention and treatment of disease. The continent is believed to have the oldest known human habitation as generally considered the cradle of human civilization.</p> <p>The ancient kingdom and empires of Africa such as Lent, Nabia, Ethiopia, Bini, Oyo, Zimbabwe, Nupe, Borno, Nri, and Mandingo has extensively codified healing zelipes. The history of healing arts in Africa can be traced back to about 3200 BC, during the times of the first pharaoh of ancient Egypt. Anthothis, the son of Menes was credited with knowledge of many therapeutic preparations, the first African physician in a scientific sense actually belong, to the great imlotap was an accomplished architect and the step pyramid at saggoroh is among his numerous works. He was also a scribe and a high ranked administration in the pharaoh’s court, a high priest and a renowned healer, who by 525 BC had become in the field as the god of medicine.</p> <p>1.2     <strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p><strong>AIM</strong></p> <p>Collection, Identification and Preservation of medicinal plants, the purpose of the research are the development in the field of medicinal plant</p>                                                          \n\nCOLLECTION, IDENTIFICATION, AND PRESERVATION OF MEDICAL PLANTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COLLECTION, IDENTIFICATION, AND PRESERVATION OF MEDICAL PLANTS", "id": 70}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This work shows how to identify the various microorganisms in palm wine and how to isolate the pathogenic organisms in palm wine viz ‘NKWUENU’, ‘ITI’, and ‘IKOT’. The attributes were identification of bacteria and yeast. All showed the spoilage rate between the erect-stem and fallen stem palm wine as shown in table 4.4 and 4.5.</p> <p>Also, the type of microorganisms present varied. In Nkwuenu, the results show the growth of streptococcus, lactobacillus and leuconostoc, and in IkOT, the result shows the growth of micrococcus, lactobacillus and baccilus in it.

It is an alcoholic beverage produced by the fermentation of sugar and other fermentable materials in palm sap. The major sources of palm wine in Nigeria are Eraesis guineensis and raphia palm Raphia hooken (Okafor 1987).</p> <p>Palm wine is usually a whitish sugary liquid, which is effervescent because the microbes causing the fermentation are alive when it is consumed. Among the land plants, the palm is very distinguished. It has a columar stem whose height range is usually between 30-50 feet (9-15 meters) high. The stem is crowned with giant leaves which are entire and folder fan at first, but usually the blade splits into segments and in some genera, the segments develop into independent leaves – lets the inflorescence is a spike like or much branched at first usually enveloped in one or more conspicuous sheathing breaks. It manifests itself in more than two thousand species and several hundred of genera.</p> <p>       Elaesis guineensis is a source of palm kernels, palm oil, palm wine and brooms in rural areas of southern Nigeria and West Africa in general. Palm are found in the meadows, stepper, and deserts on the mountains and all through the tropical and sub tropical forests of West Africa (faparsusi 1973).</p>                                                           \n\nBACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF PALM WINE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF PALM WINE", "id": 71}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0      </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Custard is a fine textured powdery food product made from corn starch. The corn starch used for the preparation of custard is basically a dense, powdery flour obtained from the endosperm protein of corn kernel (Duke, 1981).</p> <p>Custard is primarily consumed either as a breakfast cereal based food or wearing food in most developing nations of the tropics especially among children ( Ihekoronye and Ngoddy, 1985).</p> <p>Custard powder is a popular item and is often served with egg pudding and felly crystals. With increasing disposable incomes and changing life–styles, eating habits have also witnessed a definite shift.</p> <p>This phenomenon is no more restricted to the urban elites but it is spreading very fast to other areas as well.</p> <p>Thus, the contemplated product has experienced continuous increase in demand during last few years. Consistent advertising by some established manufacturers have made these products very popular which would help the new entrants provided the product quality is comparable and prices are competitive (Efstratiadis, Karirti and Arvanitoyannis, 2000).</p> <p>Custard industry in Nigeria is one of the fastest food related growing industries in the country.</p> <p>Worthy to note is the fast that most of these industries are faced with the problem of optimizing production cost and the corresponding quantity of the product to meet with the customers demand.</p> <p>These industries are concerned with the rate of productivity which can be related to the efficiency of the production system. Even though there is increase in demand, consumers have become more demanding and the key to firm survival is the recognition of the importance of customer satisfaction.</p> <p>Consequently, companies have been forced to enhance the quality of both their processes and products (Enwere, 1998).  </p> <p><strong>1.1   STATEMENT OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>For so many years people living in the urban and rural areas had been so familiar with pap, as they saw custard as a foreign food.

Epidemiologic data, in vitro studies and animal data suggest that garlic may help prevent some solid tumors, but no randomized trials have evaluated its effectiveness as a therapeutic agent in oncology. There are no studies evaluating its effectiveness or safety in treating children or pregnant or nursing women. Garlic is safe when eaten as food, though in some sensitive persons, it can cause gastrointestinal irritation, and of course, halitosis. Prolonged topical use has been associated with moderate burns. Until the first part of the 20th century, honey dressings were part of everyday wound care practice.</p>                                                          \n\nSTUDIES ON THE EFFECT OF GARLIC AND HONEY ON SOME UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STUDIES ON THE EFFECT OF GARLIC AND HONEY ON SOME UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS", "id": 73}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Plants constitute an important source of active natural products, which differ widely in terms of structure and biological properties. They have played a remarkable role in the traditional medicine of various countries. In recent years, the prevention of cancer and cardiovascular diseases has been associated with the ingestion of spices, fresh fruits, vegetables, or teas rich in natural antioxidants (Virgili et al., 2001). The protective effects of plant products are due to the presence of several components, which have distinct mechanisms of action; some are enzymes and proteins and others are low molecular weight compounds such as flavonoids. (Birt et al 2001).</p> <p>The story of spices and other flavorings, materials is one of the most interesting chapters in the history of vegetable products (Obadoni and Ochuko, 2002). The cravings for spices have been on of the great factors in human progress and have done much to change the course of history and geography and to promote international relations (Akindahunsi and Salawu, 2005)</p> <p>Spices are used to season insipid foods and to add zest to an otherwise monotonous diet. They stimulate the appetite and increase the flow of gastric juice. For this reason, they are often referred to as food accessories or adjuncts. They also play a role in many of the industries, and are used in perfumery, soaps, incense, as dyes in histology and in various acts (Onyesom and Okoh, 2006). Studies on spices have been mostly on their exciting flavours and aromas medicinal values and as flavorings. These spices are said to be therapeutically useful in the management of convulsion, leprosy, stomachache, inflammation and/or rheumatoid pains, couch and loss of appetite (Valko et al., 2007). The spices prevent postpartum contraction and aid lactation. They are also used as vegetables for spicing meat, oil bean salad, and foods., most of these spices have been associated with abundant bitter principle which is claimed to reduce blood sugar levels, and their liquor taken as a purge for colic, stomach pains, and worm infections. It is also believed that new born babies grow rapidly when they are fed with food made of these spices (Roger, 2002). The spices grow commonly in high forest areas of the south eastern region of Nigeria, as climbers, perennial creepers, or slim shrubs and trees and are available all year round (Sofowora, 1993). Proximate and nutrient analysis of medicinal plants, edible fruits and vegetables plays a crucial role in assessing their nutritional significance (Pandey et. al., 2006). As various medicinal plant species are also consumed as food along with their medicinal benefits, evaluating their nutritional significance can help to understand the worth of these plant species (Pandey et. al., 2006).</p> <p>There are also various claims about the usefulness of these spices, especially their use in fattening homes, and remarkable growth of new born babies whose mothers use these spices our results would aid in assessing their nutritional potential in relation to their ethnomedicinmal uses by the people of South East of Nigeria. The spices  include piper guineenses (uziza), Xylopia Aethiopica (Uda), Monodora myristica (Ehuru), and Tetrapleura tetrapetra (oshosho). These spices have been described variously by (Smith et. al., 1996). The result of this study will aid in appreciating the acclaimed medicinal properties of these spices and their age long usage by the people.</p>                                                         \n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL SPICES AND HERBS TO THE HUMAN HEALTH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL SPICES AND HERBS TO THE HUMAN HEALTH", "id": 74}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0  INTRODUCTION</p> <p>MICROBIAL ANALYSIS OF EXPIRED CANNED FOOD PRODUCT (CANNED MILK).</p> <p>       The wide array of available dairy foods challenges the microbiologist, engineer, and technologist to find the best ways to prevent the entry of microorganisms, destroy those that do get in along with their enzymes, and prevent the growth and activities of those that escape processing treatment.</p> <p>Troublesome spoilage micro organisms include aerobic psychrotrophic Gram negative bacteria, yeasts, molds, heterofermentative, lactobacilli, and Spore-forming bacteria psychrotrophic extracellular hydrolytic enzymes, and the extend of recontamination of pasteurized fluid milk products with these bacteria is a major determinant of their shelf life.

These are connected to sewer system in most urban areas and to septic tanks in less built-up areas.</p> <p>Toilet is also one of public facilities, which is frequently used by people and located indoor. In recent years, Scientist and public have put much concern about indoor air quality in toilet systems. Several studies have found out that indoor air pollution levels to be greater than outdoor levels (USEPA, 2001). Thus it is risky to health posed by indoor air pollution than those posed by outdoor air pollution. Therefore maintaining good air quality in toilet is essential in order to keep it hygienic and sanitary. This is aligned with the statement mentioned by Wike, “in order to create a healthier and safer environment, the first step is the wash room”. In an environment, spores of molds and bacteria may become air borne and are therefore ubiquitous. They can enter indoor areas either by means of ventilation systems. The relative humidity and/or the moisture content of the materials determines that to what extent different micro-organism are able to grow on indoor.

Therefore the task of microbial examinations is to differentiate between normal indoor microorganisms which may cause adverse health effects (Madukasi <em>et al., </em>2010).</p> <p>Air sampling of microorganisms is a popular method of conducting microbial examinations, as it allows a direct toxicological evaluation. Specific activities like talking, sneezing, coughing and toilet flushing can generate air borne biological particulate matter and occasionally release spores of <em>Altenaria, Aspergillus, Botrytis, Cladosporium, Penicillium, </em>and <em>Scopulariopsis </em>into air (Maeir <em>et al., </em>2002).</p> <p>Indoor air pollution can be as much more worse than that of outdoor air, it can cause wide range of health problems.</p>\n\nMICROBIAL AIR QUALITY OF TOILET ENVIRONMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MICROBIAL AIR QUALITY OF TOILET ENVIRONMENT", "id": 76}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Introduction</strong></li> </ul> <p>The term ‘Viscosity’ describes a material’s property from a physicists point of view, it is a fluids thickness.

The Lisikili river in Zambezi region, Namibia is a major perennial river which serves diverse economic purposes in the host community. However, it has been receiving pollution threat from effluents discharge and surface run-off from intensive agricultural lands, as well as cottage and hospitality industries and no research has been carried out on the pollution status of the river. Thus, the main aim of this study is to conduct preliminary assessment of some heavy metals pollution status of the river water. Eight (8) water samples were collected at 8 random points within a stretch of approximately 2km on each extremity and median parts of the river. Two major economic fish from the river, tilapia fish (Oreochromis niloticus) and cat fish (Siluriformes) (8 samples of each) were collected using fish net at the points of water sampling. The samples were transported to analytical laboratory in ice boxes for processing and analyses for the levels of Pb, As, Cr, Cd, Cu, Zn, Mn and Fe using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrophotometer (ICP: Perkin Elmer Optima 7000 DV). The results obtained showed wide mean concentrations of the heavy metals in the river water; iron recorded the highest level of 2.375 mg/l and arsenic (0.047 mg/l) recorded the lowest level. Apart from Zn (0.259 mg/l) and Cu (0.073 mg/l) with the present concentrations lower than their guideline permissible limits, the mean concentrations of the other heavy metals exceeded their maximum permissible guideline values for the protection of human and aquatic health. Based on the classification of metal pollution index (PI) for water, apart from Cu (PI = 0.03) and Zn (PI = 0.04); all the other heavy metals recorded pollution indices which suggest moderate to strong effect on the river water quality. In both the catfish and tilapia fish (wet weight whole sample), iron (4.926 mg/kg and 3.323 mg/kg) recorded the highest mean concentration while Cd (0.136 mg/kg and 0.078mg/kg) recorded the lowest level respectively. Generally, the present levels of the heavy metals were below their regulatory limits for the protection of human health. However, the fish’s bio-accumulation factors of the metals suggest that they have high potentials to bioaccumulate some of the heavy metals to high levels and this has adverse implication for human consumption. Because heavy metals are non-biodegradable and bio-accumulative in nature which therefore, make their presence in human foods even at very minute levels potential toxins, it is important to monitor their accumulations in the river and fish and advice precautionary measures to limit excessive human exposures to the heavy metals content.  <br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 Background to the study<br/>Heavy metals are natural components of the environment but they have become a matter of great concern because of the continuous increase in concentration of these metals in our environment (Abah et al, 2013). In particular, studies on heavy metals pollution of rivers, lakes, fish and sediments have become a major environmental focus in the recent decades (Ali and Fishar, 2005). The pollution of aquatic environment by chemical agents such as heavy metals poses adverse threat to aquatic organisms including fish, and this could yield extended effects on the human food chain. Heavy meals concentrations in the aquatic organism depict the past as well as the current pollution load in the environment in which the organism lives (Ravera et al., 2003).. Water pollution occurs when unwanted materials with potentials to threaten human and other natural systems find their ways into rivers, lakes, wells, streams, boreholes or even reserved fresh water in homes and industries (Aboyeji, 2013). According to this author, the effect of water pollution can be catastrophic, depending on the kind of chemical pollutants, concentration of the pollutants and where the pollution occurs. In aquatic ecosystem, the contamination by heavy metals is a serious threat because of their toxicity, and environmental persistence with possibilities for bio-accumulation and bio-magnification in the food chain. Aquatic organisms, including fish, accumulate pollutants directly from contaminated water and indirectly via the food chain (Hammer, 2004; Mohammed, 2009). In the aquatic environment, the trace elements are partitioned among various environmental components (water, suspended solids, sediments and biota) (Shakweer and Abbas, 2005). <br/>Due to increased human population with the attendant anthropogenic activities, both surface and underground water supplies are now affected and deteriorating fast worldwide. Water pollution has been indicated to be the leading cause of death and diseases worldwide (Pink, 2006), and accounting for more than 14,000 deaths of people daily (West, 2006).  A report by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nation (FAO) revealed that in African countries, water related diseases had been interfering with basic human development (FAO, 2007). This scenario has raised serious concerns to World Health Organization, in an attempt to improve the cultural and socio-economic standards of people in the tropical region (Umeh et al., 2004). Research report has shown that in addition to the acute problems of water pollution in developing countries, the developed countries also continue to struggle with the same pollution problems (Aboyeji, 2013). For example, in the national report on water quality in the United States, 45 percent of assessed stream miles, 47 percent of assessed lake acres, and 32 percent of assessed bays and estuarine square miles were classified as polluted (EPA, 2007).  A report by Hays (2013) indicated that the China government in summer of 2011 reported that 43 percent of state-monitored rivers are so polluted, and are unsuitable for human contact. It was further submitted that by one estimate, one-sixth of China’s population is threatened by seriously polluted water. Pyrbot and Laloo,  (2015) in a study on the toxic elements of a river noted that water is the most important and precious natural resources that is essential for the survival of living organisms, and which man has exploited more than any other resources for the sustenance of life. River water pollution can be linked to the type of waste water produced by urban, industrial, and agricultural activities that flow into surface and subsurface waters (Vittori et al., 2010).  <br/>1.2 Statement Of The Problem<br/>The increasing quantities and heterogeneity of effluents discharged into water bodies have greatly affected the natural processes of pollutants reduction. Thus, regular monitoring of the qualities of water resources is absolutely necessary to assess the quality of water for ecosystem health and hygiene, industrial use, agricultural use and domestic use (Poonam et al., 2013). It has been submitted that the protection of water and aquatic ecosystem from adverse effects of pollutants such as heavy metals is central to environmental risk management (Bere and Tundisi, 2011). The Lisikili river in Zambezi region of Namibia is a high economic resource which serves diverse human needs such as domestic utilization, fishing, and subsistence farm irrigation in the host community. Agricultural contaminations of many resources through fallout, drainage and run-off erosion is highly probable in rivers within the vicinity of intensive agricultural activities (Abah et al., 2013). Where this occurs, it constitutes threat to the sustainable use of the river resources. Even though, the Lisikili river - a major economic river in Zambezi region, is very prone to surface run-off from agricultural lands owing to intensive agricultural activities along the bank of the river, especially its proximity to Kalimbeza National Rice Research field, and effluent discharges from the cottage and hospitality industries within the vicinity of the river, there has not been any documented research on the pollution status of the river. This creates the need to carry out this baseline study with a view to determining the current heavy metals pollution status of the river and provide scientific data for future monitoring of the metals accumulation in the water body. Evaluation and understanding the sources and impact relationship of the effects of heavy metals in water bodies and biological species is important for effective water management, and the preservation of the aquatic ecosystem (Olatunji and Osibanjo, 2012). Thus, it becomes pertinent to carry out preliminary assessment of heavy metals pollution status of the Lisikili river water and its two economic fishes: tilapia fish (Oreochromis niloticus) and cat fish (Siluriformes) consumed in and around Zambezi region. <br/>1.3 Aim and Objectives of the Research <br/>The aim of this research study is to ascertain the level of concentration of heavy metals in freshwater fish in Lisikili river water, and the objectives are as follows: to<br/>a) Determine theconcentrations of the heavy metals in the river water<br/>b) Concentrations of the heavy metals in the Fish (Catfish and Tilapia fish)<br/>c) Determine the Pollution index (PI) and metal index (MI) of the heavy metals in Lisikili river water <br/>d) Examine Inter-elemental correlation between paired mean concentrations of the heavy metals  <br/>1.4 Significance of the Study <br/>Heavy metals (HMs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) pollution studies have been conducted in other areas downstream of River but none is yet conducted at the confluence of heavy metal on fresh fishes <br/>a)    for the first time, provide baseline data on heavy metals (HM) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for this area of study. <br/>b)    generate data to be used to assess the impact of these heavy metals (HM) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in water and fish consuming populace in the area of study.<br/>c)    the result will be of use to Health management practitioners in the diagnoses of certain diseases prevalent in the area of study which could be caused by heavy metals. <br/> 1.5 Scope of the Study <br/>The study was designed to assess and evaluate the level of Heavy Metals (HMs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contamination in the fresh fish and sediments of in Lisikili river water using atomic absorption spectrophotometer for the heavy metals determination and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques for the determination of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) respectively. The physico-chemical characteristics of the media were also measured using appropriate probes since they are the factors responsible for the environmental mobility and bioavailability of the pollutants. The work was limited to a dry and rainy season for HMs analysis and a rainy season for PAHs analysis and Lisikili river waterand three kilometers (3 km) upstream and downstream of river. <br/><br/>\n\nDETERMINATION OF HEAVY METAL IN FRESH WATER FISH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DETERMINATION OF HEAVY METAL IN FRESH WATER FISH", "id": 79}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Snails belong to class Gastropoda, a classification that includes land, freshwater and sea snails and slugs.

It is extensively cultivated as an annual crop in tropical and subtropical regions for its edible starchy tuberous root, a major source of carbohydrates. Cassava can also be classified into different species which include <em>M</em>. <em>aesculifolia</em> (AES), <em>M</em>. <em>Brachyloba</em> (BLO), <em>M</em>. <em>Carthaginensis</em> (CTH), <em>M.

However, it contains cynogens (1.3%) depending on cultivars (Stupak <em>et al</em>., 2006) and large amount of cyanogenic glucosiders in the cassava flour (Cumbane <em>et al</em>., 2007) which could limit cassava root utilization for consumption and for livestock feeding. Cassava appears to have originated in Brazil and Paraguay, but has spread throughout tropical areas of south and Central America long before the arrival of Columbus. Cassava is now one of the most important food crops in counties throughout the world.</p> <p>It ranks as the 6th most important food crop worldwide, even though in Western countries it is little known or used. The tubers of cassava or ‘’Yuca’’, as the plant is commonly known in South America, are extremely rich in starch infact, it is the richest sources of starch of any food plant (it contains up to 10times as much starch as corn and twice as much as potatoes). The large tubers, which can weight can weigh up to 5kg provide 30% of their dry weight as starch. However, the entire plant is poisonous if consumed raw, due to its linamarin content, a pre-cursor of cyanode glycosides.  Nigeria is the world’s largest producer of cassava while Thailand is the largest exporter of dried cassava.</p> <p><strong>1.1     Objective Of Study</strong></p> <p>The objectives of the study is</p> <ul><li>To enumerate the microbial content of dried cassava peel</li> <li>To isolate and identify the potential spoilage organism of this product</li> <li>To make recommendation on how to preserve the peels before consumption by the livestock.</li> </ul> <p>1.2<strong> Scope And Limitation</strong></p> <p>This study will cover the production processing and storage of cassava peel for livestock consumption (pig) and the limitation will include inadequacy of current literature tone and financial constrain.</p>\n\nMICROBIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF DRY CASSAVA PEEL USED IN THE PREPARATION OF PIG FEEDS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MICROBIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF DRY CASSAVA PEEL USED IN THE PREPARATION OF PIG FEEDS", "id": 81}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Introduction </strong><ul><li><strong>Background of the Study </strong></li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>The coconut <em>(Cocos nucifera </em>L.) is a tropical plant which belong to the order Arecales and family Arecaceae.

Historical records suggest that malaria has infected human since the beginning of mankind. The name “mal aria” (Meaning bad air in Italian) was first used in English in 1740 by H. Walpole when describing the disease. The term was shortened to malaria in 20th century. Laveran; in 1880 was the first to identify parasites in human blood. In 1889, Ross discovered that mosquitoes transmit malaria.</p> <p>        Malaria continues to be a cause of great suffering in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world (Brabin, 1989). Currently, it is endemic in about 100 countries affecting 4% of world’s population. Malaria has been eliminated or effectively suppressed in several parts of the world in past decade but is now undergoing resurgence (Gilles, 1987). It is returning to areas from which it had been eradicated as well as spreading into new areas such as central Asia and Eastern Europe. Despite global economic development people are dying from malaria now than 30 years ago.</p> <ol><li>EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CLINICAL FEATURES</li> </ol> <p>Malaria in pregnancy remain a notable cause of maternal and prenatal morbidity and mortality, often associated with maternal illness, maternal anemia, low birth weight, preterm delivery and prenatal loss especially in the primigravidae. In semi-immune pregnant women, malaria infection may be asymptomatic, pregnant women are at risk of clinical disease compared to non-pregnant women at all levels of endemicity (Harrison, 1995). There is unparasitized blood cells leading to a greater level of anemia than can be explained on the basis of RBCS parasitization alone (who,1991).</p> <p>Primgravidity is a known risk factor in pregnancy. It only becomes more prevalent in primigravide but also intense (Jimoh, 2003). The peak prevalence of parasitemia will be altered by prior anti malaria    injection. In a study from Madan, Papua New Guinea, the peak prevalence in primigravidae studied reached 55% to compared to 86% in other study from Kenya (flemming, 1986). Studies have also suggested that the highest prevalence of infection occurs in the 2nd trimester with inflection rate at delivery and in the postnatal period approximating to levels in non pregnant women possibly due to immunity boosting during pregnancy (Akindele, et al 1993)</p> <p>CAUSATIVE AGENT OF MALARIA</p> <p>Malaria is caused by five (5) species of plasmodium. They are as follows:</p> <p>plasmodium vivax (p. vivax) – This species is milder and generally not fatal. However, infected people still need treatment because their untreated progress can also cause a host of health problems. (Rogreson et al 2007)</p> <p>Plasmodium  Malariae ( P. Malaria) This species also is milder and not fatal. The infected person should be properly treated to avoid further health problems. This species is known to stay in the blood of the affected for several years (WHO, 2008).</p> <p>Plasmodium  Ovale (P. Ovale) -  It is also mild and as well need adequate treatment to avoid serious health condition. It stays in the liver of the affected person even for years without symptoms. (Neeru, 2005)</p> <p>Plasmodium Falciparum (P. Falciparum) This is the most serious form of the disease. It is most common in Africa, especially sub-saharan Africa. It needed thorough and adequate treatment of the affected person (Okwa, 2003).</p> <p>Plasmodium knowlesi (P. Knowlesi). This causes malaria in macaques but can also infect humans.</p> <p>INCUBATION PERIOD OF PLASMODIUM</p> <p>This refers to how long it takes from initial infection to the appearance of symptoms. This generally depends on the type (species) of parasite.</p> <ul><li>P. falicparum      -       9 to 14 days</li> <li>P. Vivax             -       12 to 18 days</li> <li>P. vivax             -       12 to 18 days</li> <li>P. malaria -       18-40 days</li> </ul> <p>However, incubation periods can vary from as little as 7 days to several months for P. vivax and p. ovale</p> <p>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</p> <p>The signs and symptoms of malaria typically begin 8-25 days following infections. However, symptoms may occur later in those who have taken antimalaria medication as prevention. The signs and symptoms may include the following</p> <ul><li>Fever</li> <li>Shivering</li> <li>Joint pain (Arthralgia)</li> <li>Vomiting</li> <li>Hemolytic anemia</li> <li>Jaundice</li> <li>Convulsion</li> <li>Sudden coldness followed by rigor</li> <li>Severe headache</li> <li>Enlarged spleen etc.</li> </ul> <p>LIFE CYCLE</p> <p>The life cycle malaria is complex with asexual reproduction in the mammalian host and sexual reproduction in the anophelene vector. The female anopheles mosquito carrying malaria causing-parasites feeds on a human and injects the parasite in the form of sporozoites into the blood stream. The sporozoites travel to the liver and invade the liver. Within some days (5-6) the sporozites grow, divide and produce tens of thousands of merozoites. Some malaria parasite species remain dormant for extended periods in the liver. The merozoties exit the liver cells and re-enter blood stream to invade the red blood cell, it under goes asexual replication and release new formed merozoites from the red blood cells. Some of the merozoites infected blood cells instead of replicating asexually, develop into sexual forms of the parasite called male and female gametocytes that circulate in the blood stream.</p> <p>When the mosquito has a blood meal, it ingests the gametocytes. In the gut, the infected human blood cell burst, releasing the gametocytes, which develop further into mature sex cell called gametes. Male and female gametes fuse to form ookinetes which burrow into the mosquito midgut and form outcasts. Growth and division of each oocyst produce thousands of active haploid forms called sporozoites which migrates to the salivary gland of the mosquito waiting for another round of blood meal (Ter kulie et al 2003)</p> <p>PATHOGENESIS</p> <p>During the life cycle of malaria parasites in human body, Mosquito infects a person by taking a blood meal. Initially, sporozoite enters the blood stream and migrate to the liver. They infect liver cells (hepatocytes); where they multiply into merozoites, rupture the liver cells and escape back into the blood stream. Then, the merozoites infect red blood cells, where they develop into ring forms, trophozoites and schizonts which in turn produce further merozoites. Sexual forms (gametocytes) are also produced, which if taken up by a mosquito, will infect the host and continue the life cycle. Malaria develop into too phases- exoerythrocytic and erythrocytic cycle/phases. Exoerythrocytic has to do with infection of hepatic or liver cells while erythrocytic phase entails infection of erythrocytes or red blood cell, the sporozite migrates to the liver and infects the hepatocytes. It can continue to multiply without showing any symptoms within 8-30 days (cogsnell, 1992).</p> <p>EFFECT OF MALARIA INFECTION IN PREGNANCY</p> <p> There are many adverse effects of malaria during pregnancy. Pregnant woman are known to be more prone to contracting malaria than those that are not pregnant. A women’s immune system is affected during pregnancy. He becomes much more susceptible to developing malaria which atime  even leads to death of the child before birth or right after delivery (Steketee, et al, 2001). Some adverse effects of malaria during pregnancy include:-</p> <ul><li>Anemia (Maternal and foetal aneinia)</li> <li>Fever</li> <li>Altered blood sugar levels</li> <li>Infection that harms the genitals</li> <li>Chance of cerebral malaria or other neurological problems</li> <li>Miscarriages</li> <li>Still birth</li> </ul> <p>TREATMENT /MANAGEMENT OF MALARIA IN PREGNANCY</p> <p>Treatment of malaria in pregnancy differs from the treatment of same woman outside pregnancy in several respects. Frequency and severity of infections are more in pregnancy particularly among primigravidae (Mutabingwa, 2004). Pregnant women with malaria infection must be treated both medically and obstetrically, taking care of both maternal and fetal interests. It is reasonable to expect confirmation of malaria infection in pregnancy. The choice of a suitable drug is predicated upon many factors including gestational age of fetus severity of the disease, the resistance of the infecting malaria parasites to the anti malaria drugs and safety profile of the drug in both mother and fetus. Ideally, effective care should clear both peripheral and placental parasites (Lars Hived, 1998).   </p> <p>OBSTETRIC MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANT WOMEN WITH MALARIA INFECTION</p> <p>Obstetric management is an integral part of the complete management of the malarious pregnant women. It consists of antepartum, intrapartum and post partum care.</p> <p>ANTEPARTUM  CARE OF PREGNANT WOMEN WITH MALARIA</p> <p>Essentially, during the antepartum or prenatal period, the antenatal clinic forms the template upon which the institutional treatment is based. As part of the routine ante natal care, history of malaria is obtained, blood tests including full blood count and malaria parasites are routinely requested for. Regular antenatal is of great importance as a single missed monthly clinic visit can result in a two fold increase malaria incidence. (Garnier, 1994) .</p> <p>INTRA PARTUM MANAGEMENT OF MALARIA IN PREGNANCY</p> <p>Intra partum management of parturient malarious women should include treatment of acute malaria with suitable agent. Routine intrapartum haemoglobin check is mandatory as ongoing hemolytic or pre-existing maternal anemia can substantially affect maternal and fetal outcome (Shulman et al, 1999).</p> <p>POSTPARTUM MANAGEMENT OF MALARIA IN PREGNANCY</p> <p>Following delivery, the mother should complete her antimalarials and supportive treatment. The foetus should be properly examined and congenital malaria excluded. The foetus should be properly examined and congenital malaria excluded. The newborn’s peripheral venous blood should be done to check for malaria parasites. Experiences by many authors have shown that heavy maternal parasitaemia significantly increases placental parasitization and fetal parasitaemia with consequent fetal anemia and possible fetal demise (Parise etal, 1998). The use of malaria vaccine in both the mother and the fetus postpartum is still inconclusive and controversial and many trials are underway to ascertain their safety profile and effectiveness.</p> <p>PREVENTION/CONTROL OF MALARIA IN PREGNANCY</p> <p>The main ways of preventing malaria in pregnancy can be achieved in two ways, they are;</p> <ol><li>Avoiding mosquito bite:- This can be achieved in various ways.</li> </ol> <p>A) VECTOR CONTROL: This means trying to reduce contact with the vector of the disease. Controlling mosquito can significantly reduce malaria incidence as well as other mosquito borne diseases. Installation of screened windows air condition together with strategies to reduce vector populations are very effective and have led to the total elimination of malaria without completely getting rid of the mosquito (Neeru, 2005).</p> <p>B) USE OF INSECTICIDE TREATED BED NETS (ITNS): ITNS can reduce the incidence of malaria  infection in pregnancy and also mortality rate in endemic areas. If ITNS are widely used in an endemic places, the mosquito population may drop dramatically as well as their life spans. </p> <p>2) Preventing disease using anti malarial medications: Drugs that are effective and at the same time that cannot affect the growing foetus should be administered starting from early pregnancy. This type of prevention is also known as suppression, they do not prevent the parasite from entering the blood stream but they stop it from developing in the blood (mc cormick,1985)    </p> <p>LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>According to Oxford Medical Dictionary, pregnancy is a period during which a woman harbors a developing foetus normally in the uterus. This last for approximately 266 days from the time of conception till the time of delivery the baby 280  days  from the  first day of a woman’s menstrual period.</p> <p>It has been observed that malaria in pregnancy has continued to be a scourge in tropical and subtropical region of the world. However, p. Falciparum has been noted to be the most serious form of the disease in pregnancy. (WHO, 1993).</p> <p>Malaria in pregnancy is the major cause of stillbirths, infant mortality, maternal mortality and even low birth weight (Menendez, 1994). In areas where malaria is endemic, people may have immunity or semi – immunity and therefore have either no symptoms or few symptoms. </p> <p>The severity of the malaria depends on three things:</p> <ol><li>The type of parasite</li> <li>Ones immunity</li> <li>The functional ability of one’s spleen (Schultiz, 1994).</li> </ol> <p>The parasite is transmitted by female anopheles mosquito when it bites human. As the parasite exists in human red blood cells, malaria can be passed from one person to the other through organ transplant, share of used needles/syringes and blood transfusion. Additionally, infected mother can as well transfer malaria to her baby during delivery it is called congenital malaria (Bray et al, 1999).</p> <p>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This research work is made to find out the rate at which malaria affect pregnant women and their unborn children. It is also made to educate mothers of childbearing age and even the entire population on how best to check malaria infection in order to enhance the health of mother and child.</p>                                                          \n\nTHE PREVALENCE OF MALARIA AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN ON ADDMISSION IN IMO STATE SPECIALIST HOSPITAL OWERRI<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PREVALENCE OF MALARIA AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN ON ADDMISSION IN IMO STATE SPECIALIST HOSPITAL OWERRI", "id": 83}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>MICROBIAL ANALYSIS OF EXPIRED CANNED FOOD PRODUCT (LIQUID CANNED MILK)</b><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>This study on the microbial assessment of expired canned milk products was conducted in Imo State between the months of June to October, 2012. a total of five expired canned milks were used in the study.

They have played a remarkable role in the traditional medicine of various countries. In recent years, the prevention of cancer and cardiovascular diseases has been associated with the ingestion of spices, fresh fruits, vegetables, or teas rich in natural antioxidants (Virgili et al., 2001). The protective effects of plant products are due to the presence of several components, which have distinct mechanisms of action; some are enzymes and proteins and others are low molecular weight compounds such as flavonoids. (Birt et al 2001).<br/> The story of spices and other flavorings, materials is one of the most interesting chapters in the history of vegetable products (Obadoni and Ochuko, 2002). The cravings for spices have been on of the great factors in human progress and have done much to change the course of history and geography and to promote international relations (Akindahunsi and Salawu, 2005)<br/> Spices are used to season insipid foods and to add zest to an otherwise monotonous diet. They stimulate the appetite and increase the flow of gastric juice. For this reason, they are often referred to as food accessories or adjuncts. They also play a role in many of the industries, and are used in perfumery, soaps, incense, as dyes in histology and in various acts (Onyesom and Okoh, 2006). Studies on spices have been mostly on their exciting flavours and aromas medicinal values and as flavorings. These spices are said to be therapeutically useful in the management of convulsion, leprosy, stomachache, inflammation and/or rheumatoid pains, couch and loss of appetite (Valko et al., 2007). The spices prevent postpartum contraction and aid lactation. They are also used as vegetables for spicing meat, oil bean salad, and foods., most of these spices have been associated with abundant bitter principle which is claimed to reduce blood sugar levels, and their liquor taken as a purge for colic, stomach pains, and worm infections. It is also believed that new born babies grow rapidly when they are fed with food made of these spices (Roger, 2002). The spices grow commonly in high forest areas of the south eastern region of Nigeria, as climbers, perennial creepers, or slim shrubs and trees and are available all year round (Sofowora, 1993). Proximate and nutrient analysis of medicinal plants, edible fruits and vegetables plays a crucial role in assessing their nutritional significance (Pandey et. al., 2006). As various medicinal plant species are also consumed as food along with their medicinal benefits, evaluating their nutritional significance can help to understand the worth of these plant species (Pandey et. al., 2006).<br/> There are also various claims about the usefulness of these spices, especially their use in fattening homes, and remarkable growth of new born babies whose mothers use these spices our results would aid in assessing their nutritional potential in relation to their ethnomedicinmal uses by the people of South East of Nigeria. The spices  include piper guineenses (uziza), Xylopia Aethiopica (Uda), Monodora myristica (Ehuru), and Tetrapleura tetrapetra (oshosho). These spices have been described variously by (Smith et. al., 1996). The result of this study will aid in appreciating the acclaimed medicinal properties of these spices and their age long usage by the people.<br/> 1.1    AIMS AND OBJECTIVE<br/>This research work is aimed at analyzing the physicochemical and antioxidant properties of culinary and local spices, with special reference to pipe Guinennse (uziza), Xylopia Aethiopica (uda),, Monodora Myristica (Ehuru) and tetrapelura tetraptera (Oshosho). It aims in achieving this will go along way in analyzing their uses and their uses and their nutritional value. It aim in achieving this will go along way in analyzing their uses and their uses and their nutritional value. It will also take as its objective to review the historical concept of the culinary herbs and spices and their functions.<br/>1.2    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.2.1 Physicochemical<br/>According to the thinkexist.con dictionary, it involves the principles of both physics and chemistry, depend on, or produced by, the join actions of physical and chemical agencies.<br/>1.2.3 Antioxidant<br/>An antioxidant is a chemical compound that actually inhibits oxidation. During the winter months your body has a lot more work to do fighting off infection. Many people believe that increasing your intake of antioxidants that you will be able to fight off those cold causing infections. Something known as free radicals tend attack the healthy cells, especially during cold and flu season. It has been medically proved that antioxidant protect those healthy cells from the free radicals.<br/> <br/>1.2.3 Property<br/>According to the oxford advanced learners dictionary, property is a thin or things or quality that are owned by somebody or something, a possession or possessions:<br/>1.2.4 Culinary Herbs:<br/>Culinary herbs are those annual, biennial or perennial plants whose green parts, tender roots or ripe seeds have an aromatic flavor and fragrance, due either to a volatile oil or to other chemically named substances peculiar to the individual species. The herbs having a pleasing scent are called sweet, and since they have been long used in cookery to add their characteristic flavors to soups, stews, dressing, sauces and salads, they are popularly called culinary.<br/>1.2.5 Local Spices:<br/>A local spice on the other hand is any of the various vegetable productions which are fragrant or aromatic and pungent to the taste.<br/>1.2.6 Pipe Guineense (Uziza)<br/>Is a West African Pepper, also known as Ashanti pepper, Benin pepper false Cubeb, guinea cubeb. Uziza pepper or (ambiguously) “Guinea pepper”. Called locally kale, kukauabe, masoro, sasema and soro wisa, it a West African spice that corresponds to the dried fruit of Piper guineeense. As such, it is a member of the genus Piper, like all true pepper seeds. It is a close relative of cubeb pepper and a relative of balck pepper and long pepper. Unlike cubeb pepper, which is large and spherical in shape, Ashanti peppers are prolate spheroids, smaller and smoother than Cubeb pepper in appearance and generally bear a reddish tinge. The stalks of Ashanti pepper berries are also distinctly curved whilst those of cubeb pepper are completely straight<br/>1.2.7 XYLOPIA AETHIOPICA (UDA)<br/>According to A. Rish, Xylopia aethiopica is an evergreen, aromatic tree, growing up to 20m high. It is a native to the lowland rainforest and moist fringe forests in the savanna zones of Africa. The dried fruits of X. aethiopica (Grains of Selim) are used as a spice and a traditional medicine. Etymology, Xylopia is a compression from Greek, iXov Irt’pov (xylon pikron) meaning “bitter wood”, aethiopica refers to the origin  of the tree, though currently, most of it grows in Ghana xylopia Aethiopica is a medicinal plant of great repute in West Africa which produces a variety of complex chemical compounds. The fresh and dried fruits, leaf, stem bark and root bark essential oils showed various degrees of activity against the Gram positive bacteria, bacillus Subtilis and Staphylococcus Aureus, the Gram positive bacteria, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, the Gram negative bacteria pseudomonas aerugmosa and the yeast-like fungus candida aihicans, using the cupplate method. However, none of the oils showed activity against Echerichia coli.<br/>1.2.8 MONODORA MYRISTICA (EHURU)<br/>Also known as Calabash nutmeg (Monodora Myristica) Gaertn Dunal is a tropical tree of the family Annonaceae or custard apple family of flowering plants. In former times, its seeds were widely sold as a inexpensive nutmeg substitute. Nowadays however, this is less common outside its region of production.<br/> 1.2.9 TETRAPLEURA TETRAPTERA (OSHOSHO)<br/>According to Adesina et al (1980), tetrapleura tetraptera is a species of flowering plant in the pea family native to Western Africa. The plant is called Prekese (or, more correctly, Prekese) in the Twi language of Ghana. The tree has many uses. Its sweet fragrance is highly valued, its fruit is used to spice dishes, and its bark is used for medicinal purposes.<br/> In so many countries, the use of culinary herbs and local spices are so extensive in many cultural ways. Culinary herbs make refreshing teas or drinks to purge or give appetite; as message liquids or oils for bites, swellings, sprains, pains and bruises; as poultices to draw out impurities and foreign bodies; as aphrodisiacs to make a man virile, a woman more fertile and also for abortion and contraception. (Edeoga et al 2005).<br/> It is almost forgotten that not too long ago bitters were common to the table. They were made from herbs that had ample potash and were good because they contained potassium.<br/> In the view of Achinewhu et al  (1995), the fragrance of each herb provides a clue to its unique character. But if you are unfamiliar with a herb, take the direct approach. Pull off a leaf (or some seeds) and taste it. Then experiment adding a few snips of one or a sprinkling of another to your favorite recipes. Culinary herbs are a seed plant which does not develop woody tissue as that of a shrub or tree, but is more or less soft or succulent. Herbs act as astringents, acidifiers, alkalinizers, tonics, diaphoretics, diuretics, laxatives and serve several other purposes. Thus herbs may be spices as well as herbs.<br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE LOCAL SPICES AND HERBS TO THE HUMAN HEALTH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPORTANCE LOCAL SPICES AND HERBS TO THE HUMAN HEALTH", "id": 85}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ASSESSMENT OF SOME HAEMOTOLOGICAL PARAMETER ON MALARIA PATIENT AT GENERAL HOSPITAL OWERRI</b><br/>ABTRACT<br/>Hematological parameters are measurable indices of the blood that serve as a marker for disease diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate hematological parameters of patients with malaria in Nigeria. This was a prospective study in which the full blood count of patients, with malaria attending the General Hospital Owerri, Nigeria from March to May 2007, were analyzed. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 15.0 software. P value of less than or equal to 0.05 is considered as statistically significant. A total of 100 patients were recruited for the study. Fifty patients had P.falciparum malaria while the remaining was negative and were used as controls. There were more males with malaria (n=30) than females (n=20) and thirty two (64%) were below 5years while 18(36%) were above 5 years. Lymphocyte and monocyte counts were elevated among patients with malaria relative to the control while haemoglobin and platelet levels were significantly decreased (P ≤0.05). The platelet level decreases as the degree of malaria parasitaemia increases. Haemalogical parameters in patients with malaria infection are deranged. Thrombocytopenia could be used to determine presence and severity of malaria.<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>        Malaria is one of the most prevalent human infections worldwide resulting in 225 million cases each year (WHO, 2010). It is caused by protozoa parasite of the genus plasmodium which infects and destroys red blood cells. Four species of plasmodia (P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. vivax) cause malaria in humans of which P. falciparum is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality (Taylor-Robinson, 1998; Das and Pan, 2006).Malaria kills an average of 1 million Patients in Africa annually, Snow et al., (2005). In Nigeria about 96 millionpeople are exposed to malaria, and out of these 64 million people get infected and almost 300,000 deaths are being reported annually in the general population, of which over 100,000 deaths are of Patients (Alaribe et al.,<br/>2006). Haematological parameters are measurable indices of blood that serve as a marker for disease diagnosis (Petel et al., 2004). Haematological abnormalities such as anaemia and thrombocytopaenia have been observed in patients with malaria (Ladhani et al. 2002; et al. 2007).<br/>The key feature of the biology of the Plasmodium falciparum, the predominant malaria species, is the ability of the infected red blood cells to adhere to the lining of the small blood vessels (Richard et al., 1998). Such sequestered parasites provide considerable obstruction to tissue perfusion. In addition, it is becoming clear that in severe malaria there may be marked reductions in the deformability of uninfected RBCs (Dondorp et al., 2000). RBCs destruction is an inevitable part of malaria, and anaemia further compromises oxygen delivery. Severe anaemia may arise from multiple poorly understood processes including acute haemolysis of uninfected RBCs and dyserythropoeisis, as well as through the interaction of malaria infection with other parasites infection and with nutritional deficiencies (Dondorp et al., 2000). The aim of this study was to determine changes in the haematological parameters of Patients with malaria infection in Nigerian population of Africa. Alterations in the haematological indices may strengthen the suspicion of malaria, prompting more meticulous search for malaria parasite, and timely institution of specific therapy.<br/>Malaria which is the most prevalent infectious disease in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world is of great public health importance (Mishra et al., 2003; Umar et al., 2007; Mia et al., 2011).The World Health Organization reports that malaria, the deadly parasitic disease is responsible for nearly ninety percent of death in Africa (Ogbodo et al., 2010). One-fifth of infants’ death in Africa is caused by the scourge of malaria (Snow et al., 2005; WHO, 2010). In Nigeria, approximately 0.25 million deaths of Patients under the age of five is caused by malaria yearly (UNICEF, 2009). Typhoid fever which is also endemic in Africa is more severe in infants and the elderly (Preston and Boreszyk, 1994; Gatsing et al., 2006). Both malaria and typhoid exhibit close symptomatology and epidemiology (Nsutebu and Ndumbe, 2001; Brian and Wahinuddin, 2006). The first case of malaria-typhoid co-infection occurred among American soldiers in 1862 (Bynum, 2002). The high incidence and prevalence of malaria-typhoid co-infection became popular almost ten years ago whereas the fact that malaria has been prevalently high is already recognized and accepted (Uneke, 2008). The onset and progression of the malaria infection is characterized by vast alterations in hematological and biochemical parameters (Bidaki and Dalimi, 2003). The World health Organization’s (WHO) criteria acknowledges that some biochemical and hematological features should raise the severity of malaria (World Health Organization, 2000).<br/>In different parts of the world including Nigeria, scientific materials on hematological and biochemical alterations in acute falciparum malaria are available (Mishra et al., 2003; Egwunyenga et al., 2004; Bidaki and Dalimi, 2003; Udosen, 2003), but none have really been reported from Sango-Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria and also scientific information on the impact of malaria-typhoid co-infection on hematological and biochemical parameters are scanty. This study examined the effect of malaria and malaria-typhoid co-infection on some hematological and biochemical indices. The study population includes only the febrile patients that have been clinically said to have malaria and malaria-typhoid co-infection from the results of their malaria and widal tests, respectively.<br/>1.1    AIM AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The aim of this study was to determine changes in the hematological parameters of patients with malaria infection in Nigerian population of Africa. Alterations in the hematological indices may strengthen the suspicion of malaria, prompting more meticulous search for malaria parasite, and timely institution of specific therapy. George and Ewelike Ezeani 769<br/>1.2    LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease of humans and other animals caused by protists (a type of microorganism) of the genus Plasmodium. It begins with a bite from an infected female mosquito, which introduces the protists via its saliva into the circulatory system, and ultimately to the liver where they mature and reproduce. The disease causes symptoms that typically include fever and headache, which in severe cases can progress to coma or death. Malaria is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions in a broad band around the equator, including much of Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and the Americas.<br/>Five species of Plasmodium can infect and be transmitted by humans. The vast majority of deaths are caused by P. falciparum while P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae cause a generally milder form of malaria that is rarely fatal. The zoonotic species P. knowlesi, prevalent in Southeast Asia, causes malaria in macaques but can also cause severe infections in humans. Malaria is prevalent in tropical regions because the significant amounts of rainfall, consistently high temperatures and high humidity, along with stagnant waters in which mosquito larvae readily mature, provide them with the environment they need for continuous breeding. Disease transmission can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites by distribution of mosquito nets and insect repellents, or with mosquito-control measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing water.<br/>The World Health Organization has estimated that in 2010, there were 216 million documented cases of malaria. Around 655,000 people died from the disease (roughly 2000 per day), most of whom are Patients in Africa.[1] The actual number of deaths may be significantly higher, as precise statistics are unavailable in many rural areas, and many cases are undocumented. Malaria is commonly associated with poverty and is also a major hindrance to economic development.<br/>Despite a clear need, no vaccine offering a high level of protection currently exists. Efforts to develop one are ongoing. Several medications are available to prevent malaria in travelers to malaria-endemic countries (prophylaxis). A variety of anti-malaria medications are available. Severe malaria is treated with intravenous or intramuscular quinine or, since the mid-2000s, the artemisinin derivative artesunate, which is superior to quinine in both Patients and adults and is given in combination with a second anti-malaria such as mefloquine. Resistance has developed to several anti-malaria drugs, most notably chloroquine and artemisinin.<br/>1.3    MEANING OF MALARIA<br/>The word malaria comes from 18th century Italian mala meaning \"bad\" and aria meaning \"air\". Most likely, the term was first used by Dr. Francisco Torti, Italy, when people thought the disease was caused by foul air in marshy areas. It was not until 1880 that scientists discovered that malaria was a parasitic disease which is transmitted by the anopheles mosquito. The mosquito infects the host with a one-cell parasite called plasmodium. Not long after they found out that Malaria is transmitted from human-to-human through the bite of the female mosquito, which needs blood for her eggs.  According to Medilexicon's medical dictionary, Malaria is \"A disease caused by the presence of the sporozoan Plasmodium in human or other vertebrate erythrocytes, usually transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected female mosquito of the genus Anopheles that previously sucked blood from a person with malaria. Malaria is also known as Jungle fever, Marsh fever, Paludal fever Approximately 40% of the total global population is at risk of Malaria infection. During the 20th century the disease was effectively eliminated in the majority of non-tropical countries. Today Malaria causes over 350 million human acute illnesses, as well as at least one million deaths annually. The anopheles mosquito exists in most tropical and many sub-tropical countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, Oceania, and Asia.  According to WHO (World Health Organization), the majority of Malaria deaths occur among Patients in sub-Saharan Africa, killing an African child every 30 seconds. Not only is Malaria associated with poverty, it is also a cause of poverty and an important obstacle to economic development.<br/>1.4    HISTORY OF MALARIA<br/>Malaria has infected humans for over 50,000 years, and Plasmodium may have been a human pathogen for the entire history of the species. Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees. Some evidence suggests that the most virulent strain of human malaria may have originated in gorillas.<br/>References to the unique periodic fevers of malaria are found throughout recorded history, beginning in 2700 BC in China. Malaria may have contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire, and was so pervasive in Rome that it was known as the \"Roman fever\". Several regions in ancient Rome were considered at-risk for the disease because of the favourable conditions present for malaria vectors. This included areas such as southern Italy, the island of Sardinia, the Pontine Marshes, the lower regions of coastal Etruria and the city of Rome along the Tiber River. The presence of stagnant water in these places was preferred by mosquitoes for breeding grounds. Irrigated gardens, swamp-like grounds, runoff from agriculture, and drainage problems from road construction led to the increase of standing water<br/> The term malaria originates from Medieval Italian: mala aria — \"bad air\"; the disease was formerly called ague or marsh fever due to its association with swamps and marshland. Malaria was once common in most of Europe and North America, where it is no longer endemic, though imported cases do occur. Malaria was the most important health hazard encountered by U.S. troops in the South Pacific during World War II, where about 500,000 men were infected. According to Joseph Patrick Byrne, \"Sixty thousand American soldiers died of malaria during the African and South Pacific campaigns.\" Scientific studies on malaria made their first significant advance in 1880, when Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran—a French army doctor working in the military hospital of Constantine in Algeria—observed parasites inside the red blood cells of infected people for the first time. He therefore proposed that malaria is caused by this organism, the first time a protist was identified as causing disease.<br/>For this and later discoveries, he was awarded the 1907 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. The malarial parasite was called Plasmodium by the Italian scientists Ettore Marchiafava and Angelo Celli. A year later, Carlos Finlay, a Cuban doctor treating people with yellow fever in Havana, provided strong evidence that mosquitoes were transmitting disease to and from humans. This work followed earlier suggestions by Josiah C. Nott,  and work by Sir Patrick Manson, the \"father of tropical medicine\", on the transmission of filariasis.<br/>In April 1894, a Scottish physician Sir Ronald Ross visited Sir Patrick Manson at his house on Queen Anne Street, London. This visit was the start of four years of collaboration and fervent research that culminated in 1898 when Ross, who was working in the Presidency General Hospital in Calcutta, proved the complete life-cycle of the malaria parasite in mosquitoes. He thus proved that the mosquito was the vector for malaria in humans by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds. He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds.<br/>For this work, Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the Indian Medical Service, Ross worked at the newly established Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and directed malaria-control efforts in Egypt, Panama, Greece and Mauritius.[103] The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by Walter Reed in 1900. Its recommendations were implemented by William C. Gorgas in the health measures undertaken during construction of the Panama Canal. This public-health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against the disease.<br/>The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree, which contains quinine. This tree grows on the slopes of the Andes, mainly in Peru. The indigenous peoples of Peru made a tincture of cinchona to control malaria. The Jesuits noted the efficacy of the practice and introduced the treatment to Europe during the 1640s, where it was rapidly accepted.  It was not until 1820 that the active ingredient, quinine, was extracted from the bark, isolated and named by the French chemists Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaimé Caventou.[106][107]<br/>Quinine become the predominant malarial medication until the 1920s, when other medications began to be developed. In the 1940s, chloroquine replaced quinine as the treatment of both uncomplicated and severe malaria until resistance supervened, first in Southeast Asia and South America in the 1950s and then globally in the 1980s. Artemisinins, discovered by Chinese scientist Tu Youyou in the 1970s from the plant Artemisia annua, became the recommended treatment for P. falciparum malaria, administered in combination with other anti-malarias as well as in severe disease.<br/>The first pesticide used for indoor residual spraying was DDT.  Although it was initially used exclusively to combat malaria, its use quickly spread to agriculture. In time, pest control, rather than disease control, came to dominate DDT use, and this large-scale agricultural use led to the evolution of resistant mosquitoes in many regions. The DDT resistance shown by Anopheles mosquitoes can be compared to antibiotic resistance shown by bacteria. During the 1960s, awareness of the negative consequences of its indiscriminate use increased, ultimately leading to bans on agricultural applications of DDT in many countries in the 1970s.<br/>Malaria vaccines have been an elusive goal of research. The first promising studies demonstrating the potential for a malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunizing mice with live, radiation-attenuated sporozoites, which provided significant protection to the mice upon subsequent injection with normal, viable sporozoites. Since the 1970s, there has been a considerable effort to develop similar vaccination strategies within humans.<br/>1.5    FIVE TYPES OF MALARIA<br/>Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) - milder form of the disease, generally not fatal. However, infected people still need treatment because their untreated progress can also cause a host of health problems. This type has the widest geographic distribution globally. About 60% of infections in India are due to P. vivax. This parasite has a liver stage and can remain in the body for years without causing sickness. If the patient is not treated, the liver stage may re-activate and cause relapses - malaria attacks - after months, or even years without symptoms.<br/>Plasmodium malariae (P. malariae) - milder form of the disease, generally not fatal. However, the infected human still needs treatment because no treatment can also lead to a host of health problems. This type of parasite has been known to stay in the blood of some people for several decades.<br/>Plasmodium ovale (P. ovale) - milder form of the disease, generally not fatal. However, the infected human still needs to be treated because it may progress and cause a host of health problems. This parasite has a liver stage and can remain in the body for years without causing sickness. If the patient is not treated, the liver stage may re-activate and cause relapses - malaria attacks - after months, or even years without symptoms.<br/>Plasmodium falciparum (P. faliparum) - the most serious form of the disease. It is most common in Africa, especially sub-Saharan Africa. Current data indicates that cases are now being reported in areas of the world where this type was thought to have been eradicated.<br/>Plasmodium knowlesi (P. knowlesi) - causes malaria in macaques but can also infect humans.<br/>1.6    HOW HUMAN BECOME INFECTED WITH MALARIA<br/>The female Anopheles mosquito transmits the parasite to a human when it takes a blood meal - it bites the human in order to feed on blood. Only the female Anopheles mosquito can transmit malaria, and it must have been infected through a previous blood meal taken from an infected human. When the mosquito bites an infected person a minute quantity of the malaria (plasmodium) parasite in the blood is taken. Approximately one week later that same infected mosquito takes its next blood meal. The plasmodium parasites mix with the mosquito's saliva and are injected into the host (human being).<br/>1.6.1 Human-to-human transmission of Malaria<br/>As the parasite exists in human red blood cells, malaria can be passed on from one person to the next through organ transplant, shared use of needles/syringes, and blood transfusion. An infected mother may also pass malaria on to her baby during delivery (birth) - this is called 'congenital malaria'.<br/>1.7    SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF MALARIA<br/>The signs and symptoms of malaria typically begin 8–25 days following infection;  however, symptoms may occur later in those who have taken anti-malaria medications as prevention. Initial manifestations of the dieases—common to all malaria species—are similar to flu-like symptoms. The presentation may include headache, fever, shivering, arthralgia (joint pain), vomiting, hemolytic anemia, jaundice, hemoglobinuria, retinal damage,[5] and convulsions. Approximately 30% of people however will no longer have a fever upon presenting to a health care facility.<br/>The classic symptom of malaria is paroxysm—a cyclical occurrence of sudden coldness followed by rigor and then fever and sweating, occurring every two days in P. vivax and P. ovale infections, and every three days (tertian fever) for P. malariae. P. falciparum infection can cause recurrent fever every 36–48 hours (quartan fever) or a less pronounced and almost continuous fever.<br/>Severe malaria is usually caused by P. falciparum, and typically arises 6–14 days after infection. Splenomegaly (enlarged spleen), severe headache, cerebral ischemia, hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), hypoglycemia, and hemoglobinuria with renal failure may occur. Renal failure is a feature of blackwater fever, where hemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine. Cerebral malaria (encephalopathy specifically related to P. falciparum infection) is associated with retinal whitening, which may be a useful clinical sign in distinguishing malaria from other causes of fever. Individuals with severe malaria frequently exhibit neurological symptoms, including abnormal posturing, nystagmus, disconjugate gaze (failure of the eyes to turn together in the same direction), opisthotonus, seizures, or coma.<br/>1.8    CAUSES OF MALARIA<br/>Malaria parasites are from the genus Plasmodium (phylum Apicomplexa). In humans, malaria is caused by P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, P. vivax and P. knowlesi. Among those infected, P. falciparum is the most common species identified (~75%) followed by P. vivax (~20%). P. falciparum accounts for the majority of deaths; non-falciparum species have been found to be the cause of about 14% of cases of severe malaria in some groups. P. vivax proportionally is more common outside of Africa.  There have been documented human infections with several species of Plasmodium from higher apes; however, with the exception of P. knowlesi—a zoonotic species that causes malaria in macaques—these are mostly of limited public health importance.<br/>1.9    LIFE CYCLE<br/>The definitive hosts for malaria parasites are female mosquitoes of the Anopheles genus, which act as transmission vectors to humans and other vertebrates, the secondary hosts. Young mosquitoes first ingest the malaria parasite by taking a blood meal from an infected vertebrate carrier. Once ingested, the parasite gametocytes taken up in the blood differentiate into male or female gametes and fuse in the mosquito's gut.<br/>This produces an ookinete that penetrates the gut lining and produces an oocyst in the gut wall. When the oocyst ruptures, it releases sporozoites that migrate through the mosquito's body to the salivary glands, where they are then ready to infect a new vertebrate host. The sporozoites are injected into the skin, alongside saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal. This type of transmission is occasionally referred to as anterior station transfer.<br/>Only female mosquitoes feed on blood; male mosquitoes feed on plant nectar, and thus do not transmit the disease. The females of the Anopheles genus of mosquito prefer to feed at night. They usually start searching for a meal at dusk, and will continue throughout the night until taking a meal. Malaria parasites can also be transmitted by blood transfusions, although this is rare.<br/> 1.10    PATHOGENESIS<br/>Malaria infection develops via two phases: one that involves the liver or hepatic system (exoerythrocytic), and one which involves red blood cells, or erythrocytes (erythrocytic). When an infected mosquito pierces a person's skin to take a blood meal, sporozoites in the mosquito's saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically for a period of 8–30 days.<br/>After a potential dormant period in the liver, these organisms differentiate to yield thousands of merozoites, which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle.The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the cell membrane of the infected host liver cell.<br/>Within the red blood cells, the parasites multiply further, again asexually, periodically breaking out of their hosts to invade fresh red blood cells. Several such amplification cycles occur. Thus, classical descriptions of waves of fever arise from simultaneous waves of merozoites escaping and infecting red blood cell.<br/>Some P. vivax sporozoites do not immediately develop into exoerythrocytic-phase merozoites, but instead produce hypnozoites that remain dormant for periods ranging from several months (6–12 months is typical) to as long as three years. After a period of dormancy, they reactivate and produce merozoites. Hypnozoites are responsible for long incubation and late relapses in P. vivax infections, although their existence in P. ovale is uncertain.<br/>The parasite is relatively protected from attack by the body's immune system because for most of its human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the spleen. To avoid this fate, the P. falciparum parasite displays adhesive proteins on the surface of the infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen.The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as in placental and cerebral malaria. In cerebral malaria the sequestrated red blood cells can breach the blood–brain barrier possibly leading to coma. Micrograph of a placenta from a stillbirth due to maternal malaria. H&amp;E stain. Red blood cells are anuclear; blue/black staining in bright red structures (red blood cells) indicate foreign nuclei from the parasites<br/>Although the red blood cell surface adhesive proteins (called PfEMP1, for P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1) are exposed to the immune system, they do not serve as good immune targets, because of their extreme diversity; there are at least 60 variations of the protein within a single parasite and even more variants within whole parasite populations.The parasite switches between a broad repertoire of PfEMP1 surface proteins, thus staying one step ahead of the pursuing immune system.<br/>Some merozoites turn into male and female gametocytes. If a mosquito pierces the skin of an infected person, it potentially picks up gametocytes within the blood. Fertilization and sexual recombination of the parasite occurs in the mosquito's gut. New sporozoites develop and travel to the mosquito's salivary gland, completing the cycle. Pregnant women are especially attractive to the mosquitoes, and malaria in pregnant women is an important cause of stillbirths, infant mortality and low birth weight, particularly in P. falciparum infection, but also in other species infection, such as P. vivax.<br/>1.11    GENETIC RESISTANCE<br/>Due to the high levels of mortality and morbidity caused by malaria—especially the P. falciparum species—it is thought to have placed the greatest selective pressure on the human genome in recent history. Several diseases may provide some resistance to it including sickle cell disease, thalassaemias, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency as well as the presence of Duffy antigens on the subject's red blood cells.<br/>The impact of sickle cell anemia on malaria immunity is of particular interest. Sickle cell anemia causes a defect to the hemoglobin molecule in the blood. Instead of retaining the biconcave shape of a normal red blood cell, the modified hemoglobin S molecule causes the cell to sickle or distort into a curved shape. Due to the sickle shape, the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and therefore malaria parasites cannot complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are homozygous for sickle cell anemia seldom survive this defect, while those who are heterozygous experience immunity to the disease. Although the potential risk of death for those with the homozygous condition seems to be unfavourable to population survival, the trait is preserved because of the benefits provided by the heterozygous form.<br/>1.13    MALARIAL HEPATOPATHY<br/>Hepatic dysfunction as a result of malaria is rare and is usually a result of a coexisting liver condition such as viral hepatitis and chronic liver disease. Hepatitis, which is characterised by inflammation of the liver, is not actually present in what is called malarial hepatitis; the term as used here invokes the reduced liver function associated with severe malaria.While traditionally considered a rare occurrence, malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase in malaria-endemic areas, particularly in Southeast Asia and India.Liver compromise in people with malaria correlates with a greater likelihood of complications and death.<br/><br/><br/>\n\nASSESSMENT OF SOME HAEMOTOLOGICAL PARAMETER ON MALARIA PATIENT AT GENERAL HOSPITAL OWERRI<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF SOME HAEMOTOLOGICAL PARAMETER ON MALARIA PATIENT AT GENERAL HOSPITAL OWERRI", "id": 86}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>BIOLOGICAL WATER QUALITY OF MABOLO RIVER IN ANKPA KOGI STATE NIGERIA</b><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>Urban River, streams and wetlands are susceptible to pollution and so, river Mabolo faces a similar problem.

This river is the major source of the main economic activities in district and most of these activities take place  within the river itself and others  take  place within the catchments such activities include water abstraction, sewage treatment, cattle rearing, agriculture  and agro-forestry and many other practices. These activities are all done without the notification of downstream user and as a result the river has deteriorated both in quantity and quality including drying up of wetland around, fringing the river (Mukwaya and Mugabe, 2010). Beside this factors the river Mabolo catchments experience <br/>    The total  nutrient discharged into surface  waters in a river   basin is normally larger than the nutrient load at the river mouth (Wassman and olli, 2004); and such discrepancy is a explained  by the process of nutrient retention which is a collectives expression for a large  number of biochemical and hydrological  process of a large temporarily  decrease, decay, degrade, transform  or permanently  retard and removes the substance  from the river channel. The significance of streams as nutrient recipients from terrestrial catchments to receiving water bodies is of environmental concern as it may lead to excessive nutrient loading and inability of the system to cope with the loading (Peterson, et, al, 2001).<br/>Ankpa lakes and rivers like other water bodies face a threat of pollution due to increasing human population, urbanization, industrialization and agricultural modernization (Joensuu 1996). There are concerned efforts by government to reduce water pollution and there include the establishment of the Direct ovate of water development under ministry of water and environment which is the principle agency of government and the provision of water supplies in rural and urban centers. The mandate of National sewage corporation (NWSC) is to operate and provide water and sewage services in area entrusted to it by the water Act (1995) and the NWSC Act, cap 150, national Environment offices, National resources management personnel, among others government also formulated polices and regulation to guide national use of water resources in order to achieved sustainable water quality and quantity. Such policies and regulation include the water statute (1995) which provide the frame work for the use protection and management of water resources and water supply, the national water policy (1999) the water resources regulations, (1998) and the waste water discharge Regulations (1998) which prescribe the threshold and procedures for applications to construct any water works. However there are still many challenges including lack of human capacity, inadequate facilitation and inter-institutional co-ordination in order to handle the associated environmental problems.<br/>            The Mabolo River has its source right within Ankpa town at a place called Ogaji, climate in the local government. Like other urban rivers and streams its faces similar threats of population and understanding its water quality dynamics as an urban river is an important aspect. Nutrient uptake and transformation is a central ecosystem function of streams (Payne, et, al., 2005), and although many studies may have been done on the water quality of river Mabolo by various researchers, more needs to be known about its water quality of river Mabolo dynamics or variations in terms bacterial load and chemical contamination.<br/>It is notice that the water resources in the river Mabolo have decline over 12 years. This can be attributed to increased degradation of the resources (this has been observed, but it is not measured) due to increase agricultural in the catchments, using poor land and soil management systems, in addition it is noticeable that there has been a declining trend of the catchments rainfall and such phenomena are believed to be the impact of climate change and global warming.<br/>There has been growing concern about the need to protect the environment from the various form of population caused by growing human populations, used of modern agricultural methods etc. (Hunt and Wilson 1986). Micro organisms often play a major role in determining the extent of this pollution (Higgins and Burns 1975) and municipal waste water is a primary contributor of bacteria to the aquatic environment (Linton et al. 1974). The presence of faecal coli-form is considered as presumptive evidence of faecal pollution (Mara, 1978) pathogenic bacteria that have been transmitted by water or waste water include, vibriocholarae, salmonella, leptospira, campylobacter and Yesinia (APHA; 1992).<br/>1.1    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Urban river, streams and wetland are prone to pollution (natumanga et al; 2009) and decoration of water quality reduce a river’s amenity and aesthetic value. Like any urban water body, river Mabolo is a source of water for domestic, marketing and agricultural activities within its catch mere (Ankpa municipality inclusive). Due to economic activities in the area such as market, hospital, schools, and industrial setups the water quantity of river Mabolo could be compromised. Not only is this a dilemma for the welfare of the riparian communities using the river for their domestic and economic needs, it is a problem for other aquatic resource as well.<br/>    Therefore he propose study seeks to assess the quality  status of the river basing on the  levels, of the pathogenic  micro organisms (E. coli and faecal coli-forms) and aquatic micro  invertebrates as indicators for water quality  in addition to the  physic- chemical parameters within that sector of the municipality. <br/>1.2 RESEARCH QESTIONS.<br/>i. What are the responses of others biotic communities (e.g. aquatic macro invertebrates) to the aquatic environment which may be compromised by anthropogenic activities?<br/>ii.   how is the status of the abiotic environmental factors (physico chemical parameters in relation to the ecosystem services they offer to other aquatic resource that are in turn utilized  by human to satisfy their needs?<br/>iii.  Worldwide water borne diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in human (WHO, 1996), and water borne pathogens infect around 250 million people per year resulting in 10-20 million  deaths to what extent is the river Mabolo by pathogenic microorganisms considering that some people fetch and use this water directly for different domestic purpose?<br/>JUSTIFICATION<br/>   Pollution of water bodies by the ever increasing human activities (agricultural, discharge and domestic waste waters, solid waste disposal run offs etc.) is a serious problem (Chapman 1996), worldwide water born diseases are a major causes of morbidity and mortality in human (WHO 1996), and water born pathogen infect around 250 million people per year resulting in 10-20 million deaths (Annon, 1996)), River Mabolo within Ankpa municipality is not an exception to this threat because of the many activities that are carry out with in and around it catchment. These studies will therefore asses the faecal indication (Escherichia coli and faecal coli forms) and the status of aquatic macro invertebrates as indicators of water quality in relation to the physico chemical parameters.<br/>       1.4     LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>Sea level in the up lands Agbaja plateau, which range from 335 to 366 meters above sea level, and the much higher Okoro Agbo hills in Ijumu L.G.A are some of the predominant to land forms of the state, the state is drained by the Niger and Benue rivers which could be view and from the top of mount Patti is located within the state of the Benue river is navigable as far as Garua in the rainy sea son floods, but up to Makurdi in Benue state in the dry season  the Mabolo (Anambra) is the biggest river in Igala land Mabolo Okura, Ubele and Ofu rivers run off the Dekina, Onkpo, Otukpa, water shed.

It is consumed extensively in homes, restaurants and hotels. Bread is made from low protein wheat. It usually contains several ingredients that would help improve its quality. Some of the basic identified ingredients apart from flour are table salt, sugars, flavors and at least a flour improver such as potassium bromate, (Vicki, 1997).<br/>        The major challenge in both flour milling industry and bakeries is baking quality of flour, which is determined by the capacity of the dough prepared from it to retain gas. As a result of wide variations in the composition of flour, various treatments and supplements conditioning agents (flour/bread improver) are added for strength during mixing, extensibility for molding and also to increase loaf volume and texture. Over the years, several improvers have been used but studies have shown some to be deleterious to health, thereby necessitating their ban. The use of potassium bromate has been a common choice among flour miller and bakers throughout the world because it is cheap and probably the most efficient oxidizing agent. It acts as a slow oxidizing agent throughout the fermentation proofing and baking process affecting the structure and the rheological properties of the dough. As a result, many bakeries use potassium bromate as an additive to assist in the rising process and to produce a texture in the finished product that is appealing to the public.<br/>        Potassium bromate has adverse effect on health and its health effects are divided into two categories. (Ayo, et al, 2002) The first category deals with effects related to non cancer effect.<br/>        This includes its effect on the nutritional quality of bread. It degrades vitamins available in bread (IARC, 1999).<br/>        In humans, potassium bromate can cause cough and sore throat when inhaled, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, kidney failure, hearing loss, bronchial and ocular problems, are some of the other non cancer health problems associated with ingestion of potassium bromate, (Atkins, 1993). In the second category, numerous studies have reviewed the potential of potassium bromate to cause cancer in experimental animals and in humans, bromate as bread improver has been banned (Ekop et al, 2008). In Nigeria however, some bread makers/bakeries have continued to include potassium bromate in their bread.<br/>        It is against this background that this investigation was undertaken in Abia State of Nigeria where bread consumption is very high. This work therefore is aimed at assessing the level of potassium bromate in bread, sold in Abia State Nigeria (a case study of Aba metropolis)<br/><br/>\n\nASSESSMENT OF POTASSIUM BROMATE IN BREAD SOLD IN ABIA STATE  (A CASE STUDY OF ABA METROPOLIS)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF POTASSIUM BROMATE IN BREAD SOLD IN ABIA STATE  (A CASE STUDY OF ABA METROPOLIS)", "id": 88}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ANTIMIROBIAL INVESTIGATION OF CYMBOPOGON CITRATE (LEMON GRASS)</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>Cymbopogon citrate is also known as lemon grass is a genus of about 55 species of grasses, native to worm temperature and tropical regions of the old word and oceania. It is fall povennial grass, common names include barbed wire grass, silky heads, citronella grass, fever grass or hierba luisa (Adsimon 2001) among many others.<br/>        Lemon grass is native to Indian. It is widely used as a herb in Asaia Cuisine. It has citrus flavor and can be dried and powdered or use fresh. Lemon grass is commonly used on teas, soups and carries it is also suitable for poultry, fish and sea food, it is often used as a tea in African and Latin American. Example of other countries include: Toyo, Mexico, Congo. Research also shows that Lemon grass oil has anti-fungal properties. They are also antispectics, hence are use in household disinfectants, and soaps. Besides oil production, citronella grass is also used for culinany purpose, in tea and also in flavoring. Lemon grass oil, used as  a pesticide and preservative, it put on the ancient manuscripts found in Indian in oriental research institute mysove. The lemon grass oil also injects natural fluidity into the brittle palm leaves and the hydrophobic nature of the oil keeps  the manuscript dry so that the text is not lost to decay due to humidity. East Indian lemon grass (cymbopogon flexusus) also called cochin grass or malaba grass (malayalami (inchinpull), is native to Cambodia, Indian, strilanaka Burma and Thailand while the west Indian lemon grass (Cymbopogon Citrates) also known as serai in malay, is assumed to have its origin in Malaysia. Indonessian people used to call are seral to or search while both can be used interchangeably, but citrates is more suitable for cooking. In India, citrates is used both as a medical herb and in perfumes. Cymbopogon citrate is consumed as a tea for anxiety in Brazilian Folk medicine, but a study in human found no effect.

Large populations of people especially in the developing world rely on folk medicines for the treatment of common infection as well as persistent diseases (Ndukwe et al., 2005). In recent times, there have been increases in antibiotic resistance strains of clinically important pathogens which have led to the emergence of new bacterial strains that are multi-resistant (Albinu et al., 2004). The non availability and high cost of new generation antibiotic with limited effective span has resulted in increase in morbidity and mortality (William, 2000). It is estimated that today,  plant materials are present in or have provided the models for 50% of western drugs (Robber et al., 1996). Many commercially proven drugs used in modern medicine were initially used in crude form in traditional and folk healing practices or for other purpose that suggest potentially useful biological activity. Traditional healers have long used plants to prevent or cure infectious conditions (Clark, 1995). Consequently, this has led to the search for more effective antimicrobial agents among material of plant origin with the aim of discovering potentially useful ingredients that can serve as a source for the synthesis of new antimicrobial drugs (Pretorius et al., 2003). Plants used as antimicrobial, are effective against infectious diseases while simultaneously mitigating many of the side effects that are often associated with synthetic antimicrobials. They are effective, yet gentle (Gill, 2007). Many vegetables are mainly consumed for their nutritional values without much consideration foor their medicinal importance (Aletor and Adeogun, 1995).<br/>The genus Phyllanthus refers to leaves and flowers and is one of such medicinal plants and is still investigated for further findings. The flowers as well as the fruits seem to become one with the leaf. It is a wide spread tropical rainforest plant commonly found in coastal areas.<br/>It comprises of 600-700 species with minor distinguishing features among them.  Phyllanthus amarus, Phyllanthus urinaria  and Phyllanthus niruri are the most employed species. Phyllanthus niruri belongs to the family Phyllanthacae, genus, Phyllanthus and specie niruri. Phyllanthus niruri has its common name stone-breaker (because of its strong root). It is commonly called “ENYIKWONWA” (the same family with ugba) by the Igbo’s in Nigeria. The stem and root have been reported along with the leaves to be of medicinal value (WHO, 2001). The latex form leaves has been used as antimalaria and for the treatment of infections of bacterial origin (Farombi, 2003).<br/>Aims and Objectives <br/>The aims and objectives of this work are to:<br/>Determine the antibacterial activities ofPhyllanthus niruri<br/>Determine the chemical constituents that may be present in the extract (ethanol, hot water and cold water).<br/>Determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) of  Phyllanthus niruri extracts<br/>LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.2  Overview of  Phyllanthus niruri<br/>Phyllanthus niruri is an annual herb which grows in the wild after first showers of monsoon in states of india. It is a wide spread tropical plant commonly found in coastal areas. It grows about 30-60cm in height. In the wild, it is found growing along roadside, in street corners and dumps of building materials. It is also a field weed which is found proliferating throughout tropical and sub-tropical regions of Asia, America and China. The epithet niruri was assigned to this plant by Swedish naturalist Charles Von Linee. It is reported that this plant is known and used since more than 2,000years. It may also grow from 20-90cm more in height.<br/>1.3  Physical Description<br/>The annual herb Phyllanthus niruri is best known by the common names stone breaker (because of its strong root), black chanca piedra, quebra wind, child  pick-a-flower, carry me seed, but has many other common names in assorted languages, including dukong anak, dukong-dukong anak, amin buah, rami buah,  turi hutan and bhuianla. Taxonomically, the annual herb belongs to<br/>Family- phyllanthaceae<br/>Order-   malpighiales<br/>Class-    magnoliophyta<br/>Division- magnoliophyta<br/>It is quite glaborous; stem often branched at the base. The leaves are green, oblong, obtuse, numerous and in pairs. The flowers are yellow, axiliary, and numerous. The male flowers are one to three (1-3) whereas, female flowers are solitary. The fruits are globuse, depressed. Capsules and seeds are pale brown in colour.<br/>1.4 Uses of Phyllanthus niruri<br/>Phyllanthus niruri blocks DNA polymerase, the enzyme needed for hepatitis B virus to reproduce. It also prevents jaundice, diabetes, dyspepsia, ulcers, sores, swellings, opthalmia and chronic dysentery (Harnett et el., 2000). It also mitigates diarrhoea. The whole plant is useful for the treatment of some forms of gonorrhoea and menorrhagia, dropsy and other genito-urinary infections of similar type (Olukoya et al., 2000). A poultice of the leaf mixed with salt cures itching and other skin infections. The root juice mixed with sugar is instilled into the nostrils for hiccups; it is also useful as an adjuvant in the treatment of dysuria. It is bitter, astringent, cold, anti-inflamatory and useful as well in treatment of liver disorders, cough, asthma, jaundice, spleen disorder. It may help decrease the amount of hepatitis B virus found in the blood stream (Yiu et al., 1994).<br/>\n\nANTIBACTERIAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF Phyllanthus niruri ON SELECTED BACTERIA.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANTIBACTERIAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF Phyllanthus niruri ON SELECTED BACTERIA.", "id": 90}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE IN-VITRO ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY OF UDARA LEAF<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Chrysophyllum albidium G in a tropical plant and commonly found in Nigeria A leaf extract of Chrysophyllum albidum G. were tested using the agar diffusion method on three bacteria strains staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and Coliform bacteria phytochemical screening shows that the chrysophyllum albidum G leaf extract contains sapon and no Alkaloid.

The branching is sympodial. The shoots are bright yellow green at first with mucilaginous bark, turning reddish brown and in two or three years being to show shallow tissues. The leaves are alternate, green to yellow-green, ovate or abovate, 10-16cm long and 5- 10cm broad with a short, slender, slightly grooved pethole. The come in three different shapes all of which can be on the saw branch, three lobed leaves, rarly there can be more than three lobe. In fall, they turn to shads of yellow, tinged with red the flowers are produced in loose, dropping few floweredrucemer appear; they are yellow to greenish yellow with five or six tepals. The fruit in a dark blue black drupel cm long. Containing a single seed borne on a red fleshy club-shaped pedical 2cm long. It is ripe in late summer with the seeds dispersed by brids. The catyledons thick and fleshy. All parts of the plant are aromatic and spicy. The roots are thick and frequently produce root sprouts which can develop into new trels.<br/>           USEFUL<br/>        It has a demonstrated usefulness as a liver protector, pain reliever in the control of high blood pressure and as a good contraceptive and infections.<br/>1.6    FOLIAGE<br/>        The dark green obovate droping leaver grow up to 5 inches long, giving the Udara an interesting tropical appearance.

The produce maroon, upside down flowers up to 2 inches across. The normal bloom period consists of about 6 weeks during March to May depending on variety latitude and ultimate conditions. The blossom consists soft 2 whorls of 3 petals each and the calye has 3 sepals each flower contains several ovaries which explain why a single flower can produce multiple fruits.<br/>FRUIT<br/>        The Udara edible fruit nutine in America. Individual fruit weight 1 to 1 hours and 2 to 3 inches in length. The larger size will appear plain similar to the mango; the fruit usually has 3 to 4 seed inside. The are brownish in color and shaped like beans, with a length of 1 to 2 inches<br/>        Udara fruits often occur as clusters of up to nine individual fruits. The ripe fruit is soft and then skinned leaves dislike strong winds overall the tree in an excellent edible landscape addition.<br/>LITERATURE REVIEW <br/>MICROBES THAT ARE USED ESCHRICHIA COLI      <br/>        Escherichia Coli (E. coli) are gram negative bacteria that can survive in an environment with or without air (facultive anaeroben) and depending on the environment may or may not produce thin air like structure (flagella or piti) that allws the bacteria to move and to attack the human cells. These bacteria commonly live in the intestines of people and animals world wide. They are mainly strains (over 700 zero tipper) of E. Coli most of the E Coli are normal inhabitants of the small intestine and color and do not cause disease in the intestine (non-pathogenic).<br/>        Nevertheless, these non pathogenic E.Coli can cause disease if they spread outside the intestine, for example into the urinary tract (where they cause bladder of kidney infection) or into the blood stream (sepsis). Other E.Coli strains (enterovialent E. Coli strains) cause poisoning or diarrhea, even though they usually remain within the intestine by producing toxins or intestinal inflammation.<br/>SOME RELATED DISEASE OF E.COLI<br/> <br/>Nose bleed<br/>Kidney infection<br/>Nausa and vomiting and sepsis<br/> <br/> <br/>Unary infection<br/>Kidney failure<br/>CHARACTERISTICS OF ESCHERICHIA COLI<br/>Escherichia Coli in a gram negative non spore forming rod.

S. F. D. A, 2006).<br/>Pharmaceutical products such as liquids (syrups) are generally required to be sterile; however, it is desirable that, they contain low level of microbial contamination in the biodegradation of the products which in essence, constitute a health hazard to its consumers. The most important<br/>component of the living matter is water. Multiplication and survival of microorganisms in drugs. This reports emphasized the need to monitor the microbiological quality on non-sterile pharmaceutical products, dispensed and sold in the public hospitals, pharmacies and potent medicine stores Taylor, R. B; Behrens, and low, A. S (2001).<br/>ORAL LIQUIDS: They are homogenous liquids preparations, usually consisting of a solution, a suspension or emulsion of suitable vehicle which are more active to be swallowed either undiluted or after dilution. Oral liquids may contain auxiliary substance such as suitable antimicrobial preservatives dispensing, suspending, emulsifying, stabilizing, flavouring, colouring and sweeten agents. The vehicle for any particular oral liquid should be chosen having regard to be nature of the active ingredients and to produce organoleptic characteristics appropriate to the intended se of the preparation.<br/>ORAL SUSPENSION: Are oral liquids containing one or more active ingredients suspended in suitable vehicle.<br/>Suspended solid may slowly separate on standing but are easily redispened.<br/>ORAL DROP: Are oral liquid that are intended to be administered in small volume in the aid of a suitable measuring device.<br/>MIXTURE: Are oral liquids containing one or more active ingredient dissolved, suspended or dispersed in a suitable<br/>vehicle. Suspended solids may separate slowly on standing but easily redispersed on shaking.<br/>ORAL SOLUTIONS: Are oral liquids containing one or more active ingredients dissolved in a suitable vehicle.<br/>ELIXIRS: Are oral liquids that contains one or more active ingredients dissolved in a vehicle that usually contains a high proportion of sucrose or a suitable polyhydric alcohol or alcohols and may also contains ethanol (96%) or a dilute ethanol.<br/>LINCTUSES: Are viscous oral liquids that may contain one or more active ingredients in solution.<br/> The vehicle usually contain large amount of sucrose or alcohols. Linctuses are intended for use in the treatment or relief of cough being sipped and swallowed slowly count and addition of water.<br/>ORAL EMULSIONS: Are oral liquids containing one or more active ingredient. They are stabilized oil-in-water dispersions, either or both phases of which may contain dissolved solids. Solid may also be suspended in oral emulsions.<br/>In oral emulsions prepared according to the formular and directions given for extemporaneous preparation and quantity of emulsifying agent specified in individual monographs may be consistence provided by doing and stability of the preparation in not affected when in uses, oral emulsions should be supplied.<br/> 1.2 FACTORS IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING THE RATE AT WHICH A DRUG IS ABSORBED FROM ITS SITE OF ADMINISTRATION ARE<br/>a. Dosage form<br/>b. Solubility in the tissue in which it is placed<br/>c. Blood flow through the tissue<br/>(Laurence, D.

R. and Bennett P. N 1987).<br/>Drug should be selectively toxic meaning they should kill or inhibit microbial cells without simultaneously damaging host tissue. Best drug are those that block the actions or synthesis of molecules in microorganisms but not in vertebrate cells.<br/>1.3 EFFECT OF MICRORGANISMS ON DRUGS<br/>Example is drugs with selective toxicity are those that block the synthesis of the cell walls in bacteria (penicillin). They have low toxicity and few direct effects on human cells because cells lack a wall and are thus natural to these actions of the antibiotic. Among the most toxic to human cells are drugs that act upon a structure common to both the ineffective agent and the host cell such as the cell membrane (Kathlene P. T. 2005).<br/>PHARMACOLOGISTS (one who specialize in the scientific study of drugs and their uses in medicine) say that drug comprises two broad divisions.<br/>A. PHARMACODYNAMICS: The biological and<br/>therapeutic effect of drugs ie. What drug dose in the body.<br/> B. PHARMACOKINETICS: Absorption, distribution,<br/>metabolism and excretion of drugs ie. What the body does to the drugs (Laurence D. R. and Bennett P. N, 1987).<br/>1.4 SYSTEMIC AVAILABILITY OF DRUG<br/>When drug is injected intravenously, it gains access to the systemic circulation and hence to the tissue and receptor ie. 100% s a available to exert its therapeutic effect, if the same quantity of drug is swallowed, it does not follow that the entire amount will reach first the portal blood and then the systemic blood that is its availability for therapeutic effect may be less than 100%. The anticipated response to drug may not be achieved unless biological availability is taken into account. In a sense, consideration of drugs that are slowly absorbed. Drugs may also bind to food constituents eg. Tetracycline to calcium and to iron, or to other drugs e.g. Acidic drug to reduced availability apply whenever any drug intended for systemic effect given by<br/> any other route rather than the intravenous, but in practice the tissue concerns enteral administration. This may be thought in three ways:<br/>I.       Pharmaceutical (Drug/Medicine) Factor:- The amount of drug that is released from a dose form is highly dependant on its formulations. Manufacturers are expected to produce a formulation with an unvarying biological availability (Bio-availability) so that the same amount of drug is released with the same speed from whatever band the patients may be taking e.g. with syrups, particle size, surface area exposed to solution) diluting substances, syrup size and pressure used in the machine may effect the disintegration and dissolution and so the biological availability of drug is difference in biological which can be demonstrated if different blood concentration of the same amount of drug are given to a single individual one after another but in manufacturing practice, measurement of the time a syrups takes to mixture up in water (disintegration time) are used to check consistency of different batches. Cowan, S. T. and Stanley (1994).<br/>2. Biological factors:- It relates to the guts. These include destruction of drug by gastric acid e.g. benzyl penicillin and impaired absorption due to intestinal which is important for all drugs that are slowly absorbed.<br/>3. Pre- systemic elimination or hepatic effect: Despite the fact that they pas rapidly through the gut mucosal cell membrane, some drugs appear in low concentration in the systemic circulation. The reason lies in the considerable extent to which such drugs are metabolized in a single passage through the gut wall and liver and an important feature of the oral route is that all drugs that is absorbed cannot escaped these elimination processes. As little as 10-20% of the parent drug may reach the systemic circulation unchanged. By contrast, if the same dose is given intravenously, 100% is systematically available and the patient is exposed to higher concentrations with great effect once the drug is in systemic circulation, irrespective of which route is used, about 20% is subjected to hepatic metabolic process in each circulation because that is the proportion of cardia output that supplies the liver i.e. Blood flow (main determinate of metabolism). (Laurence D. R. and Bennett P. N. 1987).<br/>Considerations in selecting an antimicrobic drug before actual antimicrobic therapy can begin. It is important that at least three factors are known.<br/>1. The nature of the microorganism causing the infection.<br/>2. The degree of the microorganisms susceptibility (also called sensitivity) to various drugs and<br/>3. The overall medical condition of the patient (Kathlen P. Talaro 2005).<br/>Some syrups and solutions contain preservatives and sugar concentrations, which suppress the growth of most microorgarisms except the osmotolerant one (Grigo 1976). Because of their low water content, liquids are normally protected against microbial growth but are sometimes attached by some microorganisms and fungi especially when mixed with sweat, which act as a good nutrient medicine for them. Liquids (syrups) do not allow excessive microbial multiplication after manufacturing because of their low water activity except when exposed to air or during dispersing. Under bad storage conditions, a local increase of water content may permit microbial growth. This trend is not seen in the cases of not using multi-dose containers for injections because of the high risks of contamination. (Water man, R. R) Sumner, E.D Baldwinz J. N 2001).<br/>Microbiological qualities of pharmaceutical products are influenced by the environment in which they are manufactured, packaged/handled and dispensed, and also the materials used in their production (Farero, et al 1989).<br/>1.5 RAW MATERIALS<br/>The source of raw materials used in the production of the various pharmaceutical products determine the level of microbial contamination. Raw materials of animals and vegetable origin were repeatedly shown to be contaminated with viable organisms and molds, which can render a preparation objectionable or even dangerous (chamber, et al; 1988).<br/>However, irradiation is being used to endure that the hygienic quality of this product in Belgium and the Nether lands. On the other hand, synthetic and or semi-synthetic materials usually contain low microbial contamination (Underwood, 1983).<br/>1.6 WATER SUPPLY<br/>This plays an important role in pharmacy formations being the source of many potential harmful organisms, especially the coliforms and the same time providing medium for the growth of organisms introduced from other sources. The microorganisms frequently encountered are bacteria, fungi, algae and protozoa (Chukwura 2001). Even treated or distilled water can still readily pick up organism from pipe and storage containers without effective treatment to minimize contaminations.<br/> 1.7 AIR<br/>Air can harbour large numbers of microorganisms particularly the sporulating bacteria such as clostricdium species, the non-sporing bacteria and the molds, such as penicillium spp, cladosporium species, aspergillus species and mucor as well as yeast, such as Rhodoturola species (Underwood, al; 1983).<br/>Microorganisms are carried into the atmosphere suspended in particle of dusts, talking, coughing, sneezing. These organisms can survive for a long period of time since they are usually protected by the dust particle; the number in the air depends on the activity in the environment and the amount of dust which is disturbed and also its humidity<br/>(Remington’s pharmasc. 1992).<br/>1.8 EQUIPMENT<br/>Apparatus and machines in the manufacture of various non-sterile pharmaceutical products and those used in dispensing may harbour microorganisms which might growth in the product. Therefore it is important to eliminate such microbial reservoir by sterilization to prevent them from contaminating subsequent products.<br/>1.9 PERSONNEL<br/>Human beings may harbour various organisms in their respiratory tnacts, intestinal canal, on the skin, on their hairs and even in the finger nails. The nasal passages may contain large numbers of organisms which are secreted during normal respiratory function and speech (Underwood et al 1983).<br/>They may also contaminate these products thoughts through handling of strict personal hygiene in not observed. Therefore, t is very important that all employees in pharmaceutical industries should be given an adequate training in fundamental personal hygiene and also protective measures like nose masks and hand gloves should be used both in manufacturing and dispensing of these products to minimize contaminations. Khante, S. Nikore, RL, and Joshi,<br/>S. B (1992).<br/>1.1O CONTAINERS/PACKAGING MATERIALS<br/>Containers for syrups should be well sterilized; the products should be properly checked to know if there is any leakage. The microflora in the final product may represent contaminatloeri from the raw materials or the equipment with which it was made, air or from operator.<br/>The aim of this study therefore, is to investigate the incidence of microflora in syrups especially those dispensed from large containers/packages. The data obtained herein, would provide information of the extent and nature of microbial contamination of these products, which would inevitably assist in determining and controlling the source of such contamination in future.<br/><br/><br/>\n\nA TOTAL OF 34 INDIGENOUSLY MANUFACTURED PHARMACEUTICAL ORAL LIQUIDS WERE PURCHASED FROM DIFFERENT POTENT MEDICINE STORES IN OWERRI MAIN MARKET FROM AUGUST TO OCTOBER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A TOTAL OF 34 INDIGENOUSLY MANUFACTURED PHARMACEUTICAL ORAL LIQUIDS WERE PURCHASED FROM DIFFERENT POTENT MEDICINE STORES IN OWERRI MAIN MARKET FROM AUGUST TO OCTOBER", "id": 92}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>A STUDY ON THE EFFECT OF PROCESSING METHODS ON THE TOXICOLOGICAL COMPONENT OF UKPO MUCUNA SLOANEI)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Matured Mucuna Sloanei “Ukpo) seeds were sorted cleaned, cracked to expose the cotyledons.

It is food thickener known to originated from Asia and was introduced into the western hemisphere (Akpata, 2001), it is known as horse eye bean and with other local names in respect to different tribes and ethic groups. It is called Ukpo by Ibos, “Karasuu” by Hausas and “Yerepe” by Yourbas (Ayozie 2010). The belong to the legumes family. They are other species of mucuna throughout tropical regions of the world including Mucuna urensi, Mucuna Pruriens and mucuna veracrua (Ezueh and mozie, 2004).<br/>        Nutritionally, the important of mucuna sloanei (UKPO”) lies in high content of protein and  lysine. They are usually limited in sulplur contaning amion acids partially methioine. They are better source of phoshorus, but calcium (Okaka et al, 2006). Ukpo (Mucuna sloanei contain 20.0-25.4%, crube protein, 43.3% -49%, CHO, 5.05-7.0% fat, 25.0-27.4% crube fiber and about 6.4%-14. moisture (Akpata and machi, 2001.<br/>        Ukpo (Mucuna Sloanei ) is used in preparing various soup as soup thickener (Udensi, 2004). When the seeds are cracked the cotyledons of the seeds are boiled, sufficiently to soften them and grineded into power in the eastern part of Nigeria. They are sometimes broken the seeds and the colyledons were roasted with hot ash, grinded and used as soup thickeber. In addition to their thickening property Ukpo has gelation properties used in soup. This is a desirable attribute for eating of garri, Fufu, pounded yam etc. it has been reported that the nutritive value  of some mucuna utiles have been improbed by heat treatment due to the reduction of their anti-nutritional factors content by them (Manssour et al 1993) Ukachukwu and  Udesi 2002, et al, 2004).<br/>Food thickeners as consumed by millions of people in Nigeria.

Historical records suggest that malaria has infected human since the beginning of mankind. The name “mal aria” (Meaning bad air in Italian) was first used in English in 1740 by H. Walpole when describing the disease. The term was shortened to malaria in 20th century. Laveran; in 1880 was the first to identify parasites in human blood. In 1889, Ross discovered that mosquitoes transmit malaria.<br/>        Malaria continues to be a cause of great suffering in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world (Brabin, 1989). Currently, it is endemic in about 100 countries affecting 4% of world’s population. Malaria has been eliminated or effectively suppressed in several parts of the world in past decade but is now undergoing resurgence (Gilles, 1987). It is returning to areas from which it had been eradicated as well as spreading into new areas such as central Asia and Eastern Europe. Despite global economic development people are dying from malaria now than 30 years ago.<br/>EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CLINICAL FEATURES <br/>Malaria in pregnancy remain a notable cause of maternal and prenatal morbidity and mortality, often associated with maternal illness, maternal anemia, low birth weight, preterm delivery and prenatal loss especially in the primigravidae. In semi-immune pregnant women, malaria infection may be asymptomatic, pregnant women are at risk of clinical disease compared to non-pregnant women at all levels of endemicity (Harrison, 1995). There is unparasitized blood cells leading to a greater level of anemia than can be explained on the basis of RBCS parasitization alone (who,1991).<br/>Primgravidity is a known risk factor in pregnancy. It only becomes more prevalent in primigravide but also intense (Jimoh, 2003). The peak prevalence of parasitemia will be altered by prior anti malaria    injection. In a study from Madan, Papua New Guinea, the peak prevalence in primigravidae studied reached 55% to compared to 86% in other study from Kenya (flemming, 1986). Studies have also suggested that the highest prevalence of infection occurs in the 2nd trimester with inflection rate at delivery and in the postnatal period approximating to levels in non pregnant women possibly due to immunity boosting during pregnancy (Akindele, et al 1993)<br/>CAUSATIVE AGENT OF MALARIA <br/>Malaria is caused by five (5) species of plasmodium. They are as follows:<br/>plasmodium vivax (p. vivax) – This species is milder and generally not fatal. However, infected people still need treatment because their untreated progress can also cause a host of health problems. (Rogreson et al 2007)<br/>Plasmodium  Malariae ( P. Malaria) This species also is milder and not fatal. The infected person should be properly treated to avoid further health problems. This species is known to stay in the blood of the affected for several years (WHO, 2008).<br/>Plasmodium  Ovale (P. Ovale) -  It is also mild and as well need adequate treatment to avoid serious health condition. It stays in the liver of the affected person even for years without symptoms. (Neeru, 2005)<br/>Plasmodium Falciparum (P. Falciparum) This is the most serious form of the disease. It is most common in Africa, especially sub-saharan Africa. It needed thorough and adequate treatment of the affected person (Okwa, 2003).<br/>Plasmodium knowlesi (P. Knowlesi). This causes malaria in macaques but can also infect humans.<br/> INCUBATION PERIOD OF PLASMODIUM<br/>This refers to how long it takes from initial infection to the appearance of symptoms. This generally depends on the type (species) of parasite.<br/>P. falicparum      -       9 to 14 days<br/>P. Vivax             -       12 to 18 days<br/>P. vivax             -       12 to 18 days<br/>P. malaria -       18-40 days<br/>However, incubation periods can vary from as little as 7 days to several months for P. vivax and p. ovale<br/>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS <br/>The signs and symptoms of malaria typically begin 8-25 days following infections. However, symptoms may occur later in those who have taken antimalaria medication as prevention. The signs and symptoms may include the following<br/>Fever<br/>Shivering<br/>Joint pain (Arthralgia)<br/>Vomiting<br/>Hemolytic anemia<br/>Jaundice<br/>Convulsion<br/>Sudden coldness followed by rigor<br/>Severe headache<br/>Enlarged spleen etc.<br/> LIFE CYCLE<br/>The life cycle malaria is complex with asexual reproduction in the mammalian host and sexual reproduction in the anophelene vector. The female anopheles mosquito carrying malaria causing-parasites feeds on a human and injects the parasite in the form of sporozoites into the blood stream. The sporozoites travel to the liver and invade the liver. Within some days (5-6) the sporozites grow, divide and produce tens of thousands of merozoites. Some malaria parasite species remain dormant for extended periods in the liver. The merozoties exit the liver cells and re-enter blood stream to invade the red blood cell, it under goes asexual replication and release new formed merozoites from the red blood cells. Some of the merozoites infected blood cells instead of replicating asexually, develop into sexual forms of the parasite called male and female gametocytes that circulate in the blood stream.<br/>When the mosquito has a blood meal, it ingests the gametocytes. In the gut, the infected human blood cell burst, releasing the gametocytes, which develop further into mature sex cell called gametes. Male and female gametes fuse to form ookinetes which burrow into the mosquito midgut and form outcasts. Growth and division of each oocyst produce thousands of active haploid forms called sporozoites which migrates to the salivary gland of the mosquito waiting for another round of blood meal (Ter kulie et al 2003)<br/> PATHOGENESIS<br/>During the life cycle of malaria parasites in human body, Mosquito infects a person by taking a blood meal. Initially, sporozoite enters the blood stream and migrate to the liver. They infect liver cells (hepatocytes); where they multiply into merozoites, rupture the liver cells and escape back into the blood stream. Then, the merozoites infect red blood cells, where they develop into ring forms, trophozoites and schizonts which in turn produce further merozoites. Sexual forms (gametocytes) are also produced, which if taken up by a mosquito, will infect the host and continue the life cycle. Malaria develop into too phases- exoerythrocytic and erythrocytic cycle/phases. Exoerythrocytic has to do with infection of hepatic or liver cells while erythrocytic phase entails infection of erythrocytes or red blood cell, the sporozite migrates to the liver and infects the hepatocytes. It can continue to multiply without showing any symptoms within 8-30 days (cogsnell, 1992).<br/> EFFECT OF MALARIA INFECTION IN PREGNANCY <br/> There are many adverse effects of malaria during pregnancy. Pregnant woman are known to be more prone to contracting malaria than those that are not pregnant. A women’s immune system is affected during pregnancy. He becomes much more susceptible to developing malaria which atime  even leads to death of the child before birth or right after delivery (Steketee, et al, 2001). Some adverse effects of malaria during pregnancy include:-<br/>Anemia (Maternal and foetal aneinia)<br/>Fever<br/>Altered blood sugar levels<br/>Infection that harms the genitals<br/>Chance of cerebral malaria or other neurological problems<br/>Miscarriages<br/>Still birth<br/> TREATMENT /MANAGEMENT OF MALARIA IN PREGNANCY<br/>Treatment of malaria in pregnancy differs from the treatment of same woman outside pregnancy in several respects. Frequency and severity of infections are more in pregnancy particularly among primigravidae (Mutabingwa, 2004). Pregnant women with malaria infection must be treated both medically and obstetrically, taking care of both maternal and fetal interests. It is reasonable to expect confirmation of malaria infection in pregnancy. The choice of a suitable drug is predicated upon many factors including gestational age of fetus severity of the disease, the resistance of the infecting malaria parasites to the anti malaria drugs and safety profile of the drug in both mother and fetus. Ideally, effective care should clear both peripheral and placental parasites (Lars Hived, 1998).   <br/> OBSTETRIC MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANT WOMEN WITH MALARIA INFECTION<br/>Obstetric management is an integral part of the complete management of the malarious pregnant women. It consists of antepartum, intrapartum and post partum care.<br/>ANTEPARTUM  CARE OF PREGNANT WOMEN WITH MALARIA<br/>Essentially, during the antepartum or prenatal period, the antenatal clinic forms the template upon which the institutional treatment is based. As part of the routine ante natal care, history of malaria is obtained, blood tests including full blood count and malaria parasites are routinely requested for. Regular antenatal is of great importance as a single missed monthly clinic visit can result in a two fold increase malaria incidence. (Garnier, 1994) .<br/> INTRA PARTUM MANAGEMENT OF MALARIA IN PREGNANCY<br/>Intra partum management of parturient malarious women should include treatment of acute malaria with suitable agent. Routine intrapartum haemoglobin check is mandatory as ongoing hemolytic or pre-existing maternal anemia can substantially affect maternal and fetal outcome (Shulman et al, 1999).<br/> POSTPARTUM MANAGEMENT OF MALARIA IN PREGNANCY<br/>Following delivery, the mother should complete her antimalarials and supportive treatment. The foetus should be properly examined and congenital malaria excluded. The foetus should be properly examined and congenital malaria excluded. The newborn’s peripheral venous blood should be done to check for malaria parasites. Experiences by many authors have shown that heavy maternal parasitaemia significantly increases placental parasitization and fetal parasitaemia with consequent fetal anemia and possible fetal demise (Parise etal, 1998). The use of malaria vaccine in both the mother and the fetus postpartum is still inconclusive and controversial and many trials are underway to ascertain their safety profile and effectiveness.<br/> <br/>PREVENTION/CONTROL OF MALARIA IN PREGNANCY<br/>The main ways of preventing malaria in pregnancy can be achieved in two ways, they are;<br/>Avoiding mosquito bite:- This can be achieved in various ways.<br/>A) VECTOR CONTROL: This means trying to reduce contact with the vector of the disease. Controlling mosquito can significantly reduce malaria incidence as well as other mosquito borne diseases. Installation of screened windows air condition together with strategies to reduce vector populations are very effective and have led to the total elimination of malaria without completely getting rid of the mosquito (Neeru, 2005).<br/>B) USE OF INSECTICIDE TREATED BED NETS (ITNS): ITNS can reduce the incidence of malaria  infection in pregnancy and also mortality rate in endemic areas. If ITNS are widely used in an endemic places, the mosquito population may drop dramatically as well as their life spans. <br/>2) Preventing disease using anti malarial medications: Drugs that are effective and at the same time that cannot affect the growing foetus should be administered starting from early pregnancy. This type of prevention is also known as suppression, they do not prevent the parasite from entering the blood stream but they stop it from developing in the blood (mc cormick,1985)    <br/> LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>According to Oxford Medical Dictionary, pregnancy is a period during which a woman harbors a developing foetus normally in the uterus. This last for approximately 266 days from the time of conception till the time of delivery the baby 280  days  from the  first day of a woman’s menstrual period.<br/>It has been observed that malaria in pregnancy has continued to be a scourge in tropical and subtropical region of the world. However, p. Falciparum has been noted to be the most serious form of the disease in pregnancy. (WHO, 1993).<br/>Malaria in pregnancy is the major cause of stillbirths, infant mortality, maternal mortality and even low birth weight (Menendez, 1994). In areas where malaria is endemic, people may have immunity or semi – immunity and therefore have either no symptoms or few symptoms. <br/>The severity of the malaria depends on three things:<br/>The type of parasite<br/>Ones immunity<br/>The functional ability of one’s spleen (Schultiz, 1994).<br/>The parasite is transmitted by female anopheles mosquito when it bites human. As the parasite exists in human red blood cells, malaria can be passed from one person to the other through organ transplant, share of used needles/syringes and blood transfusion. Additionally, infected mother can as well transfer malaria to her baby during delivery it is called congenital malaria (Bray et al, 1999).<br/>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>This research work is made to find out the rate at which malaria affect pregnant women and their unborn children. It is also made to educate mothers of child bearing age and even the entire population on how best to check malaria infection in order to enhance the health of mother and child.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE PREVALENCE OF MALARIA AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN ON ADDMISSION IN IMO STATE SPECIALIST HOSPITAL OWERRI<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PREVALENCE OF MALARIA AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN ON ADDMISSION IN IMO STATE SPECIALIST HOSPITAL OWERRI", "id": 94}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EFFECT OF MATURITY STAGE AT HARVEST ON THE ANTI-NUTRITIONAL COMPOSITION OF OKRO (ABELMOSCHUS  ESULENTUS)<br/>ABSTRACT </b><br/>The anti-nutritional composition of Okro seeds flour at different stages of maturity at harvest were analyzed. The Okro fruits were harvest at one and two, week’s maturity after fruity. They were de-husked prior to the determination of anti-nutritional composition. The results were statistically analyzed descriptively and correlatively at 95% confidence limit.  The tannin, saponine alkaloid, flavonoid, sterol and cyanides contents of the seeds increase with maturity. The increments were as follows: (1.49-278)%, (1.18-1.48)%, (0.95-1.25)%, (0.62-0.80)%, (0.80-0.4)%, (9.55-17.58)%<br/>It was also revealed that, the cyanide content was the highest with (9.55-17.58)% while the sterol content was the least with (0.08-0.14)% in composition.

To meet demand for nutritionally balanced food for the world’s increasing population and relieve the intense pressure, plant species used as food must be diversified (Hughes, 2001). Inclusion of a wide array of indigenous vegetables species in cereals, tubers and livestock based agriculture will be crucial to contribute to food nutritional security and income diversification for stake holders in the subsistence farming system that predominate in the under development and developing world.<br/>        Okra has considerable area under cultivation in Africa and Asia with huge socioeconomic potential. In the African context, Okra has been called as a perfect villager’s vegetable because of its robust nature dietary fibers and distinct seed protein balanced in both lysine and tryptophane amino acids, it provides to diet (NAP, 2006).<br/>        However, Okra has been considered a minor crop and until recently no attention was paid to its improvement in the international research program. This review presents a general overview of Okra’s nutritional and economic potential with special reference to past and recent progress on its improvement Okra is also called Okra, Ochro, lady’s finger etc. it is of different cultivars, which vary in time of planting to maturity, colour of leaves, steam, length, shape of fruit and other characters. Okra is traditionally grown in a region of many countries especially. Nigeria, Ghana, Asia etc. (de lannoy, 2001) Okra have a great potential to improve the nutrition and thereby health of consumers as most are good sources of vitamins, minerals and proteins needed for the proper functioning and development of the human body.<br/>        Okra fruit can be dried whole or sliced and subsequently consumed, before selling, the dried product is usually ground to a powder (slemonsma and kouame 2004). Okra can be preserved by fermentation canned out at 30oc.<br/>Drying is the most common form of food preservation and extends the food shelf life. The major objective in drying agricultural products is the reduction of the moisture content to a level which allows safe storage over an extended period. Also it brings about substantial reduction in weight and volume minimizing packaging storage and transportation. (Okras et al.,1992). The drying method is by sundry but it required long drying time that may have adverse consequences in the product quality which may contaminate the end product by dust and insects or suffer from enzyme.<br/>Recently an attention has been given to the use of Okra seeds an a source of proteins (about 20% of dry matter) and vegetable oil (about 14% of dry matter). Seeds contain mainly monounsaturated fatly acids and palmitic acid and their high Lysine level, (Adelakun et al 2008). Sometimes, the seeds are roasted and used as a substitute for coffee. Apart from its nutritive value the stem and fruit sheath used in the manufacture of paper as they contain more of the crude fibre.<br/>At a particular stage of maturity of Okra fruits they cannot be consumed because they become too fibrous and difficult to slice. The fruits are discard or either stored for the next planting season. To minimize post-harvest food causes therefore, this work was aimed at investigating on the effect on maturity stage at harvest on the anti-nutritional composition of Okra seeds, (Agbo et al 2008). Also the result from the work will help to promote industrial application of the Okra seeds.<br/><br/>\n\nEFFECT OF MATURITY STAGE AT HARVEST ON THE ANTI-NUTRITIONAL COMPOSITION OF OKRO (ABELMOSCHUS  ESULENTUS)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF MATURITY STAGE AT HARVEST ON THE ANTI-NUTRITIONAL COMPOSITION OF OKRO (ABELMOSCHUS  ESULENTUS)", "id": 95}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE OF DIOSCOREA BULBIFERA (AERIAL YAM) <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Dioscorea bulbifera is a major stable food crop which is a species of yam widely distributed around the world in tropical and subtropical regions. Dioscorea bulbifera have been traditionally used to lower glycemic index, thus providing a more sustained form of energy and better protection against obesity and diabetics, it also has anti-cancer properties. The present study was undertaken to investigate the nutritional profile and phytochemical screening of Discorea bulbifera. Which contain protein 7.47%, moisture 14.74%, ash 2.56%, fiber 0.35%, carbohydrate 73.62%. It also show the presence of some minerals like, Ca, Mg, K, P, and Na with some phytochemical analysis like saponin, tannin, flavoured and alkaloids.   <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>        Dioscorea bulbifera is a species of yam, it is one of the early foods, it was extensively cultivated and used by the generation of individual as an house hold name, means of survival, medicine and food etc. with different method of cooking, some roast, boil, and eat with oil and condiment, depending an individual. It has been agreed upon that people of old leave longer and the healthy, in respective of their none exposure, low health care system, poor sanitation and hygiene than the present century, even with all these facility close to our door step yet many fall appeal to various type of sickness and many wonder why?<br/>        An evaluation on the kind o food people of old depend on was found out to be the secret in other to verify, and confirm. (Oke, 1990). The most common tubers that were feed on by the old was picked and worked on. This was to check for the nutritive value, importance and uses of the aerial yam. Surprisingly most people dose not know such yam exist, and it is rarely sold in market. Only few people in this part of the eastern land still cultivate this yam species because of the value and importance.<br/>        This study is to help you found at the nutritive content of the aerial yam being one of the food eaten by people of the old which is their secret for healthy living and to inspire many people to revisit most the crop being cultivated and harvested by people of old and more light should be thrown on them.<br/>1.1    LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>        Dioscorea bulbitera is one of the various species of yam. Yam is the common name of some species in the genus dioscorea, they are perennial herbacocous vines cultivated for the consumption of their starchy tubers in African, Asia, Latin America etc. yam is a versatile vegetable it can be barbecued (using less heat). Roasted, fried, boiled, etc. yam are stable crops of the Igbo people in Nigeria in their language it is known as “ji” and they commemorate it by having a yam festival as a symbolism of fresh crop and availability of fresh food in abundance all over Nigeria. The new yam festival is known as “iri-ji” or iwa-ji” depending on the dialect. Yams are primary agricultural, and commonly important in west Africa, where over 95% of worlds yam crop is harvested, they are important for survival, they serve as a means of lively hood for some people. There are over 600 varieties of yam and 95% of it are grown in African (library congress 2011). Example of the varieties of yam are the white yam which is known as dioscorea volundata, Chinese yam (D. oposita), yellow (D. cayenesis) water yam (D. alatal) lesser yam (D. esculenta) Bitter yam (D. dumetorum), cush yam (D. trifida) and Air potato (D. bulbifera) etc. (key 1937)<br/>        D. bulbitera is a yam species it is also know as varahi in Sanskrit, kaachi in malayalam, Dukkar kand in maraitu, Aldo in some part of Igbo land in Nigeria or Aerial yam the English name or Air potato. The Air potato plant is a nature of Africa and Asia; it is an invasive species in many tropical including Florida (Duke et al 1993). The Air potato was introduce to the Americans from African in 1905 it was introduced in Florida due to its ability to displace native species and disrupt natural processes such as fire and water flow air potato has been listed as one of the Florida’s most invasive plant spp since 1993 and was placed on the Florida Noxious weed list by the Florida Department of Agriculture and consumer since (1999)<br/>1.2    SCIENTIFIC CLASSIFICATION OF D. BULBIFERA (TAXONOMY)<br/>Kingdom – plantea<br/>(unranked) – angiosperms<br/>(unranked) – monocots<br/>Order – Dioscoreales<br/>Family – Dioscoreacece<br/>Germs – Dioscorea<br/>Species – D. bulbifera<br/>Binomial name Dioscorea bulbifera, Air potato, aerial yam (Duke, James et al 1993)<br/>1.3    D. BULBIFERA SPECIES DESCRIPTION<br/>Aerial yam is a perennial vine with broad leaves and two types of storage organs. The plant form bubils in the leaf axils of the twining stems and tubers beneath the ground. These rigorously twining long stemmed herbaceous which may arise from under ground tuber although often tubers are inconspicuous or absent. The stems are round to slightly angled in cross section and they twine counter- clockwise. Conspicuous aerial tubers called bulbils are pale round to globose in shape up to 13cm wide and are formed in leaf axils it is this bulbils that give D. bulbifera the common name air potato. The leaves are attractive, alternate, broady heart shaped up to 20cm long and attached by long petiole. They are divided longitudinally into lobes by proximate arching vieas all radiating out from a single point of origin where the petiole attached to the leaf flowers rarely occur in D. bulbifera where occurring, they are small pale green and fregnants arising from leaf axils. The fruit is a capsule and the seeds are partially winged (langland and Buks 1998, langeland 2001).<br/>        The tubers often have a bitter taste which can be removed either by socking or boiling for detoxication (Kay, 1987) before eating. It is not grown much commercially since the flavour of other yams is preferred by most people. They are prepared like other yams. The air potato is the most widely consumed yam species in 1960’s it can grow up to 150ft tall, it grows extremely quickly, roughly 8 inches per day and eventually reach over 60ft long. It typically climbs to the tops of trees and have the tendency to take over native plants. New plants develop from bulbils an underground tuber. The primary means of spread and reproduction are via bubils, the smallest bubils make, control of air potato difficult due to their ability to sprout at a very small stage the vine produces small white flowers, are rarely seen when it grows. The fruit are capsules (National Tropical Botanical Garden 2007)<br/>1.4    INVASION INFORMATION<br/>The plant was first introduce to the world during the share trade and subsequently transported to Florida in 1905 as USDA sample, sent for Horticulural examination (Coursey 1967 and Sehults 1993). They receive and example the sample in which they saw the potential danger that the aggressive potential invader post for the state. Vigorous a sexual, reproduction via bubils has facilitated the continued spread of invasive vine throughout most of the state (mantinez 1993) bubils can last a year or more on the ground and still sprout and spoil contact D. Bubifera have become rampart on undeveloped land around Tapa by 1996 the plant had been reported from natural areas in Florida countries (large land and Burk 1998). As of 2007 the Florida exotic pest plant concil early detection and mapping system states that D. bulbilfera now occurs in at least 46 (of 67) Florida countries<br/>1.5    POSSIBLE ECONOMICS CONSEQUENCES OF INVASION<br/>        D. bulbifera is listed as an invasion exotic plant in Florida, indicating that the species is currently altering native plant community by displacing native species and changing community structure or ecological functions. Asexual propagation by means of bulbils that drop off, of parent vines to the ground in abundance ensure that eradication of the plant is exceedingly difficult once it has invaded an area. If the plant is cut to the ground the tubers can survive for extended periods and send up New short latter. In many part of the world the tubers and bulbils of D. bulbifera are used as food and the plant has also long been used as a flok medicine including use as an analgesic, aphrodisiac, diuretic and a rejuvenative tonic. The steroid diosgenin, an active component of birth control pills is extracted from the plant as is the anti-fungal compound dihydrorodio scor<br/>1.6    SALINITY<br/>          Air potato is not salt tolerant and is an in successful invader of marine and esluarine shorelines (Morisawa, 1999)<br/>1.7    TOXICITY<br/>        Aerial yams have anti-nutritional factors. In Asia detoxication and roasting of the grated tuber are used for better cultivars of this yam. The bitter compounds in yams also known locally as air potato including disobulbin and possibly saponins. These substance are toxic causing paralyses (Oke 1990). Also the wild from of bitter hence are referred to as bitter yam. Yam are usually detoxified in a vessel of salt and H20 in cold, hot, fresh or in stream. The bitter compound of the yam are H20 soluble alkaloids which on ingestion produced several and distressing symptoms. Severe cases of alkaloid intoxication may prove fatal.<br/>        Uncultivated forms such as those found growing wild in Florida can be poisonous. These varieties contain the steroid, diosgenin which is a principal material used in the manufacture of a number of synthetic steroidal hormones such as those used in hormonal contraception (National Tropical Botanical Garden 2007). There have been claims by pest plant air potato 2010 that even the wild form are rendered edible after drying and boiling leading to confusion over actual toxicity<br/> 1.8    EMBROYOLOGY <br/>        In areas where they are produced D. bulbifera seeds are wind –dispersed (Hammer, 1998) even where flowering occurs more regularly sexual reproduction via seed in still likely of secondary importance. Seed of D. Bulbefera and other members of genus are believed to undergo an obligate dormancy period of several months before they germinate. This strategy is probably and evolutionary by adaptation to ensure that the presence of viable seeds in the seed bank when breaks in forest canopy cover occur. A laboratory genuine regime for viable non-dormant D. bulbifera seed indicate that germination occurs in approximate twenty one days at 300c (Elis et al 1985). They also and be dispersed by flood H20 and appear to be little impacted by feeding from raccoons feral pigs and other animals (Coursey 1967 Morisawe 1999)<br/>1.9    REPRODUCTION<br/>        Reproduction in D. bulbifera can propagate through sexual and asexual means. Discorea species are doccious with male and female flowers occurring in separate plant. The chief of reproduction in D. bulbifera is asexual and is dependent on dedicative growth from under ground and above-ground bulbils.<br/>        Tubers and burbils generally sprout in the spring and the new short often climb the deed stems of the previous year to reach the tree canopy. In the summer (June-July) a large numbers of new bubils are produced which fall to the ground in late August. By the time seasonal stem die back begins around October a single vine may have out as many as 200 bubils (www.killerparts.com 2004)<br/>1.1.0 POTENTIALLY MISIDENTIFIED SPECIES <br/>          The water yam (D. alata) D. bulbifera are superficially similar in appearance but distinguishing the two is straight toward. D. alata and alternate in D. bulbifera. The underground tubers of D. alata are also enormous, some weighing more than 45kg where as the D. bulbifera are small and may be absent all together. (Largelan and Burks 1998)<br/>1.1.1 STORAGE  <br/>        Roots and tubers such as yam are living organisms when stored they continue to respire. The respiration process result in the oxidation of starch (polymer of glucose) contained in the cell of the tubers which convert it into H2o, Co2 and heat energy. During its transformation of starch the dry malter of the tubes properly stored is consider to be the least perishable. Below are the methods you can observe for successful storage and yam (Linus 2003)<br/>Avoid bad and damage yams, used only sound and healthy yam<br/>Proper curing, if possible combined with fungicide treatment<br/>Adequate ventilation to remove the heat generated by respiration of tubers<br/>Regular inspection during storage and removal of volting tuber and any sprout that develop<br/>Protecting from direct sunlight and remain (temp 14-150c) <br/>SAFETY PROFILE <br/>Yams of African species must be cooked before safely eaten because various nutritional toxin substance such as dioscorina can cause illness if consumed raw. Note yams have a toxic chemical called diosegenin that can be changed through chemical reaction into useful substances. They include the medicine cortisone used for treat of joint pains as in arthritis, allergic reaction like bee stings and rashes and general body inflation and several hormones including estrogen, progesterone and testosterone. The hormones mention are in category called steroids per harps you have heard of steroid as substance used improperly to increases person as athletic ability.<br/>Excessive skin contact with yam fluids can cause the skin to itch. If this occurs a quick cold bath or application of palm oil to the affected part of the body would stop the itching.<br/> 1.1.3 USES <br/>        In many part of the world the tubers and bubils of D. bulbifera are used as food and the plant is cultivated as an agricultural crop, the plant has also, long being use as a flok medicine, including use of analgesic aphrodisiac, diuretic and rejuvenate tonic. Some of the medicinal uses of D. bulbifera are in traditional/Chinese medicine; D. bulbifera is used in the treatment of soar throat, gastric cancer and carcinoma of the reticulum (GAE et al 2007)<br/>It have been traditionally used to lower glycenic index, thus providing a more sustained form of energy and better protection against obesity and diabetics it also have anti-cancer prosperities (Jiang 1978)<br/>Dioseorea bulbifera is used in Bangladesh for the treatment of leprosy and tumors (Murray et al 1984) and by the native people of Western highlands of came room for the treatment of pig cysticercosis through the tubers after collection during farming period, are totally destroyed and burnt because of high bitterness<br/>The roots of D. bulbifera, although considered poisonous because of cytotoxic activity, has been used in Chinese medicine as a remedy of soar throat and for struma (Kormori, 1997)<br/>In Zembabwe this plant is used as an infusion to apply on cuts and stores, both for humans and animals while in Cameroon and Madegascar, the rounded bulbs are applied to abscesses, boils and wound infection (Corgu 2002)<br/>Its bulbs are used in India to treat piles, dysentery syphilis and are applied to ulcers, pain and inflammation (Gupta and Sigh, 1989)<br/>Air potato has been used as a flok remedy or home remedy to treat conjunctivitis, diarrhea and dysentery among other ailment (Duke et al 1993). The steroid diosgenin, an active component of birth control pills is extracted from the plant as the anti-fungal compound dihydrodrodio.<br/><br/>\n\nNUTRITIONAL VALUE OF DIOSCOREA BULBIFERA (AERIAL YAM) <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " NUTRITIONAL VALUE OF DIOSCOREA BULBIFERA (AERIAL YAM) ", "id": 96}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>FOOD CONSUMPTION PATTERN AND MICRO NUTRIENT INTAKE OF MOTHERS IN IMO STATE.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This study was carried out to assess the food consumption pattern and micronutrient Intake of mothers in Ojo Local Government Area in Lagos State.

Food and nutrition are basic human rights because they are necessary for human development.<br/>Malnutrition is the major contribution to illness and diseases in the world. This includes risk factors related to under nutrition, excess consumption of certain diet components (carbohydrates, fat, etc) and low consumption of other food items like fruits and vegetables. Rural dwellers food consumption pattern depends on many factors intervention into the life patterns of the community to which they belong. These factors affect food availability and how each food could be processed and stored.<br/>Food consumption patterns can be defined as the recognizable ways of eating foods rural dwellers tend to adhere to their old eating patterns rather than venturing to seek new and more proper eating habits. In order to maintain healthful diets, a variety and balance of foods from all food groups and moderate consumption of all food items is very important.<br/>Variety in diet implies choosing a number of different foods within any food group, rather than eating the \"same old thing\" day after day. Food consumption patterns has been observed to be influenced by socio-economic factors including sex, income, occupation, type of house and source of cooking energy, food consumption patterns of the mother prior to conception during pregnancy and lactation affects the reproductive cycle and health of the newborn infant. A mother with poor food consumption patterns has the risk of delivering a baby that is physically and mentally handicapped. Wright and Sims (1987) assert that many complex interacting systems affect man's food consumption pattern and his consequent state of health. They further explained that natural environment (climate, topography soil conditions etc) determines what food can be produced. The man made environment (technological developments for processing, storing and distribution of food) affects what food will be made available for consumption.<br/>Proper and adequate food consumption patterns is the instrument for achieving other rural developmental goals, most especially those connected to reduction in child mortality and improvements in material health. Primary educational enrolment and achievement, gender equity and the capacity of resist disease, in order to be healthy and active women need to have food in adequate quantity, quality and variety in order to meet energy and nutrient. Consumption patterns of the mother prior to conception and during pregnancy and lactation affects the reproductive cycle and health of the newborn infant. A mother with poor food consumption patterns have the risk of delivery a baby that is physically and mentally handicapped.<br/>Adequate food plays an important role in rural development activities. It ensures their capacity to embark on livelihood activities that is sustainable.<br/>1.1 OBJECTIVES Broad Objective<br/>To assess the food consumption pattern and micro nutrient intake of mothers in Imo State Local Government Area Lagos.<br/>Specific Objectives<br/>To assess the nutritional status of mothers in Imo State L.G.A<br/>To investigate, measure and assess the food pattern of mother in Imo State L.G.A.<br/>To assess the micronutrient intake of mothers in Ojo L.G.A. 1.3 JUSTIFICATION<br/>Malnutrition remains an existing problem among Nigerians especially women and children.

With access to the region improving, the opportunity, and the need, to improve our understanding of this disease are increasing. Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever transmitted by rats. It has been known since the 1950s, but the virus was not identified until 1969, when two  missionary nurses died from it in the town of Lassa in Nigeria. Found predominantly in west Africa,1 it has the potential to cause tens of thousands of deaths. Even after recovery, the virus remains in body fluids, including semen.1The years of civil unrest in Sierra Leone (1991-2002) halted the investigation (through international collaboration) of Lassa fever at a specialist unit in Kenema. Increasing international travel and the possibility of use of the Lassa virus as a biological weapon escalate the potential for harm beyond the local level. Access to the country is improving, so renewed efforts to understand it are feasible.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>          Lassa fever or Lassa hemorrhagic fever (LHF) is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus and first described in 1969 in the town of Lassa, in Borno State, Nigeria.[1] The Lassa Fever is a member of the arenaviridiae virus family. Similar to Ebola,[2] clinical cases of the disease had been known for over a decade but had not been connected with a viral pathogen. The infection is endemic in West African countries, and causes 300,000–500,000 cases annually, with approximately 5,000 deaths.[3]Outbreaks of the disease have been observed in Nigeria, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and the Central African Republic, but it is believed that human infections also exist in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, and Senegal. The primary animal host of the Lassa virus is the Natal Multimammate Mouse (Mastomys natalensis), an animal indigenous to most of Sub-Saharan Africa.[4] The virus is probably transmitted by contact with the feces or urine of animals accessing grain stores in residences. (Garrett, Laurie, 2001). Given its high rate of incidence, lassa fever has become a major problem in the African region. Nadezhda E. Yun and David H. Walker (1999) carried out a research on the origin on the Lassa fever. Dr. Ross Donaldson accounts his experience with Lassa fever in his book, The Lassa Ward.<br/>        Lassa virus is zoonotic (transmitted from animals), in that it spreads to man from rodents, specifically multi-mammate rats (Mastomys natalensis). This is probably the most common rodent in equatorial Africa, ubiquitous in human households and eaten as a delicacy in some areas. In these rats infection is in a persistent asymptomatic state. The virus is shed in their excreta (urine and feces), which can be aerosolized. In fatal cases, Lassa fever is characterized by impaired or delayed cellular immunity leading tofulminant viremia. (R. T. D. Emond, Barbara Bannister, G. Lloyd, T. J. Southee and E. T. W. Bowen, 2000).<br/>        Infection in humans typically occurs by exposure to animal excrement through the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. Inhalation of tiny particles of infective material (aerosol) is believed to be the most significant means of exposure. It is possible to acquire the infection through broken skin or mucous membranes that are directly exposed to infective material. Transmission from person to person has also been established, presenting a disease risk for healthcare workers. Frequency of transmission via sexual contact has not been established.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>Despite much global effort, advances in research, and updated clinical management guidelines, Lassa Fever continues to be a cause of mortality and morbidity in humans worldwide. In West Africa, accounts for more than 300, 000-500, 000 with about 5000 deaths (United States Department of Medicine, 2008) and results in significant economic losses. (Barrington, Gay &amp; Evermann, 2002; Gunn, Naylor, &amp; House, 2009).<br/>Based on this the research work intends to find out the causes of diarrhea and its effect on children between the ages of 5 and 10 years respectively.<br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of writing this project is as follows;<br/>To identify the communicable diseases that is prevalent among children in primary schools in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>To find out the effects of Lassa Fever in the society at large.<br/>To outline the various causes of Lassa fever diseases.<br/>To examine the nature and scope of communicable diseases.<br/>To suggest ways to prevent or control Lassa fever.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>What are the prevalent communicable diseases in the local government area?<br/>How can communicable diseases like lassa fever be controlled?<br/>Does communicable disease like Lassa fever have any effect on children?<br/>Does poor toilet facilities causes lassa fever infection?<br/>Does contaminated water cause lassa fever?<br/>Does poor child health care cause lassa fever infection?<br/>Does improper covering of food cause lassa fever infection?<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>        The importance of this study cannot be overemphasized.<br/>The study would also be of great help to the ministry of health and the government whose objectives of primary health care are preventive health and gradual eradication of these communicable diseases.<br/>It will help the teachers and the pupils to be aware of the commonest communicable diseases in the society<br/>It will help the teachers to prevent the spread of this communicable disease in the classroom<br/>It will create awareness to the general public on the causes of lassa fever in our society<br/>It helps the teachers to care about the health of the students and to know how to treat the infected pupil.<br/>It helps in continuous training of teachers on disease control.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study is set out to investigate types of communicable diseases using lassa fever as a case study.

According to the research carried out by (Ehrlich D. 2010) found out that the effect of food poisoning s tart to manifest between 4-36 hours after eating a contaminated food.<br/>        Food poisoning is a common and usually mild but sometimes deadly illness, a part from the symptoms out lined by Ehrlich, when contaminated food or drink is consumed it can lead to fever and chills bloody stools, dehydration and even nacreous breakdown, and these symptoms may affect one person or group of people which according to Ehrlich is called an “outbreak”<br/>        Cassava whose bacteria name is “Manihot esculenta or yucca or manioc” is a woody shrub of the euphorbiaceac family, a nature of South America it is tropical and sub-tropical regions for its edible starchy tuberous root, a major source of carbohydrate. Nigeria is the world’s largest producer of cassava.<br/>        My main focus in this research work is to determine the causes and effect of food poisoning due to the consumption of improperly processed garri in Ego Local Government Area of Edo State. Nigeria garri is obtained by fermentation and subsequent frying; it can be fortified with legume like soya beans to offer a nutritionally rich meal.<br/>        Garri frying through a dehydrating process is not straight forward dry process it is not possible to produce garri from cassava pulp by just passing, heated air through it.<br/>        The product from such an operation could be dried cassava pulp or grancile and garri-garrification is simultaneous cooking and dehydrating operation. The product is first cooked with the mixture in it and dehydrates. The heat intensity during frying affects quality of the product. The moisture content of dewatered and sieved cassava mash in between 50 to 65% which has to be reduced to about 12% after frying operation in the dilled techniques the initial frying temperature is relatively low so as to avoid the formation of many lumps. As the moisture content reduces and most of the small lumps developed, have been broke n down by constant pressing and agitation, the heat is then increased in order to further cook and dehydrate the products. The colour and taste can be enhanced by adding a few drop of palm oil. At the end of the frying operation, the product is still hot and a little bit damp. It is then left to cool and dry, in a dry shade until the moisture content is reduced to 12% (Igbeka 1995).<br/>         The major factor that limits the use of cassava as food is the toxicity of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) which occurs as a result of the hydrolysis of cyanogenic glycoside (Richard 1985). According to him, the cyanide present in cassava may be considered to be of two types bound cyanide present as  the cyanorganic  glucoside and free cyanide present as the cyanogenic-glucoside and cyanide present as the cyanohydrins, that is free hydrogen cyanide which a gas above 26(under alkaline condition) add as cyanide ion, using improperly processed cassava can increase the cyanide content in the human body and eventually cause goiter cretimism, paralysis and neurological disorder(Delenge and Awuwalia 1983) as cited in Bradbury etal (1991). There is a great concern about the level of cyanide in many varieties of cassava products including garri there is equally good evidence that some fibre depleted diet cause pathetical affects as assumed by Umoh etal (1984) the effects are manifested not only in the gastro in-testinal tract but other anafomical structure such as the arteries lower limb and gall bladder.<br/>STAMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM<br/>Consumption of cassava products generally garri in particular has     always been a trend in Nigeria in west Africa and some other part of the world. The  consumption of these products has been accompanied with some side effect like food poisoning and other related effects due to inefficiency in the process of production, which inevitably lead to improperly processed product(garri), and when this product is consumed, it will result to food poisoning and its effect has consumed the product, it is still a fact that , the amount of toxins in present in cassava notably cyanide if not properly processed during the production of garri (fermentation and consequently frying) can cause a lot of affect to human body and vis-a-visa food poisoning.<br/>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The objectives of this study is enumerated as follows:<br/>To determine causes food poisoning due to the consumption of improperly processed garri<br/>To determine the effects to food poisoning due to the consumption of improperly processed garri<br/>Enlightenment of the Nigeria population to avoids for poisoning as a consuming garri<br/>Evolving a heather Nigeria<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The significance of this research are as follows: This study is undertaken on the premise that, the consumers and producers of cassava product (garri) will be better enlightened about food poisoning inherent in the consumption of improperly processed garri<br/>The study will stimulate decision maker in government to recognize the importance of considering the health of the citizen in terms of the food they consumed in order to reduce the number of patent at our hospitals both the government and the farmer would see the need of sending agric professional to educate those farmer on the production of garri (on the part of government and the farmer on the other hand would adhere to the teaching of the professional that has been sent by the government.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>The following research questions were formulated<br/>Does consumption of improperly processed garri leads to food poisoning?<br/>Does low storage time lead to improperly processed garri?<br/>Does ignorance/illiteracy of the consumer result to cassava products (Garri) being improperly processed<br/>Does poor handling of cassava lead to its very improperly processed?<br/>Could contamination by micro organism make cassava to be improperly processed?<br/>HYPOTHESIS<br/>The follow null hypothesis were formulated<br/>HI: There is no significant relationship between food poisoning and improperly processed garri.<br/>H2: There is no significant different between storage time and improperly processed garri.<br/>H3: There is no significant relationship between ignorance of consumers and improperly processed garri<br/>H4: There is no significant different between poor handling of cassava and improper processing.<br/>H5: There is no significant different between contamination by micro-organism and improperly processed garri.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study is basically a research determine the cause and effect of poisoning a to the consumption, of improperly processed garri. Ogede village in Egor local government area was used as a case study for this research.

This was further reinforced by the world summit for children held in New York in 1990. Thus, this declaration established challenges for global immunization. Therefore, the federal government of Nigeria through the federal ministry of Health has pursued an active immunization programme and has given necessary priority to its immunization programme. The expanded programme on immunization (EPI) was initiated in 1979. However, in view of the critical need to enhance the effectiveness of immunization which was fast declining and to meet global challenges of immunization, the (EPM was restructured in 1997 and it was named national programme on immunization (NPI) and established as a parastatals of Federal Ministry of Health by (Decree 12 of 1997). The NPI is charged with the responsibility of effectively controlling through provision of vaccines and immunization. The occurrence of the following disease tuberculosis, polio-myelitis, diphtheria, pretties, neonatal, tetanus, measles-yellow fever, cerebra spinal meningnitis (CSM), hepatitis B and other diseases as epidemiological evidence may deem necessary.<br/>        In Nigeria, the three levels of government (Federal, State, and Local) are important partners, committed to the formulation of strategies and support for the implementation of an effective immunization programme. National programme on immunization is 5 years. National strategic plan, 2001-2005. It adopts the regional and sub-regional vision and strategies for morbidity and mortality reduction vaccine preventable disease while polio eradication remains the major focus given the set targets, strengthening of the immunization services delivery system will be a key component to be addressed in order to improve routine immunization serves. Other area of focus include update of current immunization policy to include safety of injection and waste disposal management issue, training of immunization personnel rehabilitation and expansion of the cold chain vaccine supply and distribution, strengthening of surveillance system  advocacy and social mobilization collaboration with the private health sector will also be fostered.<br/>        The later agency coordinating committee (ICC) will expand to include more members and will take part in mobilization resources as well as monitoring plan implementation and fund utilization yearly target for immunization coverage have been set that will allow evaluation of the progress made. The estimate budget for the implementation of the planned activities is US $678,501,115. However, the annual plans derived from the five year plan will provide more accurate figure for the yearly implementation of the programme activities. Immunization is the process of protecting the body against diseases by means of vaccines or serums. San, C. A. (1987) every living thing on this planet has natural immunity by birth in humans new born babies receive the natural immunity in form of antibodies from mother. These antibodies are transferred to the infant through breast milk however, through early infancy. Thus, it is very necessary for everybody to have immunity against the crippling deadly diseases, immunization is a way to stimulate the body to produce immunity to an offending agent (bacteria or virus). This form of immunity is referred to as acqui8red immunity. There are two types of immunization namely; active immunization and passive immunization.<br/>Active Immunization: this involves the use of vaccine it is another term for vaccines. A vaccine contains substance that stimulate the body immune system to produce antibody project, then if he or she is exposed to the actual disease causing organism. Vaccine contain substance that are powerful enough to trigger antibody production but that do not actually causes diseases. Vaccine have been developed against many diseases like chicken pox, diohtheria, influenza, measles, meningitis, mumps, poliomyelitis, rabies, tetanus, whooping cough, yellow fever, rubella (German measles) etc. most vaccines are injected into the body but that of sabin polio vaccine is taken orally. A single dose of some vaccine provides life-long protection against infection other vaccine requires several dose to produce immunity and then must reinforced at regular intervals with booster dose.<br/>        Passive immunization involves the injection of serum into the body. A serum contain antibodies that have been formed in another person or an antitrial to provides almost immediate protection, from infection, but this immunity last only a few months because the antibody gradually disappears. Physicians give serums to people against disease, people to which vaccine have not been developed. Great snide have been made on NPI activities inspite of above, Alakiya and Sofolue (1980) and Ogunmekan (1976) reported a low level of involvement by the public, essentially mothers about the national programme on immunization, hence, the prevalence of the deadly disease causing a very high mortality rate among infants. Thus, many problem faced by NPI which include low level of awareness, inadequate vaccine, poor funding, lack of adequate publicity and coverage, inadequate staffing and clinic to mention but a few.<br/>        The research intend to find out the extent of utilization of the program Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area, Edo State and ascertain if the above reason also apply to the area research it is hoped that the result to this study will go a long way  to reducing if not eliminating the problem area.                      <br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>        The federal government, state and local government earmarked the year 2005 for the eradication of the deadly communicable disease. The researcher hopes to x-ray the extent of utilization of the national programme on immunization in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of Edo State. The issue for infant mortality is still very rampant and this has passed lots of concern about the efficiency or otherwise of this study, entails the determination of the level of utilization of the NPI in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS   <br/>        This study attempted to answer the question pose below;<br/>What is the socio-economic status of mothers who participate in NPI?<br/>What is the educational level of mothers and utilization of NIP?<br/>What is the knowledge of types of immunization do they have?<br/>What is the information media of mothers who utilized NPI?<br/>HYPOTHESIS<br/>There is no significant relationship between economic status of mother who participate in NPI in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>There is no significant relationship between educational level of mother and utilization of NPI.<br/>There is no significant relationship on the knowledge of the types of immunization in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>There is no significant relationship between the information media of mothers who utilized NPI in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area.<br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY    <br/>        The purpose of this study is to assess and determine the extent of utilization of NPI in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area and also identified the problems affecting the programme and children’s health as far as the communicable disease are concerned in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area. The objective of this study include finding out/examining;<br/>The level of utilization of the national programme on immunization in Ikpoba Okha Local Government  Area of Edo State.<br/>How many mothers are in the community.<br/>The number of children immunized<br/>The number of children the mothers have<br/>Suggesting ways of improving the rate of immunization of children in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area<br/>The reason for immunization<br/>The believe of mothers about immunization<br/>Ascertaining the socio-economic status of mother who participated in the national programme on immunization<br/>The view of others did not participate in the national programme on immunization.   <br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The world health organization (WHO) pronounced using the federal ministry of health by degree 12 of 1997 to totally eradicate the communicable disease by 2005. Therefore the importance of this study lies in the fact that children make the community. This societies and the world, children should therefore be ensured by parents not just the government duty along but for the children to be immunized against these deadly communicable diseases namely tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pretties, neonatal, tetanus, measles, yellow fever, cerebra spina meningitis (CSM) hepatitis B and other diseases as epidemiological. According to national immunization policy (May, 2003).<br/>        The study hope to highlight the extent of utilization of national programme on immunization in the area of study, this may help the federal ministry of health to intensify in improving the programme.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>        Some terms and abbreviation used in this study are defined below to enhance easy understanding.<br/>NPI: National programme immunization.<br/>Immunization: Makes immune against diseases.<br/>Poliomyelitis: A diseases of infants that usually paralyzed the legs.<br/>DPT: Diphtheria, peruses and tetanus<br/>OPV: Oral polio vaccines<br/>CSM:  Cerebra-spinal meningitis<br/>VF: Yellow fever<br/>EPL: Extended programme on immunization<br/>  <br/><br/>\n\nANALYSIS OF THE UTILIZATION OF NATIONAL PROGRAMME ON IMMUNIZATION IN IKPOBA OKHA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA  <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANALYSIS OF THE UTILIZATION OF NATIONAL PROGRAMME ON IMMUNIZATION IN IKPOBA OKHA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA  ", "id": 100}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECT OF PESTICIDES DICHLORODIPHENYL TRICHLOROEYHANE (D.D.Y)<br/>AND BENZENE HEXACHRORIDE (BHC) ON THE MICROFLORA OF THE THREE TYPES OF SOIL.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The effect of pesticides, chchlorodipheny trichloroethane (DDY) and Benzene hexaxhoride (BHc) on the  microflora of the three types of soil (loamy, clay and sandy soil) was conducted. The serial dietitian technique was employed up to 10-3 using nutrient agar, potato dextrose agar and sabourand agar plates. The isolation of both bacterial and fungal organisms were made  before treating the soil types with the two pesticides), D.D.T and BHC.  and after treating the soil types with D.D.T after treating  and BHc. The highest bacterial count before treating the soil types with D.D.T and BHc was got in loamy soil with 133 per ml having  PH 7.1, followed by clay soil with 78 per ml and  least was sandy soil with 42 per ml. while the highest bacterial count  after treating the soil types with D.D.T was gotten in loamy soil 105 per ml, followed by clay soil with  51 and least count was got in sandy with 28 per ml. Also the  highest bacterial count after treatment with BHc was obtained in loamy soil with 12F per ml, followed by clay soil with 64 per ml and the least count was got from sand soil with 37 per ml. The highest bacterial isolate from all the soil types before  treatment with the two pesticides was pseudomonas with 25 per ml, followed by Bacillus SPP with   24 per ml, and  next was achnomycetes with 19 per ml  while the least bacterial organism was Rhizobrium SPP. The fungal organisms isolates were Aspergillus species, syncophatastrum species, pernicillum species and mucor species. The results of this project showed that there was reduction in microflora of the soil types after treatment separately with the two pesticides. But the effect was more with  D.D.T than with BHc. Also the effects of the two pesticides was highest in sandy soil followed by clay and lastly the loamy soil.  <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>Introduction <br/>1.2              Aims and objectives <br/>1.3              Statement of problem <br/>1.4              Hypothesis <br/>1.5              Limitation of the study <br/>CHAPTER TWO <br/>Literature review                                                                                            <br/>2.1       Pesticide labeling and safety                                                           <br/>2.2              Various classes and types of pesticides.                                         <br/>2.3              Effects of pesticide on population of invertebrates in soil         <br/>2.4              Effects of  pesticides on population of vertebrates in the soil    <br/>2.5              Effects of pesticides on population of micro organism in the soil <br/>HAPTER THREE <br/>3.0       Materials and methods                                                                                    <br/> 3.1      materials                                                                                                          <br/>3.2       Methods                                                                                                          <br/>3.2.1    Sterilization                                                                                                     <br/>3.2.2  Collection of pesticides                                                                   <br/>3.2.3    Collection of three types of soil loamy clay sandy                             <br/>3.2.4  Preparation of media                                                                             <br/>2.2.5    Playing technique                                                                                             <br/>3.2.6 Microbial count, staining and microscopic work                                   <br/>3.2.7    Identification of would                                                                                  <br/>3.2.8  Biochemical test for identification       <br/>CHAPTER FOUR <br/> Result                                                             <br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>Discussions                                                                                         <br/>CHAPTER SIX <br/>6.0       Conclusion and recommendation                                                       <br/>6.1              conclusion <br/>6.2              recommendation                                                                                             <br/>References                                                                                                               <br/>Appendix                                                                                                                    <br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>According to crupta and Daroren (2003) soil is that portion of the surface of the land which is essential for plant growth. Plant are anchored in the soil by their root, which spread in all direction and which by holding on to the soil keep the plant in position plant draw all their water and  most of their food or nutrient from the soil. Soil is therefore the source of food for plants, animals and man. Soil is of different types, sandy, clay and loamy soil. Sandy soil has or size range of 0.2 to 2mm diameter. They are free draining and do not retain any appreciable amount of soil water. It is brown loose and dry. While clay soil range in size from 0.002mm and lower and contains more than 40% of clay particles. They are sticky, plastic and  easily moldable into  shape. Another type is loamy soil which contains a fair balance of clay , silt and sand particle and it is the best  soil for agriculture, as it has a high proportion of organic matter or content soil organic malter represents on accumulation of  partially decayed and animal residues. Such material is continually being broken down as a result  of the  work of soil micro –organism consequently. It is a rather  transitory soil constituent and must be renewed constantly by the additionb of plant residues. The organic matter content of a soil is small, only 3-5 percent by weight in a representative minerals topsoil. It is a major soil source of two important mineral elements namely phosphorous and suefur and essentially the sole source of nitrogen. Through its effect on the physical condition of soil, organic matter also increase the amount of water a soil can hold and the proportion of water available for plant growth. Further more   organic matter is the main source of energy for soil microflora. Without it biochemical activity would come practically to a stand still soil organic matter consist of two groups (a) Original tissue and its partially decomposed equivalent and (b) the humus. The original tissue include the under composed roots and the tops of higher plants. The materials are subject to vigorous attack by soil organism and both plant  and animal which use them as sources of energy and tissue building material. The gelatinous, more resistant products of this decompository both the synthesized by the micro organisms and those modified from the original plant tissue are collectively known as HUMUS. This material, usually black or brown in colour is coloidal in nature. Its capacity to hold water and nutrient ions greatly exceeds that of clay, its inorganic counterpart. Small amount of humus thus augment remarkably the soil capacity to promote plant production. <br/>According to Burges and Raw (1967) loamy like clay is a product of degradation and synthesis. And the agencies responsible are the living organisms in the soil both the animal (fauna) and the plant (flora). These organism engineer a myriad of biochemical changes as decay takes place. They also physically chum the soil and help stabilize soil structure. A rast number of organism live in the soil. By far the greater proportion of these belong to plant life. Yet animal are not to be minimized especially in the early stage of organic decomposition. <br/>Edward and lofty in 1969 explain that the activities of specific group of soil organisms are commonly identified by (a) their numbers in the soil (b) their weight per unit volume or area of soil (biomass) and (c) their metabolic activity. Although the relative metabolic activities are not shown, they are generally related to biomass of the organism. As might be expected, the numbers are highest among the micro organism. So great are microflora number that they do minate the biomass in spite of the minute size of each individual organisms. The microflora monopolize the metabolic activity in soil. It is estimated that 60-80% of the total soiil metabolism is due to the microflora. <br/>They further said that some of the many naturally and artificially occuring substance have deleterious effect on the life of at least some species of organism in the soil by inhibiting the development of these species. However, there is continuing concern that these chemical substance may also adversary affect various non parasitic segment of the soil microflora. These chemical compound substance are called pesticide. Pesticides are  therefore material useful for  the control  nutigation of animals detrimental to human or economy. Algaecides, deforlant and descant herbicides plant growth  regulator and fungicide are used to regulate population of undesirable organisms which compete with or  pristine crop or namental plants. Attractant insecticides, muticides, accredits, molluscide, nematodes, repellant and rodenticide are used principally  to reduce parasitism and trasmission in domestic animals, the loss of crop plant, the destruction of processed  food textile wood products as well as parasitism and disease transmission to human. <br/>Jones (1956) and fletcher (1960) have shown the effect of different pesticide on type, number and activities. They explain that herbicide and insecticides can destroy soil micro organism or suppress their activities if applied at excessive rate. But when applied at recommended rate these chemicals reach soil concentration of  more than 2 or 3 part per million (PPm) however, some pesticide are obtained from plant and minerals, while few other are obtained by the mixed culture of micro organisms insecticides like pyrethin, cruelties and nicotine are  extracted from plant. Also toxin produced by bacillus thuringiesis are active ingredient against moth and butterfly larrac. The toxins are sometime called miracle gene”. DDt is an out standing example of insecticide and probably the most commonly used pesticide. It is known to contain remarkable properties and does not occur naturally too. Its first synthesis  was recorded in 1874 by a German research chemist called. Zeidler <br/>In the mid 60s, the  benefits steaming from the ability of DDT to control insect pest could be counter balanced by adverse effects on other element of the enriroment. Detailed reviews of properties, stability, prehistoric and impact upon all facets of the environment were carried out  with DDT and other chlorinated organic insecticides. Concern over the  undesirable effects of pesticide culminated insecticides, fungicide,nd rodenticide act (FIFRA) by public.  Law o2-516, the federal environmental  pesticide control act (FEPCA) in united state of American to prevent unreasonable environmental hazard from pesticides for general and restricted users as a function of acute toxicity Benzene hexachloride (BHC) is an organochiloride pesticide for its efficiency in the control of anthropoid pests. There is fear that BHc will probable have adverse effect on non targeted microflora  of the soil the aplastic anemia reported in individual said to have been exposed to BHC has been attributed to benzene, which causes aplastic anaemia. But BHc is based on cylohexane. Which does not cause anaemia (grawhill 1982). <br/>1.2              AIM AND OBJECTIVES <br/>i.          To determine the effect of pesticide dicblorodipheny trichloroethane (DDT) and benzene hexachloride (BHC) on the microflora of three types of soil.<br/>ii.         To isolate soil microflora from the three types of soil. <br/>Iii         To identify soil microflora of the three type of soil.<br/>iv.                To determine the type of soil that is mostly affected by pesticides. <br/>1.3              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>According to (Higa 1990) Agricultural practices can have a significant positive and negative impact on soil.

They are berries but because or their unusual structure, they are called fresperidiums. Sweet oranges originates in southern China thousands of yeast’s ago. Now they are most popular and wide spread of the citrus fruits. Citrus saneness (sweet oranges) can be grown is most parts of the tropics where than five months and where there is fairly even distribution of  rainfall  throughout the year. The  trees can be grown from seed but its more usual to buy  budded citrus sincensis from private nursery men or form official Agricultural sources. Citrus saneness  is a spreading  ever  green, some time spiny trees up to  12m  fall with ovale elliptic leaves which are commonly 7-10cm long dark green and routed at the base. They are carried on short articulated petioles with very narrow wins. The leaves are strongly scented the white sweet smelling flowers are  smaller than those of the group. The rounded fruits are up to 12cm in diameter. Deep yellow to orange or in humict climate remaining green when ripe. Sweet oranges (citrus saneness) are trotrical crops. They are also annual crops (Cobley 1976) <br/>In a typical sweet orange, the excerpt and mesa carp are leathery and protect the juicy inner tissue deceived from the endocarp from damage and desiccation. The epidermis of the fruit has a thick cuticle and varying number of stomata, the excerpt or flavedo is a layer of irregular photosynthctically active parenchyma cells which is green in young fruit and becoming orange or greenish when they nature. The mesocarp is thicker than the exocarp and consists of inter cellular space. The mesocarp is know as the albedo. It is rich in vitamin C sugar cellulose and in pectin. The mesocarp and excarp together form the bird  of the fruit. The center of the fruit is occupied by the development  carpels of the ovary which are disposed around the pithy axis in form of several closely packed segments. Each segment develops from a single carpal and is surrounded by thin, transparent endocarp or “ray” form which multi-cellular hairs grow to fill each segment. Each huge cell or pulp vesicle of these hairs fills with juice and they form the edible part of the fruit for which the crops are grown. The  seed lies on axle placenta close to the central axis and in the nature fruit is about 40- 45 percent juice 30 percent rind and 30 percent pulp and seeds which taken together consists of about  90 percent water 5-10 percent sugar 1-2  percent petunias various acids, essential oil proteins and minerals.<br/>Generally the fruit contains 80-90 percent of sugar and acids with relative proportion  varying between other species of citrus. Citric acid  is the abundant acid in the sap. Pectin in the juice gives it a  cloudy colloidal  appearance. Cilrus nsinensis contain mineral salts,  glycosides, small amount of protein and vitamin (cobley 1976) it is a good source of cirus are citrus paradisc (grape fruit) citrus limon (lemon) citrus  aurantatifolia (lime) citrus aurantinum (sour orange) citrus reticulate  (tangermie and maudanine) citrus grandis (pummelo) and citrus medical (citron) The sugar and acids vary between species. <br/>The medical potency of sweet orange (citrus smeasin) is due to its high content in vitamin  C which is believed to stimulated the production of white blood cells, primarily neutrophib, which attack foreign antigens such as bacteria and viruses.  It also boost the body’s production of antibodies and interferon, the protein that helps protect us from viral invaders and cancer cells. (Uddoh, 1998).  The importance of vitamin C from citrus fruits in prevention of scurvy was scientifically proven in 1756 by John Lind (Rudolph et al 1978)<br/>            The skin is normally an effective barrier to pathogens, but skin may be broken example by wounding, surgery or the “bites” of insects etc.  Wounds may admit any of the variety of potential pathogens capable of causing systemic disease (disease affecting the entire body) or localized disease.  Bacterial pathogens can enter via “bites” (singleton 1995).  Marmoin et al (1973) state that there are many organisms associated with wound  infections, which are, propionibacterium, Klebsiella, staphylococcus, Escherichia coli etc. superficial infection are skin pustutes, boils, carbunictes, impetize, penphigus, neonatorum, sycosis barbae, paronychia styles, blepheritis and conjunctivitis” infections of accidental and surgical wounds.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>            Most wound infections are infected by staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and other micro organisms (Bhata et al 1998) vitamin C is said to play important role in protection agaisnt bacterial and viral infection (Okaka et al 2002).  The uptake of orange juice which is rich in vitamin C stimulates the production of white blood cells premarily neutrophils which fight agiasnt bacteria and virus and speeds the healing of wound (Rudolph et al 1978).<br/>            It is therefore necessary to carryoput a research work to determine the antibacteria activity of sweet orange on S. aureus and E. coli involved in wound infections<br/>AIMS AND OBJECTIVE<br/>1.                  To determine the antibacterial effect of orange juice (citurs sinensis) on staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli isolated from wound infection.<br/>2.                  To determine the antimicrotial sensistivity pattern of isolated involved<br/>HYPOTEHSES<br/>HO      -           Orange (citrus sinensis) has antibacterial effect on S. aureus and E.

Hepatitis was described in the Babylonian Talmud in the fifty century BC, and was referred to by Hippocratic over 2000 years ago. Despite this ancient knowledge, it was not until 1963, that the first human Repetitious virus was isolated, Hepatitis B. This was followed quickly by the purification of Hepatitis A in 1973, and more recently by the isolation of viruses C, D, E and G. These viruses are known to infect the human liver (Anderson et al; 2001).<br/>However, there are more than twenty other viruses, which infect the human liver. These are not considered “Repatitis viruses” as these other viruses tend to infect organs other than the liver more seriously’. These include common viruses such as Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Mumps, Rubella, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as well as rare ones such as Rassa fever and yellow fever viruses.<br/>Any infection that results in inflammation of the liver is called Repatitis (Greek Repaticus, liver). Incidentally, not all “hepatitis” is caused by viruses. “HEPATITIS” means “inflammation of the liver”, and can be caused also by other types of infection (bacteria fungi etc); toxic drugs; poisons; alcoholism and so on (Drexott etal; 2005).<br/>But of interest is one Repatitis virus – one of the most common infections diseases, causing an estimated 1.5millon deaths world wide each year – Hepatitis B. Hepatitis B is caused by the Repatitis B virus (HBV), a double – stranded circular DNA virus of complex structure. Hbv is class ivied as an orthoropadnavirus within the family hepadnaviridae. HBV was originally recognized as the age responsible or serum Repatitis the most common form of partially transmitted viral Repatitis and an import cause of acute and chronic infection of the liver. This why hepatitis b is some times called seum Repatitis. The virus was formerly and anilines referred to as Australian antigen. The reason being that it was first isolated room the blood of an Australian aborogie and is associated with HBV. (procott et al 2005.<br/>Hepatitis B remain one of the major cause of human suffering in the world despite a through understanding of its transmission and prevention. Serum form undivided infected with hepatitis B contains three district antigen  particles: a spherical 22nm particle, a 42 nm  spherical particle ( counting DNA  and DNA polymer able) called  the Dane particle, and tubular or filamentous particles that vary in length. The small spherical and tubular particles  are the unassembled component of the Dane particle- the infective form of the virus. The unassembled particles. Contain hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) whose presence in the blood is (a) an indicator of Repatitis B infection (b) the basis for the large scale screening of blood for the hepatitis B virus, and (c) the basis for the first vaccine for human use developed by recombinant DNA technology (Evans, 1997 <br/>The Hepatitis B virus is normally transmitted through blood transfusion, contaminated equipment, drug users unsterile needles, or any body secretion (saliva, soren, sweat, breast milk, urine)  The virus also can pass from the blood of an infected mother through the placenta to infect  the fetus. Each year an estimated 200, 000 people in Nigeria are infected with Australian Antigen (HBV) about 1000 person die yearly from hepatitis related cirrhosis and about 5000 die from HBV related liver cancer. (HBV is second only to tobacco as a known cause of rumen cancer). Worldwide, HBV infects over 200 million people (Schlesinger &amp; Schlesinger, 2001). The clinccal signs of Repatitis B vary widely, most cases are symptomless. However, sometime fever, loss of appetite, abominal discomfort, nausea, fatigue, and other symptoms gradually appear following an incubation period of 1 to 3 months. The virus infects liver Hepatic cells and causes liver tissue degeneration and the release of liver associated enzymes (transaminases) into the blood team. This is followed by jaundice, the accumulation of bilirubin (a breakdown product of raemoglobin in the skin and other tissue with a resulting yellow appears. The distinctive yellow jaundice the Hepatitis B usually imparts to its victims  skin has  made it an rasity detectable disease through recorded history. Frequently, acute hepatitis B in anicteric and symptomatic, although acute liver failure may develop. The virus persists in about 10 percent of infected immouno compent adults, and in as many 90 percent of infants infect peninatally depending on the ethnic group of the mother. About 350 million people worldwide are persistent carries of hepatitis B. actually one in twenty infection results in chronic hepatitis, defined as persistent hepatitis virus six mouths after the onset of the acute illness. Chronic HBV infection can be entirely begin with normal liver blood tests (“Chronic Carrier State”) or may be an aggressive inflammatory process (“Chronic active hepatitis”), which can lead to severe scarring (“Cirrhosis).<br/>Approximately 25 percent of all patients with chronic hepatitis will progress to cirrhosis and about 20 percent of those with cirrhosis will develop hepatocellular carcinoma. That is to say, the risk of liver cancer (hepatoma) is high in cirrhosis caused by HBV. <br/>Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common cancers worldwide (Seeger &amp; manor; 2000)<br/>During the first phase of chronicity, virus replication continues in the liver and replicative intermediates of the viral genome may be detected in DNA extracted from liver hiopsies. Makers of virus replication in serum include HBVDNA (this indicated virus presence and activity), DNA polymerize (determines the presence of HBVDNA in liver cell, and a soluble antigen, hepatition.be antigen (HbeAG), which is secreted by productively infected hepatocytes. In those infected at a very going age this phase may persist for life but, more usually, virus levels decline over time. Eventually, in most individuals, there is immune clearance of infected hepatocytes associated with seroconverision low replication, the viral senome may integrate into the chromosomal DNA of some hepatocytes and these cells may persist and expand closely. Rarely , seroconversion to anti-HBs follows clearance of virus replication but, more frequently, HBSAg persists during a second phase of chronicity  as a result of the expression of integrated viral DNA.    <br/> VIRAL REPLICATION <br/> With respect to replication of the HBV, the fundamental  process of viral infection is the expression of the viral replication cycle in a rost cell. The steps for the infection process involving HBV usually include the following:<br/>Enter a host <br/>-          contact and enter susceptible cell.<br/>-          Replicate within the cell.<br/>-          Sprea d to adjacent cells.<br/>-          Cause cellular injury. <br/>-          Engender a host immune response<br/>-          Be either cleared from the body of the host, establish a presistnt infection , or kill the host. <br/>-          Be shed  back into the environment (prexote it al; 2005).<br/>VIRAL SPREAD             <br/>Mechanisms of viral spread very, but the most roates include bloodstream. The presence of viruses in the  blood is called VIREAMA&gt;HBV is spread through blood, body secretion, needles, placenta as well as sexually. This os to say that transmission as through parental routes. Therefore, transmission of HBV can occur from  person to person as  a result of transfer of blood by any prouder which breaks the skin or mucous members HBV spread mainly parentally, in most cases seen in adults , HBs (Australian Antigen) has been identified in almost every body fluid f infected persons- saliva tears semen, cerebrospinal fluid, ascetic fluid, breast milk synovial fluid, gastric juice, urine and rarely in faces. This disease is, therefore, a major occupational hazard of medical personnel. It is commonly  seen in people  who receive multiple blood transfusion or blood product intravenous drug abusers, homosexuals and the sexually promiscuous. <br/>1.2        PURPOSE OF STUDY <br/>The need for study can never be over emphases having considered the above, this study serves the following purpose  or objectives. <br/>1.                  To  obtain a general view of the group of individual affected whether children or adults. <br/>2.                  To show circumstances which dispose to viral hepatitis and suggest means of reducing the incidence. <br/>3.                  To review the management of these patients with regards to vestigation done and treatment. <br/>4.                  To understand the complex or exorbitant nature of the structure of the hepatitis B virus as well as the debilitating effect it has on the patient <br/>5.                  Also compare and contrast primary data from this study with secondary from the library <br/>6.                  To how rate of progression to chronicity as well as make known the daily activities that will not result in contacting HBV.<br/>1.3        SIGNIFIGANCE OF STUDY <br/>This study done to known the existence or widespread of this disease among patience in Nation Orthopedic Hospital Enugu. Or to understand and show the prevalent Hospital in question .the significance of this study can never be over emphasicum this is because in developing countries such as HBV is indisputable essential in the life of that country especially in their hospitals. Many children are infected by hepatitis B virus at on early age a significant portion of apparently healthy individual are chronic carriers of HBsAg, that is the Australia Antign. The significance of this study is seen in the light of having a better knowledge and understanding or better still widening our scope of the chronically and pathogenically of HBV.<br/>4.1              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>A study of this nature surely must have problem which result in it. Hepatitis B is a viral disease that is spread through all  body fluids, that is to say that one can contact this disease by exchange to body fluid with    infected person.  Looking at our society and hospital there are cases where by  unscreened blood is transfixed to a patient case of multiple sex  partner people having unprotected sex, making use of sharp objects without any care. All these dispose to viral hepatitis B. and gives risk to a study of such .<br/>1.5              HYPOTHESIS <br/>H0        Hepatitis B is prevalent among patients in National Orthopedic Hospital Enugu. <br/>H1          Hepatitis B is not prevalent among patients in National Orthopedic Hospital Enugu. <br/>  <br/>\n\nPREVALENCE STUDY OF HEPATITIS B \r\n(AUSTRALIAN ANTIGEN) AMONG PATIENTS IN NATIONAL ORTHOPAEDIC HOSPITAL ENUGU. \r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PREVALENCE STUDY OF HEPATITIS B \r\n(AUSTRALIAN ANTIGEN) AMONG PATIENTS IN NATIONAL ORTHOPAEDIC HOSPITAL ENUGU. \r\n", "id": 103}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF BACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH SELECTED PASTEURIZED DRY MIL POWER<br/>ABSTRACT </b><br/>The bacteria quality of four (4) commercially available dry sachet milk powder (peak, cowbell, Blue boat and Nunu) were analysed in this study usinf the pour plate method. The result showed that peak, cowbell and blue boat were free of all forms of bacteria which Bacillus and Lactobacillus species were isolated from the Nunu brand. Although the microbial count was low, the fact remains that their presence in the product would certainly compromise it shelf life and there by constituting an health hazard especially to children and lactase intolerance people. In view of this result , there is need for the manufacturers to tighten in –process quality control checks and for government food regulatory agencies such as National Agency for food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFSAC) to carry out routine checks from time to time on these milk producing companies to ensure consumer safety standards are not compromised.<br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>1.0     INTRODUCTION <br/>milk is nearly white liquid secreted by the mammary glands of female mammals for nourishinf their young ones. Milk contains all the nutrients needed for foods of the adult mammal. Several kinds of mammals are raised to produce milk for human consumption. Of these, daily cattle are of greatest commercial importance, but milk is also obtained from water buffalo, goats, sheep, Camel, reindeer, mares and other mammals (Harper and Hill, 1986).<br/> Milk is a natural source of energy and natural scource of fifteen essential nutrients. Besides these nutrients, milk also co ntian compounds that have been found to be anti-carcinogen, such as conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and butyric acid. It is essential therefore to understand the make –up of this extraordinary, wholesome and safe source of goodness that provides so many health giving factors. It is important to remember that the consumption of milk varies according to the type and bread of animal, its state of health and  the diet on which it is reared.<br/>Milk<br/>Milk is unique nutritious and a major source of protein and calcium. Milk powder (dry milk) is a powder-like food product received by means of drying previously condensed milk. Powdered milk has a far longer shelf than liquid milk and does need to be refrigerated due to its low moisture content. It is less expensive and easier to store than fresh milt, but ha a disadvantage is that it never tastes quite like the real thing. Powdered milk was first made in 1802 by Russian doctor Osip Krichevsky. It is found abundantly in many developing countries because of reduced transport and storage cost (as it does not require refrigeration) like other dry foods. It is considered non- perishable and is favoured by survivalist, hikers and other people in need of nonperishable easy to prepare food stuff.<br/> Powdered milk is often used in baking, in recipes where adding liquid milk would render the product too thin to be used. It is a common sight in UN food aid supplies, fallout shelter, warehouses and wherever fresh milk is not a viable option. Powdered milk is also used in western blosts as a blocking agent to prevent non-specific protein interactions<br/>T<br/>The body needs Vitamin D to absorb calcium. Good sources of vitamin are sunshine, Cod liver Oil, Multivitamins, liver and ofcourse milk.<br/> Milk drawn from a healthy animal already contains some bacteria. Most of the changes which take place in the flavour and appearance of milk, after it is drawn from udder and the resultd of the activities of microbes. The favourable microbes bring favourable changes in flavour and appearance and are carefully propagated while the pathogenic (Unfavourable) which may cause diseases are destroyed to make the milk and its products safe for human consumption. The following are the important microbes found in milk.<br/>(a)      Bacteria – These are microscope, Unicellular organisms which occur inform of spherical, cylindrical or spiral cells. The size ranges from I to 5N. spore forming bacteria post problem in dairy industry because of its resistance to pasteurization and sanitation procedures. The greater the bacteriological count in milk, the lower its quality.<br/>(b)     Moulds- These are multi-cellular organisms, at maturity are as mycelium and is useful in cheese making. It is responsible for defect in butter and other milk products.<br/>©       Yeasts- Unicellular organisms that are larger than bacteria.<br/>(d)     Viruses – these are ultra-microscopic forms of organisms.<br/> Bacteria inevitable enter milk during milking (production) and handling. They multiply depending on the storage time and condition. Milking is normally followed immediately by cooling to retard bacterial growth. The changes that take place in the physio-chemical properties of milk are as result of the activities of individual microbial cells during their period of growth and reproduction or substances produced during such activity.<br/> Product of microbial growth in milk are enzymes, decomposition products (fats, protein, sugars), pigments toxins, miscellaneous changes (cousins, 1982).<br/> Biochemical changes in foods when perceived as undesirable are called spoilage. Sour milk is examples of food considered spoiled as a result of microbial growth. The souring of milk however, involes microbial processes analogous to those that cause agreeable acidic flavour of sour cream<br/> Raw milk is pasteurized to destroy potentially harmful bacteria it may contain and to disable certain natural enzymes. It also increases the shelf life of milk pasteurization involved the heating of raw milk to 1450F for 30munites or heating it to 1610F for 15munites. During this process, the pathogenic bacteria will be killed while the non pathogenic will survive. The pasteurized milk Is then rapidly cooled to 380F. pasteurization has negligible effect on the taste and nutritive characteristics of milk.<br/>1.1        AIMS OF THE STUDY <br/>The aim of the study is to<br/>1.       Acquaint the individuals and public with precise information and techniques commonly used to assess the bacteria that is associated with pasteurized dry milk power.<br/>2.       Determine the microbial load of pasteurized dry milk powder.<br/>1.2STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>milk drawn from a health animal already contains some bacteria. After pasteurization, the milk is considered safe for consumption. However, during package process, there may be contamination through handling and preservation of the products and this can leads to change in flavour and appearance of the milk due to the activities of the microbes. It is therefore necessary to acknowledge and understand the possibility of assessing the bacteria that is associated with pasteurized dry milk powder.<br/>1.2        SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>To determine the level of bacterial contamination of dry milk powder in sachet packages in view of the fact that they have been pasteurized and are supposed to be sterile.<br/>    <br/>\n\nISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF BACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH SELECTED PASTEURIZED DRY MIL POWER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF BACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH SELECTED PASTEURIZED DRY MIL POWER", "id": 104}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>INVESTIGATE THE MICROBIAL CONTENT OF SOME BOLTED SOFT DRIVELS SOLD IN ENUGU INTERLOPES<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This work was done in order to investigate the microbial content of some bolted soft drivels sold in Enugu interlopes.

The food and drug administration standard of identity for carbonated soft drink define them as a class of beverage made by absorbing carbodiocide in potable water. The amount of carbonhdioxide used is not less than that which well be absorbed by the beverage at a pressure of one atmosphere and a temperature of 60F. these drinks contain no alcohol, or only such alcohol (not in excess of 0.5% by weight of the finished beverage) as is contributed by the flavoring ingredient that may be use in  carbonated soft drinks in such properties are reasonable required to accomplish their intruded effects. These include nutritive sweeteners flavoring ingredient natural and antificial colour additive acidifying agent buffering agent emulsifying stabilizing or viscosity producing agent foaming agent caffeine and chemical preservatives the beginning of the carbonated beverage (soft) drinks) as recorded by Resrosier (1977) date back to the closing years of the eighteen (18th ) century <br/>Morris (1959) defined micro organisms as plant or animal organisms of microscopic or submicroscopic dimensions. Plant microorganisms are generally classified into three major groups, namely fungi bacteria and   Algae as for as beverage manfacture is concerned the fungi are the most important group of spoilage organisms because yeast and mould belong to this group. The protozoa are the most important  of the animal microorganisms. <br/>Actually individual microorganisms are microscopic in size they can form colonies clouds precipitates sediments and scums with time and these are visible to the naked eyes and are the direct signs of the presence of microorganisms.<br/>The microbiological safety and ratability of the diverse type of soft drinks products depend on their formulation (including) the use of chemical preservative carbonation low PH values and pasteurization) this was stated by ganglion (1982). Batchelor (1985) put it that the inter related environmental factors that determine the microbial load of  product or the susceptibility of a product to microbial spoilage are intrinsic and Extrinsic factors. <br/>Intrinsic factor are derived from the product and its formulation according to pauezai comments they are not easy to change Extrinsic factor are variable introduced during processing packaging distribution and storage. They should be easier to change and control. Girighano further  recorded that control should be by application of the air Hazard Analysis critical Control point (HACCP) system to raw material formulating processing condition and packaging examples of such control would be :<br/>a.                   Measurement of temperature during heat treatment of pasteurized product <br/>b.                  Measurement of carbonation level by routine monvtorning of carbendioxide pressures in carbonated products <br/>c.                   Measurement of pH water activity product viscosity and preservatives in combination with other formulation parameters <br/>d.                  Maintenance of good hygienic practice to prevent the building up of spoilage organisms on the plant equipment and in the production areas. <br/>Most microbiological problem arise because of poor quality of raw material (eg fruit concentrates sugar and syrup) poor processing hygiene packaging material and storage condition and these lead to over coming of the preservation system applied drinking  manufactures  or production of the beverages (soft drinks) by the micro organisms. <br/>JUSTIFICATION<br/>Soft drink are consumed in large quantities by the massed both male and female cutting across different age group adult and children of different classes of people all oven the state. This is aided by the general availability of these drinks almost every place where people gather for work or recreational activities so it is necessary to let the people taking this soft drinks know the consequences of leaving their drink open there by allowing some microorganisms which grow in the presence of air (acropea or acrophile organisms) to gain their way into the drink. Also for then to know the implicated organism in the soft drink thereby    helping them to reduce their soft drink intake.<br/>AIM AND OBJECTIVES<br/>Aim and objective of this project is to investigation the microbial content of bottled soft drinks by:<br/>i.                    Isolating the microorganisms present in them <br/>ii.                  Identify and characterize the microorganisms present <br/>HYPOTHESES: <br/>H0 Yeast and would are the only organisms implicated and identified in the microbiological charateristion of the three brand of soft drinks. <br/>H1 Yeast and mould are the only organisms implicated and identified in the microbiological characterization of the three brand of soft drink, bacteria were also implicated and identified. <br/>  <br/>\n\nINVESTIGATE THE MICROBIAL CONTENT OF SOME BOLTED SOFT DRIVELS SOLD IN ENUGU INTERLOPES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INVESTIGATE THE MICROBIAL CONTENT OF SOME BOLTED SOFT DRIVELS SOLD IN ENUGU INTERLOPES", "id": 105}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>BACTERIAL CONTAMINATS ASSOCIATED WITH COMMERCIAL POULTRY FEED FROM THREE DIFFERENT COMPANIES<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            The bacterial contaminants associated with commercial poultry feeds from three companies in Nigeria (vital, Guinea and Top) were studied using streak plate techniques.  The culture media used were Nutrient agar and Mac Cokey agar.  The aim/ objective of the study is: To ascertain the microbial safety of commercial poultry feeds produced by companies.  To isolate microorgaisms that are contaminants of poultry feeds, to identify the bacterial types and to determine the microbial load of poultry feed.  The microbial mean count was highest in vital feed as 166 per ml with pH 7.80, followed by Guinea feed having mean count of 153 per ml with pH 6-46 and the least microbial mean count was got in Top feed, having 105 per ml withpH 6.00. The study revealed Staphylococcus aureus as the msot predominant bacterial organism with 52cfn (33%) followed by salmonella typhin with 48cfu (30%), The next bacterial organism isolated was Bacillus cereus with 40cfn (25%) and the least was Pseudomonas aeruginosa with 18cfu (12%).  Also vital feed had the highest isolation of stapohylococcus aureus, as 60cfu per ml followed by Guinea feed having 57 cfu per ml and least isolation was obtained from top feed as 40cfu per ml. While the highest isolation of salmonella tipphi was obtained also from vital feed as 57cfu per ml, followed by Guinea feed with 50cfu per ml.  The highest6 isolation of Bacillus cereus was still from vital feed as 50 cfu per ml, followed by Guinea feed as 43cfu per ml and least in Top feed with 28cfu per ml.  The highest isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was from vital feed with 25cfu per ml, followed by Guinea feed with 19cfu per ml while least isolation was from top feed as 10 cfu per ml.  The results showed that the poultry feeds in general had bacterial contaminants.  But the microbial load was minimal increasing with decrease in acidity (i.e. high pH).<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE                                                                                          <br/>Introduction                                                                                                    <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Literature review                     <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0       Materials and method                                                             <br/>3.1       Materials                                                                                 <br/>3.2       Methods                                                                                              <br/>3.2.1    Sterilization                                                                                           <br/>3.2.2    Source of samples                                                                               <br/>3.2.3    Preparation of culture media                                                   <br/>3.2.4    Determination of pH                                                   <br/>3.2.5    Plating Technique                                                                   <br/>3.2.6    Bacteria count, Gram staining and Microsoft work               <br/>3.2.7    Biochemical test for identification                                         <br/>i.                    Indole test                                                                                           <br/>ii.                  Methyle Red Test                                                                               <br/>iii.                Voges – Proskaver test                                                                       <br/>iv.                Oxidase test                                                                                        <br/>v.                  Citrate utilization test                                                             <br/>vi.                Hydrogen sulphate production/sugar fermentation                <br/>vii.              Motility test    <br/>  CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.0       RESULTS                                                                                           <br/>4.1              Table 1                                                                                                <br/>4.2              Table 2                                                                                                <br/>4.3              Table 3                                                                                                <br/>4.4              Table 4                                                                                                <br/>4.5              Table 5                                                                                                <br/>4.6              Table 6                                                                                                <br/>4.7              Table 7                        <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>Discussion                                                                   <br/>CHAPTER SIX<br/>Conclusion and Recommendations                                                    <br/>Reference                                                                                                        <br/>Appendix                                                                                            <br/>                                                                        CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION                <br/>            Poultry are collection of birds raised commercially or domestically for meat, egg and feathers.  Chickens, ducks turkeys and geese are of primary importance while guinea fowl and squabs (pigeons) are chiefly of local interest.  These birds are source of income and food to the rarer.  In the past only hens that could no longer produce eggs were killed and sold for meat but by the mid-20th century, meat production had outstripped egg. Production as a specialized industry (Encycloparredia Britaimca, 1988).  Heavy breed poultry animals are used for meat white light bread chickens are primarily for the production of eggs (Mc Graw Hill encydopaedia 1992).  The meat and eggs produced from poultry are important sources of dietary portion.  In Africa, animal protein foods from all sources contribute between 7g and 15g daily per person to the total food intake (Oyenyga, 1974).  Today, Poultry production in the country is increasing at a tremendous rate and yet cannot meet the demand because of population growth and the awareness created by the campaigns for the need of animal protein in the diet.<br/>            The growth and well-being of organisms are to a large extent dependent on the mount and type of food they receive and the manner or rate at which they receive it.  The food should contain nutrients such    as water, carbohydrates, fats, protein, minerals, vitamins and added growth factors improper balance.  Each of these nutrients has a major role to play concerning growth, maintenance and productivity of the poultry.  According to Leonard 91981), nutritional deficiency or inbalance.  These diseases may include rickets, perosis, and nutritional roup, curly             the paralysis etc.  These diseases could result due to deficiency in vitamins D, Manganese, vitamin A, vitamin E and riboflavin.  Improper sanitation and inadequate management play major roles in disease.  Outbreak and productivity of the desired products.  In developing countries like Nigeria, the cost of feeding, especially the monogastries continues to escalate primarily in response the soaring cost of the conventional feed ingredients.  This phenomenon is precipitated by under production and importation of some food stuff coupled with the competition between man and farm animal for  energy and protein concentrates.<br/>            The use of agro-industrial by-products towards reducing food cost has been widely recognized (EshieH and Ademosun, 1981; Atteh and Oloagbenla, 1993). Chicken and turkeys satisfy their energy needs provided the ration a allows them to do so (Church, 1988).  The are of course exceptional to this rule particularly where heavy breed layers are concerned, when birds have a tendency to over-eat.  Where this is a problem, it is general practice to subject the birds to some degree of food restriction during the growing  and production periods. The major ingredients that are integral parts of poultry rations at the present time in the USA are corn, as the primary source of energy and soybean meal as the major protein supplement (Roland et  al     1972), while in Nigeria, Udedibie et al (1988) and Nwokon (1993) produced poultry offal meal (P.O.M) and chicken offal meal (COM) respectively from waste product similar to poultry visceral Offal (PVO) according to these authors POM has been used to replace ground nut cake in layer and broiler finisher diets and COM has been used along with  fish meat and blood meat as sources of methodize and lysine in the starter diets of lockerels.  These major ingredients, usually available in plentiful supply, allow rapid growth or high egg production with very efficient conversion.  However, corn-soy rations are deficient in some nutrients for chickens and these nutrients are normally supplied by other poultry meal.<br/>            There are different  types of feeds given to poultry brids depending on the purpose.  These different types of feeds given to poultry birds depending on the purpose.  These different types are the breeders’ starters, growers’ and layer’ feeds.  The percentage of each ingredient in the feed varies depending on the type of feed.  The ingredient include ground yellow corn, ground oats or barley, Alfata meat, Fish meal, Oystershell, managised salt, vitamin A, vitamin D, and coccidiostat (which is given in form and at the level recommended by the manufacturer). The different percentage of each ingredient varies depending on the kind of feed for example, ground yellow corn in starter and grower feed is 25% and 22% in breeder and layer feeds. There could be the same percentage of a particular ingredient in different feeds as in the case of a alfafa meal which constitutes 10% inall the feed types.  Some ingredients could be absent in a particular feed but present in the others as in the case of riboflavin supplement which is absent in starter feed and present at the levels of 2 and 5% in rower, layer and breeder feeds respectively.<br/>            To maintain healthy birds, the feeds are kept fresh as much as possible at all times.  The amount of feed in feeders are limited to the extent necessary to avoid wastage.  It is a good practice to fill hanging feeders – only three quarter full, and trough feeders only two third full (Graham, 1977). Checking the weight of the birds and its feed consumption is very necessary.  A drop in feed intake usually is the first indication of trouble, a disease outbreak, molt, stress or poor management (Graham, 1977).  Most poultry feed are prepared in dehydrated forms and because of this, there is the need to store them properly  to avoid moisture uptake and damage by heat.  In this way,. They can remain safe for a considerable period of time without loosing their safeness and value.  The feed should be stored in a suitable place where it will not be attacked by microorganisms, insects, rodents, etc.  Air tight storage is not advisable because offensive odour might result when there is obstruction of out flow and inflow of air (Leonard, 1981).  High temperature and oxidation destroy certain vitamins, therefore, care must be taken in the  preservation and storage of feeds to protect the vitamins they contain (Mc Graw – Hill encyclopaedia 1992). The condition of feed storage and handling could be a source of contamination.  When feeds are unhysgenically handled and stored, there could be a buildup of microbial contaminants.<br/>            Poultry have been found to be susceptible to infection due to certain microorganisms and man may be secondarily infected through heavy contaminated food such as poultry meat and eggs (Gorden and Tucker, 1965, Hall, 1977, and  Barrell, 1982).  Micro-organism that may contaminate feed include the following general another disease caused by salmonella infections is paratyphoid.  Paratyphoid is an infection disease of chi, Entherobacter,  Escherichia,  Protens, Pseudomonas, staphylococcus, salmonella, shigella, providencia, serratia, Klebsiella, streptococcus, clostridium, Aspergillus and Erysiphelothrie (Leonard, 1981). Typically, in some countries, about 50% of all outbreaks of salmonellosis in man are caused by infections derived from these sources and the incidence of salmonella in poultry carcasses has, in certain cases been found to be 7% or more (Van schothorst Notermans, 1980).  Okongi (1984) examined poultry feed and found that salmonella was present in the sample.  Another disease caused by salmonella infections is paratyphoid, Paratyphoid is an infections disease of chicken, turkeys, ducks and other birds.  Bofulism another kind of disease occurs in both young and adult poultry birds.  It is caused by a bacterium, Clostridium Botulinum. This organism grows in decaying plants and animals materials. Birds feeding material containing the toxins produced by the bacteria lose control of their neck muscle (Leonard, 1981).<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY:<br/>The objective of this study is to ascertain the microbial safety of commercial poultry feeds produced by companies.<br/> AIMS OF THE STUDY<br/>i.                    To isolate micro-organisms that are contaminants of poultry feeds.<br/>ii.                  To identify the bacterial types <br/>iii.                To determine the microbial load of poultry feed.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>            Poultry feed is known to contain salmonella, and other microorganisms are also implicated in poultry feeds, (Klinger and Ladidot, 1993).  It is therefore pertinent to carry out microbiological examination of commercially prepared poultry feeds to ascertain their safety to livestock.<br/>HYPOTHESIS<br/>HO:-    Poultry feeds are associated with bacterial contaminants<br/>H1:-     Poultry feeds are not associated with bacterial contaminants<br/> <br/>HII:-    Poultry feeds do not have enough bacterial contaminants to cause infection in poultry<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            As the end of the project work, the results will be a guide to the  microbiological safety or otherwise of the commercially prepared poultry feeds.<br/>    <br/>\n\nBACTERIAL CONTAMINATS ASSOCIATED WITH COMMERCIAL POULTRY FEED FROM THREE DIFFERENT COMPANIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " BACTERIAL CONTAMINATS ASSOCIATED WITH COMMERCIAL POULTRY FEED FROM THREE DIFFERENT COMPANIES", "id": 106}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE PREVALENCE OF TRICHOMONA VAGINALIS AMONG ADULTS IN “OSUMENYI” IN NNEWI SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA ANAMBRA STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            The prevalence of Trichomonas  Vaginalis among adult in “Osumenyi” in Nnewi south local government Area of Anambra state was carried out.  This was done using a stotal of one hundred adults from there different clinics viz ;- Health center, family planning and Antenatal Clinic in Osumenyi;

Trichomonas vaginalis is a pear-shaped, flagellaatic, motile protogoa, with an undulating membrance.  It is about 10-20 Hm wide, and oxide. The organism is propelled by four anterior flagella with a  flagellium attached to an undulating membrance (Heine, 1993).  I. Vaginalis is a eukaryrote, anaeobic and does not  contain mitochoria in its cytop[lasm but instead contains specialized granules called hydrogenosomes throguh out the region of the cytoplasm with a slender posteriorly protruding regid rod called axostyle (Nester, est el, 2001 and Rultyle, 1983).  I. Vaginalis exist only as a trophozoile and do not take o a cyst from (Lossick, 1990).  Due to the organism’s unique energy metabolism,s the organism bears a strong resemblance to anaerobic bacteria (Petriu, 1998).  In wet mount preparation of vaginal secretions, the live organism can often be recognised by its unmistakably swaying motion (Nester et al, 2001).  I. Vaginalis grows best under anearobic conditions and at elevated PH levels.  Masimum growth and metabolic functions are greatest at PH of 6.0 (Spence, 1992) In accord with its anaerobic state, sthese interesting cytoplasmic double –bounded organelles (hydrogenosomes) remove the carboxyl group (CooH) from pyruvate and trasnfer electrons to hydrogen gas (Nester et al, 2001).  I. Vaginalis derives its glucose into oseccinate, acelate, malate, and hydrogen.  In addition it produces some carbondioxide but nost via the kreb cycle pathway (Dyall and Johnson, 2000).<br/>            I. vaginalis causes sexually transmitted inecxtion (STI) called Trichomoniasis.  This infection is the most common nonviral sexually transmistted disease in the world.  Trichomoniasis, sometimes referred to as “Trich” is primarily an infection of the urogenital tract,. Which infects both men and women.  The urethra is the most common site for I. Vaginalis infection in men.  The organism can aslo be detected in the epididymis, semen and urine (Krieger, 1981). I. Vaginalis was first located in prostatie secretions from husbands of infected women (Drummond, 1936).  In women, vagina is the most, common site of the infection the organism may be isolated from the cervix, vagina, bartholins glands, bladder and occasionally.  The upper sreproductive / urinary tract (Reing, 1990).  Over 95% of infections have been isolated from vagina and only 5% from the urinaryu tract of adult women (Grys, 1964) the urethra and skene’s glands are infected in 90% of cases.  There have also been instances where organisms were isolated from bladder urine (Thoniason, 1989).  Infected men are usually asymsptomatic carriers of the organisms (Krieger, 1995) which most symptomatic I.Vaginalis infection occur in women (Wolner- Hanssen, 1989).  It ranks third after bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis among the diseases that commonly cause vaginal symptoms (Nester, et al, 2001).  According to World Health Organisation’s annual, estimates, There are an estimated 7.4 million trichomoniasis cases each year in the united states, with over 180 million cases reported world wide  (Weinstock et al, 2004).  WHO in 1999 states that the infection rates have been reported by some researchers to be as high as 67% in Monogolia in 1988 (Schwebke, et al, of 40 – 60% in Africa and 40% in indigenous Australians.  Trichomoniasis rates are also high in inner city populations in the united states.  I . vaginal is was originally considered a commensal until in the 1950s when the understanding of its role as a sexually transmitted infection began to involve (Swygard, et al, 2004).  Trichomoniasis often leads to vaginitis, an acute inflammatrory disease of genital mucosa.<br/>            This infection is associated with preterm delivery, low birth weight and increase in infant mortality.  It also pre-disposes individuas to HIV/AIDS and cervical cancer (Cohen, 2000 and Upcroft and Upcroft, 2001).  Among both women and men, I. Vaginalis is emerging as one o the most important factors in transmission and acquisition of HIV infection (Sorvillo, 1998).  In women, the health complications include increased  risks for the following, infertility, development of a typical pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infection following gynecologic suggery and cervical inflammatory neoplasia.  There have also been high rates of correlation between trichonioniasis and pregnancy complication in women (Cotch, 1997). In men, I vaginals has been linked to main factor in infertility and as a common cause of non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) in men (Sch webke 2002, and soper, 2004).  Minkoff, et al (1984) identified a strong association between I vaginalis infection and prefern rupture of membrane.  Several studies have showns I. Vaginalis to be a rish factor for tubal infertility (El-Shazly, 2001).  Sorvillo (1998) states that I.Vaginalis may amplify HIV – I transmission by increasing subceptibity in an HIV-1 negative person and the infectiousness in an HIV-1positive patient. He further stats that I. Vafinalis is emerging as one of the most important cofactor in  amplifying HIV transmission particularly in African American Communities in the united state (Sorvillo, 2001).  The association of trichomoniasis with HIV amplification is seen among men as well (Hobbs, 1999).  I. Vaginalis has a significantly increased incidence of HIV transmission (Jackson, et al, 1998). I vaginalis elicits an aggressive local cellular immune response with a heavy influx of target cells in HIV. This response may increase a seronegative individual. Conversely in an HIV-seropisitive individual, punctuate haemorrhages,  That are frequently associated wit I vaginalis infection, increased shedding and subsequent transmission of the virus (Cohen, et al, 1997).<br/>            In women, the infection is often characterised by vaginal i.e a thin foamy yellow – green, frothy vaginal discharge, vaginal odour, sometimes macodoros, pains with sexual intercourse, pain with urination and vulvovaginal sorness (Itching) (Rein, 1990, and Nester et al, 2001). (Common clinical signs include vulva erythema, inflammation excess of white blood cells seen on a wet mount preparation of vaginal discharge, numerous polymorphonuclear nuetrophils (Similar in size with Trichomonads) and occasional red blood cell (Rein, 1980), motile trichomonads in the wet mount preparation and a vaginal PH above 5.0, most of which overlap with Baterial vaginosis (Rein, 1984, and Wolner-Hassen, 1989).  The wall of the vagina and vulvu are diffusely red and slightly swollen (Nester et al, 2001). I vaginalis infection is a persistant disease of genitourinary tract, characterised with foul odour, serve cases, puncstuate or scattered pinpoint haemorrhagos are present.  It may also cause preumonies bronchitis (public Health Agency of Canada. (PHAC) 2001, and MC Laren, et al, 1983).  These symptoms usually appear within four to twenty days of exposure.  In men, the infection is more difficult to detect as the majority of infections remain a symptomatic and readily available diagnotic techniques are inadequate this is problematic since long tewrm carriage of I vaginalis in a symptomatic men have been documented up to 4 months (Kreiger, 1993).  Most men seeking treatment do so because of htier infected partners (Hager, 1994).  Up to 50% males are usally a symptomatic with the organism persisting in their prostate gland or seminal vesicles (Krieger, 1995).  Symptoms in men typically include Urethral discharge, dysuria, mild prurities licting burning after intercourse (Kreiger 1995, and Latif, 1987).  These may casue Urethritis, prostatis, reversible sterility and semen PH is 78.1 – 8.0 (Gopalkrishnan, 1990).  This changes have been attributed to the mechanical trauma by the moving protozoa, but toxins or exotoxins have not be ruled out by the organism.  The  frothy discharge is probably due to gas produced by the organism (Nester, et al, 2001).<br/>            The life cycle of I. Vaginalis is still poorly understood.  The trophozoite lives in close association with the epithelia of the urogenital tract (Latif et al, 1987) and reproduces by longitudinal binary fission (Nester et al. 2001). I vaginalis is distributed world wide as a human parasite and has no other reserviors (Nester et al, 2001) the mode of transmission is by intimate or direct copntact with vaginal and urethral discharges of infected persons during sexual intercourse rarely occurs by intimate contact with contaminated articles.  The highest rate of infection with multiple sex partners and congenital infection is possible (That is from infected mother to infant at child birth althought infrequent).  New born girls can acquire the infection from their infected mothers through birth canal.  In such cases, the infection tends to remain a symptomatic unstil puberty (Nester et al, 2001, Bradley, et al, 1993 and public Health Agency Canada (PHAC) 2001).  The organism can survive for hours on moist objects such as damp towels clothes and bathtubs of infected women (Lossick, 1989 and Nester et al, 2001).  Nonsexual transmission is extremely rare sine i. Vaginalis infection is generally rstricted to a specific sites namely the urogenital tract Ithomason (1989).  The only known nonviral form of transmission is through perinatal acquisition.  Approximately 5% of female babies born of infected mothers contract the infection (Bramley, 1976).  Nevetheless, I. Vaginalis infection in children should at least raise the question of sexual abuse and p[ossible exposure to other sexually transmitted diseases (Nester et al, 2001). Evidence for sexual transmission of I. Vainalis is very strong as prevalence is highest among patients with increased sexual acitivity and mul;tiple partners.  Approximately 14-65% of male partners of infected females are also infected (Krieger, 1995, and Sena, 2003).  The incubation period before symptoms arise is 4-28 days and years for persistat infection (PHAC, 2001).  There is high percentage of a sympstomatic carriers especially among men and this fosters tranmission of the disease (Nester et al, 2001).  Asymptomatic infected individuals factors in trichomoniasis transmission.  Many studies have shown that treatment of the male partner (s)  of infected women improves bsoth cure rates and recurrence rates (Hager, 1980 and lyng, 1981).<br/>AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>1.                  To determine the prevalence of I.

Plasmodium malaria is widely distributed but less common  Plasmodium Ovale is rare but it tends to replace P. Viax in west Africa where it has been linked with Lack of Duffy blood group by (John Murray, 1880).<br/>The life cycle of the malaria (Plasmodium protozoa) includes of the malaria (plasmodium protozoa)includes three  basic stages. The first stage occurs  in the mosgintos body (Exogenous stage). The second and the third stages take place in a persons  body (exogenous stage) the first stage begins where the mosginto bites Samoan who has malaria. Plasmodium enter the insects body and reproduce in its stomach. The protozoan young tin their way into the mosguito saliva.  The second stage occurs after the mosquito bites another person. Plasmodia.<br/>During the third stage, each plasmodium invades a red blood cell, where it multiples again.  The infected blood cells eventually rapture and release large numbers of plasmodia, which  invades additional red blood cells. This invasism, multiplying and cell rupture by, the parasites continues, causing the periodic attacks of fever that are typical of malaria.  An attack occurs each time the red blood cells rupture.  Some plasmodia develop further in human blood and are able to reproduce in a mosquitoes body.  They enter the insects body when the mosquito bites a person their life cycle begins again.<br/> Human malaria can be transmitted only by female anopheline mosquitoes.  In addition to transmitting malaria, anophelines also transmits filariasis and some  viral disease, but other mosquitos are more important as vectors of the two latter infections.  The Anopheless belong to the order of Diptera, sub-order Nematocera, family culicidae sub-family culicinae and tribe Anophelim in the zoological classification..  within the tribe Anophelin, the germs anopheles has several sub-genera. (Ketchum 1984).<br/>There are about 400 species of Anophelese mosquitoes throughout the world, but only some 60 species are vectors of malaria under natural conditions: of these some 30 species are of major importance.  Natural susceptibility or resistance of Anapheles to infection with a defined species of malaria parasite is largely unexplained though it is certainly related to biochemical processes in the body of the mosquito and to its nutritional requirements.  Among the main factors determining whether a  particular species of Abophelese is an important vector, the frequency of its feeding on man (in preference to animals) is of particular relevance.  The other factors are the mean longevity of the local population of  an anpheline species and its density in relation to man.  Thus, a particular species of Anopheles may be an important vector in one area of the world and of no importance in another area.  Although Anopheles mosquitoes are most frequently seen in tropical or subtropical regions, they are found in termperate climates. They life expertance of the mosquito depends on enviroenmntal conditions.<br/>The external morphology of both female and male anophels provides the main criteria for recognising both the genus and the species of these mosquito.  The successive stages of growth and metamorphosis of the mosquito are the egg, lava, pupa and finally the adult or imigo.<br/>In general, malaria is yound in regions lying roughly between latitute 60N and 400  of the equator.  The impart of malaria on any population depends upon its epidemilogical pattern.  Nigeira has endemic and stable malaria (Meneudez, 1995).<br/>CLASSIFICATION = (Beadle 1977) classified malaria parasite as follows:-<br/>-           Phylum            -           Protozoa<br/>-           Class                -           Sporozoa<br/>-           Order               -           Coccidida<br/>-           Sub-order        -           Haemosporina<br/>-           Family -           Plasmodidae<br/>-           Germs  -           Plasmodium<br/>            Thus plasmodium (protozoa: Haemo sporina) secure malaria to man and it is atransmitted by female Anopheline mosquitoo during blood meal.<br/>1.1       Malaria cause by Four species of Plasmodium.<br/>            Malaria cause by P.  Falciparium is refered to as Falciparium  malaria,  formely known as subtertian (ST) or malignant tertian (MT) malaria.  It is the msot widespread, accounting for up tpo 80% of malaria cases  worldwide. P. Falciparum  is the msot pathogenic of the human malaria species with untreated infections causing severe disease and death, particularly in yousng children, pregnant women and no-immune adults.  According to (Trigg and kondrachine, 1998) P. Facciparum causes yearly 300 million to 500 million cases of clinical illness and 1-5 million to 2.7 million deaths in sub-saharan Africa, plus 5-20 million clinical cases and 100,000 deaths else where in the world 80% of them in Asta.<br/>            In a pregnant women, Normal immune responses are reduced during pregnancy.  In areas of stable malaria transmission, a pregnant women will have acquired partial immunity to malaria.  This will protect her against serious clinical  Falciparum malaria but not present heavy parastic infection of the placenta and anaemia (often severe) which can result in a low birth weight baby which may not survive.<br/>            Malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax is referred as vivax, formerly known as benign tertian (BT) malaria.<br/>            Malaria caused by Plasmodium  Ovale  is referred to as ovale malaria, formerly known as ovale tertian malaria.  While that of Plasmodium malaria is referred to as malariae malaria, also referred to as quartan malaria.<br/>            Infections caused by P.Vivax,  P. Ovale or P.malarine are rarely life – threatening according to parasite cells does not occure and parasitic densities are lower.  In vivax and ovale malaria, parasites numbers rarely exceed 50000 /N/ or 2% of cells infected, and in quatan malaria (P. malaria) parasite  numbaer are usually less than 10,000/ML with only up to 1% of cells becoming infected.<br/>P.Vivax and Ovale malaria has a common feature “Relapses” due to the delayed development of pre-erythrocytic (PE) schizonts from hyprozoites in liver cells.  While P. Malariae  has a feature of repeated malaria attacks due to recrudescence caused by small numbers of erythrocytic forms of the parasite persisting in the host, possibly as a recent of parasitic antigenic charge.<br/>            A serious complication infection with P. Malariae is “ne phrotic syndrome” which may head to renal failure. It occurs more frequently in children and is caused by damage to the kidneys following the deposition of antigen anti-body completes on the glomerular basement membrane of the kidney.<br/>1.2       AIM AND OBJECTIVE<br/>1.                  The aim of this research project is to demonstrate the incidence of malaria infestation caused by different species of plasmodium<br/>2.                  To identify the commonest species of plasmodium implicated in the attack.<br/>3.                  To identify stages of plasmodium in the patients.<br/>4.                  To confirms the population at risk<br/>5.                  To make recommendation that would assist in the reduction or eradication of malaria especially among children in Enugu metropolis and the society ins general.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>            The major problem with diseases in developing world has been the failure to set realistic priorities with respect to both research and control.  As clinical diagnosis fail to effectively lay emphasis on species specificity in malaria attack, and as there are today increasing cases of chloroquine resistant in malaria therapy, a good knowledge of species specificity may help to claudicate the lathert causes of the problems in malaria therapy.  Finding from this work will clearly identify the followings:<br/>1.                  The different  species of plasmodium treatment<br/>2.                  The  nature of the stages in man<br/>1.3      HYPOTHESIS<br/>H1        There are four species of plasmodium evenly distributed in human population<br/>H2        Some species of plasmodium are more prevalent then others.<br/>H3        Plasmodium parasitenia is higher in children than in adults.<br/>H1P      Plasmodium parastitenia is equal in all age cohorts.<br/>1.4       JUSTIFICATION<br/>1.                  The four species of plasmodium is prevalent among the resident of Enugu state.  They infect humans and cause malaria.<br/>2.                  All species are vector borne disease, being spread by aropheline mosquitoes, and the disease is distributed throughout the <br/>1.6       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This study is limited to examination of incidence of malaria infestation caused by different species of plasmodium in Enugu metropolis.  The area of work covers parkland general Hospital Enugu.  As a general hospital, which is standard I feel that they will give me more information and provide me with the materials needed to carry out this work. <br/> <br/><br/>\n\nEXAMINATION OF INCIDENCE OF MALARIA WEFESTATION CAUSED BY DIFFERNET SPECIES OF PLASMODIUM IN ENUGU METROPOLIC \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF PARKLANE HOSPITAL ENUGU)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EXAMINATION OF INCIDENCE OF MALARIA WEFESTATION CAUSED BY DIFFERNET SPECIES OF PLASMODIUM IN ENUGU METROPOLIC \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF PARKLANE HOSPITAL ENUGU)\r\n", "id": 108}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>FUNGAL INFUSTATION ON BAKERY PRODUCT DREAM<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This project work which is all about the fungal infestation of bakery product BREAD, explain the kind or type of fungal organisms that are responsible for the  spoilage on contamination of bread.

Infestation of these fungal organisms spoil the product so that it is not fit to eat; it also changes the taste so that the product is not desirable. The concept of food infestation of fungal organisms is based on the consipteration for fiutres of consumption. Infestation is defined as the over presence alone has led to its growth and microbial activity. Pathogenic organisms however can cause food poisoning. Food poisoning can arise  through infatuation of food by organisms (micro) which secrete toxins which B their consumed. The cost of  fungal infested bread resulting to  spoilage is also  great with loss of money due to wastage of the raw materials. Also considering the usefulness of this product in the community with the management of money being spent it has also helped in the sense that since it is regarded as a fast food it is being bought and consumed directly without further preparations done.  Effect of contaminated bread in the society can lead to an epidemic  of gastrointestinal disorder  where by that particular environment that consumed the contaminate bread become affected there by developing stomach upset. As a result of this a lot of consideration should be given to breads that are sent into the community to be sold and this  is done by the standardized system called HACCP ie hazards Analysis critical control point. This method is now  generally  considered as a choice for ensuring safety of foods  (jay 1996 de Boer and Beumer 1999) hazzard analysis critical control point involves identifying places in the production process where hazzard could occur. i.e. the CCp (critical control point” and putting monitoring procedures in place to prevent these hazards occurring even with this system in place samples still need to be tested  for the presence of micro organism. <br/>Detection of most of the micro organisms requires growth of the organism on selective media which can take a number of days from isolation to identification. These method are sensitive and gives qualitative information on the number and nature of the micro organism. Present in a food sample. However, conventional methods require several day to produce result because they rely on the ability of micro organisms to multiply to visible colonies (De Boser and Beumer 1999).  Presentation  of bread commonly involves the use of propionates and  sorbates and sometime henzoates. Preservatives  are added to retain on to increase the shelf life by preventing the micro-organism responsible for the contamination of that food. There alter natives to preservatives have been  bought also. The chief types of microbial spoilage of bread as a result of fungal infestation will  also studied which is moldiness. Rapines is also  another type of bread spoilage but unfortunately it wont be studies due to the fact that it is caused by bacterial organism which unfortunately is not a fugal organisms and as a result is not in the  scope of study for this research work.

They help the body to fight diseases. More than 3,000 years ago ancient people stumbled over the discovery that some moulds could be used as a cure. The egyptians, the chinese, and indians of central American would use mold to treat rashes and infected would. At that time they didn’t understand either diseases or treatment. As time went on, people began to gain some insight of disease. In the 1860 Louis Pasteur Shaw that many disease were caused it bacteria. Later he discovered that we may be able to fight germ and other microbes. It was two German doctors, who were first to make an effective medication form microbes. Kudo if and Emmerich and Oscar has conducted their experiment in the  1890. They proved that germ that would for another. All the men did was to take the germ from infected bandages and grow then in a test tube. They would  then isolate a particular germ that caused green in factions in open would. This germs was bacteria called Bacillus pyoicyaneus. They put then into another test tube containing other type of bacteria, it was  then it happened that the bacillus pyocyaneus wiped out the other disease germ. The germs that was killed were those that caused cholera, typhoid, diphtheria and anthrau. From this the two men created a medication that they called pyoanase, it was the first antibiotics used in hospitals.<br/>In 1928 Alexander Fleming, a Scottish scientist, discovered penicillin, the first antibiotics. He was keeping in a petn dish when a speck of mold fell in, it cause the mold to grow on the nutrient agar used to feed the bacteria. Surpassingly, it stopped the growth of the bacteria. Fleming through the mold called penicillin notatum produced a substance that killed the bacteria and so called it penicillin. However, he was not able to entrant it from broth in which he grew the mold.<br/>In 1945, Waksman used the word antibiotics for the first time and proposed that it can be defined as a chemical substance of microbial origin that possesses antibiotic powers. He discovered a drug called streptomycin. It onginated frommicrobes found in soil and was a cure for many intestinal  diseases. Now antibiotics like penicillin and streptomycin was discovered. Each was effective against certain disease, but scientist wanted more. Doctors however, anted broad spectrum drug. That is a single antibiotics that could cure many disease <br/>The search proved successful one laboratory discovered Aureonycin, which is a drug that does the job of penicillin and streptomycin. Another laboratory discovered chloromycin. <br/>In 1949, yet another laboratory came with one of the effective  antibiotics ever found, terranycin. This drug could be used against many bacteria disease (Katzung, 1994). <br/> 1.2              AIMS AND OBJECTIVE <br/>1.                  To identify causative organism that are delectious to mans health. <br/>2.                  To determine the potency of the different antibiotics. <br/>3.                  To know the type of organism sensitive to the different antibiotics. <br/>1.3                 HYPOTHESIS <br/>H0-       Streptomycin is more effective <br/>H1 – Streptonyin is not  effective <br/>H2  -     Chloramphenicol is not effective <br/>H3-  Chloramphenicol is not effective <br/>H4- Gentamicin is more effective <br/>H5 –Gentanicin  is not effective <br/>H6 – Comparing the strength of the three antibiotics.<br/>1.4              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>Due to the problem encountered in Enugu Urban (obiagu), most people abuse antibiotics owing to the general belief that antibiotics can be used  in the treatment of all kinds of diseases. This can result to drug resist. Accumulation of these drugs can lead to internal denage.  Hence this study which compares the antimicrobial strength of three antibiotics. <br/>1.5              SOCOP OF STUDY <br/>This work will be limited to the maximum inhibitory concentration and know the organism sensitive to the different antibiotics under certain temperature. <br/>  <br/>\n\nCOMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF ANTIMICROBIAL STRENGTH OF THREE MOST COMMON ANTIBIOTICS USED IN ENUGU \r\n(CASE STUDY OF ANTIBIOTICS DRUGS BROUGHT IN OBIAGU.) \r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF ANTIMICROBIAL STRENGTH OF THREE MOST COMMON ANTIBIOTICS USED IN ENUGU \r\n(CASE STUDY OF ANTIBIOTICS DRUGS BROUGHT IN OBIAGU.) \r\n", "id": 110}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>REFURBISHMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY LABORATORY <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This work presents the raw materials and steps used in the refurbishment of microbiology laboratory at institute of management and technology.

Tiles are generally used for covering roofs floors and walls or other objects such as table tops. Another category is the ceiling tiles made from light weight materials such as perlite wood and mineral wool. The word is derived from the French word tuile which is in turn from the Latin word tegula meaning a roof tile composed of baked clay. Less precisely, the modern term can refer to any sort of construction tile or similar object such as rectangular counters used in playing games. <br/>            (Davis Langton 1998) tiles are often used to form wall and floor covering and   can range from simple square tiles to complex mosaics.<br/>            Tiles are most often made from ceramic with a hard glaze finish, but other materials are also commonly used such as glass marble, granite, slate and reformed ceramic slurry which is cast in a mould and fired, (James F Kellam 2003).<br/>            A ceramic is an inorganic non metallic solid prepared by the action of heat and subsequent cooling ceramic materials may have a crystalline or partly crystalline structure or may be amorphous (eg a glass) Because most of common ceramic are crystalline it is also in organic crystalline materials as opposed to the non crystalline glasses the  earliest ceramics were pottery (citation needed) objects or 27000 year old figurines made from clay either by itself or mixed with other materials hardened in fire. workers of ceramics (Crassostrea Iredali Oyster 2009). <br/>  <br/>\n\nREFURBISHMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY LABORATORY <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " REFURBISHMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY LABORATORY ", "id": 111}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECT OF PESTICIDES DICHLORODIPHENYL TRICHLOROEYHANE (D.D.Y)<br/>AND BENZENE HEXACHRORIDE (BHC) ON THE MICROFLORA OF THE THREE TYPES OF SOIL.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The effect of pesticides, chchlorodipheny trichloroethane (DDY) and Benzene hexaxhoride (BHc) on the  microflora of the three types of soil (loamy, clay and sandy soil) was conducted. The serial dietitian technique was employed up to 10-3 using nutrient agar, potato dextrose agar and sabourand agar plates. The isolation of both bacterial and fungal organisms were made  before treating the soil types with the two pesticides), D.D.T and BHC.  and after treating the soil types with D.D.T after treating  and BHc. The highest bacterial count before treating the soil types with D.D.T and BHc was got in loamy soil with 133 per ml having  PH 7.1, followed by clay soil with 78 per ml and  least was sandy soil with 42 per ml. while the highest bacterial count  after treating the soil types with D.D.T was gotten in loamy soil 105 per ml, followed by clay soil with  51 and least count was got in sandy with 28 per ml. Also the  highest bacterial count after treatment with BHc was obtained in loamy soil with 12F per ml, followed by clay soil with 64 per ml and the least count was got from sand soil with 37 per ml. The highest bacterial isolate from all the soil types before  treatment with the two pesticides was pseudomonas with 25 per ml, followed by Bacillus SPP with   24 per ml, and  next was achnomycetes with 19 per ml  while the least bacterial organism was Rhizobrium SPP. The fungal organisms isolates were Aspergillus species, syncophatastrum species, pernicillum species and mucor species. The results of this project showed that there was reduction in microflora of the soil types after treatment separately with the two pesticides. But the effect was more with  D.D.T than with BHc.

Plant are anchored in the soil by their root, which spread in all direction and which by holding on to the soil keep the plant in position plant draw all their water and  most of their food or nutrient from the soil. Soil is therefore the source of food for plants, animals and man. Soil is of different types, sandy, clay and loamy soil. Sandy soil has or size range of 0.2 to 2mm diameter. They are free draining and do not retain any appreciable amount of soil water. It is brown loose and dry. While clay soil range in size from 0.002mm and lower and contains more than 40% of clay particles. They are sticky, plastic and  easily moldable into  shape. Another type is loamy soil which contains a fair balance of clay , silt and sand particle and it is the best  soil for agriculture, as it has a high proportion of organic matter or content soil organic malter represents on accumulation of  partially decayed and animal residues. Such material is continually being broken down as a result  of the  work of soil micro –organism consequently. It is a rather  transitory soil constituent and must be renewed constantly by the additionb of plant residues. The organic matter content of a soil is small, only 3-5 percent by weight in a representative minerals topsoil. It is a major soil source of two important mineral elements namely phosphorous and suefur and essentially the sole source of nitrogen. Through its effect on the physical condition of soil, organic matter also increase the amount of water a soil can hold and the proportion of water available for plant growth. Further more   organic matter is the main source of energy for soil microflora. Without it biochemical activity would come practically to a stand still soil organic matter consist of two groups (a) Original tissue and its partially decomposed equivalent and (b) the humus. The original tissue include the under composed roots and the tops of higher plants. The materials are subject to vigorous attack by soil organism and both plant  and animal which use them as sources of energy and tissue building material. The gelatinous, more resistant products of this decompository both the synthesized by the micro organisms and those modified from the original plant tissue are collectively known as HUMUS. This material, usually black or brown in colour is coloidal in nature. Its capacity to hold water and nutrient ions greatly exceeds that of clay, its inorganic counterpart. Small amount of humus thus augment remarkably the soil capacity to promote plant production. <br/>According to Burges and Raw (1967) loamy like clay is a product of degradation and synthesis. And the agencies responsible are the living organisms in the soil both the animal (fauna) and the plant (flora). These organism engineer a myriad of biochemical changes as decay takes place. They also physically chum the soil and help stabilize soil structure. A rast number of organism live in the soil. By far the greater proportion of these belong to plant life. Yet animal are not to be minimized especially in the early stage of organic decomposition. <br/>Edward and lofty in 1969 explain that the activities of specific group of soil organisms are commonly identified by (a) their numbers in the soil (b) their weight per unit volume or area of soil (biomass) and (c) their metabolic activity. Although the relative metabolic activities are not shown, they are generally related to biomass of the organism. As might be expected, the numbers are highest among the micro organism. So great are microflora number that they do minate the biomass in spite of the minute size of each individual organisms. The microflora monopolize the metabolic activity in soil. It is estimated that 60-80% of the total soiil metabolism is due to the microflora. <br/>They further said that some of the many naturally and artificially occuring substance have deleterious effect on the life of at least some species of organism in the soil by inhibiting the development of these species. However, there is continuing concern that these chemical substance may also adversary affect various non parasitic segment of the soil microflora. These chemical compound substance are called pesticide. Pesticides are  therefore material useful for  the control  nutigation of animals detrimental to human or economy. Algaecides, deforlant and descant herbicides plant growth  regulator and fungicide are used to regulate population of undesirable organisms which compete with or  pristine crop or namental plants. Attractant insecticides, muticides, accredits, molluscide, nematodes, repellant and rodenticide are used principally  to reduce parasitism and trasmission in domestic animals, the loss of crop plant, the destruction of processed  food textile wood products as well as parasitism and disease transmission to human. <br/>Jones (1956) and fletcher (1960) have shown the effect of different pesticide on type, number and activities. They explain that herbicide and insecticides can destroy soil micro organism or suppress their activities if applied at excessive rate. But when applied at recommended rate these chemicals reach soil concentration of  more than 2 or 3 part per million (PPm) however, some pesticide are obtained from plant and minerals, while few other are obtained by the mixed culture of micro organisms insecticides like pyrethin, cruelties and nicotine are  extracted from plant. Also toxin produced by bacillus thuringiesis are active ingredient against moth and butterfly larrac. The toxins are sometime called miracle gene”. DDt is an out standing example of insecticide and probably the most commonly used pesticide. It is known to contain remarkable properties and does not occur naturally too. Its first synthesis  was recorded in 1874 by a German research chemist called. Zeidler <br/>In the mid 60s, the  benefits steaming from the ability of DDT to control insect pest could be counter balanced by adverse effects on other element of the enriroment. Detailed reviews of properties, stability, prehistoric and impact upon all facets of the environment were carried out  with DDT and other chlorinated organic insecticides. Concern over the  undesirable effects of pesticide culminated insecticides, fungicide,nd rodenticide act (FIFRA) by public.  Law o2-516, the federal environmental  pesticide control act (FEPCA) in united state of American to prevent unreasonable environmental hazard from pesticides for general and restricted users as a function of acute toxicity Benzene hexachloride (BHC) is an organochiloride pesticide for its efficiency in the control of anthropoid pests. There is fear that BHc will probable have adverse effect on non targeted microflora  of the soil the aplastic anemia reported in individual said to have been exposed to BHC has been attributed to benzene, which causes aplastic anaemia. But BHc is based on cylohexane. Which does not cause anaemia (grawhill 1982). <br/>1.2              AIM AND OBJECTIVES <br/>i.          To determine the effect of pesticide dicblorodipheny trichloroethane (DDT) and benzene hexachloride (BHC) on the microflora of three types of soil.<br/>ii.         To isolate soil microflora from the three types of soil. <br/>Iii         To identify soil microflora of the three type of soil.<br/>iv.                To determine the type of soil that is mostly affected by pesticides. <br/>1.3              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>According to (Higa 1990) Agricultural practices can have a significant positive and negative impact on soil. For example wrong application of pesticides (DDT) and BHC) is  detrimental to soil microflora. Therefore it is necessary to determine the effect of D.D.T and  BHC.

Food has been defined as that which can be eaten to nourish the body. Since the economic situation is getting worse day by day, it becomes imperative that an alternative soymilk be provided to improve nutrition status. <br/>Soybeans (Glycine max) is a member of the family legminosae, sub family papilnonaceae (Howell and Caldwell, 1972) Ezedinma F.O.C 1964) it is an annual summer legume  be4ing that it is found in the hairy pods of an erect bushy legume native to Asta and have been reported   to have originated from eastern and where used as food as long as before the existence of written record. It is highly proteinous in that it contains a large proportion of assailable protein, have carbohydrate having no starch at all. The protein of soybeans  are  glycinun, phaseolin, and legumlin are equally good source of B- comple vitamins and minerals (James et al 1992). They are also known to contain best blance of essential ammoniac’s and that is why it is usually referred to as the miracle legume or the poor mans meats”.<br/>SOYBEAN PRODUCTION<br/>Originally confined to the temperate zone is no spreading rapidly into tropic particularly in Brazil and other parts of south American in India and in the far East Inspite of being one of the earliest filed crops, soybeans was introduced into Nigeria shows that Benue state and Kogi state is the most important soybeans producing are in the country. In Nigeria, nearly all of the soybeans  production estimated at 30,000 tons is for human consumption and in response to increasing demand for. Soybeans as a source of protein and vegetable oil, National programmes in Nigeria have expanded their research on the crop since 1981) ( III A Annual report 1983). <br/>Soymilk, which is traditionally an equeous extract of whole soybeans has been of considerable interest to nutritionists as a possible  substitute for cow or human milk due to its advantage over many other protein source in that no allergenic properties have been associated with it so far. Therfore it is recommended for infants who are allergic to cows milk (food and food production Encyclopedia 1971) <br/>Soymilk has been made in china for generation and its consumption is fast gaining ground in Nigeria (Ahmed 1984; bashiell et al, 1990) soymilk has been recommended by physicians for years  to patients who are allergic to cows milk and now it is being recommended to those who have suffered from or are prone to degenerative heart diseases and who need a milk with unsaturated fat as a   replacement for dairy milk. (Ahened 1984)  <br/>IMPORTANCE OF LEGUMES AS FOOD <br/>Generally legumes contain 17-25% protein except soybeans which contains about 40% protein and 40-70% carbohydrate. Legume seeds are also good  sources of minerals such as  phosphorsphrous and iron (Bresani and Elias, 1974; stegel and fawceth, 1976) except for soybeans and groundnuts, which  contains 18% and 48% oil respectively (Muller and Tobin 1980) legume seeds their utilization is impaired by inherent constraints such as the presence of several antinutrients and toxic components despite their high nutrient content. Legume seeds are generally low in fats and oils.  Consequently legume seeds as protein souces despite the fact that legume protein are cheaper. However, with adequate processing legumes are safe and nutritious. <br/>Today. In Nigeria, the house holds use of various Nigerian Families and communities all over the country. Food recipes have been developed for those based mainly on soybean and those in which soybean I incorporated so as to increase the nutrient content especially protein. Soybean are incorporated into cereals tubers, and roots and other legumes. They are used to prepare the main dish breakfast, foods for adults and children weaning foods and convalescent diets. <br/>JUSTIFICATION <br/>Soymilk is rich beverage and food products rich in protein, substitute for cow milk and other source of protein, cheaper than other source of protein and a food beverage for student to take all day long without feeling the cost. Therefore there is need to ensure that the milk is hygiene prepare, free from pathogen and other spoilage organism with longer shelf ;life  to  protein, cheaper than other sources of protein and a food beverage for student to take all day long without feeling the cost. Therefore there is need  to  ensure that the milk is hygiene- prepare, free from pathogen and other spoilage organism with longer shelf  life to protect the student from diseases arising from food poisoning <br/>AIM AND OBJECTIVE <br/>The objective of this research work  is to carryout  microbiological quality control of the soymilk beverage sold in I.M.T campus 3 Enugu. This is to ensure that the soymilk sold is from pathogenic and spoilage organizes and also to  ensure that the food compties with the food keeping quality. <br/>HYPOTHESIS <br/>HO       Soymilk is associated with spoilage microorganism <br/>H1        Soymilk is not associated with spoilage Microorganisms. <br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>Soymilk as a food of high  nutritional value is highly associated with microorganism as a result of this  hygienically prepared and declared fit for consumption so as to protect the student from disease that arises due to food poisoning. <br/>METHODOLOGY <br/>30 soymilk samples will be collected  from the various hawkers within I.M.T campus 3 Enugu. Serial dilution of the sample will be carried. Samples will be cultured using streaking method with nutrient agar and macconkey agar. <br/>Gram staining will be carried out and microscopic examination will also be carried out to identify the pathogenic organism. Finally, biochemical test will be done to confirm the presence of the organisms. <br/>  <br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE MICROBIOLOGICAL QUALITY CONTROL OF SOYMILK BEVERAGE SOLD IN INSITITUE OF MANGEMENT

INTRODUCTION<br/>            Banana may be defined as a personal seed plant that produces an edible fruits, usually seedless, belong to the species M.  acuminata, or are hybrids M. acuminata, M. balbisnna.  They are perennial herbs with long, the bases of these leaves (petioles) remain tightyly fused and form the trunk (Pseudostem) of a plant 2-9m (6-30-ft) in height (Ploetz, 1994),<br/>            “Banana” is a general term embracing a number of species or hybrids in the genus musa, family musceae. In some areas of the world bananas are grown only as ornamental plants or for fiber.<br/>            It is found in tropical regions.  The banana is monocarpic, flowering and setting fruit once before sit dies.  The inflorescence protective flag leaf.  The flower stalk of most banana varieties  is positively geotropic and bends from the vertical until its stip points towards vertical flower stalks are from 30 – 90 cm (1-3ft) along, tapered and covered in a sheath of over- lapparing bracks the flower are parthenogenic (self-fertile).  And occur in group of 12-20 beneath the bracks.<br/>            At first, individual fruiots called fingers, make up the groups (hands) which are arranged in a spiral around the flower stalk, forming a bunch.<br/>            At fruit set, a healthy banana plant will have 8-12 leaves, fruits mature in 60-100 days after flowers first appears depending on the season and cultivan.  New banana plants arise as suckers from an underground rhizone.  As old planted die and new sucher are formed the rhizome expands and is called a mat.  Banana are propagated by suckens, pieces of the Bluzome and by tissue culture  (Ploetz 1994)<br/>USES    <br/>Bananas contain about 74% waterm 23% carbohydrate, 1% protein and 0.5 %.  A 4 – ounce banana without the peel is a good source of  vitamin Bb, Potassium, and fiber.<br/>Banana fruit may be   eaten raw or as a cooked vegetable.   The fruit can also be processed for a number of food products.<br/>            Ripe fruits can be pulped for puree for in a variety of products including ice cream, yoghurt, cake, bread, nectar, and baby food.  Ripe banabas can be dried and eaten, or sliced canned with syrup, and used in bakery products, fruits salads and stoppings.  Green (unripened) bananas can be sliced and fried as chips. Whole green fruits can also be dried and ground into flour. Vinegar and alcoholic beverages can be made from fermented ripe bananas. Other parts of the banana plant are consumed besides the fruits. The heart of the growing pseudostem is eaten in India.   In Southeast Asia, the male bud is eaten as a boiled vegetable.<br/>            The banana leaves are not eaten but may be used for wrapping food in cooling. The banana foliage and pseudostems are used as cattle feed during dry periods in some banana producing areas.  Culled bananas are used sto feed cattle and hogs.  Bananas are a good energy source but need to be supplemented with  protein.  But not all micro-organisms associateeed with fruits are harmless”.  This  includes the lactic acid bacteria, coryne forms, pseudomonads, xanthomonads  micrococci, amny fungi and coliforms.  These microorganisms do play an important role in the spoilage of food and dictate the shelf life of fresh fruits. Most healthy raw produce will have on them anywhere from a  few thousand to millions of miucroorganisms per gram.  The presence of many of these microorganisms is a concern for causing product spoilage.  <br/>            Food spoilage is a major problems in all societies especially fruits, because  they provide nutrients for us, also are excellent environment for the growth of micro-organisms.  Microbial growth as  well as spoilage is controlled by factor related to the food itself or intrinsic factor and also to theenvironment where the food is being stored or what are described as    extrinsic factors.  Food composition is critical intrinsic factor that influences microbial growth, if a food consider primarily  of carbohydrates, spoilage does not result in major odours.  Thus, foods such as some fruits e.g. banana show spoilage by fungal growth.  Also, PH of a food also is critical because a low PH a food also is critical because a low PH favours the growth of yeasts and mold.  This is the case in banana fruit because it has PH of 2-5 physical structure of a food also can affected the course and extension of spoilage.  Banana fruits has outer  skin (peels) that project them from spoilage.<br/>            Often, spoilage micro-organisms have specialized enzymes that help them weaken and penetrate protective peels, especially after the fruits has been bruised.  Temperature and relative humidity are important extrinsic factors in determining whether a fruit (banana) will spoil.  At higher relative humilities, microbial growth is  initiated more rapidly even at lower temperatures.<br/>            The atmosphere in which the fruit is stored is also important as this plays a crucial role in its spoilage.  Because fruits are such excellent sources of nutrients, If the intrinsic and extrinsic conditions are appropriate, micro-organisms grow rapidly and make what once was an attractive and appealing fruits into a sour, foul-smelling or fungus – covered mass suitable only for the garbage car.<br/>Microbial spoilage in Banana can lead to visible challenges, including a variety of colours caused by spoilage organisms.<br/>               Bacteria do not seem important in the initial spoilage of whole fruits like banana instead such spoilage often is initiated  by molds.  These organisms have enzymes that contribute to the weakening and penetration of the protective outer skin.  Many microorganisms have been isolated from banana, actually spoilt banana. These micro-organisms have been associated with moko disease, or moko de Guineo, or marchites bacteriana, is caused by the bacterium, pseudomonas solanacearum, resulting in internal decay.  It  has become one of the western hemisphere and has seriously reduced production in the leading area as of Colombia. It attacks Heliconia species as well.  It is transmitted by insects, machetes and with the roots of sick plants.  There are said to be 4 different types transmitted by different means.  Efforts at control include covering the male and bud with plastic to prevent insects from visiting its mucilaginous excretion, debudding, disinfecting of cutting tools  with formalde hyde in water 1:3, disinfection of  planning material; disposal of infected fruits and plant parts: infection of herbicides into seemingly healthy neighbouring plants. if The organism is vriant SFR, all adjacent plants. If the organism is variant SFR, all adjacent plants within a radius replanted for 10 to 12 months for this variant persists in the soil that long.  If it is variant B, the plants within 32.8 ft (10m) must bee injected and the area not replanted for 18 months.<br/>            In either case the soil must be kept clear of broad leaved weeds that may serve as hosts.  In Colombia, there are 12 species of weeds that serve as hosts or “carriers:” but only 4 of these are themselves susceptible to the disease.  Crop rotation is sometimes resorted to the only sure, defense is to plant resistant cultivans.  Such as the ‘pelipita’ plantain.<br/>            Black-end arises from infection by the fungus arises from infectrion by the fungus Glocosporium musarum, of which Glomerella cingulata  is the perfect  form.  It causes authracuose on the plant and attacks the stalk and stalk – end of the fruits  forming dark, sunken lesions on the peel, soon penetrating the fresh and developing dark, watery, soft area in severe cases, the entire skin turns black and the flesh rats.  Very young fruits shrived and mummify. This fungus is often responsible for the rotting of bananas in storage.  Immersing the green fruits in hot water. 131of (55oc) for 2 minutes before ripening greatly, reduces spoilage.<br/>            Sigar-tip rot, or cigan-end disease, stachylidium (verticillium) theobromae begins in the flowers and extends to the tips of the fruits and turns sthem darks the peel darknens, the flesh becomes Fibrous. One remedy is to cut off withered flowers as soon as the fruits are formed and apply copper fungicides to the cut surfaces.  Unlike most other fruits, banana develop their best eating quantity after they are harvested. This allows bananas to be shipped great distances.  Almost our entire supply of banabas, available year-round is imported from central and south america.  Bananas are sensitive to cool temperature and will be induced in temperatures below 550f for this reason, they should never be kept in the refrigerator.  The ideal temperature for ripening bananas is between 60 and 700f.  higher temperature cause them to repen too rapidly.<br/>            However, Bananas which are firm, bright in appearance, and free from repeness is indicated by skin colour.  Best eating quality has been reached when the solid yellow colour is specked with brown.<br/>            At this stage, the flesh is mellow and the flavour is fully developed.  Bananas with green stips or with practically no yellow colour have not developed their full flavour potential.<br/>AIM AND OBJECTIVES<br/>1.      it shows the amount of bacteria present in the decay of banana<br/>2.      it also shows the amount of yeast and mold present in the decay of banana<br/>3.      it provides a basic understanding of the physical, chemical and microbiological principles underlying the psreervation of foods and also provide as a basic understanding of the study of food microbiology from farm to consumer.<br/>4.      It provide students with an understanding of the physical and chemical characteristics which influence the formation, stability and texture of food systems<br/>1.3       SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>            This study is done to find out how similar or different microorganisms associated with the spoilage of bananas are: it brings to fore a good number of   microorganisms associated with that or bring about the spoilage of banana (musa acuminata).  The significance of this study can never and will never be over emphasized.  This is because banana is a fruit of choice and spoils easily.  As a result of this, a knowledge of the microorganisms that are involved in its (banana) spoilage is essential.<br/>            Also, this study gives an insight into the conditi ons as well as factors that result in the spoilage of this  attractive fruit, not to mention the nature or group of microorganisms that are associated with such a fruit.  The significance of this study is seen in the light of having a good understanding and showing the comparism of the spoilage microorganisms of banana.<br/>1.4              STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>A study of this nature must have problems which result in it.  This problem will result from how these microorganisms are being  associated with the spoilage of banana a fruit and cause decay to these banana and make it undesirable for human consumption.  This microorganisms associated  with the spoilage of banana includes yeast and mold, {uedomonas species, micrococcus species,  bacterial and fungal species.  Looking at many banana sold in the market today, most of them are infected with these microorganisms or other microorganisms like the soft rot, crown rot bacteria and soft rots which infect and make these fruit unattractive  for human consumption and may cause problems to human being as well as animal.   <br/>1.6       HYPOTHESIS<br/>Ho       =          Microorganisms are associated with the spoilage of banana<br/>HI        =          Microorganisms are not associated with the spoilage of banana.<br/>    <br/>\n\nCOMPARATIVE STUDY OF MICRO-ORGANISM ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPOILAGE OF BANANA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMPARATIVE STUDY OF MICRO-ORGANISM ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPOILAGE OF BANANA", "id": 114}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY OF THREE TYPES OF MEDICATED<br/>SOAPS ON STARHYROCOCCUS AUREUS FORM WOULD INFECTIONS<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The antibacterial activity of three type of medicate soap on staphylococcus aureus isolated from wound infections was conducted. Fifty individual with would infection within the age range of 9-73 years were sampled. Swabsticks were used to collect specimens from wound infection. each swabstick was streaked separately over plates of nutrient   and  macconkey agar and later incubated at 370c. out of the fifty (50) individuals sampled 25(50%) were mostly infected with staphylococcus aureus followed by pseudomonas acruginqu (22%)  staphylococcus epidermis (10%) least by Exchericha coli b(12%) The organisms occur within the age range 9-13 years with 8 (16%) followed by 14-18 years 4(8%) next by the age range of 19-23 years 3(6%) followed by 24-28 years with 2(4%) followed 24-28 years with 2(4%) and the heart in the age range are 29-33,34-38,39-43,44-48,49-53,54-58 64-68 with 1(2%) each while there was no isolation in the age range 59-63. The study also revealed that all the staphylococcus aureus isolated were sensitive to the three medicated soap. The means of inhibition was highest in Aleppo medicated soap with 12.92 mm followed by temperate medicated soap with 11.2mm and least in carat medicated soap with 10.56 mm. Also the staphylococcus aureus isolated were also sensitive to the commercial autibutics used as couplers the means zones of inhibition was highest in ampiclox with 12.8 mm followed by gentamyain with 12.04 mm and the heart in penicillin with 10.4 mm. there was a close relationship in the zenes of inhibition between the three medicated soap and the commercial antibiotics used as coconutrels. The result showned that medicated soaps were effective against staphylococcus aureus involved in would infection in humans and  are comparable to commercial antibiotics. There fore medicated soap can be used in cleaning the skin particularly in the affected part of the skin during the time one has hurt or cut on the  skin. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/> CHAPTER ONE <br/>1.0              Introduction <br/>1.1              Aims and objectives <br/>1.2              Statement of the problem <br/>1.3              Hypothesis <br/>1.4              Justification of the study <br/>1.5           Limitation Of The Study <br/>CHAPTER TWO <br/>2.0              Literature review <br/>2.1              Antibacterial activity of soap<br/>2.2              Medical relevance of antimicrobial soap <br/>2.3              Normal skin microbiota and soap <br/>CHAPTER THREE <br/>3.0              Material and methods <br/>3.1              Materials<br/>3.2               sterilization <br/>3.2.2        Collection of soap sample <br/>3.2.3        Preparation of culture media <br/>3.2.4        Collection of bacterial organisms from would infection<br/>3.2.5        Microbial count, grams stain and microscopic examination <br/>3.2.6        Biochemical test for identification of isolates <br/>CHAPTER FOUR <br/>Result <br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>Discussion <br/>CHAPTER SIX <br/>Conclusion and recommendation <br/>References <br/>Appendix<br/>LIST OF TABLE<br/> Age distribution number sampled as well as percentages with staphylococcus aureus and other organisms <br/>Table 2 Age distribution as well as percentage of each isolated organisms <br/>Table 3 Preliminary identification of bacterial isolates <br/>Table 4 Biochemical test carried out for identification of bacterial isolates<br/>Table 5 Sensitivity test using three medicated soap and three antibiotics indicating their zones of inhibition.<br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>According to pelage et al (1986) antibacterial activity is the ability to either destroy bacteria or inhibit their growth. This is significant with respects to the human body in preventing sepsis and skin infections. Also Derland (1981) states that medicated soap have the germicidal substance like chloroxyhlenol potassium mercuric iodide, trichlorocarbanlide etc. incorporated into them, in order to enhance their antibacterial activity. These germicide  substance are normally added in a specified amount and percentage of the substance used are always stated on the soapcase or  inside the lesflet which certains the information on how to use the soap for various purposes. <br/>Anon (1964) states  that soap may be defined as a chemical compound resulting from the interaction of fathy acids oil and caustic soda (alkali) possesing the characteristic soap like properties of detergents, surface tension lowering wetting and emulsifying power and gel formation. All fatty oils and fats. Are mixtures of glycoside compounds (erters) of trihydric alcohol, glycosides and some  fatty acids such as plasmatic acid the chemistry of soap manufacturing may  be expressed the following equation which is know as saponification (Anon (1964).<br/>HzCocoG5H31)3 + Na 0H        Naoco15H31      (zH31 + c3H5(oH)3 <br/>Palliation                     caustic             sodium palurtate         glycerion <br/>                                    Soda                            <br/>Amon (1964) further explain that a bactericidal soap cernirts existentially of the following 0.1 to 3% weight based on the total weight of the soap. <br/>0 to 10% by weight based on the total weight of the soap in a compound of formular <br/>R –Co-N1-CH2C00H<br/>CH3 <br/>Here R represents an alkyl or  alkenye group of 8 to carbon atoms. <br/>According to Johnson (1978) antibacterial  soap may include 2,4,4,trichloro 2,2 hydroxydiphenyl in an amount 0.05 to 5% by weight and at least one phosphorus oxyacid. Phosphorus oxyacid salt phosphoric ester is represented by<br/> (R1(oCH,CH2)<br/>R2<br/>Where R1 in (8-20 alkyl, R2 is hydrogen or  methyl and is (1-10). R1 is the same group as R2 or H alkali metal and n is H or alkali metal. Such a soap has a wide range of antibacterial activities and marked resistance of discoloration  upon exposure to sunlight (Kaw,1981) another invention relates to an autimicrobial composition consisting of ammoniated zinc sulphate optionally formulated into sufficient formulation and toilet bars. Medicated soap incorporate in their composition germicidal  agent which include hexachlorophene mercuric which trichoran, trichlorocarbaucide .<br/>Sykes (1958) described sterilization as the complete destruction of all living matters. In medical sense, it is often used in a restricted sense to refer to  the destruction of pathogenic organisms only. <br/>According to William (1979) wound is defined as disruption of cellular and anatomic continuity while its healing is the restoration of continuity.  That biological procen can only be accomplished by regeneration, cell proliferation and collage production which can be alleviated washing the would surface especially with medicated soap which due to its concert of pherolic compound help in keeping off organisms like staphylococcus aureus escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa always from the would to a certain stage. Wound can also result when the operative barrier of the skin is breached  by traumatic invasion or whether it is caused by trauma or internationally by surgery. The open area is susceptible to microbial invasion and once a would has become infected pus form in the injured area resulting to wound abbess. <br/>Baker et al decried antisepsis as the most convenient way of preventing infection usually by inhibiting the growth of bacteria. And most disinfectant when  suitably diluted have the artixeptic action. Different method are employed for the destruction of bacteria or for getting rid of them and those method can  be conveniently divided into chemical physical and mechanical methods. <br/>Baker et al (1985) explained that chemical agent function as a sterilizing agent by the following lethal mechanisms <br/>1.                  Disruption of the cell membranes <br/>2.                  Interfering with  orgymatic systems of the organisms emzyme poison) <br/>3.                  Co-aqulation of protein <br/>4.                  Oxidation  <br/> 1.1              AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>1.                  To isolate staphylococcus aureus from would infection <br/>2.                  To determine the artibacterial activity of three medicated soap on staphylococcus aureus isolated from wound infection.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>Since Dorland (1981) stated that  medicated soaps have germicidal substances like chloroxylenol pothaium, mercuric widide  trichlorocarberihide etc incorporated into them in order to greatly their antibacterial activity. It is therefore necessary to investigate the artibaterial activity of three medicated soap (Asepos carat and temperate) on staphylococcus aureus isolated from wound inflection. <br/>1.3              HYPOTHESES <br/>Medicated soap have antibacterial activity <br/>Medicated soaps have no artibaterial activity. <br/>1.4              JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY <br/>The result of the project work will indicate the antibacterial activity of medicated soap. And if favourable, then medicated soap can be used for washing the surface of manor wound before the application of further medication <br/><br/>\n\nTHE ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY OF THREE TYPES OF MEDICATED SOAPS ON STARHYROCOCCUS AUREUS FORM WOULD INFECTIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY OF THREE TYPES OF MEDICATED SOAPS ON STARHYROCOCCUS AUREUS FORM WOULD INFECTIONS", "id": 115}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CONSTRUCTION OF RC MULTISTAGE COUPLED AMPLIFIER <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The aim of this project work is to create an alternative sound amplifying circuit that will enable the enhancement of electronic production.

As pointed out earlier, this review gives an overview of some of the catalytic reactions that are useful, either on a laboratory sale or industrial scale of certain organic compounds. No attempt has been made to include all the catalytic reactions in which transition metal complexes are involved. Research has come a long way from the time of Werner and Jorgenesen, in terms of the growth that coordination Chemistry has experienced over the last few decades.  Their work was stepping stone for the development of modern inorganic Chemistry which is truly a multidisciplinary one in the present day context.  The ever increasing importance of metal complex analyzed reactions has already been discussed above. <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>The study of coordination chemistry in the modern day context began with two notable scientists, (Alfred   werner nor 2002) and sophus mads Jorgensen. Although there was considerable controversy between werner and jorgensen regarding the interpretation of their experimental results on the structures of coordination compounds, one cam now conclude that werner’s interpretation of his results is correct;. The (pioneering 19992) contribution of Werner to the study of coordination chemistry fetched him the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1913 and incidentally he is the first organic chemistry to win the coveted distinction. Despite jorgensen’s interpretation being ‘ wrong’ his contributions by no means are to be ignored. As chemists we owe a lot to these two people who contributed immensely to our understanding of the chemistry of coordination compounds. The details of the contributions of Werner and jorgensen are out of scope of this review. Soon after the reports by (Werner 2002) and (jorgensen 2006) there have been different approaches towards the study of bonding in transition metal complexes. Despite rigorous study, there still exist Laurence in the understanding of reaction mechanisms in the case of <br/>inorganic chemistry compared organic chemistry. This lack of understanding of reaction, mechanisms spills over into synthesis as well to a certain extent. Synthetic tricks are sometimes discovered that allow one to prepare a desired compound without the interference from an undesired product. Werner discovered that certain cis isomers could be prepared, from a carbonate compounds that would react with acid to generate carbon dioxide and insert two anions of the acid as ligands. The purpose review is to highlight some of the applications of transition metal compounds as catalysts, The subject matter of this review will consist of certain general principles outlining the features involved for a transition metal complex to act as a catalytis, reactions some specific catalytic reactions that are being employed in industry currently,briefly some comments on industry academia collaborations current and future  trends in catalysis, and finally  conclusion.<br/> <br/>\n\nTRANSITION METAL COMPLEXES AS CATALYST FOR ORGANIC REACTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " TRANSITION METAL COMPLEXES AS CATALYST FOR ORGANIC REACTION", "id": 117}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CONSTRUCTION OF RC MULTISTAGE COUPLED AMPLIFIER <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The aim of this project work is to create an alternative sound amplifying circuit that will enable the enhancement of electronic production.

Tiles are generally used for covering roofs floors and walls or other objects such as table tops. Another category is the ceiling tiles made from light weight materials such as perlite wood and mineral wool. The word is derived from the French word tuile which is in turn from the Latin word tegula meaning a roof tile composed of baked clay. Less precisely, the modern term can refer to any sort of construction tile or similar object such as rectangular counters used in playing games.<br/>            (Davis Langton 1998) tiles are often used to form wall and floor covering and   can range from simple square tiles to complex mosaics.<br/>            Tiles are most often made from ceramic with a hard glaze finish, but other materials are also commonly used such as glass marble, granite, slate and reformed ceramic slurry which is cast in a mould and fired, (James F Kellam 2003).<br/>            A ceramic is an inorganic non metallic solid prepared by the action of heat and subsequent cooling ceramic materials may have a crystalline or partly crystalline structure or may be amorphous (eg a glass) Because most of common ceramic are crystalline it is also in organic crystalline materials as opposed to the non crystalline glasses the  earliest ceramics were pottery (citation needed) objects or 27000 year old figurines made from clay either by itself or mixed with other materials hardened in fire. workers of ceramics (Crassostrea Iredali Oyster 2009).<br/><br/>\n\nREFURBISHMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY LABORATORY <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " REFURBISHMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY LABORATORY ", "id": 119}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ANTIMICROBIAL ACTION OF CHITOSAN AGAINST SPOILAGE ORGANISM IN OKPA<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The antimicrobial action chitosan was investigated in this study.

The principles involved in the method of food preservation are primary based on the control of the growth and activities of these microorganisms. The microorganisms responsible for food spoilage may be classified into three broad group mold, yeast and bacteria (okaka, 2005).<br/>          Bacteria such as staphylococcus aureaus and clostridium botulinum produce toxic substances while growing in certain foods, and bring about food intoxication when consumed. Food infections result from life ingestion of pathogenic organism especially bacteria, specie of the genus salmonella which invariably multiply once consumed, producing the disease (okaka, 2005).<br/>          Food stability is a major determinant of the shelf food products. Development of processes that specifically improve food stability is needed and has been the goal of mankind throughout history. What began in an empirical way with few simple processes such as smoking and salting is now a precise science, and modern food technologists have a wide range of preservative compounds at their disposal. There are concerns; however, over the long term health effects of many foods develop novel natural antimicrobial systems for use in foods and food related applications and to reduce dependence on traditional preservation (Rhoades and Rastall, 2004).<br/>          Chitosan is a technologically important and ubiquitous polysaccharide biopolymer produced by partial alkaline N-deacetylation of chitin which is commercially extracted from shrimps and crab shells. Chitosan combines unique biological characteristics which allow for a wider range of application, including biodegradability, biocompatibility and non-toxicity. Chitosan has emerged as a new biomaterial for food, pharmaceutical, medical, Textile, Agricultural and other industries, as well as waste purification (Babel et al, 2003).<br/>          In food industry, it has been shown that chotosan posses strong antimicrobial activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria including the food born pathogen such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella   typhemurim. Antimicrobial activity of chitosan is influenced by several factors which can be intrinsic and extrinsic. It has been noted that lower molecular weight chitosan have high antimicrobial activity than native chitosan (Takia et al 2002).<br/>          In recent years, chitosan and its derivative have attracted much attention as agents against fungi, bacteria and viruses, and as elicitors of plant defense mechanisms. In fact, a number of commercial applications of chitosan benefit from its antimicrobial activities, including its use in food preservation. Chitosan antimicrobial mode of action is more complex than assumed; it is not confined to as single molecular, but that killing results from a sequence of rather untargeted molecular events taking place simultaneously or successively (Bable et al 2003).<br/>          Okpa (Bambara groundnut),  voandzeia subterranean or vigna subterranean originated in West Africa and are grown primarily for its seed, which are eaten fresh as vegetable when semi-ripe, and as a pulse when dry and mature. They may be ground into flour which is used to prepare a popular steamed product known as ‘Okpa Snack’. Okpa is referred to as a complete food because it contains carbohydrate, fat, minerals, vitamins, ploy-phenols and a major source of protein in sub-saharan are the taste, firmness of the gel and the orange yellow colour imparted to the product by the red palm oil used in its preparation (Brink et at, 2006).<br/>1.1       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Okpa is a popularly known Igbo food/snack which is gaining wide acceptance by people of different ethnic groups and socio-economic classes in our society, but has very short shelf life. It has a shelf of 24-40 hours after which microbial deterioration sets in. unfortunately, no study has been carried out to identity the spoilage organisms or prevent their growth in okpa.<br/>1.2       OBJECTIVE OF STUDY<br/>1)     To determine the storage stability of okpa prepared with chitosan<br/>2)     To produce okpa with chitosan as ingredient and preservative.<br/>3)     To identify the organism that causes spoilage in okpa.<br/>4)     To produce alternative method of preservation of okpa under room temperature for a longer shelf life.<br/>1.3   JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY<br/>        Owing to the short shelf life of okpa, it is produced only in a very small scale and therefore underutilized. This work will sensitize the public   the antimicrobial action of chitosan and will further enlighten the producers and processors of okpa on a tested and trusted technique of extending the shelf life of okpa thus increasing the chances of its large scale production and making it available and convenient.<br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nANTIMICROBIAL ACTION OF CHITOSAN AGAINST SPOILAGE ORGANISM IN OKPA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANTIMICROBIAL ACTION OF CHITOSAN AGAINST SPOILAGE ORGANISM IN OKPA", "id": 120}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF PALM WINE SOLD AT UDI LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This work shows how to identify the various microorganism in palm wine and how to isolate the pathogenic organism in palm wine vie Nkwuenu and the attributes were identification of bacteria and yeast.

It is an alcoholic beverage produced by the fermentation of sugar and other fermentable materials in palm sap. The major sources of palm wine in Nigeria are eraesis guineensis thesis and raphia palm raphia hooken (Okafor, 1987). <br/>        Palm wine is usually a whitish sugary liquid, which is effervescent because the microbes causing the fermentation are alive when it is consumed. Among the land plants, the palm is very distinguished. It has a columar stem whose height range is usually between 30-50 feet (9 – 15 meters) high. The stem is crowned with giant leaves which are entire and folder fan at first, but usually the blade splits into segments and in some genera, the segments develop into independent leaves lets the inflorescence is a spike or much branched at first usually enveloped in one  or more conspicuous sheathing breaks. It manifests itself in more than two thousand species and several hundred of genera. <br/>        Elaesis guineensis is a sources of palm kernels, palm oil, palm wine and brooms in rural areas of southern Nigeria and west African in general. Palm are found in the meadows, stepper, and deserts on the mountains and all though the tropical and sub tropical forests of West Africa (faparsus, 1973).       <br/>        Okafor, (1977) reported the following genera of bacteria in palm wine such as lactobacillus, savina, corynbacterium, leuconostoc, and yeast so far reported as being present included saccharomyces pasturianius, s. ellipsordeus, s. cerevisae, s. markie etc. it is noted that the sources of this micerboes is from when the palm sap enter the calabash, it ferments spontaneously by the activities of their microbes (yeast and bacteria) which find their way into the palm sap from old palm wine crust present in the calabash, other sources of these microbes includes the tapper’s Knife, the Bamboo, funnel through which the sap drips, the air and bark of male inflorescence.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>        Bacteria are found in palm wine some of this bacteria are lactobacillus, streptococcus, candida, spp, pichia spp etc in different palm wine shops at Udi Local Government  Area of Enugu state. For palm wine sellers, palm wine are kept uncovered from the time they finish selling it. Such exposure can allow the growth of microorganism in the palm wine. When it is  been consumed this can cause vomiting, fever, stomach problem etc. <br/>        Thus, this problem lies at the unhygienic and poor preservation of the palm wine tapers and dealers. <br/>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF STUDY <br/>Aim: Bacteriological examination of palm wine <br/> To identify the various microorganisms in palm wine <br/>To isolate the pathogenic organisms. <br/>1.4   HYPOTHESIS <br/>H0:    The microbes found in palm wine are only yeast and bacteria. <br/>H1:    The microbes found in palm wine are not only yeast and bacteria. <br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>        This is to bring to the knowledge of the general public that palm wine contains microbes; these microbes can be from the bamboo, funnel, and tapers knife etc that is mostly common when they are stored at low temperature. <br/><br/>\n\nBACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF PALM WINE SOLD AT UDI LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF PALM WINE SOLD AT UDI LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA ", "id": 121}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CALIBRATION AND APPLICATION OF CATHODE RAY OSCILLOSCOPE IN OUR LABORATORY<br/>ABSTRACT</b> <br/>The cathode ray Oscilloscope plays a very important role in the laboratories, for instance it is used to measure frequency and voltage of a signal it is equally used for study current fluctuation in electric power supply the cathode ray oscilloscope is made up of three major part, they are the cathode ray tube, which is the major integral part A the Oscilloscope also the other important[1 parts of the Oscilloscope is the power supply unit and the vertical as well as horizontal amplifier.

This is usually done by displaying a time-varying potential (voltage) potential (voltage) on the vertical axis (y), anytime on the horizontal axis. This is called the “y-t” mode. Most oscilloscope also allow the horizontal axis to be driven with another time varying potential.  In this mode, the horizontal axis is called the x- axis, and this is called the x-y mode common with the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) has much in tube of the TV sets. A hot wire filament heats a metal cathode which then emits electrons. These electrons are accelerated by a high potential (typically 10kv), collimated in to a narrow beam and focused to a small spot on the front of the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT). They give up their energy to the atoms in the phosphor coating on the front of the tube.  These excited atoms quickly give up their energy in the form of light.  Thus, the small spot struck by the election beam give off visible light.  The struck by electron beam give off visible light.  The beams is aimed as a particular spot on the phosphor screen by two pair of electrostatic deflecting plates, one set to deflect the beam up or down and the other to deflect the beam left or right (Bruce D, 1969).<br/>The deflecting plates potential are controlled by the output of two independent electronic amplifier while the horizontal amplifier is driven by saw tooth wave generator (within the Oscillioscope).  The saw tooth generator drives the electron beam horizontally at a constant speed, then quickly returns it to sweep again.  The right-to-left motion is usually so rapid that the eye cannot follow the motion, and only the left to right sweep is seen.  The phosphor coating of the screen has persistence which causes it to glow for a short time after being excited. The persistence of the screen and the persistence of the human eye (vision) combine to produce a flicker free illusion of a continuously traced graph (Paul, 2000).<br/>Both the vertical and horizontal amplifier has precisely calibrated gain (Amplitude) controls which makes it possible to determine potential and time intervals accurately from measurements on the face of the CRT.  The sweep generator of the older oscillioscope can only be adjusted in frequency. It is often tricky to stabilize the screen of such a scope.  More sophisticated Oscillioscope also have a “trigger’ mode in which the sweeps is initiated (triggered) by an electric signal.<br/>One can choose whether the triggering signal is Internal or from an EXTERNAL signal.  Usually one can set the sign and size of the voltage required to trigger the sweep.  Some even allow you to choose to trigger on voltage level or on the slope of wave form (Wedlock, 1969).<br/>        Mostly a “time base’ generator.  But oscillioscope generally have some provision to deflect the beam with an external signal modern oscillioscope often have two independent Amplifiers which may be used simultaneously.  Each is called a channel and such an oscillioscope is a “dual channel” oscillioscope.  Dual channel oscillioscope can display two different signals simultaneously on the screen, and may have the capability to display their sum or their differences.<br/>David et al, (2001) highlighted that Cathode Ray oscillioscope (CRO) is a common laboratory instrument that provides accurate time and amplitude measurement of voltage signal over a wide range of frequencies. Its reliability, stability and ease of operation makes it suitable as a general purpose laboratory instrument.  The heart of cathode ray oscillioscope (CRO) is the cathode ray tube.  The cathode ray is a beam of electrons which are emitted by the heated cathode and accelerated towards the fluorescent screen.  The assembly of the cathode, intensity grid, and accelerating anode is called the “ELECTRON GUN”. Its purpose is to generate the electron beam and control its intensity and focus.  Between the electron gun and the fluorescent screen, are two pairs of metal plates. One oriented to provide horizontal and vertical defecting plates.  The combination of these two deflections, allows the beam to reach any portion of the fluorescent screen.  Wherever the electron beam hits the screen, the phosphor is excited and light is emitted from that point.  This conversion of electron energy into lights allows us to write with points of light on an otherwise darkened screen (Roberge, 1969).<br/>In the most common use of the oscillioscope, the signal to be studies is first amplified and then applied to the vertical plates to deflect the beam vertically and at the same time a voltage that increase linearly with time is applied to the horizontal plates thus, causing the beam to be deflected horizontal at a uniform rate.  The signal applied to the vertical plates is thus, displayed on the scream as a function of time.  The horizontal axis serves as a uniform time scale.  The linear deflection or sweep of the beam horizontal is accomplished by use of a sweep generator that is incorporated in the oscillioscope circuitry.  The voltage output of such a generator is that of a saw-tooth <br/>        Application of one cycle of this voltage difference, which increase. Linearly with time, to the horizontal plates causes the beam to be deflected linearly with time across the tube face.  When the voltage suddenly fall to zero as at point a, b, and c.  The end of each sweep, the beam flies back to the initial position.  The horizontal deflection of the beam is repeated periodically, the frequency of this periodicity is adjusted by external controls (Kieth, 1995.)<br/>1.2       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>To know the calibration and application of cathode ray oscilloscope in the laboratories.<br/>1.3       DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Amplitude: This is the maximum displacement of a particle from its mean position.<br/>Peak Voltage: This is the maximum voltage.<br/>Time Period: This is the time taken for the sign to complete one cycle.<br/>Wave number: This is defined as 2 times the reciprocal of the wavelength (K =2/).<br/>Wave Velocity: This is the distance a wave signal covers in a given time.<br/><br/>\n\nCALIBRATION AND APPLICATION OF CATHODE RAY OSCILLOSCOPE IN OUR LABORATORY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CALIBRATION AND APPLICATION OF CATHODE RAY OSCILLOSCOPE IN OUR LABORATORY", "id": 122}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>DETERMINATION OF CHLORINE CONTENT IN WATER  FROM AJALLI SOURCE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Determination of the chlorine content in water from Ajali sources was carried out in the laboratory.  Chlorination has been a method for the treatment of drinking water and chlorine being an excellent disinfectant is the sole element for this practice.  The world health organization (WHO) and National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) set out standard chlorine adequate for drinking water which is given as 200mg/l.  This research work is based on the determination of chlorine content in raw Ajali water, treated reservoir water and Tap water.

Most people cannot detect the presence of chlorine on water  amount (1.0mg/l).  although 1.0mg/l chlorine in water is not harmful to people, it does cause problems to fish and other aquatic animals when they are expose to it over along period of time.  It is very important for  water suppliers to monitor closely the level of chlorine present in the water (Hodges 1997).<br/>RISK OF WATERBORNE DISEASE<br/>        Where adequate water treatment is not readily available, the impact on public health can be devastating (White, 2002), would.  Worldwide, about 1.2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water and twice that number may have adequate sanitation (Christian et al, 2001).  As a result the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.4 million people mostly children die, every year from water related diseases.  Rideal etal (2005). Even where treatment is widely practiced constant vigilance is required to guard against  waterborne disease outbreaks.<br/>        Well known pathogens such as E coli are easily controlled with  chlorination but  can cause deadly outbreak give condition if inadequate  or disinfection (Richardson, et al 2007).  Some emerging pathogens like osporiolianare resistance to chlorination and can appear even in high quality water supplies.  Cryptosporidium was the cause of the longest reported drink water in United state (Craun et al, 2002).  The new regulation from U.S Environmental Protection Agency will require water system to monitor cryptosporidium and adopt a range of treatment options based on source water cryptosporidium concentrations.  Most water systems are expected to meet EPA  requirement while continuing to use chlorination.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>There has been high prevalence of water borne disease in<br/>Enugu metropolis judging from the hospital statistics hence the need to know if the cause has been from the method of water treatment employed in the purification of drinking water supplied to the municipality.<br/>1.3       AIMS  OF THE STUDY<br/>-              To determine the chlorine content to water from Ajalli water source.<br/>-              To compare the chlorine content in he drinking water in Enugu metropolis with  World Health Organization standard.<br/>-              The study will also evaluate the effect of bad water chlorination and the harms of indisinfecter drinking water.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCES OF THESTUDY<br/>This research work is meant to elucidate the actual concentration of chlorine in Enugu drinking water  and to make known the processes or steps taken in the treatment of the water.  Also to establish whether some prevalent disease could be traced to the way drinking water in Enugu is treated.<br/>1.5  SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>          This research work is limited to the determination of the chlorine content in raw Ajalli water source the treatment of water and the tap water within Enugu.<br/> <br/>\n\nDETERMINATION OF CHLORINE CONTENT IN WATER  FROM AJALLI SOURCE\r\n\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DETERMINATION OF CHLORINE CONTENT IN WATER  FROM AJALLI SOURCE\r\n\r\n", "id": 123}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EUTROPHICATION AND WATER POLLUTION<br/>ABSTRACT </b><br/>Eutrophication and water pollution is the increase in the rate of supply of organic matter in an ecosystem.  It deals with the acquiring of water body to a high concentration of nutrient especially phosphate and nitrate that promote excessive growth of algae.  Eutrophication causes pollution in water.  It is chemical, physical or biological change in the quality of water that has a harmful effect on anything that drinks or uses it.

Food that contains a toxin, chemical or infectious agent (like a bacterium, virus, parasite or prion) and causes symptoms in the body are considered types of food poisoning by most investigators.<br/>Those symptoms may be related only to the gastrointestinal tract causing vomiting or diarrhea or may involve other organs such as the kidney, brain or muscle. (Charles, 2011).<br/> Tribe et al., (2008) explains that food poisoning usually arises from improper handling, preparation or food storage. Good hygiene practice before, during and after food preparation can reduce the chances of contracting an illness. There is a consensus in the public health community that regular hand washing is one of the most effective defenses against the spread of food borne disease. The action of monitoring food to ensure that it will not cause food poisoning or diseases can also be caused by a large variety of toxins that affect the environment. Food borne illness can also be caused by substances like poisonous mushrooms or pathogenic microorganisms.<br/> Tribe et al., (2008) further explains that bacteria are common cause of food borne illness. He further points out that in Nigeria during 2000, the individual bacteria involved were as follows.<br/>Campylobacter jejumi 77.3%, salmonella 20.9%, Esherichia coli 1.4% and all other less than 0.1%.<br/>In the past, bacterial infections were thought to be more preventive because few places had the capability to test for the particular agent. <br/>Symptoms for bacterial infections are delayed because the bacteria need time to multiply. They are usually not seen until 12 – 72 hours or more after eating contaminated food.<br/> Marases et al., (2007) highlighted that food poisoning/food borne diseases is caused by eating food or drinking beverages contaminated with bacteria, parasites or viruses. He further states that harmful chemicals can also cause food borne disease. If they have contaminated food during harvesting or processing. Food poisoning can cause symptoms which include diarrhea, fever, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and dehydration. Most food borne infections are undiagnosed and unreported, though the center for disease control and prevention estimates that every year, about 76 million people in the United States become ill from pathogens or disease causing substance in food, (Katon and Chessbrought 2000).<br/> Joffe, et al., (2002) pointed out that harmful bacteria are the most common cause of food borne illness or food poisoning. Some bacteria may be present in foods when they are purchased. Raw foods are the most common sources of food poisoning because they are not sterile. Examples includes: raw meat and poultry that may have become contaminated during slaughter. Sea food may become contaminated during harvest or through processing. One in 10,000 eggs may be contaminated with salmonella spp inside the egg shall. Products such as spinach, lettuce, tomatoes, spronts and melons can become contaminated with Salmonella, Shigella or Esherichia coli. during growth or through processing and distribution. Contamination may also occur, during food preparation in a restaurant or at home kitchen.<br/> Robert, et al., (2007) states that the most common contamination from handled food is by a group of viruses known as the Norwalls. Infected kitchen workers can contaminate a salad or sandwich as they prepare it, if they have the virus on their hands.<br/>1.2       CAUSES OF FOOD POISONING<br/>Mayo, (2011) explains that contamination of food can happen at any point during its production, growing, homewashing, processing, storing, shopping, or preparing. Cross contaminate the transfer of harmful organisms from one surface to another is often the cause. This is especially troublesome for raw, ready – to – eat food, such as salads or other product. Because these foods are not cooked, harmful organisms aren’t destroyed before they can cause food poisoning.<br/>The major causes of food poisoning are as follows, bacteria, viruses and parasitic organism.<br/>The organisms are as follows:<br/>-      Campylobacter<br/>-      Clostridium butulinum<br/>-      Esherichia Coli 0157H7<br/>-      Circadian Limbia<br/>-      Hepatitis A<br/>-      Listeria<br/>-      Rotavirus<br/>-      Noroviruses (Norwalk like viruses)<br/>-      Staphylococcus aures<br/>-      Shigella <br/>  TABLE I: COMMON CONTAMINANTS, FOOD AFFECTED AND MEANS OF TRANSMISSION.<br/>Contaminants     Onset of symptoms     Foods affected and means of transmission<br/>1. Camplobacter    2 to 5 days    Meat and poultry contamination occurs during processing of animal feaces contact meat surfaces. Other source includes unpasturized milk <br/>2. Clostridium butulimum    12 to 72 hours    Home canned food with low acidity, improperly canned commercial foods, smoked or salted fish, potatoes baked in aluminum foil and other foods kept at warm temperature for too long.<br/>3. Esherichia Coli 0157H7    1 to 8 days    Beef contaminated with feaces during slaughter spread mainly by undercooked ground beef. Other sources include unpasturized milk and apple cider, alfalta sprouts and contaminated water.<br/>4. Staphylococus aures.    1 to 6 hours    Meat and prepared salad cream, sauces and cream filled pastries can be spread by hand contact, coughing and sneezing. <br/>5. Shigella    24 to 48 hours    Sea food and raw, ready –to – eat produce can be spread by an infected food handlers.<br/>6. Rotavirus    1 to 3 days    Raw, ready –to- eat produce can be spread by an infected food handler.<br/>7. Listeria    9 to 48 hours    Hot dogs, luncheon meats, unpasturized milk and cheeses and unwashed raw produce can be spread through contaminated soil and water.<br/>8. Norovirus. (Norwalk like viruses)    12 to 48 hours    Raw ready to eat produce and shellfish from contaminated water can be spread by an infected food handler. <br/>Source: Mayo, (2011)<br/> According to Linda (2011), food poisoning can affect one person or group of people who all ate the same contaminated food. It more commonly occurs after eating at picnics, school cafeterias, large social functions or restaurant. The germs may get into the food you eat (called contamination) in different ways which includes: <br/>Meat or poultry can come into contact with bacteria from the intestine of an animal that is being growing or shopping can contain animal or human waste and food handling or preparation in grocery stores, restaurants or homes.<br/> Arnon, et al., (2007) explain that salmonella is a common cause of food borne illness, particularly is undercooked chicken and chicken eggs. Food borne illness, commonly called “food poisoning” is caused by bacteria, toxins, viruses, parasite, and prions.<br/> Williams (2009), also explained that roughly 7 million people die of food poisoning each year, with about 10 times as many suffering from a non fatal case. The two most common factors leading to cases of bacteria food poisoning are cross contamination of ready – to - eat food from other uncooked foods and improper temperature control. Less commonly, adverse reaction can also occur if chemical contamination of food occurs. For example, improper storage or use of non-food grade soaps and disinfectants.<br/>Again, when food is cooked and left out for more than 2 hours at room temperature, bacteria can multiply quickly. Most bacteria grow undetected because they don’t produce a bad odour or change the colour or texture of the food. Freezing food shows or stop bacteria growth but does not destroy bacteria.<br/>1.3    FOOD POISONING AND FOOD SPOILAGE ORGANISMS<br/>Danilo (2009), states that food poisoning (known as food borne illness or food borne disease is any illness that results from eating contaminated food.<br/>Bacteria and viruses are the most common cause of food poisoning. The symptom and severity of food poisoning vary depending on which bacteria or virus that has contaminated the food.<br/>The bacteria and virus that causes the most illness, hospitalizations and death includes;<br/>-      Salmonella<br/>-      Norovirus<br/>-      Compylobacter<br/>-      E.coli<br/>-      Lesteria<br/>-      Clostridium perferingens<br/>1.4    FACTORS THAT ENCOURAGES FOOD POISONING<br/>The common factor that encourages food poisoning are as follows:<br/>i.      Contamination by food utensil<br/>ii.      Improper storage of food at room temperature<br/>iii.     Inadequate cooking and re-heating of food <br/>iv.     Poor personal hygiene of food handlers<br/>v.     Cross contamination from raw to ready to eat foods.<br/> 1.      CONTAMINATION BY FOOD UTENSIL: Live tissue on animal is essential sterile but it is during food preparation that it can become contaminated at any stage of the process. The most critical stages are skinning and evisceration as it is the hide and intestines that contains the animal micro-flora along with organism present in the feaces and soil. Abattoirs hygiene must be kept to a very high standard to present contamination from faecal mutter and other carcess like knife, plates etc. E coli is most commonly associated organism.<br/>2.      IMPROPER STORAGE OF FOOD AT ROOM TEMPERATURE: Proper storage of food can help reduce and prevent food contamination. After grocery shopping, store perishable foods in the refrigerator should be kept at 40 degree Fahreheit. Some bacteria such as listeria can survive and grow even at low temperature. Thus even foods stored in the refrigerator won’t last forever. Throw away all foods that have passed their expiration date or hake been opened for longer than recommended.<br/>3.      INADEQUATE COOKING AND RE-HEATING OF FOOD: Both raw and cooked food must be regularly checked to prevent microbial growth. Food that is being retreated must be reheated to a temperature of approx 700°c to ensure any organism growing are destroyed prior to consumption. The most common food poisoning organism Campylobacter jejuni is most often associated with undercooked chicken<br/>4.      POOR PERSONAL HYGIENE OF FOOD HANDLERS: Unhygienic food handling promotes contamination and spread of food borne illness/food poisoning. Unwashed hands can transfer harmful microbes to your food. Wash your hands with soap and water before and after handling food. Raw food as poultry, seafood and meat contain microbes that can spread to your cooking surface and other ingredients if you do not handle them properly. Prevent contact with raw meat and fresh food and secure raw juice from leaking and contaminating other ingredients by using plastics containers, wash your hands, cutting boards, utensils and kitchen surface immediately after you handle raw meat.<br/>5.      CROSS CONTAMINATION FROM RAW TO READY TO EAT FOOD: Although it may not seem so but fresh vegetables and fruits can also contain microbes ad washing your fresh foods before eating or using them in salads helps prevent contamination. The surface of these foods can contain microbes acquired from a variety of sources during harvest, storage and transport. Use warm water to rinse all clean vegetables and fruits and use a brush for foods that contain dirt such as potatoes, carrots and mushrooms.<br/>1.5    COMPLICATIONS OF FOOD POISONING<br/>Hughes, et al., (2009) states that dehydration is the most common complication. This can occur from any causes of food poisoning. Less common, but much more serious complications depend on the bacteria that are covering food poisoning.<br/>These may include:<br/>-      Arthritis<br/>-      Bleeding problems<br/>-      Damage to the nerves system.<br/>-      Kidney problem<br/>-      Swelling or irritation in the tissue around the heart.<br/> Robert (2007), points out that in some people especially children, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) can result from infection by a particular bacteria especially pathogenic Echerichia coli and can lead to kidney failure and death. HUS is a rear disorder that affects primarily children between the ages of 1 and 10 years and is the leading cause. <br/> <br/>\n\nFOOD POSIONING, IT'S CAUSES, EFFECT AND CONTROL<div

that causes acquired Immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) a condition that slowly destroys the body Immune system and makes the body vulnerable to infections.  The virus is typically called Human Immunodeficiency  virus (HIV) because it destroys the Immune system of the individual which is responsible for protecting the individual from disease.  The immunodeficiency associated with, HIV infection can be enormous, and it is the major cause of death, due to the disfucntion of immune system.  The problem with AIDS is , sits neurological dementia complex.  HIV is a lentivirus, a subgroup of retrovirus.  The  family of virus is known for  lafency, persistent viremia, infection of the nervous system and weak hot immune system.  Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is small ultra-microscopic organism that infect living things and uses them to make copies of itself when one’s Immune system is damaged by HIV, AIDS take place (Gallants, 1999).<br/>HIV was first recognized in 1981 in Homosexual men in New York city.  In the united states the HIV is now known to have originated from chimpanzees, transmission from chimps to human.  Initially, there was wild speculation about what might be the cause of AIDs, but in 1982, the centre for disease control had convincing epidermological evidence that AIDS was caused by a new infectious agents.<br/>            Dulbecco et-al (1983, located small quantities of the new virus named Lymphademopalty virus (LAN) but enough to be used an antigenina blood test which showed that AIDS patients were infected with the virus.  WHO, (19097), responded that the number of patients living with AIDS has escaculated, a figure of 9000 was confirmed by may 1997.  In African AIDs was first responded in 1982.  In Nigerian it was first responded in 1986, among commercial sex workers in Lagos and calabar.  In 2003 the seroprevalence has been on the increase, despite the comprehensive and successful prevention effort in many part of the would, 4. 1 million new HIV infection was expected to have occurs  In 2003 alone, which could have been contributed by an estimated 9,020 to 10,000 infection per day.<br/> Currently, the health problem in Nigerian considering reports from various hospitals particularly, the tertiary hospitals, place  AIDS infections in Nigerian at a very serious state.  the potential and propensity for widespread is enormous and the debilitating and negative effect n the economy, the population category affected the working class and the dependents which constitute the penultimate individuals to the working class.  HIV infections in this direction and orientation should be healed as a national emergency in Nigeria.<br/>Meanwhile, Dr.  Robert Gallo’s laboratory begin recovering a virus from AIDS patient, and reported the finding in the science journal.  A  number of these vinal isolated was introduced together into continuous cell cultures to see if a strain of the virus could replicate in the cells one did replicates and Gallo’s named the virus HILV. III because of the resemblance to two human T-lymphotropic viruses.  (Neser, 2001).<br/>By 2004, it was shown that many esymtomatic people  was infected with virus and could transmits it and that the epidemic was far more extensive than previously suspected.  Blood test was generally available for routine testing to donate blood.  Thus markedly improving the safety of blood transfusion and products prepared from pooled blood (peiperls, 1995)<br/>1.1       Hypothesis<br/>H.O:    There is significant difference in the result of Westernblots (WB), Enzymes Linked Immuno (Elisa) and Radiommuneoassay kit among HIV carriers.<br/>HI:      There is no significant difference in the result of  Enzymes linked – immurosorbentassay (Elise), Western blots (WB), and Radommunoasay kit (RIA) among HIV carriers.<br/>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>            To evalulate the current techniques used in the diagnosis of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).<br/>            To help recommend the best and most reliable one essaying HIV<br/>1.3       Statement of problems<br/>            The major problem with HIV/AIDs in developing would has been the failure to set realistic priorities with respect to both research and control.<br/>            As  clinical diagnosis fail to effectively by emphasis on the virus attack is they are increasing case on HIV infection.  Some specific techniques are use

rows of kernels that are than protected by the silk-like threads called “corn silk” and encased in a husk. Corn is known scientifically or Zee Mays.  This moniker reflects its traditional name, Maize, by which it was known to the Native Americans as well as many other cultures throughout the world.  Although we often associate corn with the colour yellow, it actually comes in host of different varieties featuring an array of different colors, including red, pink, black, purple and blue.  Although corn is now available in markets years round, it is the locally grown varieties that you can purchase during the summer months that not only tastes the best but are usually the least expensive (Pitt and Hocking, et al 2009).<br/>From the time when primitive man began to cultivate crops and store food, spoilage fungi have demanded their tithe.  Fuzzes, powders and slimes of white or black, green, orange, red and brown are signs of silently invading, acidifying, fermenting, discoloring and disintegrating microbes rending commodities unpalatable or unsafe (Pitt and Hocking 2002). Pitt and Hocking 2009, also stated that in a prophetic article warned of the danger from common spoilage fungi.  Since 1960, a seemingly endless dream of pathogenic fungi discovered.  On these ground alone, the statemen “it is only a mould” is no longer acceptable to microbiologist, health inspectors or consumers.  The demand for accurate identification and characterization of food spoilage fungi has become urgent.  <br/>This research work is focused on corn and its spoilage organisms.  It set out to document current knowledge on the interaction of corn and fungi in the context of spoilage.  Area covered are how the fungi is isolated using the suitable best media and identification of corn spoilage fungi.  Mycologist develop preference and peculiaritie of the type of fungi that are routinely grown.  Media will affect colony morphology and color whether particular structures are formed or not, and may affect whether the fungus will be even in culture (Hunt et al, 2004).<br/>1.1    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>          Corn (Zea Mays) is a grain grown by farmers in various parts of the world especially in Africa.  Its spoilage most times limits its availability to consumers and causes economic waste to farmers. Corn is mostly spoiled by fungi.  The identification and characterization of these spoilage organisms will go a long way to profer solution on matter how little to this problem of corn spoilage.<br/>1.2       AIMS/OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>To microbiologically evaluate and identify fungi involved in corn spoilage using maize as case study.<br/>1.3       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>The study will help in the acquisition of the knowledge of fungi associated or involved in the spoilage of corn, factors that enhance spoilage of corn and the risk involved in the consumption of spoilt corn. <br/>          <br/>\n\nISOLATION AND CHARATERIZATION OF FUNGI ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPOILAGE OF CORN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ISOLATION AND CHARATERIZATION OF FUNGI ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPOILAGE OF CORN", "id": 127}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PRODUCTION OF MIXED SPICES USING CURRY LEAF (OCIMUM BASILLICUM) AND <br/>(OCIMUM GRATTISSIUM)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The project was based on production of mixed spices using scent leaf and curry leaf.

Sometimes a spice is used to hide other flavours.          Spices can also be a sort of substances (e.g ginger, nutmerg, cinnamon, cloves etc), used to flavor food.<br/>        The universal use of spices to flavor food implies its attributes to impact as well as improve unappetizing and unpalatable food. Though such food may be attractive to look at or balance nutritionally, without good aroma and taste, the essential reflexes require and digestive processes may not be activated (health, 1978). Eating of such will not be pleasurable or fully consummated. The properties and characteristics of spices have been summarized by Johnson and Peterson (1774) as the ability to give flavor to a flavourless base to impact a different character to the basic product. Boost intrinsic flavours which would otherwise be too weak and disguise objectionable intrinsic flavor.<br/>        Spices are distinguished from herbs which are part of leafy greens plants also used for flavouring or as garnish.<br/>        Many spices have antimicrobial properties. This may explain why spices are more commonly used in warmer climate, which have more infections disease and why use of spices is especially prominent in meat which is susceptible to spoiling.<br/>        A spice may have an extra use, usually medicinal, religion ritual, cosmetics or perfume production or as a vegetable. For example, turmeric roots are consumed as a vegetable and garlic as an antibiotic.<br/>        Curry leaf and scent leaf are known as African basil or wild basil, these spices belong to plantae kingdom, they are angiosperms and the order is lamiales in the family of lamiaceae genus ocimum specie. The spices originated from hawau where they serve as a major part of the food due to reasons like flavouring agents in foods, preservatives, medicinal value as well as appetizing agent in foods.<br/>        Ocimum specie comprises of ocimum basillium and ocimum grattisium among others. Ocim,um bassilium (curry leaf) is known to be an important seasoning leaf in the Igbo land. It is often used in cooking of foods like ice, yam portage, stew etc. it is been used with ocimum grattisium (scent leaf) to give a more pronounced flavor and aroma to the food. These leaves can be pluralized. The effect of the drying temperature (if not controlled, the preparation or production process as well as the level of exposure to air when chopped are of paramount importance in the production of the leaves. These spices serve based on the type of food they are used for.<br/>        The botanical name of these spices are ocimum basillicum (curry leaf) and ocimum grattisium (scent leaf/nchuanwu).<br/>1.2    USES/USEFULNESS<br/>Ocimum basilicum (curry leaf) is one of the ingredients of Indian curries, cooked vegetables, salads, chutneys and spices.     <br/>Curry leaves are useful in all kinds of medical treatment and cooking methods as well. Curry leaf improve functioning of the stomach and small intestine and help to carryout their actions. They improve the quality of digestion.<br/>Ocimum grattisium (nchuanwu) is extensively used through west Africa as a febrifuge, anti-convulsant. The crushed leaf juice is used in the treatment of convulsion, stomach pain and catarrh. oil from the leaves have been found to posses antseptic, anti bacterial and anti fungal activities (C.N Ezekwesili et all, 2004). In the coastal area of Nigeria, the plant is used in the treatment of epilepsy (Osifom, 1992) high fever (oliver, 1980) and diarrhea (oliver, 1980 and sofowara, 1993).<br/>These spices require a well drained of fertile loamy soil. They grow to height of 2cm – 3cm and require moderate rainfall and sundry, most often propagated in the months of April and may using the seedlings with a planting space of 20cm2 to 30cm per stand on flat.<br/>The maturity time is not determined since its vegetative can be used in preparing food as early as they grow out but the scent and aroma is more pronounced when the leaves grow older (Ugochukwu O.C 1999).<br/>Spices comprise of Allium sativium (Ginger), capsicum specie (peppe) to mention but a few. These spices are made up of food components like, mineral, vitamins and water, though they can be found to contain 66.3% moisture (water), 1.0% fat, 6.1 protein, 6.1% carbohydrate, 6.4% crude fibre 4.2% mineral, 814mg of calcium, 600mg phosphorus, 3.1mg of iron, 600mg of carotene (vitaimin A) and 4mg/100g vitamin c.<br/>Ocimum basillium  and ocimum grattisium can be identified by their leaves i.e  dark green, aromatic and slightly bitter in taste. Their roots is of a fibrous specie and its height is considerable production of mixed spices depend on the productivity, this in turn show the appetizing values of such food samples (spices). In respect to food savory, taste and aroma.<br/>The production of mixed spices, ocimum Basillicum and ocimum grattissium (curry and scent leaves) is of interest in food spicing or seasoning.<br/>1.3    AIMS OF THE STUDY<br/>        To produce mixed spices from curry leaf and scent leaf (nchuanwu) in a different ratio by ranging from (curry leaf) and (scent leaf) as: (100:0 sample A), (90:10, sample B), (80:20 sample C), (70:30 sample D), (60:40 sample E), (50:50 sample F), (0:100 samples G) (10:90 sample H), (20:80 sample), (30:70 sample J), (40:60 sample K).<br/>1.4

synonymous with summon than freshly picked corn on the cob?  Corn grows in “ears, each of which is covered in rows of kernels that are then protected by the silk-like threads called “corn silk” and encased in a husk. Corn is known scientifically as Zea Mays.  This moniker reflects its traditional name, Maize, by which it was known to the Native Americans as well as many other cultures throughout the world.  Although we often associate corn with the colour yellow, it actually comes in host of different varieties featuring an array of different colors, including red, pink, black, purple and blue.  Although corn is now available in markets years round, it is the locally grown varieties that you can purchase during the summer months that not only tastes the best but are usually the least expensive (Pitt and Hocking, et al., 2009).<br/>From the time when primitive man began to cultivate crops and store food, spoilage fungi have demanded their tithe.  Fuzzes, powders and slimes of white or black, green, orange, red and brown are signs of silently invading, acidifying, fermenting, discoloring and disintegrating microbes rending commodities unpalatable or unsafe (Pitt and Hocking 2002). Pitt and Hocking 2009, also stated that in a prophetic article warned of the danger from common spoilage fungi.  Since 1960, a seemingly endless dream of pathogenic fungi discovered.  On these ground alone, the statement “it is only a mould” is no longer acceptable to microbiologist, health inspectors or consumers.  The demand for accurate identification and characterization of food spoilage fungi has become urgent.  <br/>This research work is focused on corn and its spoilage organisms.  It set out to document current knowledge on the interaction of corn and fungi in the context of spoilage.  Area covered are how the fungi is isolated using the suitable best media and identification of corn spoilage fungi.  Mycologist develops preference and peculiarities of the type of fungi that are routinely grown.  Media will affect colony morphology and color whether particular structures are formed or not, and may affect whether the fungus will be even in culture (Hunt et al, 2004).<br/>1.1    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>          Corn (Zea Mays) is a grain grown by farmers in various parts of the world especially in Africa.  Its spoilage most times limits its availability to consumers and causes economic waste to farmers. Corn is mostly spoiled by fungi.  The identification and characterization of these spoilage organisms will go a long way to profer solution on matter how little to this problem of corn spoilage.<br/>1.2       AIMS/OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>To microbiologically evaluate and identify fungi involved in corn spoilage using maize as case study.<br/>1.3       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>The study will help in the acquisition of the knowledge of fungi associated or involved in the spoilage of corn, factors that enhance spoilage of corn and the risk involved in the consumption of spoilt corn. <br/> <br/>\n\nISOLATION, IDENTIFICATION AND CHARATERIZATION OF FUNGI ASSOCIATED \r\nWITH THE SPOILAGE OF CORN\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ISOLATION, IDENTIFICATION AND CHARATERIZATION OF FUNGI ASSOCIATED \r\nWITH THE SPOILAGE OF CORN\r\n", "id": 129}]
