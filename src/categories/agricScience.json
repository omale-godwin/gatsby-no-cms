[{"content": "<div class=\"abstract\"> \n  INTRODUCTION<br/>       This feasibility study is centered on cassava farming in oronigbe oriowo local government area, Edo State Nigeria, between January/March 2018.The business will be a own Eseosa cassava farm venture registered under coperate affair commission (CAC) business wholly owned by ME with the intention of recruiting young youths in Nigeria.<br/>The abundance endowment of the  mineral resources have not reflected in the country GDP and over dependent on the government to create job for our citizen result from the public sector driving the economic like Nigeria made a lot of our youth frustrated after graduation from the university. <br/>        From the research that was carried out, it was discovered with the increasingly diverse use of cassava product in Nigeria, cassava farming is getting more lucrative with every passing day. This farm product has always being a source of livelihood and for food for millions of Nigerian. 90% of Nigerian households consume cassava product every day. Some of the meals are; Garri, Wheat, Flour, Animal feed, Commercial caramel, and lots more.<br/>        As the population of Nigeria and Africa as a whole continues to grow, the demand for cassava products will continue to sky rocket, leading to higher revenue generated by cassava farmers. Thus wide spread consumption of cassava product will continue to place it as a cash product that always get bought after a harvest, and guarantees a good profit after sales.<br/>        The venture will help in providence employment involving young youths and graduates or more, meeting the demand of cassava and other related products and making the price affordable.<br/><br/>BUSINESS DESCRIPTION<br/>     The venture(firm) to be established is a cassava farm that will concentrate on the production of mainly garri and other related product because of the fund required, the venture will start as a small scale business having a population of Nigeria as the target market.<br/>       The firm is entirely a new firm to be started from the scratch. However, the venture is not an entirely new innovation as a lot of people ventured into cassava farming but usually have lack of capital as an hindrance. Capital hinders a lot of business activities from taking of. But with the economic recession being experienced in Nigeria, the Nigeria government through the country's bank of agriculture (BOA) have now made more agriculture loans available to millions of potential and active farmers. Taking advantage of the government agricultural loans and incentives at this time became a good way for us to start up our own cassava farm.<br/><br/>GOAL AND VISION OF THE BUSINESS IDEA<br/>      The Goal of the business is: To increase income by at least #140,000 every year in 1.8million farm families and to add a million jobs to the cassava sub-sector in Nigeria through a doubling of production, processing and marketing of cassava in the cassava growing belt of Nigeria over a period of time.<br/>      The vision of the business is: To assist, promote and encourage the production, processing and marketing of cassava products in Africa, particularly in Nigeria leading to job creation, poverty alleviation and industrialization of the continent.<br/><br/> \n\nFEASIBILITY STUDY ON CASSAVA FARMING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete business plan</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FEASIBILITY STUDY ON CASSAVA FARMING", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\"> \nABSTRACT<br/>A feasibility study report on the setting up of a 200 capacity snail farm enterprise at Koro farm garden, Gure town in Bori, Rivers State, Nigeria was conducted to determine if the business idea was feasible and to assess its impacts on the people. The business was named Evergreen Snail Products and Services Nigeria Limited (ESPS).It made available good quality and a very prolific Achatina achatina species of the African giant land snail that provided a substantial source of protein to complement our usual carbohydrate meals. The ESPS was run on both part and full time basis and with a startup capital of N255, 000. From this startup capital, a working capital of N253,597.7 was used in running the business out of which a capital  assets  of  N70,000  was  invested  in  for  use  in  five  years.  The remaining N1,402.3 were kept in bank and used in maintaining the business and  for  other  miscellaneous  expenses. The  working  capital  and  capital assets gave the initial outlay of N253,597..The first year’s estimated sales and net profit indicated a high success with N520,460 cash inflows. The Evergreen snail business is a sole proprietorship medium scale enterprise aimed at consolidating and expanding the outdated snail farm in the state through increased provision of required products and services. Snail slurries are useful industrially for zymolyse enzyme production. Snails contain less fat and cholesterol therefore; its consumption helps in improving the circulatory system and standard of living of the people. The venture provided employment  to  all  categories  of  people  including  retirees,  house-wives, young school leavers, inventors, traders, local dwellers, applicants, and workers who need extra income to augment their merge salary. It generates foreign revenue without one running from pillar to post. The SWOT analysis showed that the opportunities of the business outweigh the challenges and was concluded that the snail farming business idea is healthy and feasible.<br/>\n\nA FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT ON THE SETTING UP OF A 200 CAPACITY SNAIL FARM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete business plan</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT ON THE SETTING UP OF A 200 CAPACITY SNAIL FARM", "id": 2}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\"> \nINTRODUCTION<br/>Fish constitutes about 41% of the total animal protein intake by the average Nigerian hence there is great demand for fish in the country. Nigeria requires about 2.66 million metric tons of fish annually to satisfy the dietary requirement of its citizens which are about 150million in number. Regrettably, the total aggregate domestic fish supply from all sources is less than 0.7 million metric tons per annum. Nigeria has to import about 0.7million metric tons of fish valued at about $500 million annually to augment the shortfall. This massive importation of frozen fish in the country has ranked Nigeria the largest importer of frozen fish in Africa. The huge sum of money spent by Nigeria annually in fish importation could be used to invest in fish farming. Nigeria can substitute fish importation with domestic production to create jobs, reduce poverty in rural areas where 70% of the population lives and ease the balance of payments.<br/><br/>       \n\nFEASIBILITY REPORT ON STARTING A FISH FARM WITH A CAPITAL BASE OF N500,000<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete business plan</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FEASIBILITY REPORT ON STARTING A FISH FARM WITH A CAPITAL BASE OF N500,000", "id": 3}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\"> \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY<br/>GENERAL CONSIDERATION<br/>This feasibility report makes a case for the establishment of small scale oil palm processing oil (the Mill) in Edo State along Benin Ekpoma Road. The Millwill use palm fruits and palm kernel nuts to produce crude palm oil (CPO), palm kernel oil (PKO), and palm kernel cake (PKC). The case for feasibility of the Mill is founded on the following findings<br/>1.Excellent Demand Prospects for CPO, PKO, and PKC; there is supply shortage for these products, and domestic demand is currently augmented by imports.<br/>2.Availability of inputs; oil palm produce are generally available, the technology for fabricating oil palm processing mills are available locally, labour is generally cheap, and locating the Mill in the area identified will ease access to raw materials.<br/>3.Oil palm milling open opportunities to establishing plantations, and producing further refined produce in the near future.<br/>4.Profitability analyses indicate a payback period of three years. Given a venture capital of N65,070,000 to be committed to establishing the Mill in the first year, the net cash flow from the third to the seventh year of operation are N3,459,000, N22,857,000, N46,755,000, N70,653,000, and N94,551,000 respectively.<br/>5.Environmental impact assessment indicated very minimal negative impact of the factories operation as all solid wastes generated from oil palm milling are recyclable. <br/><div>The positive impact of the Mill on the immediate operational environment and the economy include high quality finished products, job creation, poverty alleviation, and development of the oil palm processing technology.</div><div>CAPITAL INVESTMENT </div>Information was elicited through interviews and physical using descriptive statistics (mode, frequencies and corresponding percentages and gross margin model). Profitability analysis indicate a payback period of 3 years, given a venture capital of N65,000,000 to be committed ot establishing the mill in the just year.<br/>Financial proposal<br/>The crude input-output margin of the kernel oil processing unit is summarized in table A below. The kernel oil mill  has an installed capacity of 500kg kernel/hr, which amounts to 5000kg per 10hours working day. <br/>As for the palm oil milling, an average milling rate of 2500kg/day (and 750, 000kg/year) is assumed kernel is currently valued at N62 per kg which amounts to about  N160,000 worth of kernel milled per working day and N41.29 million worth of kernel milled per year.<br/>Financial and Economic Analysis <br/>The financial and economic analysis is summarized in table A below:<br/>    The daily output rates for PKO and PKC are 1,000 liters and 1,500kg respectively. This is based on the assumed ratio of 40 percent PKO and 60 percent PKC. PKC is currently sold for N225 per liter and PKC N25 per kg. The value of daily outputs of PKO and PKC are about N230,000 and N38,000 respectively. The yearly value of outputs of PKO and PKC are N67.5million and N11.25million respectively. Thus, palm kernel procured for N41.29million in a year yields N78.75million worth of PKO and PKC<br/>       \n\nFEASIBILITY REPORT OR ESTABLISHING A SMALL SCALE OIL PALM MILL <div

class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The term Agricultureâ has been subjected to different definitions by various experts. As a result Ighodo (1984: 20) defined agriculture as the art and science of the cultivation of crops and rearing of animals for man's use.  He also emphasized that agriculture is also the production of fibres for industries, processing of farm produce, packaging and marketing of farm products.  This definition is quite embracing as it covers all activities that ensure man's survival.  However, the aspect of research and training that is so vital in production was conspicuously missing in the definition.</p> <p>In order to fill this gap, Ogwuma (1985: 5-8) defines agriculture as production of field crops, forestry, fishing and livestock, research and training of extension workers.</p> <p>Production is only complete when it gets to the final consumers.  It is in response to this economic doctrine that Anyanwu (1987:102) defined agriculture as involving cultivation of land, raising and rearing of animals for the purpose of providing food for man, feed for animals and raw materials for industries.  It involves forestry, fishing, processing and marketing of these agricultural products.</p> <p>Komolafe (1985), Adegoye (1985) and Adubi (2000) defined agriculture as the cultivation of soil for crop production and of looking after animals to produce better meat and other food products and also a process by which farm products are sold.</p> <p>Simon Kuznet (1973) defined economic growth as a long term rise in the capacity to supply increasingly diverse economic goods to its population.  It entails a sustainable rise in national output which is a manifestation of economic growth.</p> <p>To Anyanwu (1997), the role of agriculture in transforming both the social and economic framework of an economy cannot be over-emphasized.  In effect, it has been the main source of gainful employment from which the nation can feed its teeming population, providing the nation's industries with local raw materials and as a reliable source of government revenue.</p> <p>According to Adegoye and Dittah (1985), agricultural output can increase the level of income of farmers and the people.  They said what constitutes the level of agricultural output will vary with the stage of economic development of a country.</p> <p>For a purely subsistence economy, agricultural development will occur but not like in a fully developed economy.  If there is enough food for the people and a marketable surplus is produced, it will increase the income of the peasants.  The increased income generated would so provide means for them to purchase other necessities of life, which they cannot produce themselves.  By this means, the standard of living of the peasants will improve and unemployment, underdevelopment will be reduced.</p> <p>They stated that a fully developed economy, especially in agricultural sector, means increase in the production of export crops with an improvement in the quantity and grades of such export crops.  For a country that has started to industrialize, agricultural output will be said to have acquired growth if agriculture can supply enough raw materials to the agro-allied industries.</p> <p>Reynolds (1975: 215), revealed that agricultural development can promote the economic development by increasing the supply of food available for domestic consumption and releasing the labour needed for industrial employment.  According to him, agricultural development can promote economic development of underdeveloped countries in four distinct ways:</p> <p>i)  By increasing the supply of food available for domestic consumption and releasing labour needed for industrial employment.</p> <p>ii) By enlarging the size of the domestic market for the manufacturing sector.</p> <p>iii) By increasing the supply of domestic savings and</p> <p>iv) By providing foreign exchange earned by the agricultural exports.</p> <p>Omawale and Rodriguez (1975) opined that for most developing countries, agriculture has been assigned an important role in national development.  To them, agriculture has been seen as a means of reducing dependence on certain importations, containing food price increases, earning foreign exchange, absorbing many new entrants to the labour market and increasing farm incomes at times of severe unemployment and rural poverty.</p> <p>According to J. C. Anyanwu, A. Oyefusi, H. Oaikhenan and F. A. Dimowo (1997), the role of agriculture in transforming both the social and economic framework of an economy cannot be over-emphasized.  It is a source of food and raw materials for the industrial sector, it is also essential for expansion of employment opportunity, for reduction of poverty and improvement of income distribution, also for speeding up industrialization and easing the pressure on Balance of  Payment. In effect, it has been the source of gainful employment from which the nation can feed its teeming population, providing the nation's industries with local raw materials and as a reliable source of government revenue.</p>                                                           \n\nTHE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT ON NIGERIAN ECONOMIC GROWTH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT ON NIGERIAN ECONOMIC GROWTH", "id": 6}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Abstract</p> <p>The incidence of gully erosion in  Obollo-Etiti in Udenu Local Government  Area of Enugu State has assumed alarming proportions thereby gaining local government recongnition as an ecological disaster.</p> <p>The aim of this study is therefore to determine and analysis the factors responsible for gully development and with preferring solutions. From my observation, the gully erosion for more than three to four years has been responsible for the loss of farmland, damage of roads, thereby rendering them farmless  for varying period of time and loss of livestock which majority of the population depends on for survival.</p> <p>Congruently, the community have been working on it and even employing indigenous management strategies.

Hugo (2009), Naik (2009) and Keane (2004). Disaster which may occur from natural or man-made processes often involve large scale alternations of the areas they occurs and suffering of a sizeable number of persons. Human responses to disaster vary according to the nature of the disaster.</p> <p>        Advances in science and technology have aided the human race to stop the events, to predict the events and more out of the ways such disasters or discover ways of recovery after the events had taken place. However, some notable disaster which when they occur, death and loss of property usually result include, gas escapes earthquake, chemical spill oil, oil spills, forest fires, coastal floods  generally etc. landslide, causes of loss property death and population displacement when they occur in densely-settled area of the world s within Nigeria landslides occur as follows ups from deep gully incision (Mozie 2010). The most devastating gully erosion in Nigeria are found in South Easter Nigeria in the populated Enugu, Abia, Imo and Anambra State  and other lesser area is in Auchi in Edo State of Nigeria.</p> <p>        This project discusses the gully erosion control in Udenu Local Government Area of Enugu State, Nigeria.</p> <p>1.2    Objectives of the Study </p> <p>To determine the cause of the gully erosion in the Obollo-Etiti, Udenu L.G.A. gully site.</p> <p>To construct maintain and unrest in the study are unfrustural works like roads, water schemes and gradual transfer of these to benefiting communities to engage in other activities that will increase agricultural production in the soil.</p> <p>To design appropriate soil erosion control structures for gully erosion site.</p> <p>1.3    Justification of the Study  </p> <p>        The justification of this project work is seen in the aftermath of the gully development, which includes the destruction of the profile and the topography of the area, thereby hindering development around it. The downstream sedimentation is causing damage to the vegetation of area and a kind of sediment transfer to discharge outlet (which may cause  pollution) is being seen effected by the overland flow that originates from the watershed. All these problems will be tackled when this work is successfully completed. The justification of this project work is also seen in the earnestness of the control. This is because the cost of reclamation and control is increasing on daily basis due to the continuous deepening of the gully by run off action and detachment by rain drop action.</p>\n\nRECLAMATION MEASURES FOR GULLY EROSION SITES A CASE STUDY OF OBOLLO-ETITI, UDENU LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, ENUGU STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RECLAMATION MEASURES FOR GULLY EROSION SITES A CASE STUDY OF OBOLLO-ETITI, UDENU LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, ENUGU STATE", "id": 7}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p>The microbiological and organic pollutants characteristics of umuosoko stream in ikwuano local government area, Enugu state, Nigeria were carried out.

Man needs water for various other purposes apart from drinking and body functions.</p> <p>The other purposes includes it’s use in transportation, waste disposal and hydro electric system. About 80% of the earth’s surface is covered by water. This may be grouped into natural and artificial water. Natural water includes atmospheric water (rainfall, hail and snow), surface water includes (stream, lakes, rivers, ocean) and ground water (spring well, under ground stream). Artificial water on the other hand includes ponds. Surface water can be contaminated by some impurities like dust, smoke or gases etc from the atmosphere.</p> <p>Anthropogenic activities ad dumping of waste on the river bank also results to the contamination of surface water quality, water may of these micro-organisms when present in large quantities and for prolonged period of time can cause health problem (Onyeagba and Isu, 2003, Shelton, 2003: WHO, 2004). There is a strong relationship existing between water, health and diseases causation (Ajewole, 2005). Water is a very essential element of human nature, yet a very dangerous element in the spread of diseases.</p> <p>A recent study of water related and water borne diseases are in one way or the other caused by surface water (Medema et al 2003). Water that is free of disease producing micro-organism and chemical substance that is dangerous to health is referred to as potable water. The two categories of the sources of surface water pollution based on their origin are point and non-point sources. The contaminants that enter a water way through discrete conveyance, such as pipe or ditch are called point source pollution. The non point pollution is the diffused contamination that does not originate from a single discrete source. The cumulative effect of small amount of contaminants gathered from a large area is as a result of non point source pollution (USGS, 1998: EPA 2005)</p> <p>The contamination of water has been associated with sewage and sewage effluent. It has been generally accepted that surface water contains more harmful micro-organisms compared to other source, of water including ground water and rainfall water (Oyebode: 2005). Consequently, high degree of sewage dumps, practices with domestic waste water may be sources of bacteria and other organisms capable of producing diseases in man and animals including livestock. Other source includes livestock manure and waste water from municipals, schools, feedlots and swamps.</p> <p>Consequently, the number of cases of water borne diseases has been seen to be the cause of many health hazards. The demand and pollution of level of water requires the basic monitoring on the quality (WHO, 2004: EPA 2002) Hence there is need to ascertain the physical, chemical and biological quality of this river to ascertain whether it is safe for human consumption.</p> <p><strong>1.2    Objectives of the Study </strong> </p> <p>The aim of this project is to determine the effect of anthropogenic activities and domestic waste on Ekulu river water quality.</p> <p>Specifically the objectives of this project are:-</p> <p>i.         To collect water samples from different parts of Ekulu River and take to the lab for analysis.</p> <p>ii.        To analysis the lab results with a view to ascertaining the physical, chemical and biological properties of the water.</p> <p>iii.       To recommend amendments for the water considering the various potential uses of Ekulu River in Enugu North of Enugu State.</p> <p>iv.      To subjectively evaluate the extent of domestic waste deposits in the river.</p> <p><strong>1.3    Justification of the study</strong></p> <p>Not minding the anthropogenic activities and domestic waste dumping at Ekulu River, it is still a good source of water for agricultural and domestic activities</p> <p>Ekulu River is a neat source of water but water may not be adjudged potable by appearance or taste and that is why the analysis of this water is essential.</p>\n\nEVALUATION OF THE EFFECTS OF ANTHROPOENIC ACTIVITIES AND DOMESTIC WASTE ON SURFACE WATER QUALITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTS OF ANTHROPOENIC ACTIVITIES AND DOMESTIC WASTE ON SURFACE WATER QUALITY", "id": 8}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Abstract</p> <p>        Flooding has been described as one of the most important environmental factors determining the distribution of salt marsh plants.

The weather change due to various reasons causing unexpected and sudden flood recently in Nigeria has negative impacts on rice farming and people’s life. This research project is to evaluate the effect of flooding on the growth of three varieties of rice grown in Abakaliki Ebonyi State and to see how it influences people and agriculture.</p> <p>The extent of the damage of flooding on rice is related to at least three factors. The temperature of the water, the amount of water motion and the duration of the flood. Temperature affects the speed of respiration. The faster the respiration, the quicker the oxygen is depleted and the sooner fermentation begins. Warm water speeds respiration, oxygen use and cell death. The faster water moves the greater the degree of turbulence. This water turbulence oxygenates the water slightly. Increasing oxygen content of the water slightly decrease’s the impact of flooding on plants. Duration of the flood is important because many of the effects of low oxygen on plants are reversible of the duration is not too long. Long durations allow for increased oxygen depletion and build up of harmful chemicals. Although local conditions influence the effects, 36 to 48 hours is often the tolerable limit.</p> <p>In general rice cannot tolerate flooding better than other plants. But, if flooding occurs in the spring, the rice growing point is near the soil surface (below or above) making it likely to be submersed longer. Soil water logging and submergence (collectively termed flooding) are abiotic stresses that influence species composition and productivity in various type of rice, worldwide.</p> <p>In rice farming, flooding species are manipulated (e.g. Ofada, upland and Nerica rice) or are accommodated by genotype selection. There have also been recent advances towards developing cultivators for low land areas prone to short-duration flash flooding. For most of this rice, excess water is a constraint to growth and productivity in many regions and this adversely affecting the growth of various types of rice.</p> <p>Finally, rice are often damaged and thus, more susceptible to disease organisms. Disease symptoms may not appear until several weeks or even months after the flood event.</p> <p>1.2 Objectives of the Study</p> <p>The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of flooding on the growth of three varsities of rice grown in Abakaliki Ebonyi State.</p> <p>Specifically the objectives or aim of this project are:-</p> <p>1.   To determine the effect of flooding on three varieties of Rice. (Oryza Sativa)</p> <p>2.    To examine three varieties of Rice on a flooded land and Non-flooded conditions.</p> <p>3.   To know the nutritional evaluation of the effect of flooding on three varieties of Rice.</p> <p>4.   To study the flooding characteristics of various varieties of Rice.</p> <p>5.   Provide strategies on handling the effects of adverse flooding.</p> <p>6.   To make recommendations and profound solutions to the problems.</p> <p>1.3 Justification of the Study</p> <p>The main purpose of this research work is to determine weather flooding affect the growth of three varieties of rice (A case study of Abakaliki Ebonyi State). Recent heavy rains in some parts of Nigeria have promoted injuries of flooding and its effects.</p> <p>The extent to which flooding injures rice is determined by several factors, including plant stage of development when flooding occurs, the duration of flooding, and air/soil temperatures, rice can survive only 2-4 days of flooded conditions. Once rice has reached the silking stage shallow depths of flooding usually cause a noticeable amounts of damage.</p> <p>If excess moisture in the early growth stages retards rice development, rice may be subject to greater injury during a dry summer because root systems are not sufficiently developed to access available subsoil water. Seed treatments are usually effective but can provide protection only so long; if seedling development is slowed or delayed 2-3 weeks. There is limited resistance to these diseases and predicting damage is difficult because symptoms do not appear until later in the growing season. Rice should be cultivated in a favourable climatic condition for increasing its rice production and rapidly moving to self-sufficiency in rice.</p> <p>        This study has thoroughly discussed and offered clear indications of priority among these challenges as well as pointers to their solution</p>\n\nEVALUATION OF THE EFFECTS OF FLOODING ON THREE VARIETIES OF RICE<div

Agriculture and their main occupation is subsistence farming which attracted the interest  of many co-operative societies both the old and new ones.  Improving the Agricultural production was their main target and at the same time lifting the level of it size and qualities.  Most of the crop couldn’t grow well in  order to produce as expected.  The product that were several affected were yam tubers, cocoa yam, vegetable, cassava stem and tubers.</p> <p>In the sixties, Anambra State economy had a mono-sectorial dependency on Agriculture as the main source of earning, and also the main source of employment.  Then we took one leaf from this dependency  on agriculture to a higher dependency on trade and white collar jobs.</p> <p>Anambra state Agriculture is till completely preasentised,  hoe, cutlass economy with a large number of small-scale holder producers.  One can observe that Anambra state is still semi-substantial and their output from Agriculture production can neither feed the fearing population nor provide essential raw material for the agro-based industries.  The export of the state major cash crops which has in the past supported the economy has virtually stopped.</p> <p>While a lot of observers dwell on the urgent need to reinitialize this sector, Omuma (1986) implied the adverse effects of no reinitialization  of the agricultural sector noted that under such conditions, all it needed was famine and kwashiorkor to be evident in the village.</p> <p>Furthermore, one wondered why it is taking the state so long despite its abundant land and know-how to revitalize the agricultural sector and save the inhabitants of Anambra state who both underrated kwashiorkor stricken  and undernourished.  While emphasizing the importance of improving agriculture productions, through co-operatives.  Igbo (1996)  said, it is now on the government  the dependence on the external sources of food, because it has ties their state independence to the uncertainties of ridiculed.</p> <p>According to Anambra state food journal (1991), Agriculture was the back bone of the state’s economy development to thousands of Anambra  state indigenes over 95%  of the labour force, mostly from rural areas.  Agriculture produces feeds for animals that provide proteins for man.</p> <p>All these made the government to organize these present farmers into agricultural co-operative with view of having massive food production in the country.</p> <p>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>          Co-operative movement all over the world has been considered or taken as both mean and instrument  of development whereby individual as group of people with common social-economic come together mutually to take and solve their common socio-economic problems.  In our country today, sources of statements have been made in the newspapers and other news media, by scholars advocating the use of co-operative societies for the development and improvement of living standard of the rural people.</p> <p>Meanwhile, many programmes have been launched by the federal government in support of this rural development, such as Agricultural Development Project (ADP), National Land Development Authority (NALDA), Directorate of Food, Roads and Rural Infrastructures (DFRRI), Better Life  {Programme (BLP),  etc.</p> <p>Recently, the family support programme (FSP) which was launched by the federal government which aims at improving the life of the rural dwellers through the formation of co-operative movement.  Co-operative movement spans through many aspects of our economic life such as production, consumption, distribution, thrift, savings and the provision of rural infrastructures.</p> <p>1.1        STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>Nigeria has embarked on various programmes and policies, costing hundreds of millions of naira aimed at reviving the depressed agricultural sector.</p> <p>In view of this, agricultural co-operative was instituted so as to organize the small-scale farmer who are still involve in manual labour type of farming in co-operative and had failed to produce enough food for our teaming population thereby forcing the country to be involved in importation of large quantity of food with a huge percentage decline in agricultural export.  All these government efforts have not actually had much significant improvement in this sector as much emphasis is now being placed on agriculture.  This  call for urgent reexamination of the role of these agricultural products, its aim of facilitating the attainment of self sufficient in agricultural and making agriculture to take its prime position in the national economy of this country.</p> <p>1.2         PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The general purpose of this project report is to undertake a study of the existing farmer co-operative societies has their efforts in improving the development of agriculture.</p> <p>Also the study has the following objectives:</p> <p>a)      To examine the organizational structure and the operations of co-operatives movement in Anambra state with particular reference to Aniocha Local Government Area.</p> <p>b)      To examine the impact of the farmer co-operative societies.</p> <p>c)      To investigate the problems facing the farmers co-operative societies.</p> <p>d)     To suggest ways and means for enhancing the effectiveness of the societies and assist in further research into contemporary issue on this manner.</p> <p>1.3        DEFINITION OF TERMS.</p> <p><strong>1.      Agricultural Productivity:</strong></p> <p>         The index of the ratio of the value of the total farm output to the value of the total                             </p> <p>         input used  in farm

The domestic birds include fowl ducks, turkey, guinea fowl and geese., poultry products have been found to have the highest protein concentrate of about 20.5% relative to others success of protein (animals) and has the shortest production cycle of all animals.</p> <p>Production cycle involves all the activities in the rearing of livestock from day old to maturity. For example, to achieve a ten-fold increase in the body weight in relation to weight at bird, Williamson and Payne (1978) outlined that it takes 25 days in broiler, 48 days in piglets, 250 days in caves and 170 days in sheep.</p> <p>The rearing of pigs, cattle’s and goats however requires extensive kind more than poultry where more units of production can be achieved from a given space compared to the farmer. These advantages are perhaps the cause of a higher turnover in poultry production at reasonably short period of time in this work more emphasis shall be made specifically to the domestic fowl, which are the major birds for commercial and nutritional importance in Ikpoba Okha Local Government of Edo State.  Poultry rearing have been in practice in Ikpoba Okha for a long time. The traditional motive varies from hobby to the use of fowl and eggs as food. Apart from the important roles that the fowl play in the traditional workshop of duties in many parts of the states, some communities use it as gift to their neighbours in appreciation of a good deed and as a mark of solidarity.</p> <p>The traditional poultry keeping is generally subsistence in outlook without the use of modern scientific methods. Hence the birds under this system are poorly cared for and they are characterized by slow growth rate, poor feed utilization and low productivity. The birds are also exposed to high mortality rate as a result of diseases, pest and bad weather conditions.</p> <p>However, inspite of the popularity of commercial poultry keeping, the subsistence and the small-scale units are still prevalent all over the place especially in the villages. Although the commercially oriented poultry units are abundant all over the state with varying modern scientific approach to production poultry output continues to be inadequate with prices above the reach of the common man.</p> <p>This paper will therefore focus attention on the problems and prospect of poultry production in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of Edo state.</p> <p><strong>1.2         </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>In Nigeria, the business of poultry farming is concentrated in the hands of few individual partly because of the complex problems such as finance and climatic condition while others are problem of poultry processing and storage facility.</p> <p>In Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area, there had been retrogression in poultry production due to illiteracy in the maintenance of records. Hence maintenance of record helps the farmer to determine the process of retrogressing nature of the farm. Besides, it helps in making future project, planning and programming in poultry industry. Most farmers either as a result of illiteracy, training or otherwise are unable to keep records. The result is that most extension officers are unable to help them out of their problems due to lack of information.</p> <p><strong>1.3         </strong><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the problems encountered by poultry farmers in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area and suggest solutions to them.</p> <p><strong>1.4         </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>The ultimate goal of the government or individuals engaged in poultry production today is to achieve a high standard of production with a view of increasing animal products for the ever-increasing populace.</p> <p>In an attempt to producer enough poultry products {meat and eggs} several problems and constrains have been identified. Some of these problems include finance, quality feeds, disease problems and poor housing condition.</p> <p><strong>1.5         </strong><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work will focus attention to cover Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of Edo state.

Large number of people engages themselves in agriculture for food and income in other to increase their standard of living. Agricultural sector is the earliest occupation of the economy in the history of mankind. Therefore following the trace of the history of agriculture it is obvious that agriculture started from when man stung from place to place gathering ruffle and animals to satisfy his immediate needs. As at that time man had three (3) basic necessities in life, these are matter, air and food has to be provided by man himself. Man at first feed himself on edible roots, small animals which he caught later on, due to the advent of urbanization, man gradually learnt a primitive way of planting, cultivating and harvesting crops and rearing of animal for food as well as for hunger, for clothing and shelter.</p> <p>          Agriculture later developed to such on extent that the role cannot be over stressed from the rural way of farming, it move a step further to involve the use of agricultural mechanism. But it is natural that the people of Oredo Local government Area of Edo State still use primitive and crude implements for farming because of the protection of lack of capital, low level of education, lack of infrastructure and so on. Agricultural development in Oredo Local Government Area gives provides food for the over growing labour force, raw materials also provide income for people, it could noted that 75% of the population are engaged in agriculture and derives its income directly or indirectly from farm. Agriculture later developed to growing of food crop and cash crops such as cocoa, rubber, oil palm and food crops such as yam, corn, cassava, etc. this different types of occupation exist in Oredo Local Government Area these include trading, teaching, sports builders, but agriculture suppress them all. Before the discovery of crude oil agriculture contributed the lions share to Nigeria foreign exchange in 1960 the highest foreign exchange earning came from agriculture sector.</p> <p>          During oil boom in 1974 the sector contribution depreciated to 27% and 18% respectively. Despite the billion of naira spent on operation feed the nation and the area revolution programme. Yet we still import food in spite of the amount invested on agriculture for the two periods. These happened due to the poor attitude towards farming.    </p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM  </strong></p> <p>          So far, it is difficult to find a sector that is problem free. Hence, the agriculture sector cannot be expected from the economic role of Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State. Some of the problems include:</p> <p>i.                   Poor transportation, which affects the economic development in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.</p> <p>ii.                 The use crude implement in Oredo Local Government Area.</p> <p>iii.              To analyze the economic role of agriculture in the economy of Oredo Local Government Area.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY  </strong></p> <p>          It is obvious that the significance of the study is to identify the role of agriculture in the economic development of Oredo Local Government Area and to find possible ways in increasing output and infrastructure that will facilitate the economic development of Oredo Local Government Area through agriculture.</p> <p><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY    </strong></p> <p>          The study is only to some selected areas in Oredo Local Government Area, Edo State.</p> <p>i.                   Okhuesan</p> <p>ii.                 Udukpa</p> <p>iii.              Ikeken</p> <p>iv.              Ahia</p> <p>v.                 Eko</p> <p>This is to examine the meaning, type of agriculture, problems and solution of agriculture in the economic development of Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.</p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE IN THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE IN THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT", "id": 12}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p><strong> (A CASE STUDY OF UNION BANK)</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The research on the financial institutions in agricultural development in Nigeria” A case study of Union Bank Plc was necessitated by the fact that the agriculture development has been on issue of great concern in Nigeria. The financial institutions particularly Union Bank Plc has played to the development of this sector are critically examined in the study. The study is also aware of the pass role of agriculture in the development process when cocoa and rubber products were our major source of revenue. The purpose of the study includes ways in which the Nigeria agriculture and financial institutions particularly Union Bank Plc have been trying to revamp the agricultural sectors, highlighting some of the problems which prevent the full realization of objectives of Union Bank Plc and finding solution to some of its problems. The research also includes the procedure methods used in collecting data and other important information. The primary data method is the first method used to collect data. All the information gathered in this method were mainly through personal interview. The other method termed participant observation affords the one opportunity to watch the social settings and attitudes of the people under references. Finally, the work has tried to examine the problems militating against small scale farmers and the full realization of Union Bank Plc objectives is agricultural development. Some policy recommendations that will help improve agricultural sector were made, these include the best policy formulation aimed at revitalizing the agricultural loans, increased rural banking (new branches and mobile banking scheme) favourable agricultural produce marketing policies, adequate infrastructural development and agriculture research and extension services.  Also for policies to succeed, state government and their agencies are required to pay their loan in time so as to make the bank program work. Debts to Union Bank should be promptly paid without their liquidity will be adversely affected and of course limits the recycling of loanable funds. All these when needed in policy making will enhance sound agricultural development through the role of financial institution.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION     </strong></p> <p>Background of the study</p> <p>Objectives of the study</p> <p>Statement of the problem</p> <p>Scope of the study</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW  </strong></p> <p>Agricultural credit in Nigeria</p> <p>Problem of financing the rural sector</p> <p>Agriculture by banking</p> <p>Agricultural credit development</p> <p>Objectives of the bank</p> <p>Function of the bank</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY        </strong></p> <p>Population size</p> <p>Method of data collection</p> <p>Research instrument</p> <p>Method of data analysis</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR:      </strong></p> <p><strong>PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF DATA</strong></p> <p>Presentation of data and Analysis of data</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE:       </strong></p> <p><strong>SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION </strong></p> <p>Summary of findings</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Recommendation</p> <p><strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY       </strong></p> <p><strong>QUESTIONNAIRES            </strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          Agricultural developments in Nigeria were established during the third National Development Plan (1975-1980) to enhance agriculture and food production. These are World Bank assisted projects consisting of an input delivery and credit supply system.</p> <p>          However the role of financial institution in agricultural development involves ways and means by which a farmer obtains the entire necessary fund required in order to carry out agricultural production. And it also deals with the supply of demand for funds in agricultural sector of the economy. Where a farmer has a sufficient capital of his own to carry out farm production he can then obtain credit from the best available sources.</p> <p>Agricultural finance is playing significant role in the development of the agricultural sector because adequate fiancé is required by farmers to establish economic size farms or large scale farms, and to expand existing farms. Adequate finance also brings significant changes in the structure of agriculture. This is because finance enables the acquisition of machinery and farm equipment to substitute labour use and the purchase of other farm inputs.</p> <p>          The use of finance in farming leads to rapid increase in farm land value which necessitates the farmers to look outward for fund.</p> <p>          Agricultural finance from co-operative societies is very important in communities where credit institutions such as commercial banks are lacking; farmers who belong to a co0operative society can often get inputs against liens over produce for sale through the societies. Credit it normally limited to goods and services, but cash loans are sometimes made.</p> <p>          Therefore, agricultural fiancé is development are has been made mandatory in Nigeria through government directives on rural banking and the lending of a certain percentage of the banks loanable fund or deposit to agricultural sector of the economy.</p> <p>          As a result of the Nigeria enterprises 1972, the federal government of Nigeria acquired banks shares.</p> <p>However, agriculture is very important in most developing countries.</p> <p>          The purpose of agricultural or land Banks is to help in the development of agriculture with the supply of credit. It requires to provide short and long term loans to farmers to carry our agricultural production.</p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY        </strong></p> <p>          The objectives of this study are</p> <p>1.     To examine the impact role of financial institutions in agricultural development</p> <p>2.     To examine why there is decline in agricultural production</p> <p>3.     To examine the ways and means by which a farmer obtains all the necessary fund required in order to carry out agricultural production</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>          The following are some of the statement of problem</p> <p>1.     The low educational background of some of he farmers makes it difficult for majority of the farmers to get information about the existing credit facilities and the procedure involved in getting such loans</p> <p>2.     Farmers in some cases do not get their disbursement from the ministries loan units in good time for finely operation</p> <p>3.     Inadequate supervision of individual farmers bring about difficulty in recovery loans that has been given to farmers</p> <p>4.     State agencies do not reach the number of farmers originally targeted</p> <p>5.     Funds to other project that is not originally included in the programme without due consultation bring about difficult in loan recovery</p> <p>6.     Most, farmers do not have the required collateral to obtain loan</p> <p>7.     There are many loan defaulters and this prevents other farmers from benefiting</p> <p>8.     Too many risks in farming. There is risk of crop failure as a result of disease s and pest, prices of products may fall after harvest</p> <p><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The study is reviewing the effects role of financial institutions in agricultural development in Nigeria. This is only a case study since the result will be directly relevant to financial institution in agricultural development in Nigeria and the society at large</p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA", "id": 13}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE ROLE OF RURAL WOMEN FARMERS ON THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF ONDO STATE</strong></p> <p><strong>A CASE STUDY OF ESE-ODO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The role of rural women farmers in the economic development of Ese-Odo Local Government Area in Ondo State cannot be over emphasized.

A review of feminist literature indicate that there is now a demand for re-orientation of research and changes in methodological procedures used for complication of national income. There are at least three stands to this firstly; there is the issue that a considerable portion of women’s labour is not reflection in Ese-Odo Local Government statistics. This is a phenomenon due to the fact that the labour of the house wife is not traded and valued at market prices.</p> <p>          Secondly, there is the formal versus informal sector issue. On a world wide basis, but more so in the developing countries of the world women constitute the greater percentage of the informal sector labour forces. Thirdly, there is the rural-urban dichotomy more of ten than not, women are left behind when there is male migration from rural to urban areas. These three issues are mutually self explanatory as women get left behind in the rural areas. They have limited opportunities for self improvement. They are therefore suitable mainly informal sector employment. Their labour as house wives, house maids etc is not accurately affected in nation statistics. Another relevant issue is that where women are in selection for religions or social reasons, enumerators who are more often men cannot meet the women to accurately appraise their labour input.</p> <p><strong>PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The objective of this paper is therefore to highlight the role of women in economic development of Ese-Odo Local Government Area in Ondo State with view to identifying attendant problem and suggesting possible solution.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS   </strong></p> <p>          The basic premise of this essay is that the non involvement or marginalization of women in development programmes is wasteful and impedes effective economic development. Its effect is similar to inadequate use of factor of production in agriculture which means that the production possibilities curve is lower than it should be on the basis of this premise, the problem associated with the involvement of women in the economic development of Ondo State and strategies of solving these problems are discussed.</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>H1: Rural women farmers have significant economic contribution to the economic development of Ese Odo Local Government Area of Ondo State. </p> <p><strong>ORGANIZATION OF WORK</strong></p> <p>          The entire work I this project is divided into five chapters, chapter one is introduction, while chapter two review the literature of economic development, chapter three contain the methodological approach of the role of women in economic development in Ese Odo Local Government Area of Ondo State and the finding of what role women played which are not identified as economic development chapter four is discussion, while the last chapter of this project gives the summary of findings, conclusion and policy recommendations.</p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF RURAL WOMEN FARMERS ON THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF RURAL WOMEN FARMERS ON THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT", "id": 14}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY IN FOOD CROP PRODUCTION IN UHUNMWODE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE, NIGERIA</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This project is based on the technical efficiency in food crops production in Uhunmwode Local Government Area of Edo State. Data were collected from fifty food crops production farmers to ascertain the effectiveness and enhancement of technical efficiency in food crops production. The result showed that family labour, hired labour and material input were the prime factors responsible for the change in output of food crops production. A range of technical efficiency was observed across the sampled farms. The best farm has technical efficiency of 40%while the worse farm has a technical efficiency of 10%. This was attributed to the improper usefulness of available resources. At this juncture, the researcher recommended that government should implement policies and programmes that are favourable to farmers or enhanced technical efficiency of food crops production.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUTION</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>          Food consumption accounts for a larger percentage of household expenditure in Nigeria. It was estimated that about 50% of the total expenditure of house hold in Nigeria in 1994 was on food consumption but this figure increased to about 72% in 1995.</p> <p>          An increased in population figure especially in the urban centres exert more pressure on demand for food consumption by the populace. In other words, an increase in population will eventually lead to an increased in demand for food consumption.</p> <p>          In view of this assertion, farmers will need to improve more or exploit more of their potentials in food production so that output could be maximized to meet the ever growing demand for food by the increasing population in Nigeria. The federal ministry of agriculture (200) estimated that the annual food supply would have to increase at an average annual rate of 59 percent to meet food demand and reduce food importation.</p> <p>          Studies conducted have shown that aggregate food production has been growing at about 2.5% per annum in recent years in Nigeria, but the annual rate of population has been on the high side up to the tune of 2.9%(Olayemi, 2002). The implication is that Nigeria as a country has not been able to be independent relation to food production despite the increasing resource being shifted into food production annually.</p> <p>          It is anticipated that demand for food will continue to grow in developing countries (e.g Nigeria). Because global demand for food per person is below the expected and has lead to food shortage or food insufficient in these countries (Fergie et al 2008).</p> <p>          Nigeria farmers have tried to increase food production to meet the ever growing population in two ways:</p> <p>1. The area under cultivation is increased</p> <p>2. Production on existing farm land</p> <p>These two ways or methods are mutually exclusive and both have been employed to increased the food production and reduce food shortages in Nigeria. Although it have been noted that productivity on existing on existing farmland have been preferable in area where land is scarce to unavailability of it. It avoids green house emission associated with bringing new land into production and large scale of disruption of existing ecosystems. But the method have failed to yield the maximum results due to inabilities of the farmers to technically efficient.</p> <p>          In this study, efforts is being put at informing the public on the technical efficiently (i.e combination agricultural sector) of the production in their bid to increase food supply in response to population.</p> <p>1.2<strong> STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>          The militating factors to the growth of food production have been attributed mainly to low yield of crop resources management. An upward movement in the efficiency of farmers in food crops production could definitely lead to improvement in the standard of living and drastic production in the poverty level of farmers and food insecurity.</p> <p>The problem therefore is why has farmers technical efficiency not enough not enough factor in solving the problem of food security in the country? It is therefore in line with this question that this project investigate the technical efficiency in food crops production in Uhunmwode Local Government Area of Edo State to find out the factor that is negating the technical efficiency of farmer in food crop production in the study area.</p> <p>          (Adeyemi 2001) observed in his past studies that decline in food crops production can never be attributed to lack of finance on the part on government but to knowledge gap that exist among  the factors in the country.</p> <p>1.3    <strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The objective of the study is to basically assess the farmer in Uhunmwode Local Government Area of Edo State in the following areas:</p> <p>1.To assess the effectiveness of the efficiency used by farmer in food crops production in Uhunmwode Local Government Area so as to maximize output to meet the ever growing for food.</p> <p>2.  To determine the extent to which efficient food crops production can lead to an improvement in the standard of living of the farmers.</p> <p>3.    To ascertain the level of steady increased in food crops production such as beans, rice, yam, etc.</p> <p>4.   To generate information on ways to achieve a steady but regular increment in food crops among the farmers.</p> <p>5.  To determine strategy to be employed in reducing the poverty level of the farmers and also a reduction in food insecurity in Uhunmwode Local Government Area.</p> <p>6.  To         identify some of the challenge and problems faced by the farmers in food crops production  in Uhunmwonde Local Government Area</p> <p><strong>1.4    RESEACH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>          The study tends to engage the farmers with the following questions. How effective has your efficiency been in food crops production? Can an increase in the efficiency used lead to an improvement in your standard of living? What is your level of steady increament in food crops? If the level of increament in food crops  is irregular increament in food crops  is irregular, how can we achieve a steady but regular increament? What is the strategy to employed in reducing the poverty level of farmers and food insecurity? What is the problem and/or challenge faced in food crops production?</p> <p><strong>1.5    SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The study is expected to cover Uhunmwode Local Government Area of Edo State, Nigeria. It cover some randomly  selected farmer in the study area. These farmers are fifty in the sample size.</p> <p><strong>1.6    SIGNICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The study will have beneficially effect on the Government, farmers and the people (individual) of Uhunmwode Local Government Area of Edo State in  particular and Nigeria at large. Government will be able to implement policies and programmes that will alleviate the problems of food crops farmers which tend to increase the efficiency of these farmers, with that food production will increase making food to be surplus and affordable by the people and this will bring about increase in the standard of living of food crop farmers.  Government will  also be able to generate revenue and earn foreign exchange through export of the excess.</p> <p>1.8    <strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>          Technical efficiency is define as the ration of product output to the factor input.</p> <p>          Food crop production is growing, raising, cultivation, picking, harvesting, collection of crop that are edible to man.</p> <p>          Therefore technical efficiency in food crops production is the radio of product output to the factor input in the growing, raising, cultivating, picking, harvesting, and collection of crop that are edible to man.</p>\n\nTECHNICAL EFFICIENCY IN FOOD CROP PRODUCTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY IN FOOD CROP PRODUCTION", "id": 15}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>TRANSPORTATION COST VARIATION AND ITS EFFECT ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT</strong></p> <p><strong>A CASE STUDY OF EDO STATE</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This research is focused on the effect of transportation cost variation on agricultural produce in Benin city of Edo State. It has been discovered that transportation and socio-economic development are closely related. This is also to introduce students and indigenes of Edo State to the problem and reason for the low standard of socio-economic development in Edo State. The various sectors such as agriculture, industry, trade and marketing, education and health services, forestry and other social infrastructures are aggregated to constitute what is so called socio-economy. It therefore, means that an improvement in this sector will elevate the socio-economic standard of living. Transportation is one of the factor that has a higher degree of relationship to the level of socio-economy development. In other to make clear the fundamental importance and effects of education in the development of socio-economy the study has been limited to agriculture as an agent of development. Furthermore, this study identifies the relationship between agricultural goods or products and transport cost variation. That is the higher the price of petrol that leads to increase in transport cost the higher the prices of agricultural products.      </p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE         </strong></p> <p>Introduction</p> <p>Background of the study</p> <p>Objective of the study</p> <p>Significance of the study</p> <p>Limitation of the study</p> <p>Scope of the study</p> <p>Research questions</p> <p>Definition of terms</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO        </strong></p> <p>Review of related literature</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p> <p>Research design and methodology</p> <p>Research design</p> <p>Population of the study</p> <p>Instrument for data collection</p> <p>Validation of data collection</p> <p>Method of data collection</p> <p>Method of data analysis</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR       </strong></p> <p>Presentation and discussion of result</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></p> <p>Summary of findings, conclusion and recommendation</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Recommendation</p> <p><strong>QUESTIONNAIRE     </strong></p> <p><strong>REFERENCES  </strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUNG TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        Agricultural have been a source of help to economy development especially the trend of agricultural product. In time of old, the early men live by agricultural produce through this, food and shelter, food from animals and plant e.g. root and harps are gotten from agriculture to live a healthy life.</p> <p>       Nevertheless, this product can be carried out from one place to another by transportation before the arrival of colonial masters (white men) we were dealing with human porter age and animal transportation.</p> <p>     Human porter age is the earliest means of transportation system whereby human being transport goods especially on their heads while animal porter age transportation involved the use of animal used, in carrying goods and services from one place to another e.g. donkeys horses e.g. these are commonly found in Northern part of Nigeria,</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>           This project is aimed at explaining and finding solution to the following,</p> <p>       The causes of transportation cost the effect to agriculture the effect for austerity measure on the citizens Nigeria e.g.</p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This project is aimed at studying the following,</p> <p>(1)  The Behaviours of those who live in Urban areas and rural Areas,</p> <p>(2)  The present state of the economy on transportation and agriculture</p> <p>(3)  Effect of agriculture on the nation development rate</p> <p><strong>(4)  </strong>Way of improving the Nigeria economy in the word of transportation and agriculture</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANT OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>    The purpose of this study is to carry out awareness to the populace on how the transportation cost variation truly affected, firms, individuals and industries.

To the farmers it is edible root tuber crop, which generate his income for the up-keep of his family and himself. It has helped raised the standard of living over the years. The oxford dictionary describe yam as a starch tuberous root largely replacing potato as a staple food in many tropical and sub-tropical countries of the world. Yam belongs to the botanical genes discovered, but there are very many species of great importance in West Africa.</p> <p>The white yam (Discoreal rotonlata) </p> <p>The water yam (Discoreal alata)</p> <p>The yellow yam (discoreal caganesis)</p> <p>Lesser yam (D. bulbfery)</p> <p>Trifoliate or three leave yam (D. dumetorum)</p><p> STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </p> <p>          The edible yams are root crop groom on a field scale for the tubers. They provide staple carbohydrate food in the yam zone of west Africa, where daily consumption is 0.5, 1.0kg yam need a great deal of labour for their cultivation and to prepare them for food and they are usually expensive to buy for normal human consumption, the field or peal, sometimes after partial boiling in west Africa, they are usually eaten as pounded yam which is prepared by pealing cut up yam and boil before pounding them in a wooden mortal to produce a glutinous dough (pounded yam).</p> <p>          The chemical composition of yam tuber is as follows:</p> <p>Water                   70%</p> <p>Starch                   25%</p> <p>Sugar                    1%</p> <p>Protein                 1.2%</p><p> RESEARCH QUESTION   </p> <p>          Yams have high starch content and low amount of protein yam has an important role the social religion life in the yam eating areas of West Africa. In Nigeria this was associated with religious count, which has a priest hold. Annual festival was helded at planting and harvesting and was later known, as the new yam festival was the most important celebration of the year. Discorea species are widely used in traditional medicine in Africa and Asia. The tuber of some wild Spp contain steroidal sapogenias related to the sex hormones and conticosteriod. These now provide a source of diosgenin, which is use to the manufacture of oral contraceptive bere hormones and conbsone.</p><p> OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY  </p> <p>          Yam production in Edo State have hither to received security attention from research workers and students, the main reason for this is that people are ignorant at the importance of yam production in the state.</p> <p>          One of the present day problems of yam production in Edo state has not been encouraging, the people regard the production of yam in the state as fit for only poor and the illiterate. Illiteracy is regarded as a passport to shirt and tie job in town.</p><p> SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>          Yam is a notable for its importance in human life.</p> <p>          To ensure it’s confined existence with better performance</p> <p>To ensure the awareness of people to the need for development of a positive attitude towards the production of yam in Oredo Local Government of Edo State.</p> <p>To improve the quantity and quality of yam production in our local government area of Edo State.</p> <p>To make people understand better effective and efficient modern methods of producing yam in the state.</p> <p>To find out why yam is not cultivated in lorry scale by the farmer in Edo State.</p> <p>To identify the different condition favourable for yam production in Edo State.</p> <p>The existence of yam is threatened by cassava production if care is not taking the survival of yam doubtfully.</p><p> SCOPE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>          This product works is centered on the production of yam in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.</p> <p>          The problems associated with yam production in Edo State and ways of finding solution to the problem encountered by the farmers.</p><p> DEFINITION OF TERMS  </p> <p>          This research of work or project should be centered on definition on the problems and prospect of yam production in Edo State.

Eggs and poultry meat are produced primarily for food consumption. Eggs are also used in various food industries like the manufacturing of confectionary (i.e. sweet chocolate cakes etc.). They are also used for the manufacturing of cosmetics of infection diseases while the feathers may be used for making pillows and mattresses. Some species of poultry are suitable for genetic nutritional and physiological studies because of their relatively low cost of maintenance, proliferation (a rapid growth or increase in numbers) and short generation intervals. In the earlier time, the keeping of poultry were not being considered as a major occupation; that is birds were kept to obtain some money and in most cases for pleasure and pastime cock fighting. In some areas or communities, fowls are still used in the past as a means of knowing what times of day, most especially the cock (i.e. male fowl).</p> <p>Poultry farming started those days when our local farmers used the old and extensive method in keeping fowls, goats, sheep, pig and other related domestic animals proved that the poultry section was a profitable venture too. Gradually, poultry keeping developed into a commercial enterprise involving thousands of birds, large poultry units, replace small ones while more efficient strains of birds, balanced feeds, intensive housing and better poultry equipment come into use. All these industrialized system of keeping poultry birds in a recent development in Edo state as in most humid tropical countries. The effect of some environmental factors like the industries are less capitalized, consists of smaller units and depend more on manual labour. These lead to less production of the birds or the birds perform at a lower level. Due to this account, the cost of poultry production is higher. All these factors contribute to the lower consumption of poultry production in the tropical areas like Edo state. For example, the recent estimate of eggs consumption in Nigeria was far low when compared with the European countries and the United States. Moreover, the industries in the tropical areas are not as diversified as in the temperate. In the tropics, the emphasis is on egg production and only one species of poultry (the domestic fowl) is used. Whereas economic and nutritional benefits can be derived from keeping other species, for example some strains of ducks are fast growing, resistance to many diseases of the domestic fowl and can produce as many as 300 eggs per annum. These can be used to increase the consumption of poultry products in the tropics.</p> <p>However, throughout the world, the domestic birds are unique for its popularity in producing both poultry meat and eggs while the other species are kept primarily for meat. In order for poultry birds to produce efficiently, there is need to raise them under a conducive environment. We have various ways of rearing birds like the industrialized system of rearing birds.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>Poultry, which is of economic importance to the entire members of the society because it provides meat and eggs for consumption. The bones are being used as bone meals to farm animals. It is therefore important that these products get to the final consumer at the place and time they are needed. This is only possible when the marketing system is efficient. This study is therefore concerned with the appraisal of the problems of marketing poultry products in Orhionmwon Local Government Area.</p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is designed to achieve the following objectives:</p> <p>1.     To identify the type of poultry products sold in Orhionmwon Local Government area.</p> <p><strong>2.     </strong>To identify the problems affecting the marketing of poultry products.</p> <p><strong>3.     </strong>To find out how best the problems of marketing poultry products can be solved.</p> <p><strong>4.     </strong>To make recommendations based on  finding of the study.</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>To assist in carrying out appraisal into the problems of marketing poultry products in Orhionmwon Local Government area, some research questions will be useful and these include:</p> <p>i)                   How does extension system of rearing poultry affects its product?</p> <p>ii)                What is the importance of transportation in the marketing of poultry products?</p> <p>iii)              Which part of poultry products do you sell most daily?</p> <p>iv)              Why are poultry products difficult in market?</p> <p>v)                What way so you think will help in the marketing of poultry products?</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The need for appraisal of this type is to know the problems facing the marketing of poultry products in Orhionmwon Local Government area in Edo state. it is assumed that at the end farmers and the consumers within the territory in which the appraisal was carried out will benefit from the findings of the study. During the appraisal, some farmers were questioned and they responded actively and also ask various question s, which help them to rear their livestock very well. Therefore, this study will help the farmer within Orhionmwon local government area to known the various system of rearing birds in other to keep them away from infection diseases. It will also help them to known the best the best marketing channel to sell their products. Also this study will help the consumers in that same area to known the most hygienic place to purchase their meat and other domestic products from.</p> <p><strong>SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>In this scope, poultry products in Orhionmwon local government area will be carefully examined. This study will pay particular attention to factors affecting the marketing of poultry products in Orhionmwon. It will also appraise some selected types of poultry products and causes of their low marketing and make recommendation that will enhance more distribution in Orhionmwon local government area.</p> <p><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Production</strong>: The processes and methods employed to transform tangible input into goods.</p> <p><strong>Marketing</strong>: The action or business of promoting and selling products.</p> <p><strong>Prospect</strong>: The like hood of success.</p> <p><strong>Problem</strong>: A matter or situation regarded as unwelcome or harmful and needing to be death with and overcome.</p>\n\nTHE PROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF POULTRY MARKETING AND PRODUCTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF POULTRY MARKETING AND PRODUCTION", "id": 19}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF OIL PALM PRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>A CASE STUDY OF NIFOR EDO STATE</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study examined the problems and prospects of oil palm cultivation using Nifor as a case study.

The study is to look at the attitude of Edo State people towards the improvement of agriculture, which tend to be a weak attitude and problems to the state at large. These problems are summarized as low level of literacy, poor agricultural implements, inadequate number of skilled /trained and qualified labourers or workers, little or on finding etc. However, the research deems it fit to profound solution to the low level of agriculture in Edo State. these solution are as follows; lists of skilled workers should compiled and updated always receipt or certificates should be advocated, personal income and support should be  appropriate appreciated and use well. However, the above solutions to the problems of agriculture in Edo State, will tend to change to a positive one, whereby the people of Edo State will now tend to improve agriculture effectively if only the government of Edo State will employ these prospect of agriculture.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>Introduction </p> <p>Background information</p> <p>Statement of the problems</p> <p>Purpose of the study</p> <p>Scope and limitation of the study</p> <p>Research methodology</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p>Literature review</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE    </strong></p> <p>Methodology</p> <p>Research design</p> <p>Population of the study</p> <p>Sample of the study</p> <p>Sampling techniques</p> <p>Research instrument</p> <p>Data analysis</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR       </strong></p> <p>Presentation and analysis of data</p> <p>Presentation and analysis of data</p> <p>Presentation of analysis</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></p> <p> Summary, Recommendation and Conclusion </p> <p>Summary of findings</p> <p>Recommendations</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p><strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY       </strong></p> <p><strong>QUESTIONNAIRE     </strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION</strong></p> <p>Agricultural sector is the earliest sector of the economy in the history of mankind. The history of agriculture started when man wandered from places to place gathering fruits and animals to satisfy his immediate need. As at that time, man had three basic necessities in life, these are air water and food air and water is provided naturally while food has to be provided by man himself with much and little hindrance from nature.</p> <p>     Agriculture as the backbone of West Africa economy is further revealed by the fact that it contributes an average of about 75 percent of various counties exports. Agriculture supplies about 80 percent of Nigeria’s exports.</p> <p>       The importance of agriculture in the economy of west Africa is borne out by many factors, for instance, it employs between 60-90 percent of west Africa occupied population in Liberia, 80 percent of the working population is engaged in agriculture forestry, fishing and breeding more than 60 percent of the employed labour force is engaged in agriculture in Ghana in the Ivory coast, 85 percent of the population are farmers, and the percentage rises to go if we include the immigrant population of that country in Senegal 80 percent of the active population is engaged in agriculture. All these point to the facts that agriculture is the main source of livelihood of West Africa</p> <p>    Agriculture as an economic development has provided a dominant position within the economy of each country gives at a crucial role in the economy development of West Africa. It provides raw materials for the textile, tyre, soap, cocoa, fruit canning and cigarette factories.</p> <p>          In 1968, agricultural exports formed 72 percent of the total exports of Ghana. The 408.000 tons of agricultural products, valued at about 24,000 million CFA Francis, which the Cameroon republic exported in 1964. Constituted about 80 percent of their total exports.</p> <p>          At about 20 percent of the total agricultural output of West Africa is exported while the remaining is consumed directly or used by the local industries. The rates of economic development and growth of Nigeria and West Africa countries of the under developed and developed ones has increase efficiently under production of the existing exports crops as permitted by the world markets, and the developing of new ones in orders to increase foreign exchange earning which turn permits the import of the goods and services needed for development.</p> <p>          This goes to say that one of the most significant impetus for economic development lies in the size and stability of a flow of maximum prop[ortion of investment in agricultural output which will have to be rapidly expanded. Also, with an increase in the incomes obtained from the sale of food stuffs and agricultural raw materials by the farmers more funds will be available for further investment in agriculture and the new industries.</p> <p>          According to Areoye (1944), some states have low agricultural potentials, it has also been observed that a West Africa small scale farmers applies a lot of general labour, the supply of which is plenty, and a little capital to a wider extent of land than his counterpart in the economically advanced area of the world.</p> <p>          Simple implement likes hoes and cutlasses are used on the frames while fertilizers and manures are not widely used. Almost all the traditional farmers are uneducated thus activities not properly organized and production cost are not carefully related to their yearly output. However, bulk of agricultural production in West Africa come from millions of small scale farmers in Nigeria, peasant farmer’s cultivate a averages of two to three areas and in some part of the Northern states, each extended family has been found to hold about 17 areas, about one quarter of which is usually under permanent cultivation. It is significant that apart from food products the bulk of exports like rubbers, cocoa, cotton and palm kernels are produced on the small holding of millions of West Africa peasant farmers. And in spite of the significance of large scale plantations farming in Liberia and Ivory coast yet now here does the proportion of plantations exceed 10 percent of the total cultivated land.</p> <p>          Lastly, the small scale farmers use traditional methods of farming one of these is shifting cultivation and bush fallowing by which they allow land to go back to bush after a few crops.</p> <p>          Thus, new land is cleared for cultivation which may be for two or five years, depending on the pressures of populations of land after which it is abandoned for a number of years, the percentage of the total land area that is under fallow at any period of time has been estimated to be at least 40 in Nigeria which however engages it to problems in food production in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>          This study is designed to answer the following questions.</p> <p>1.     Are citizens of Edo State including the salary earners really involved in agriculture?</p> <p>2.     Is agriculture a reasonable development or economics development in Edo State?</p> <p>3.     What categories of people are engaged in agriculture?</p> <p>4.     Are governments exercising their roles in agricultural development?</p> <p>5.     What contributions has agriculture brought to economic development in West Africa (Nigeria)</p> <p><strong>PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>1.     To analyze the economics roles of agriculture in the Nigeria economy towards economics development</p> <p>2.     To identify problems facing the agricultural sector in Edo State.</p> <p>3.     To offer possible solutions to the problems facing agricultural sector in Edo State.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>a.     In the light of the foregoing, this study will enlighten those with the significance of agriculture as a source of economic development in Edo State.</p> <p>b.     Examine the positions of administrating agricultural economic development to be best informed about the effect of it.</p> <p>c.      As certain empirically the problems of agricultures and it’s importance of economic development.</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>          Primary and secondary data will be used for study. Which will be analyzed by the descriptive techniques while appropriate measure of instability index will be applied in the determination of relative stability of government roles to agricultural development? Questionnaire will be used to obtain information.</p>\n\nAGRICULTURE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROBLEM AND PROSPECT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AGRICULTURE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROBLEM AND PROSPECT", "id": 21}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE PROBLEMS OF DUCK FARMING</strong></p> <p><strong>(CASE STUDY OVIA NORTH WEST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA) EDO STATE</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This project work was carmed out in Ovia North West Local Government Area of edo state to examine the problems of duck farming within the area. 5o questionnaires were distributed among farmers in the local government but there response where only analyzed using simple frequency and percentages.

They are easier and cheaper to keep than chickens. This makes duck keeping for the production of eggs and meat an attractive enterprise about 700 million ducks are kept around the world, the majority of these more than 500million are found in Asia. Despite this uneven distribution, it is certainly also possible to raise ducks in parts of the worlds, including Africa and Latin America. Ducks can be reared for eggs and meat, for own use or for sale. Other products from ducks which can also be sold include down feathers and fattened livers. There are many similarities between chicken and duck rearing. The most obvious similarities are found in the type of the products for which these forms of poultry we kept duck, like chicken are good producers of eggs and meat.</p> <p><strong>1.1             </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Ducks however have several advantages over other poultry species, in particular their disease tolerance. They are hardly, excellent foragers and easy to hard, particularly in wetlands where they naturally tend to flock together.

Recent trends all over the world, point to a decline in landing from capture fisheries, an indicator that fish stocks have approached or even exceeded the point of maximum sustainable yield. Aquaculture therefore remains the only viable alternative for increasing fish production in order to meet the protein need of the people. Catfishes of the family Claridae comprise the most commonly cultivated fishes in Nigeria. The growth of aquaculture in Nigeria now is largely being boosted by a steady rise in catfish culture. Inadequate availability of seed for stocking and feed used to be major problems. Tremendous progress is now being made. The total value of the industry today is US$800 from the value of fingerlings, feed and farmed fish. Since the culture of Clarias gariepinus through hypophysation was initiated in Western Nigeria in 1973, the procedure has been widely practiced throughout Nigeria thus leading to increase of farm-raised catfishes from the 80’s to date. The favoured  catfish species in Nigeria aquaculture include:  gariepinus, Heterobranchus bidorsalis, Clarias,  Heterobranchus hybrid (Heteroclarias) and Clarias, nigrodigitatus. Heterobranchus sp. is the more commonly cultured fish in the south eastern parts of Nigeria. African catfish is popular in the market and has great potentials to boost the rapidly growing Nigerian aquaculture.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Fish farming has not been fully explored as a strategy to reduce poverty levels despite its potential to improve livelihoods in rural communities. Low productivity, prohibitive establishment costs, high farm-level losses and inefficient marketing often pose a problem.</p> <p>The low level of productivity results from lack of appropriate production knowledge and skills, suboptimal stocking and/or overstocking, poor fish  population control methods and inadequate feeding due to costly feeds.</p> <p>Complications arise from high capital requirements for establishing a fish  farm, especially for excavation, stocking of fingerlings and installation of protective chain link. The losses at farm-level arise from predators such as snakes, monitor lizards and birds, and from improper harvesting and post-harvest techniques. Inefficient marketing results from a lack of farmers  ability to integrate production and marketing activities.</p> <p>It is therefore imperative that youth and farmers are supported to initiate fish farming using the fish farm approach through provision of startup fingerlings and other technical inputs for developing business plans.<br/>Objectives<br/><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>A.    To promote <strong>fish</strong>-farming in Nigeria and contribute to increased household incomes</p> <p>B.     To facilitate the development of fish farm project into a modern  fish farm project in Edo State.</p> <p>C.  To highlight the problem associated with small scale fish farm in Oredo.</p> <p>D.  Make some recommendation on how these problems could be solved so that fish production could be more profitable.</p> <p>E.  To provide a basic for future research on this topic and will also be useful to students who have interest in small scale poultry business.</p> <p><strong>SOGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>1.   On completion of this study.

C. (1975) can be defined as “a cultivation of the land for the purpose of producing food for man and animals and also fibre or raw materials for our industries”.  It also includes the processing and marketing of crops.</p> <p>Another definition from V. O. Akinyosoye O. (1976) states that agriculture is concerned basically with the husbandry of crops and animals for food and other purpose.</p> <p>Agriculture has been the main stay of man right from the earliest times.  It is the oldest occupation and the entire world depends mostly on it for food requirements.  In the olden days, man practiced crude method of farming which involved local tool such as stones, sticks and other related equipment.</p> <p>Today, agriculture is being looked upon as a basic necessity of life.  Food is an essential thing among the human needs. It is believed that without food, nobody can survive.  This is as a result of the benefits of agriculture.  Today also, private individuals, communities, states and federal government have geared every effort towards bringing agriculture to the door step of their citizens.</p> <p>The development of agriculture started when the ancient hunters who depended on fruits and vegetables as well as animals as their food found out that some of the seeds.  From the fruits they dropped, as they moved along germinated and grew on their own.  They started nursing some of these economics fruit crops as their own.  In his quest for food and shelter, man has adopted many agricultural practices through the ages and his technical skills and material resources grew.  The four major types are hunting and gathering, pure subsistence agriculture, mixed subsistence with some cash crops production and pure commercial agriculture.</p> <p>Agriculture sector is the leading non-oil sector in Nigeria economy.  About 70 of the total population engaged in agriculture while about 30 of the total working population are taking part in white colar jobs and others in commercial activities.  This is the reason why demand is greater than supply in Nigeria market, today concerning food production.</p> <p>Since 1960, most people in the rural areas have been migrating to the urban areas in search of employment which offers a good living condition and because of this, agriculture is neglected.</p> <p>There are also other problems that face agriculture already.  These problems lies in the traditional and subsistence system of agriculture.  Production techniques are poor and there are few applications of fertilizers and insecticides.</p> <p>Many efforts and contributions have been made to improve agriculture and the production of agricultural products in this country particularly in Udi Local Government Area.  As part of its contribution in finding solutions to the problems of Nigeria Agriculture, the Societe General Bank of Nigeria Limited organized three symposia in October 1984.  The symposia served as forums for bringing together participants from the public and private sectors including farmers, industrialists, government officials and researcher.</p> <p>This was held at the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture Ibadan on 16th and 17th October, 1984, while the second symposium took place at Durabar Hotel Kaduna on 22nd and 23rd October 1984.  The third symposium was held in Lagos at the Nigeria Institute of International Affairs on 25th and 26th October 1984.</p> <p>The Ministry of Agriculture also arranged for effecting the collecting of agrometerological data to ensure successful timing of agricultural activities.  The ministry established Young Farmers Club (YFC) to encourage youths under twenty five years to farm in their localities.</p> <p>Other programmes had been mapped out towards achieving self sufficiency in food production, such programmes included the Operation Feed Nation (OFN), Green Revolution, Agricultural Development Project (ADP), MOSA etc.  Again, the introduction of Better Life for rural women from rural to urban centres in search of white collar jobs.  Again in the introduction of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1960, agriculture was responsible for 63% of it.  The major components of GDP being agriculture, mining, electricity, manufacturing etc.</p> <p>All these efforts by the Ministry has made agriculture to be very important for the provision of most human needs.</p> <p>For clarity purpose, it will be important to give a vivid description of the geographical background of the study area Udi.</p> <p>Udi is a Local Government Area in Enugu States.  It is bounded by some local government areas such as Ezeagu, Oji River, Nkanu, Enugu North and Awgu.  It is a very populous local government area made up of about 19 towns.</p> <p>1.2      <strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM:</strong></p> <p>One of the major problems facing rural areas, both in Nigeria and other underdeveloped countries of the world, is the rural to urban migration.  As young and energetic men and women migrate to the urban areas, the rural areas instead of developing tend to slide more and more into underdevelopment.  Various government and agencies have been endeavouring in one way or the other to develop the rural areas of Nigeria, especially Udi Local Government Area which is the focus of this research.  These include the provision of electricity, pipe borne water supply, access roads, etc.  However, these measures have not fully stemmed the rural urban migration and the continuing decline of rural areas.</p> <p>One of the major areas which I feel the government has not fully explored is the function which agriculture can play in enhancing rural development.</p> <p>1.3      <strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>The objective of this research is to assess or weigh the contribution which agriculture has provided to the development of Udi Local Government Area of Enugu State.  Again to assess that the greatest problem facing many nations and developing states is hunger and poverty especially in the rural areas.</p> <p>Furthermore, to change many negative attitude towards the introduction of some scientific equipment and method of farming.</p> <p>A:    To enable the country to achieve self sufficiency in the supply of foods by local production of adequate quantities of  high quality foods to keep pace with the food demand of the production.</p> <p>B:    To provide raw material for local and foreign agrobased industries.</p> <p>C:    To provide employment opportunities for able bodied people and to satisfy the market demand for locally manufactured products.</p> <p>1.4      <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>The study of the contributions of agriculture to the rural development of Udi Local Government Area is considered vital because it is believed that the result will help us to know the contributions which agriculture has provided to the local government area.</p> <p>The findings will also alert government of Enugu State on some problems that hinder the contributions so that appropriate measures will be taken for improvement.</p> <p>It is hoped that the findings will serve as a guide to the agricultural planners when adopting any programme.</p> <p>The findings will further influence the habits and attitudes of the people who think that agriculture is meant for the illiterate and poor people.  And by knowing the contributions and agriculture in the state, it will increase peoples incentives and will therefore, make way for more increase in the capacity of food production in Udi Local Government Area.</p> <p>1.5      <strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS:</strong></p> <p>1.          What are the contributions of agriculture to rural development?</p> <p>2.          Does the contributions change the attitude of farmers towards agriculture?</p> <p>3.          Does it make life better to dwellers of Udi Local Government Area or worst for them.</p>\n\nTHE CONTRIBUTIONS OF AGRICULTURE TO

AGRICULTURE CREDIT GUARANTEE SCHEME FUND IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Agricultural credit guarantee scheme fund was established to help farmers who have little or no collateral to get loans from commercial banks by CBN. It was the aim of this research work to find out if CBN has helped in developing cooperative activities in agricultural aspect through their giving of loan, grant, and other farm inputs. Chapter one contained great discussion of the origin and existence of this scheme (ACGSF), it also went further to state the problems to be studied, research question scope and definition of terms.     A number of past and present literature review was examined by the researcher and all these highlighted in chapter two, chapter three dealt with the methodology for the study population and so on.    In chapter four data gotten from the research surveyed was analyzed and interpreted. Also similar questions on both questionnaire were compared.  Finally the summary of these findings was that farmers need to be encouraged to get loan though the measurement of CBN in the reduction of collateral and surety for guaranteeing loans, if banks and farmers/artisans would put the recommendation made in the study into use there would be increase and improvement in activities of agriculture and also continues growth and development in the agricultural sector.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT</strong>   </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.0      Introduction         </p> <p>1.1  Background of the study      </p> <p>1.2  Statement of the Problem    </p> <p>1.3  Objective of the study          </p> <p>1.4  Research Hypothesis</p> <p>1.5  Significance  of the study     </p> <p>1.6  scope and Limitation of the study </p> <p>1.7  Definition of Terms       </p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p>2.0  Literature Review   </p> <p>2.1  Agricultural/credit, purpose and establishment of ACGSF.               </p> <p>2.2  Purpose of the scheme (ACGSF)   </p> <p>2.3  Objectives of the study </p> <p>2.4  Importance of the Credit to Nigerian Agriculture</p> <p>2.4.1 Agricultural Financing in Nigeria</p> <p>2.4.2 Overview of agricultural credit purveyance</p> <p>2.5.

The export of the state major cash crops which has in the past supported the economy has verbally stopped.</p> <p>       While a lot of observers dwelt on the urgent need to reinitialize this sector, Omuma (1998) implied that the adverse effect of non-initialization of the agriculture sector will only bring such condition like famine and Kwashiorkor to the village but emphasizing on the importance of improving agricultural production through loans from government Igbo (1986) said it is now on the government for the independence on the external sources of food because it has tried their state independence to the uncertainties of ridicule.’</p> <p>       Then in the early seventies, the central bank of Nigeria and the federal government carried out a study to find out reasons for the declining agricultural production. The study revealed that credit was one of the major factors then the commercial and merchant banks (now deposit money bank) were reluctant to lend to agriculture because of the high default risk and the inability of the borrower offer tangible collateral.</p> <p>       The agricultural credit guarantee scheme was established in 1977 to share in the risk of the banks in agricultural lending and hence encourage them to continue to extend credit to it. As at 31st December 2004 the total investment under the scheme were N4.4billion.</p> <p><strong>1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In our country today, sources of statements have been made in the newspapers and other news media, scholars advocating the use of agriculture for the development and improvement of living standard of the rural people.   Agricultural activities have brought about solutions to our national problem of massive food shortage. Many agricultural cooperative societies plays vital role and function in massive food production they include the following:</p> <p>1.  Agriculture has embrace all the cooperative activities with the aim of helping farmers in their professional capacities and producers. The inherent weakness of farming Calo of this type of cooperative society.</p> <p>2.  Agriculture has contributed immensely to the improvement of the viability of the small holders by bringing their economies of scale.</p> <p>3.  Agricultural activities are a type of producers cooperatives which aim at improving food production and well being of the citizens.</p> <p><strong>1.2  STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Much of the increase in Nigerians agricultural output in recent years has resulted from expansion of the area under cultivation rather from increased productivity. Some of the many problems militating against the agricultural sector have been listed and discussed.</p> <p><strong>Infrastructure Problem</strong></p> <p>Which include the following</p> <p>Poor feeder road and inadequate road network between the rural areas where agriculture production mainly takes place and the urban area</p> <p>Lack of appropriate on-farm and off-farm storage facilities.</p> <p>       Irrigation facilities are still very poor despite the existence of River Basin  and rural Development Authorities (RBRDA) for instance in Ogun state only 15 hectares of land were irrigated between 1997 and 1999 by Ogun-Osun RBRDA.</p> <p><strong>Manpower/Skill Underdeveloped Problems</strong></p> <p>The extension services delivery system still suffers from inadequate number of extension men/women.

It is also one of the fastest growing segments of animae agriculture. Aquaculture output has grown at a rate of more than 10% for captured fishers and 3% for livestock meat production (FAO, 2000) while only 13 million tons of fish were produced in North American in 1990, there were over 31 million tons produced in 1998. Concurrently, the value of this production doubled from 490 million to nearly 81 billion (USAA, 1998).</p> <p>       Human consumption of fish and related foods is increasing each year. Demand for fish products is greater than the ability of the oceans to supply them. A reduction in wild –caught fish coupled with increased consumption by American consumers has led to increased profitability, improvement in technology required for captive production, and a rapid expansion of farmed aquatic specie. As a result aquaculture is becoming a major alternatives crop globally and in many areas of the United States illustrates the increasing percentage of the total world fish production supplied by aquaculture in relation to the oceanic catch. Because the oceanic fish is no longer increasing significantly, additional production depends on growing more fish through aquaculture. Approximately 75 percent of the earths surface is covered by water yet humans harvest only 1 percent of their total food supply from this source.</p><p> BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY </p> <p>       Over 4000 years ago the Chinese through trial and error developed a system approach to harvesting the nutritional riches of water. They found that different species feed in different natural niches. The animals of particular use to in the ancient Chinese were complementary varieties or crop. The common crop (Cyprinus Earpio) is abenethic that consumer invertebrates in the bottom of the ponds. For thousand of years carp species provided the Chinese with a sustainable harvest. The Chinese discovered that the use of manure as fertilizer could enhance the productivity of a pond. In the 1880s aquaculturist in Eastern Europe countries also cultured the common carp (Silver carp, black carp, grass carp), in the United States aquacultures was launched when the federal government began hatching and stocking program to restock salmon lost spawning rivers in the North West. In an attempt to increase Salmon numbers in the wild, the federal government began hatching program that were basically “put and take” system. Eggs were collected, hatched in captivity and fingerlings released. This program, although successful in increasing wild-caught number, was actually more successful in providing initial information and research for the science of aquaculture. Hatching and restocking into the wild required development of the same technology as that needed by commercial hatching. This made salmon the major marine fish industry of the United state with more than half the production coming from public because over 600 million commercial salmon landing accounting annually.</p> <p>       In the 1950s the US government supported programs of farm pond construction and stocking. Although more than 2 million ponds were constructed they have demonstrated little importance for food production. In 1960s ponds were constructed specifically for catfish in the Southern United States where production fastest growing agricultural enterprises from 1970s till today. Catch moved to the Mississippi delta Region. The federal research laboratory in sluttgart, Arkansas, helped promote catfish by providing information and support. Regional government aquaculture research centers have helped bolster growth and profitability of the industry. Aquaculture production in North America involves diverse farming systems in diverse areas. It is most concentrated in the southern region of the United States. Today the US catfish industry of the largest aquaculture industry in the world employing more than 25, 000 people and generating over $ 1 billion annually. More than 178, 000 acres of catfish ponds on 1300 farms produced approximately 100 million metric tones per year. Currently 80% of the catfish production occurs in the state of Mississippi with 105, 000 acres concentrated on 400 farms. Many other commercial species are also centred in the south East Louisiana is the leading producer of craw fish and arkangas leads in baitfish production. Florida is the leading in ornamental fish, increasingly there are niches being found for hybrid stripped bass, fresh water prawns, red fish and tilapias throughout the country. Other species that have potential include allegation, bullfrogs and turtles. Production of the American cupped oyster is predominately from the united state e.g. clams, crayfish, catfish, mussels, cyprinids etc. </p><p> STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM               </p> <p>       The statement of the problem are;</p> <p>1.          Do we have fishing ponds in Delta State of Nigeria?</p> <p>2.          Do we have enough facilities to engage in fishing production?</p> <p>3.           What can the federal government do about the fishing industry</p> <p>4.          What are the roles of the public concerning fish production?</p><p> OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>       The purpose of this study is to examine the importance of fish production and it marketing value of fish production in Nigeria, which is the usefulness of rearing of fish and it nutritional value to human.</p> <p>-                     To identify the marketing value of fish production in our means.</p> <p>-                     To understand aquatic animals much better now than that in the past.</p> <p>-                     To bridge the gap resulting from our having invested minimally in salt and fresh water food production research to compare with research investment made in food production from the land.</p><p> SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY  </p> <p>       The study of the importance of fish production and it marketing value of fish production in Nigeria is significance not only to agriculturist but to everybody. If the contribution of US aquaculture project growth is achieved, the federal government, state government, general public at large established a good and adequate fishpond the need of today would be meet. Therefore the significance of carrying out this study is to show the influence of fish production in Nigeria.</p><p> RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS  </p> <p>       The research hypotheses are stated in the alternative and null hypothesis.</p> <p>1.          What types of fish do agriculturist rear in the area of study.</p> <p>2.          What are the marketing value facing aquaculture production in the area of study.</p> <p>3.          What are the main purpose for aquaculture keeping by the government of that state.</p> <p>4.          What are the nutrients gotten from aquaculture?</p><p> SCOPE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>       Due to its compulsory has been carried out in some selected areas. This is also a result of a large number of fishpond within Nigeria. The selected fishponds covered are the school of education fish pond, Gabano hotel, Uniben fish pond, delta state fish pond Ughelli.</p> <p><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS </strong></p> <p>       What is fish aquaculture: this is the rearing or growing of an aquatic organism under controlled or semi-controlled condition. In simple terms, aquaculture, which uses salt water than fresh water animal, crustaceans, (shrime, prawns and crayfish), mollusks (clams and oyster), reptile Clligators, amphibians bull frogs.</p>\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF FISH PRODUCTION AND ITS MARKETING VALUE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPORTANCE OF FISH PRODUCTION AND ITS MARKETING VALUE", "id": 27}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF YAM PRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Nigeria is by far the world’s largest producer of yams, accounting for over 70–76 percent of the world production. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization report, in 1985, Nigeria produced 18.3 million tonnes of yam from 1.5 million hectares, representing 73.8 percent of total yam production in Africa. According to 2008 figures, yam production in Nigeria has nearly doubled since 1985, with Nigeria producing 35.017 million metric tonnes with value equivalent of US$5.654 billion. In perspective, the world's second and third largest producers of yams, Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, only produced 6.9 and 4.8 tonnes of yams in 2008 respectively. According to the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Nigeria accounted for about 70 percent of the world production amounting to 17 million tonnes from land area 2,837,000 hectares under yam cultivation.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p><p> CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION       </p> <p>Background to the study</p> <p>Statement of problems</p> <p>Research question</p> <p>Objective of study</p> <p>Significance of study</p> <p>Scope of study</p> <p>Limitation of study</p> <p>Definition of terms</p><p> CHAPTER TWO     Review of Literature       </p> <p>Yam Agricultural System</p> <p>Environmental requirement</p> <p>Cultivation</p> <p>Sowing</p> <p>Weeding</p> <p>Staring</p> <p>Fertilizer application</p> <p>Harvesting</p><p> CHATTER THREE  </p> <p>Methodology</p> <p>Study population</p> <p>Sample size</p> <p>Sample techniques</p> <p>Instrument</p> <p>Method of data collection</p> <p>Analysis of data</p><p> CHAPTER FOUR    </p> <p>Data presentation, analysis and interpretation</p><p> CHAPTER FIVE     </p> <p>Summary, conclusion and recommendation</p> <p>Summary and major findings</p> <p>Costly labour</p> <p>Discussion on the findings</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Recommendation</p> <p><strong>REFERENCE  </strong></p> <p><strong>QUESTIONNAIRE</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p><p> <strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong> </p> <p>       Definition of yam problems (discoral supp) yams means many things to most people. To the farmers it is edible root tuber crop, which generate his income for the up-keep of his family and himself. It has helped raised the standard of living over the years. The oxford dictionary describe yam as a starch tuberous root largely replacing potato as a staple food in many tropical and sub-tropical countries of the world. Yam belongs to the botanical genes discovered, but there are very many species of great importance in West Africa.</p> <p>The white yam (Discoreal rotonlata) </p> <p>The water yam (Discoreal alata)</p> <p>The yellow yam (discoreal caganesis)</p> <p>Lesser yam (D. bulbfery)</p> <p>Trifoliate or three leave yam (D. dumetorum)</p><p> STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </p> <p>       The edible yams are root crop groom on a field scale for the tubers. They provide staple carbohydrate food in the yam zone of west Africa, where daily consumption is 0.5, 1.0kg yam need a great deal of labour for their cultivation and to prepare them for food and they are usually expensive to buy for normal human consumption, the field or peal, sometimes after partial boiling in west Africa, they are usually eaten as pounded yam which is prepared by pealing cut up yam and boil before pounding them in a wooden mortal to produce a glutinous dough (pounded yam).</p> <p>       The chemical composition of yam tuber is as follows:</p> <p>Water            70%</p> <p>Starch            25%</p> <p>Sugar             1%</p> <p>Protein           1.2%</p><p> RESEARCH QUESTION   </p> <p>       Yams have high starch content and low amount of protein yam has an important role the social religion life in the yam eating areas of West Africa. In Nigeria this was associated with religious count, which has a priest hold. Annual festival was helded at planting and harvesting and was later known, as the new yam festival was the most important celebration of the year. Discorea species are widely used in traditional medicine in Africa and Asia. The tuber of some wild Spp contain steroidal sapogenias related to the sex hormones and conticosteriod. These now provide a source of diosgenin, which is use to the manufacture of oral contraceptive bere hormones and conbsone.</p><p> OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY  </p> <p>       Yam production in Edo State have hither to received security attention from research workers and students, the main reason for this is that people are ignorant at the importance of yam production in the state.</p> <p>       One of the present day problems of yam production in Edo state has not been encouraging, the people regard the production of yam in the state as fit for only poor and the illiterate. Illiteracy is regarded as a passport to shirt and tie job in town.</p><p> SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>       Yam is a notable for its importance in human life.</p> <p>       To ensure it’s confined existence with better performance</p> <p>To ensure the awareness of people to the need for development of a positive attitude towards the production of yam in Oredo Local Government of Edo State.</p> <p>To improve the quantity and quality of yam production in our local government area of Edo State.</p> <p>To make people understand better effective and efficient modern methods of producing yam in the state.</p> <p>To find out why yam is not cultivated in lorry scale by the farmer in Edo State.</p> <p>To identify the different condition favourable for yam production in Edo State.</p> <p>The existence of yam is threatened by cassava production if care is not taking the survival of yam doubtfully.</p><p> SCOPE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>       This product works is centered on the production of yam in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.</p> <p>       The problems associated with yam production in Edo State and ways of finding solution to the problem encountered by the farmers.</p> <p><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS </strong></p> <p>       This research of work or project should be centered on definition on the problems and prospect of yam production in Edo State. However, due to the complex nature of the villages in Edo State, some selected villages in the state are Edogbo Oregbani and Asoro</p>\n\nPROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF YAM PRODUCTION 2<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF YAM PRODUCTION 2", "id": 28}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>AGRICULTURE FINANCING IN NIGERIA PROBLEMS AND PROSPECT</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This project seeks to bring together existing state of knowledge and existing state of practice in agriculture sector new techniques have to be proven before they are adopted in the general practice.</p> <p>       Chapter one of this project will deal with the statement of problems rationale of study significance of study and definition of terms.</p> <p>Chapter two will examine in details the related literature to the project.</p> <p>Chapter three will deal with statement of hypotheses methodology of study and sources of data.</p> <p>       Chapter four will deal with presentation of data and analysis of data and also the discussion of results.  </p> <p>Chapter five will deal with summary conclusion and suggestion</p> <p>       Finally I hope that this project will be of benefit to agriculture sector the student of training and finance and other researchers in related topics.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>Title                                                              </p> <p>Abstract                                                               </p> <p>Acknowledgement                                    </p> <p>Table of content                                      </p> <p><strong>Chapter one</strong></p> <p>Introduction                                                         </p> <p>1.1 Statement of problem                          </p> <p>1.2 Rationale  of study                       </p> <p>1.3 Significance of study                            </p> <p>1.4 Definition of terms                       </p> <p><strong>Chapter two</strong></p> <p>LITERATURE REVIEW                                             </p> <p>2.1 An overview of the agriculture in Nigeria              </p> <p>2.2 The role of the agricultural section in the Nigeria economy</p> <p>2.3 Problem of agriculture finance                             </p> <p>2.4 Specialized financial institution in agricultural        </p> <p>2.5 Prospect of institution financing agriculture</p> <p><strong>Chapter three</strong></p> <p>Statement of Hypotheses Methodology of Study Source of Data</p> <p>3.1 Statement of hypotheses                                         </p> <p>3.2 Methodology of study                                              </p> <p>3.3 Source of data                                          </p> <p><strong>Chapter four</strong></p> <p>Data Presentation and Analysis of Data                     </p> <p>4.1 Presentation of data                                         </p> <p>4.2 Analysis of data                                        </p> <p><strong>Chapter five</strong></p> <p>Summary Conclusion and Suggestion                </p> <p>5.1 Summary                                                 </p> <p>5.2 Conclusion                                               </p> <p>5.3 Suggestion                                                      </p> <p>Bibliography                           </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM.</strong></p> <p>The problem of low productivity and lack of improvement in agriculture has been traced to various causal factors.</p> <p>One of such course is the lack of adequate finance to the agriculture’s.  They complain that they do not have enough fund to carry on with their activities.  We    want to investigate the reasons why these formers find it difficult to raise enough money to carry out their important work.</p> <p>       I will also investigate the ways of eliminating these problems.  Several measures have been taken by the government to encourage agriculture financing in the country but they houses not yielded the necessary effect for they are established.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>RATIONALE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study seeks to examine the various roles of financing agriculture Nigeria.</p> <p>Specifically.

It includes the cultivation of crops as well as rearing of animals for human uses. Today in Nigeria, about 70% of its population is engaged in this activity. Despite the large number of people engaged in this activity in the country and the whole world in general, the activity is not 100% successful. Norman (1981) grouped the development of agriculture in the world into four. Thus: physical, social, economical and political constraints. In the developed countries the physical and economic constraints are taken care of: now left with the problem of the land scarcity.</p> <p>       In the developing countries especially in the savannahs (Sudan and Sahel) where there is series of aridity condition, the most dominant problem in every country or nation, at least must have one or two of these problems which militate against the development of agriculture in the region.    </p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>       Despite the large number of people engaged in agricultural activity in the study area, yet agriculture is still at the primary level.

It has been established that about to percent of Nigeria population is engaged in agriculture (Obasi and Aug, 2000) while 90 percent of Nigeria total food production comes from small farms and to percent of the country population earn their living from these small farms (Oluwatayo et al, 2008). The recent importation of food items into the country to make up for the short falls in food supply Is a dangerous indication of warning farm productivity and warning sign that if the nation continue with the business as usual, the prospect of food security will be black for millions of people (Nwede 2003)</p> <p>       It terms employment agriculture is by far the most importance sector of Nigeria’s economy engaging about 70% of the labour force. Agricultural holding are generally small and scattered, family is often of the subsistence variety characterized by simple tools and shifting cultivation. These small farms produce about 80% of the total foods. About 30.7 million hectares (76 million acres) or 33% of Nigeria land area are under cultivation. Nigeria’s diverse climate from the tropical area of the coast the arid zone of the North, make it possible to produce virtually all agricultural products that can grown in the tropical and semitropical area of the world the economic benefit of large scale agriculture are recognized, and the government favors the formation of cooperative societies and settlements to encourage industrial agricultural. Large scale agriculture, however, is not common.</p> <p>       Despite an abundant water supply a favorable climate and wide area or arable land, productivity is restricted owing to low soil fertility in many areas and inefficient method of cultivation agriculture. Contributed 32% to GPD in 2001</p> <p>It’s widely recognized that co-operative form an indispensable component. Through community organization co-operative serves the basis and plant form for bring together the economically weak member of the society with a view of enhancing their individual capacities (Akali, 1991). The contributions of cooperative to the economy especially in the developing countries are enormous, ranging from provision of credit to its members and sourcing of inputs at reasonable price to scale of member produce (Okonkwuo, 1991). Cooperative are defined as “an autonomous association of persons who unite voluntarily to meet their common economic and social needs and aspiration through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. (ICA, 1995) cooperative are established by like-minded persons to pursue mutually beneficial economic interest. Researcher are of the opinion that under normal circumstance, cooperative play significant role in the provision of service that enhance agricultural development.</p> <p>Patrick, (1995) described cooperative as a medium, through which services like provision of farm input, farm implements, farm mechanization agricultural. Loans agricultural extension member education, marketing of member farm produce and other economic activities and services rendered to members regular and optimal performance of these roles will accelerate the transformation of agriculture and rural economic development. Ijere (1981) further explained that. It is the cooperative that embraces all types of farmers and a well organized and supportive cooperative is a pillar of strength for agriculture in Nigeria. </p> <p>Ogunbameru (1986) also estimated that 52% of Nigerians population is women and that 70% of such women live in rural area. It is also on record (Adebayo and Amao, 2003) that 53% of the poor in Nigeria are women. In the rural areas a large number of women are illiterate, very poor, have high rate of infection and are economically oppressed (Essien, 2000) observed that only small fraction of woman in Nigeria had the benefit of higher education and that the majority is engaged in petty trading and peasantry farming. Despite the low educational and poor economic background of Nigeria women they are still responsible for more than half of the nations food basket and contribute more than two third of the working hours on the farm (Barret et al, 2001). They also reported that AFRICAN Women are responsible for 66% of micro processing activities, especially the processing of agricultural produce.</p> <p>In Nigeria, agricultural production is dominated by small-scale farmers most whom live in rural areas. Crops and animals are produced on scattered farm holding. Most of the farmers operate without modern production input. Their marketing system is unorganized with each farmer acting individually to produce farm inputs and to sell farm produce. Cooperative societies enable people to achieve through joint efforts what they are unable to achieve while working as individuals. They are legally established organization on the basis of specific set of principles cooperatives activities is one of the best method by which peasant farmer can take part in their own economic advancement and gain valuable experience of democratic produce and business management. Akinwumi (1978). They are association of persons who have voluntarily come together to achieve common objective through the formation of a democratically controlled organization, making equitable contributions to the capital required and accepting fair share of the risk and benefit of the undertaking (World Bank, 1999, Ebonyi and Jimo, 2002).</p> <p><strong>1.2      STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS </strong></p> <p>       Cooperative has been regarded as one of the main institutional machineries for empowering the economically weak member of the society. With this official recognition and the determination of government (at all levels) to transform agricultural production and raise the standard of living in the rural areas many agricultural cooperative societies have been formed all over the country. Despite the efforts or contribution made by the cooperative societies towards agricultural development in Nigeria, this effort has not been evenly known and it was in an attempt to address such problem that this study was designed.</p> <p><strong>1.3  OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>1.    Determine farmer’s extent of participation in cooperative societies.</p> <p>2.    Determine the benefits derived by respondents by being member of various cooperative societies.</p> <p>3.    Determine major problems militating against the participation of farmer in cooperative activities.</p> <p>4.    Make policy recommendation based on the funding</p> <p><strong>1.4  STATEMENT OF RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>       Based on the nature of the problems aforementioned, hypothesis testing as a measure will assist immensely in carrying out the research to a logical conclusion because of the statistical testability of the problems formulated.</p> <p>Hypothesis is an assumption or statement which may or may not be true concerning the population. Walpole (1974). Hence, the hypothesis of this research is considered as tentative statement, which would be considered positive or negative at the end of the research presentation.</p> <p>i.     f0:   Agricultural organization operate in ignorant of the existence of cooperative socie5ties.</p> <p>ii.    f0: The objectives, Programme, and agricultural strategies of cooperative societies are not recognized and accepted by agricultural organizations.  </p> <p>       F1: the objectives, programme and agricultural strategies of cooperative societies are recognized and accepted by agricultural organizations.  </p> <p>iii.    f0: Cooperative societies have not contributed positively to agricultural activities.</p> <p>       f1: Cooperative societies have contributed positively to agricultural activities.</p> <p><strong>1.5  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>       This study is embarking upon to determine the impact of cooperative societies on agricultural production in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State knowing the contribution of the impact of cooperative societies will encourage farmers and enlightened on the important of this society.

This concept has been given general definitions in time past but in recent times, there has been a divergence of ideas on what food security really means. food security is  defined as access by all people at all times to enough food for an active and healthy life. The committee on world food security defined it as physical and economic access to adequate food by all household members without undue risk of losing the access. However, the definition adopted by the countries attending the world food summit of 1996, and reconfirmed in 2002, accepts the USAID’S concept which has three key elements viz; food availability, food access and food utilization. However, a fourth concept is increasingly becoming accepted namely, “the risks that can disrupt anyone of the first three factors” There are therefore four major elements of food security. They are food availability, food access, food utilization and not loosing such access. Availability, access and utilization are hierarchical in nature. Food availability is necessary but not sufficient for food accessibility and access is necessary but not sufficient for utilization. In a larger sense, two broad groups of factors determine food security. These are supply side factors and demand side factors. The supply-side factors are those that determine food supply or food availability. In other words, they are determinants of physical access to food at national, household and intra-household levels. The demand side factors on the other hand are factors that determine the degree of access of countries, households and individuals to available food. They are, in other words, determinants of economic access to food or determinants of entitlement to available food. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>CHAPTER 1</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1     BACKGROUND   OF THE   STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>        Food insecurity or lack of access to nutritionally adequate diet in a household or country can take various forms.

Transitory food insecurity occurs when there is a temporary decline in access to adequate food because of instability in food production, food price increases or income shortfalls.</p> <p></p> <p>We may distinguish between national food security and household food security. This distinction is necessary because an aggregate supply of food, from domestic sources or import or both, are prerequisite but certainly not a sufficient condition for a food secure situation in a country. In other words, adequate availability of food in Nigeria on a per capita basis does not necessarily translate to sufficient and adequate food for every citizen. Food security at household level is a subset of the national level and it requires that all individuals and households have access to sufficient food either by producing it themselves or by generatingsufficient income to demand for it.

Larger sized animals usually produce more meat than smaller animals. Size is commonly represented by weight, though other linear measurements can be used. The size of an animal should be considered in relation to its age allowing for evaluation of growth performance used as a component in deciding which animals to buy, sell, cull or mate. Body weight is measured not only to evaluate carcass yield (Afolayan <i>et al.,</i> 2006) and condition of the animal as a selection criterion but also to determine suitable medication dosage during health care and required feed amount of the animal (Kunene <i>et al.,</i> 2009). Goat farming has increased in the tropics and is important for economic and social livelihood of the large human population, contributing meat, milk and clothing in domestic markets (Kosgey <i>et al.,</i> 2006).</p> <p>The economic importance of goats and sheep in the livelihood of rural African people cannot be overemphasized. They play a pivotal role in the rural economy as sources of meat and milk and their processed products such as cheese, wool and hair (including monhair) and skins. Economic and environmental benefits are derived from dung (which improves soil fertility and structure) and from nutrient recycling, and also income generation (FAO, 2009). Goat production in Nigeria contributes significantly to the agrarian economy. Various factors are within the environment which dictates the performance of animals, and these factors include rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, wind movement, solar radiation. The effect of these environmental factors can mediate through reduction or increase in feed intake, weight gain, plane of nutrition, diseases, reproductive performance and feed efficiency (Imasuen and Otoikhian, 2004).</p> <p><b>1.1       Statement of research problem</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Semi-intensive system of management involves a part time grazing of animals (4 to 6 hours) after which they are supplemented with cut forages or other available feed materials to make up for the inadequate feed they get from grazing, and the energy expended during grazing can be replenished during supplementation of feed under this system of management.<br/> Also, considering the capricious nature of goats, they tend to expend more energy during grazing which could drastically affect their weight gain and subsequently their performances.</p> <p>Increased influx of livestock population into Niger State due to available water bodies and feed stuff results in creating problems in the feed resources available (Adama <i>et al,</i> 2008)</p> <p><b>1.2       Justification of the study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Given the limited work done on the effects of different management systems on weight gain in sheep and goats, this research on the determination of weight changes in sheep and goats raised semi-intensively is of paramount importance. This is because it will aid in generating baseline information on weight changes that will be used to advise livestock farmers within the study areas on good management practices with optimal impact on weight gain in sheep and goats which will result in high profit making for the farmer.</p> <p>During the dry season of the year, there is high competition on the feedstuff available (Adama <i>et al,</i> 2008). This brings about a need for supplementary feeding of the animals. Dry season periods could bring about decrease in weight gain. This leads to low economic value of our livestock species.

The World Bank (2000) observed that 70 percent of all Africans and nearly 90 percent of Africa’s poor work primarily in agriculture. Climate change affects agriculture and agriculture also affects climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) from different farming practices (Maraseni, Mustaq, and Maroulis2009; Edwards and Harris,2009).</p> <p></p> <p>The term “climate change” often refers to changes in climate which according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC (2007), are 90-95 percent likely to have been in part caused by human action. It describes changes in the variability of average state of the atmosphere over time scales, ranging from a decade to millions of years (Adejuwon, 2004). Swings in the global climate pattern have aroused attention at local, national and international levels (Onyeneke, 2010). Moreover, climate change is expected to increase with increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather conditions in Nigeria’s coastal and rainforest regions (Babatunde, Ayobami and Mark, 2011). The implications for the region are that it would generally experience wetter than average climate, more extreme weather conditions, particularly erosion, sea level rise and floods (Onyeneke, Iruo, and Ogboko,2012).</p> <p></p> <p> Given that agriculture and fishing remains the main sources of livelihood for most rural communities in Nigeria’s coastal and rainforest regions, climate change is expected to have greater negative impacts on poorer farm households as they have the lowest capacity to adapt to change in climate conditions and more vulnerable to vagaries that are climate induced (.Onyeneke, Iruo, and Ogboko 2012; Onyeneke and Madukwe, 2010). Adaptation measures are therefore important to help these communities to better face extreme weather conditions and associated climate variations (Adger, Brown, Conway, and Hulme, 2003). Estimates by Building Nigeria’s Response to Climate Change (BNRCC) (2011) suggest that, in the absence of adaptation, climate change could result to loss of 6% and 30% by the year 2050 (BNRCC, 2011). This loss is equivalent to N15 trillion (US$100 billion) and has the potential to significantly contribute to reductions in negative impacts from changes in climatic conditions as well as other changing socioeconomic conditions (Kandlinkar and Risbey, 2000).</p> <p> According to the Inter Academy Council Report (IACR) (2004), adverse climate change impacts are considered to be particularly strong in countries located in tropical Africa that depend on agriculture as their main source of livelihood. The challenge this poses affects sustainable development on the continent. This challenge is composed of the likely impacts on the ecosystem, agricultural production, and livelihoods. Generally, losses in the agricultural sector due to climate change have economy wide consequences, like loss in gross domestic output, a decline in the income and the general deterioration on households’ welfare. Climate change is also expected to exacerbate Africa’s struggles with strained water resources and food security. Mendelsohn, Dinar and Dalfelt. (2000) affirmed that rising global temperatures are expected to increase flooding in coastal areas, cause declines in agricultural production, threaten biodiversity and the productivity of natural resources, increase and exacerbate desertification. Thereby exerting a disproportionately adverse impact on Africa’s agriculture-based economy. To make matters worse, Africa has a low adaptive capacity due to its dependence on rain fed agriculture, low levels of human and physical studies on the effects of climate change on economic variables, estimated and a very high predicted loss of income due to climate change through crop simulation experiments (Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994).</p> <p> Nigeria, like all the countries in Sub-Sahara Africa is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC 2007; Nigerian Environmental Study Team (NEST 2004). IPCC (2007) further noted that Nigeria specifically, ought to have been concerned by climate change because of the country’s high vulnerability due to its long (800km) coastline that is prone to sea-level rise and the risk of fierce storms.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2       Statement of the Problem </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Climate change which is attributable to natural climate cycle and human activities, has adversely affected agricultural productivity in Africa (Ziervogel, Nyong, Osman, Conde, Cortes, and Dowing, 2006). As the planet warms, rainfall patterns shift and extreme events such as droughts, flood, and forest fires become more frequent (Zoellick, 2009). This results in poor and unpredictable yields which subject farmers to vulnerable events (United Nation Framework and Convention on Climate Change  UNFCCC, 2007). Farmers who constitute the bulk of the poor in Africa face challenges of tragic crop failures, reduced agricultural productivity, increased hunger, malnutrition and disease.</p> <p></p> <p>  Food crises in countries such as Nigeria are reminders of the continuing vulnerability of the region to the vicissitudes of climatic conditions. This is in large measure due to weak institutional capacity, limited engagement in environmental and adaptation issues, and a lack of validation of local knowledge (Adams <i>et al</i>. 1988, Royal society 2005; BNRCC, 2008) Accordingly, there is the need to gain as much information as possible, and learn the positions of rural farmers and their needs, on what they know about climate change in order to offer adaptation practices that meet these needs (Apata, Samuel and Adeola, 2009). Specifically in West Africa, small changes in comparison to the normal climatic factors can lead to climate extremes with disastrous consequences on agriculture, animal resources, and the economy as a whole. Other phenomena such as desertification, deforestation and in particular, migration of populations as a result of poverty associated to climatic effects call for urgent sensitization and actions for government and populations on climatic risk and their mitigation; and also their integration into development strategies (ECA,2008). The vulnerability of developing countries like Nigeria is worsened by heavy reliance on renewable natural resources for livelihoods, employment and incomes.</p> <p></p> <p>In view of the foregoing, the following research questions are deemed appropriate:</p> <p>i.                    What are the socioeconomic characteristics of crop farmers in the study area?</p> <p>ii.                  What is the level of awareness and the perception of crop farmers about climate change phenomenon in the study area?</p> <p>iii.                What is the level of vulnerability of crop farmers to the consequences of climate change in the study area?</p> <p>iv.                What are the indigenous and emerging adaptation measures used by the crop farmers in the study area, and</p> <p>v.                  What are the factors affecting the choice of adaptation measures selected by the farmers?</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3       Objectives of the Study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The main objective of the study is to analyse the vulnerability and adaptation of crop farmers to climate change in Agricultural  Zone 1 of Niger State, Nigeria.

Climate change influences crop production and have impacts on agriculture which become a crucial challenge for sustainable development on the continent. The challenge is composed of the likely impacts on the ecosystem services, agricultural production and livelihoods. The socioeconomic characteristics of crop farmers will provide insight on socio economic characteristics and institutional factors significantly affecting the vulnerability of famers to the policy makers to come up with appropriate policies on adaptation measures that will match the attributes of farmers. Information on the level of awareness and perception will guide the extension agency to come up with effective extension service delivery that will help the farmers cope with and adapt to climate change. The findings of the study on the vulnerability of farmers to climate change will assist the policy makers to come up with appropriate  policies  that  will reduce level of vulnerability of crop farmers to climate change. Farmers will also use the results as a handy guide to improve upon their resilience to climate change phenomena. The findings will also serve as spring board for the conduct of further research. </p> <p></p> <p>Till date, little attention had been devoted to investigate the extent of vulnerability of crop farmers in Niger State Nigeria. This is evidenced by a dearth of such studies which necessitated the conduct of this study.</p>\n\nVULNERABILITY AND ADAPTATION OF CROPS FARMERS TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN AGRICULTURAL ZONE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " VULNERABILITY AND ADAPTATION OF CROPS FARMERS TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN AGRICULTURAL ZONE", "id": 36}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>AN APPRAISAL OF AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (ADP) AND CASSAVA FARMING IN ATIBA LOCAL GOVERNMENT  AREA OF OYO STATE 2007-2015</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Atiba local government area of Oyo State in the western part of Nigeria is known for their agricultural practices; cassava is one of the agricultural products that can be found in this area of oyo state. cassava is one of the agricultural products that are consumed by both the rich and the poor; Atiba local government area is among the rural areas in Nigeria that survive mostly through the sales of agricultural products; the agricultural development programs plays a major role in the motivation of the practice of farming in these rural areas of Nigeria; the federal government of Nigeria have put up so many agricultural programs with aims of eradicating poverty in Nigeria especially the people in the rural area of Nigeria.</p> <p>The people of Atiba local government area is known for their fertile land; production of cassava and fish farming; the federal government of Nigeria wishes to improve the standard of living in this area of Oyo State. The agricultural programs plays a major role in the growth and development of the Nigeria economy through agriculture; some of these agricultural programs includes: United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Agricultural Development programmes (ADP), Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and the National Economic Empowerment and Development (NEED); all these are for the growth and development of agriculture in Nigeria but for the purpose of the research work, we shall focus on the Agricultural Development Programme (ADP); this programme was establish by the federal government of Nigeria in the year 1963 after independence; the main aim of this programme was to increase the production of agricultural products in Nigeria and to increase the income of most farmers that operates on a small scale through the provision of assistance such as giving them fertilizers, improved seed for good harvest; this programme have being of great important to both the small and medium scale farmers in Nigeria. according to (Ajayi and Ajala, 1997; Garba, 2000; akpabio,2007) they stateed that the agricultural programme aimed at increasing food production for rural dwellers and raising the income level of small scale  farmers by making provision for improved seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, credit facilities and infra- structural facilities.

The agricultural sector has the potential to be the industrial and economic springboard from which a country’s development can take off. Indeed, more often than not, agricultural activities are usually concentrated in the less developed rural areas where there is a critical need for rural transformation, redistribution, poverty alleviation and socio-economic development (Stewart, 2000). Nigeria’s economic aspirations have remained that of altering the structure of production and consumption patterns, diversifying the economic base and reducing dependence on oil, with the aim of putting the economy on a path of sustenance, all inclusive and non-inflationary growth. Despite Nigeria’s vast agricultural resources both human and natural, we are still faced with acute food crisis, the intensification of poverty and massive suffering of the overwhelming majority of Nigerians. This situation is however typical of all third world countries operating within the neo colonial capitalist system (Akor, 2009).</p> <p>Nigeria is generously endowed with abundant natural resources including biological and non -biological resources. Resources depend on importance attached to it, hence agriculture constitutes one of the most important sectors of the Nigerian economy. The significance of the agricultural resource in bringing about economic growth and sustainable development of a nation cannot be under-estimated. Agriculture contributes to the growth of the economy, provides employment opportunities for the teeming population, export revenue earnings and eradicates poverty in the economy. </p> <p>Abayomi (1997) stated that stagnation in agriculture is the principal explanation for poor economic performance, while rising agricultural productivity has been the most important concomitant of a successful industrialization. The pervasive influence of agriculture on Nigeria’s economic and social development has also been articulated by Oluwasanmi (1996) “A strong and efficient agricultural sector could enable a country to feed its growing population, generate employment, earn foreign exchange and provide raw materials for industries”. The agricultural sector has a multiplier effect on any nation’s socio- economic and industrial fabric because of the multifunctional nature of agriculture (Ogen, 2007). </p> <p>Agriculture has been defined as the production of food and livestock and the purposeful tendering of plants and animals, (Ahmed, 1995). He stated further that agriculture is the mainstay of many economies and it is fundamental to the socio- economic development of a nation because it is a major element and factor in national development. In the same vein, Okolo (2004) described the agricultural sector as the most important sector of the Nigerian economy which holds a lot of potentials for the future economic development of the nation as it had done in the past. Notwithstanding the enviable position of the oil sector in the Nigerian economy over the past three decades, the agricultural sector is arguably the most important sector of the economy.</p> <p>Generally the agricultural sector contributes to the development of an economy in four major ways ;product contribution, factor contribution, market contribution and foreign exchange contribution (Abayomi, 1997; Abdullahi 2002 &amp; World Bank 2007). The objective of this study is therefore to examine the agricultural sector as the key to the diversification of the Nigerian economy for sustainable development. </p> <p>The definition of agriculture changes over time. Agriculture is the cultivation of plants and husbandry of animals. That is, the management of living things and eco systems to produce goods and services for the people. Agriculture includes farming, ranching, aquaculture, apiculture, horticulture, viticulture, animal husbandry, including but not limited to the care and raising of livestock, poultry husbandry and  the production of poultry and poultry products, diary production, the production of  field crops, tobacco, fruits, vegetables, nursery stock, ornamental shrubs, ornamental trees, flowers, sod or mushrooms, timber,  pasturage, any combination of the foregoing, the processing, drying, storage and marketing of agricultural products. When these activities are conducted in conjunction with, but are secondary to such husbandry or production.</p> <p>The sustainability of agriculture in Nigeria cannot be isolated from the sustainability of economic development. A number of other related definitions are also in common usage. The American Society of Agronomy, for example, defines sustainable agriculture as one that, over the long term, enhances environmental quality and the resource base on which agriculture depends, provides for basic human food and fiber needs, is economically viable, and enhances the quality of life of farmers and society as a whole (Uptal, 2001).</p> <p> Another definition by Macrae (1990) posits that Sustainable agriculture is both a philosophy and a system of farming. It is rooted in a set of values that reflects an awareness of both ecological and social realities and a commitment to respond appropriately to that awareness. It emphasizes design and management procedures that work with natural processes to conserve all resources and minimize waste and environmental damage, while maintaining and improving farm profitability. </p> <p>Agricultural development, a subset of economic development, implies a sustained increase in the level of production and productivity over a reasonable length of time and the subsequent improved wellbeing of farmers as reflected in their higher per capita income and standard of living. Rural development relates not only to a sustained increase in the level of production and productivity of all rural dwellers, including farmers, and a sustained improvement in their wellbeing, manifested by increasing per capita income and standard of living, but also leads to a sustained physical, social and economic improvement of rural communities.</p> <p> The colonial government recognized the potential of the agricultural sector to improve the Nigerian economy and therefore put in place policies aimed at increasing output and to extract surpluses in the sector. The main focus of development in this period was the surplus extraction philosophy or policy whereby immense products were generated from the rural areas to satisfy the demand for raw materials in metropolitan Britain (Ayoola, 2001). This early interest of the extractive policy was on forest resources and agricultural exports like cocoa, coffee, rubber, groundnuts, oil palm, and cotton. The capitalist agricultural policies of Nigeria since 1900 have remained basically intact. No efforts have been made to fundamentally change them. The nature of these agricultural policies and their impacts led to Nigeria’s agricultural disorientation and the food crisis (Akor, 2009).</p> <p>Meanwhile, most of these policies were made without proper institutional arrangement, programs, specific projects, strategies, goals or targets and specific objectives geared towards the realization of these dreams of the policies. This can be proved by the fact that there was only one documented agriculture scheme that evolved towards the end of the era (early 1960s) called the farm settlement scheme (Iwuchukwu &amp; Igbokwe, 2012). The imperialistic theoretical framework of the notions of development and modernization have decisively influenced the Nigerian agricultural policies since the colonial era. The rate and direction of Nigeria’s agricultural development were therefore, determined by the British colonialist and taken over by the neo-colonial Nigerian ruling classes since 1960 (Akor, 2009).</p> <p>The Nigeria’s agricultural development was fully de-centralized with the regions and states carrying out all activities while support was provided by the federal government and this enabled a state/region specific approach. This approach involved the combined efforts of small scale farmers/the private sector and the government. This approach was very successful during the period and thus with agriculture remaining the mainstay of the Nigerian economy; providing employment, raw materials for industries, the main source of foreign exchange earnings and also sustaining the food security status of the populace. The appropriation and utilization of Nigeria’s economic surplus by the colonial and neo colonial imperialist powers is central to the analysis of the structural distortions in the agricultural sector and Nigeria’s food crisis. The central point in the imperialist relationship was the transfer of economic surplus to strengthen the capitalist class and the capitalist mode of production in Europe and North America (Akor, 2009).</p> <p>However, with the onset of the 1970’s, there was a national neglect of this sector due to oil boom which practically led to a decline in the sector (Abimiku, 2009). Despite the drastic decline, no matter how much development and structural transformation will be achieved in Nigeria, agriculture will continue to retain its relative dominance in the economy for many decades to come. More importantly, it is from agriculture and in particular from agricultural exports that the country received its principal stimulus for economic growth in 1950s and 1960s. It will remain a key factor in Nigeria’s economic development as the largest employer of labour (about 72% of the labour force in 1970-1971), the principal source of food and raw materials for the population and industries and a significant though relatively declining earner of foreign exchange. The acceleration of agricultural growth is therefore crucial for the country’s future progress (Akor, 2009).</p> <p>            In the 1970’s, the policy instrument that was introduced by government included a series of development plans at the national level. The Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) in 1986 came up after this and efforts were made at making the agricultural sector commercially competitive and remunerative and also tried to redress Nigeria’s defective mono-economic imbalance by diverse diversifying programs in order to reduce dependence on the oil sector and also on imports. This policy package focused on a rapid improvement of domestic food production, the domestic supply of agricultural raw materials, the production of exportable cash crops and also rural employment. The client status of Nigeria in the international capitalist system is the fundamental structural basis for imposing the abuses of underdevelopment on the country (Akor, 2009). </p> <p>The programs only succeeded in creating and raising the awareness to diversify the economy through agriculture and the catalytic and leading role the private sector must play in agricultural development which renewed a general interest in agriculture. Despite its huge potentials, the country is a net importer of food. The nation’s food import basket is made up of items which can be produced locally in sufficient amount. In addition, the economy is characterized by price volatility and high prices due to over dependence on rain-fed agricultural output. Some of the problems faced by agricultural sector include; Under-investment, low productivity, inadequate input, poor and rudimentary storage culture, unfavourable exchange rate policy among others. In addition, (Adesina, 2011), posited that only 1% of total lending in banking sector goes to agriculture despite the fact that the sector accounts for about 70% of employment opportunities and 44% of the Nation’s GDP. The promotion of capitalist agricultural development in Nigeria led to heavy reliance on imported agricultural inputs from the core capitalist countries from 1970 to 1979, while the imported agricultural inputs increased, there were no visible increase in both food and cash crop production .The rise in the importation of agricultural inputs went hand in hand with the rise in food imports, food shortages and negative output of cash crops. The poor performance records of the agriculture in the face of massive imported agricultural inputs imply that the strategy must be faulty and the solutions anticipated misconceived (Akor, 2009).</p> <p>According to (Sanusi, 2011), Nigeria is incurring a total food import bill of $4.2billion about N638.4billion annually due to the neglect of agriculture and partly due to insatiable appetite of Nigerians for foods not locally produced. For instance, Nigeria is the only country in the world that does not produce wheat and yet consumes 100% wheat bread. According to Okojie &amp; Mike (2006), the relationship between export performance and economic growth has been a subject of considerable interests to development economists especially those who believe that economic growth should be sustained and maintained.  Chenery &amp; Strout, (1994) asserted that for a long time, there was hardly any country which exhibited sustained economic growth rate higher than its growth of exports. They also claimed that growth rates of individual developing countries correlate better with their export performance than with any other single economic indicator.</p> <p>Nigerian government at different times have formulated and implemented several agricultural policies aimed at addressing the myriads of problems confronting the sector and ensuring food availability and foreign exchange earnings for the country. However, for a policy to have a meaningful impact, it must have strategies (that is, programs or projects) geared towards the accomplishment of specific objectives and the ultimate goal of the policy. To this extent, various policy programs and projects have been initiated in Nigeria. Some of these policy programs recorded substantial success while some were huge failures. Similarly, Offiong, (1980) opined that the general obstacles that has frustrated the African match towards economic freedom remained imperialism and dependency. Another impact of imperialism is seen through the process of making and unmaking leaders .As illustrated by Onimode, (1988) “there is no gain saying that most coups carried out in the African continent were planned by the colonial imperialist powers to achieve their purpose of dominance”.</p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Nigeria is yet to attain the ranks of a developed country due to lack of structural changes among other factors. Also, it was observed that a factor crucial to this lack of economic progress is the lack of economic diversity which caused the economy to rely heavily on crude oil for revenues and as a major export commodity in the economy (Osuntogun, 1997). Prior to the 1970’s, Nigeria’s exports were predominantly non-oil commodities with agricultural commodities accounting for a lion share. However, in the 1970’s when the price of crude oil in the international market skyrocketed, the share of agricultural exports began to fall and have remained low ever since. This is majorly due to the money spinning nature of oil export which makes it more profitable to export oil and less profitable to export non-oil commodities.</p> <p>This has caused a rather heavy dependence on the oil sector and the proceeds from exportation of crude oil. This heavy reliance subjects the country to difficulties when the price of crude oil, the major exports commodity is low in the international market (as it is case presently). In light of this, the government adopted various strategies to boost agricultural exports and stabilize the economy. In spite of these efforts, the performance and contributions of the agricultural sector has remained low. The sector has continued to perform below its full potentials. This research is therefore carried out to address the following issues/questions.</p> <p>1.         What are the factors responsible for low agricultural output in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.         Why the less emphasis on agricultural sector and much dependence on petroleum sector?</p> <p>3.         What measures should be taken by government to enhance the performance of the agricultural sector towards diversifying the economy for sustainable development?</p> <p>4.         Has petroleum impacted positively or otherwise on the agricultural sector and the development of the Nigerian economy?</p> <p><strong>1.3       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In spite of Nigeria’s rich agricultural endowment, there has been a gradual decline in agricultural contribution to the nation’s economy. Low agricultural output has a negative effect on the Nigerian economy as a whole. This research work is aimed at examining the agricultural sector as the key to the diversification of the Nigerian economy for a sustainable development. Other aims include:</p> <p>1.      To see how Agriculture can be used for the diversification of the Nigerian economy in order to achieve sustainable development.</p> <p>2.      To identify the constraints hampering Agriculture as a tool for the diversification of the Nigerian economy for sustainable development.</p> <p>3.      To suggest ways of removing these constraints.</p> <p>4.       To suggest other measures necessary for improving agriculture as a tool for the diversification of the Nigerian economy for sustainable development.</p> <p><strong>1.4     METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research is geared towards understanding the role of agriculture in the diversification of the Nigerian economy for sustainable development. This study will employ the use of quantitative statistical tools and econometric method of analysis. An econometric multiple regression model will be adopted to determine the impact of agriculture on Nigeria’s economic growth. With the appropriate model, the following tests will be conducted to test the statistical reliability and the significance of the estimated parameters: the standard error test, t-statistics and f-test.                            </p> <p>For the purpose of data analysis, a multiple regression model will be used to show the relationship between the dependent variable (GDP) as a proxy for economic growth and the explanatory variables, the revenue from agricultural output, unemployment rate and inflation rate. The hypotheses to be tested in this study are:</p> <p><strong>HO</strong>:      There is no significant impact of agricultural output on Nigeria’s economic growth.</p> <p><strong>H1</strong>:       There is a significant impact of agricultural output on Nigeria’s economic growth. </p> <p>The hypotheses are to be tested at 5% level of significance.</p> <p>            This can be represented mathematically as:</p> <p>GDP = f (X1, X2, X3,)</p> <p>This can be further expressed in an econometric model as:</p> <p>GDP = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + β3X3+µ</p> <p>Where:</p> <p>GDP = Gross Domestic Product</p> <p>X1 = Agricultural Output</p> <p>X2 = Unemployment rate</p> <p>X3= Inflation rate</p> <p>β0 = Constant term</p> <p>β1 = Parameter estimate of agricultural output</p> <p>β2= Parameter estimate of unemployment rate </p> <p>β3=Parameter estimate of inflation rate</p> <p>µ = Error term or stochastic variable</p> <p>The a priori expectation is that an increase in the independent variable (agricultural output) will have an increase in the dependent variable (GDP) while a decrease in the independent variable (unemployment rate) will have an increase in GDP and an increase in inflation rate will have an increase on the GDP. Hence, positive β1, negative β2, and positive β3.</p> <p>This research work has six chapters, with chapter one covering the general introduction, which includes introduction, background of the study, statement of the problem, objectives of the study, methodology of the study, sources of data, scope and limitations of the study.</p> <p>Chapter two contains literature review which gives the Classical’s, Neo-Classical’s, Keynesian’s, Neo-Keynesian’s, and Marxian views about using agriculture for economic diversification.</p> <p>Chapter three examined the Nigerian oil dominated economy and the need for diversification. This contains the declining dominance of the petroleum sector in the Nigerian economy, Alternative sources for the diversification of the Nigerian economy for sustainable development and agriculture as the main vehicle for the diversification of the Nigerian economy.       </p> <p>Chapter four focuses on the agricultural sector as the key to the diversification of the Nigerian economy for sustainable development; agriculture as the main tool for increased revenue generation in Nigeria, agriculture as the main tool for solving Nigeria’s unemployment problem, agriculture as the main tool for curbing inflation in Nigeria, agriculture as the main source of raw materials for industries in Nigeria, agriculture as the main tool for reducing poverty, hunger and malnutrition in Nigeria and agriculture as the main tool for remedying Nigeria’s balance of payment problems.        </p> <p>Chapter five deals with data presentation and analysis, model specification, model estimation, test of statistical significance, interpretation of results and discussion of findings.</p> <p>Chapter six summarizes the research work.

Agriculture as its output tends to contribute significantly in the areas like employment opportunities, provision of food to the increasing population, contribution to GDP where the country is able to earn foreign exchange, also the provision of raw materials to our local industries particularly the agro-allied industries for further production.</p> <p>An overview of Nigerian agricultural sector during 1960’s revealed that</p> <p>agricultural sector was the most important to the economy. In fact, the generation of this period can still remember those days when the pyramid of groundnut was the pride to the northern region and cocoa production areas of the west also boosted the foreign earning from cocoa exports. Today, the nation is still not independent in terms of agriculture providing food for its people to feed on.</p> <p>Credit is an important instrument for improving the welfare of the poor directly through consumption smoothening that reduces their vulnerability to short-term income. It also enhances productive capacity of the poor through financing investment in their human and physical capital. The demand for credit for productive investments usually comes from the poor who are less risk-averse and it enables them to overcome liquidity constraints, making it possible to undertake investments that can boost production, employment and income. Financial intermediaries have not been able to accommodate small-scale farmers because it is risky and a different task associated with high transaction costs. Lack of information prevented large formal leaders who had capacity to serve the smallscale farmers and the poor from doing so. It is undisputable that small-scale farmers have always had a problem of access to credit facilities. To improve the access, improvements need to be made in the provision of financial services. In order to implore financial services, leaders need to consider the preferences and socio-economic condition of clients. This contributes to both regulatory process as well as product development – thus, an understanding of characteristics influencing farmers’ decision to use agricultural credit could assist policy formulation that could enhance welfare of the poor or those excluded from access to credit</p> <p>facilities.</p> <p>The poor performance of Nigerian agriculture and its attendant effect prompted government to seek and reverse the situation which was demonstrated in the policies and practice such as National Accelerated food production programme</p> <p>(NAFPP), Operation Feed the Nation (OFN), Green Revolution Programme (GRP), Accelerated Crops Production Programme Scheme (ACPS) and</p> <p>international organisation like the World Bank. This includes some of the steps taken by the Federal Government of Nigeria to assist farmers to boost agricultural production in the country.</p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong></p> <p>In spite of the remarkable contribution of the agricultural sector to the GDP, findings over the years here shown that government subsidies directed at the agricultural sector have drastically reduced and as such the dwindling fall in agricultural productivities and by extension agricultural development. In Nigeria, as in most developing countries, “lack of credit facilities has been regarded as the major constraint farmers face when they try to improve economic activities and/or living conditions” (Britain, 1986: Biswanger et al, 1993: Agbor, 2004). Even when available, access to credit facilities is difficult to access by farmers in the rural area despite the fact that it is an essential input in production (FARM, 2006). This could be adduced to lack of information and collateral securities among farmers.</p> <p>Furthermore, the behaviours of financial institutions set up to finance agriculture revealed that funds necessary to induce agricultural productivity has not been geared toward agricultural sector. Commercial banks in particular are skeptical towards financing agricultural activities and in most cases do not offer friendly interest rate to encourage farmers to acquire loans. This research study shall examine the analysis of credit facilities to small scale farmers in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>The specific objectives of the analysis of credit facilities to small scale farmers are:</p> <p>i.                 To analyze the impact of credit facilities to the operation of small scale farmers in Nigeria.</p> <p>ii.               To identify and analyze the socio-economic characteristics that may influence farmer’s decision about whether or not to use credit.</p> <p>iii.            To examine the probability that non-borrowers can borrow given that socioeconomic characteristics are increased.</p> <p><strong>1.4            </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS </strong></p> <p>Given the nature of this research work there is need to formulate a reasonable hypothesis:</p> <p>H0: credit facilities are not significant in the operation of small scale farmers in Nigeria.</p> <p>H1: Credit facilities are significant in the operation of small scale farmers in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.5            </strong><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>The scope of this study shall cover the role of credit facilities to small scale farmers in Bende L.G.A in Abia state. This study shall encompass the nature, the structure of availability of each facility as well as measurement of relative accessibility to small scale farmers in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6            </strong><strong>JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY </strong></p> <p>The concern of credit facilities as a factor input has been amplified by different experts and government itself has the potentials of opening new doors of opportunities in the development of small-scale farming in Nigeria.</p> <p>There are few studies on the subject of small scale farm credit and how their socioeconomic characteristics influence their decision about whether or not to take credit. The development of the sector is not feasible if an avenue of credit facilities is not provided. Therefore, this research work is directed at providing insight into this less studied dimension in agriculture by eliciting and analyzing small scale farmers’ socio-economic factors that affect their decision about credit facilities, and also to evaluate the nature, structure and pattern of credit facilities to small scale farmers in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.7            </strong><strong>ORGANISATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is divided into five chapters. Chapter one contains the introduction of the study, chapter two deals with the review of relevant literature and theoretical framework, while chapter three presents the research methodology which embodies specification of estimating techniques. Chapter four reveals the presentation and discussion of results and findings, while summary of findings, conclusion and recommendation are provided in chapter five.</p>\n\nANALYSIS OF CREDIT FACILITIES TO SMALL SCALE FARMERS.

In the center of this stone or nut lies the seed.  The fleshy part of the fruit (the pulp) is at first black in colour, but as it ripens becomes bright red.  Palm fruit common name for member is palm a large fairly of chiefly tropic all trees shmbs and vines, most spies are traces characterized by a crown of compound teases called fronds terminal tall woody, unbrached  stem. Also oil palm being a nature of equatorial west Africa and preferring high rainfall and a more open kind a long river banks grow in bunches weighing up to ten kilograms and containing hundreds of fruitless like small plums.  The flesh is oily and the oil ran be recovered by very simple means so that it is probable that palm oil has been recovered and used for human food for tens of thousand of years.  The primitive extraction procedure are still in use in the village today.  A typical method consists of cutting the bunches, usually after climbing the tree and allowing them to ferment in a heap for six to seven days then production takes place.  Vegetable as it is generally called is an important product and raw material for most agro allied industries. More emphasis had been placed on vegetable oil from groundnut source in recent time, this had been attainted to its local usages most especially in domestic activities like cooking and as well as its cheap and local method of production but with the new trend in technology, vegetable oil is how being produced from both palm oil and palm kernel fruit.</p> <p><strong>1.10   OBJECTIVES/SCOPE OF STUDUY</strong></p> <p>The objective of this study and analysis is to know the characteristics of the fats contained in the oil and other characteristic features in the oil about to help the manufacture that uses chide palm oil as a raw material to know the measure of proportion of both the saturated and unsaturated acids present the degree of instauration, its reactions with other products or fats and with them jow the oil behaves in the percale of other kind of reacting substances, these study and help to a great extent in the productions of some products</p> <p>It also help one to know hoe to recover the fats present in die oil and under which condition it can be recovered and the methods of determination of the fatty acid composition.  This analysis also help in detecting the deterioration of fats; the greatest  objective is to determine the constants which helps every industries and companies that uses there oils as their raw material to know which the oil is adulterated and how to avoid and examine the mixtures contained in these oils.</p> <p>These study helps to expose so many the be or environment to the nutritional value, economic value; is benefits heath wise and also the commercial gain to their country and  its economy.  known to be the most productive oil crop, a hectare of oil palm can produce five tone of crude palm oil.  This is five to ten femies more than the yield of any commercial grown oil crop.</p> <p>  <br/></p>\n\nANALYSIS OF CRUDE PALM OIL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANALYSIS OF CRUDE PALM OIL", "id": 40}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>AN ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURE ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study examined and analysed the impact of agriculture on economic growth in Nigeria. It adopted the secondary data sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria covering the period 1985 to 2010. The study employed the modern Time Series of the Ordinary Least Square to test for the relationship between agriculture and economic growth in Nigeria. The results derived infer that there exists a significant relationship between agriculture spending and economic growth. The null hypothesis stated for this study does not hold. What this implies is that agriculture revolution is a determinant to economic growth. Thus, it is important that the government placed greater emphases on this sector by increasing budgetary allocation to agriculture in Nigeria in other meet the recommendations of both Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and African Union (AU). It is recommended that  more funding be provided  for agricultural universities in the country to carry out more research on all aspect of agricultural output, such as livestock, crops, fishing and forestry, crop preservation and also establishment of more research institutes to improve seedling production, encourage the use of irrigation farming system and provision of storage facilities for seasonal products as means of improving the country’s agricultural output.  Further recommendations include the need for the Central Bank of Nigeria to come out with stable policy guideline to enable the commercial banks disburse loans to farmers at a very lower interest rate, in order to help them expand their production capacity. More so, the need for government to encourage more exportation of agricultural output as this in turn will enhance external foreign exchange earnings and improve the competitiveness of Nigerian agricultural produce in the international markets.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>Page</p> <p>Title page                                                                                                                             i</p> <p>Certification                                                                                                                        ii</p> <p>Dedication                                                                                                                          iii</p> <p>Acknowledgements                                                                                                         iv        </p> <p>List of Tables/ figures                                                                                                       viii</p> <p>Abstract                                                                                                                              ix</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE- INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1            Background to the Study</p> <p>1.2            Statement of the Problem</p> <p>1.3            Objectives of the Study</p> <p>1.4            Research Questions</p> <p>1.5            Hypothesis for the Study</p> <p>1.6            Significance of the Study</p> <p>1.7            Brief Methodology</p> <p>1.8            Plan of the Study</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO- LITERATURE REVIEW AND THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</strong></p> <p>2.1      Introduction</p> <p>2.2      Empirical review</p> <p>2.3      The Profile of Agriculture in Nigeria</p> <p>2.4      Budgetary Allocation to Agricultural sector of Nigeria</p> <p>2.5      Effect of Neglect of Agriculture in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE- ANALYTICAL FRAME WORK AND RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>3.1      Introduction</p> <p>3.2      Analytical Framework</p> <p>3.3      Methodology</p> <p>3.4      Sources of Data</p> <p>3.5      Re- statement of Hypothesis</p> <p>3.6      Specification of Model</p> <p>3.7      Model Estimation Techniques</p> <p>3.8      Unit Root Test</p> <p>3.9      Integration Analysis</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR- EMPIRICAL RESULT AND DISCUSSION</strong></p> <p>4.1      Description of Data</p> <p>4.2      Unit Root Test</p> <p>4.3      Co integration Test</p> <p>4.4      Long run Static Regression Analysis</p> <p>4.5      Error Correction Model</p> <p>4.6      Short Run Regression Coefficient</p> <p>4.7      Coefficient of determination</p> <p>4.8      Short Run Model’s Goodness of Fit</p> <p>4.9      Stability Test</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE- SUMMARY, RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSION</strong></p> <p><strong>SUGESTION FOR FURTHER STUDY</strong></p> <p>5.1       Summary</p> <p>5.2      Conclusion and Recommendations</p> <p>5.3      Suggestion for further studies</p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p><strong>Appendix</strong></p> <p><strong>List of Tables/ Figures</strong></p> <p>1.                 Agriculture share of the total GDP at Current Basic Prices (1985-2010)</p> <p>2.                 Growth Rate of Real GDP- Agriculture</p> <p>3.                 Proportion of  the Nigeria’s annual budget in Agriculture: 1985-2010</p> <p>4.        Descriptive Statistics</p> <p>      5.       Unit Root at a level</p> <p>      6.        Unit Root at First Difference</p> <p>      7.        Johansen Co integration</p> <p>      8.        Static Regression</p> <p>      9.       Error Correction Model Estimate</p> <p><strong>List of figure</strong></p> <p>1       Trend in Agricultural output (RGDPAG) and Government Budget to Agricultural sector(BUDGAG)in Nigeria</p> <p>2       Cumulative Sum of Square at 5 percent significance test of stability</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The term Agriculture is derived from the Latin words, “ager,” meaning field, and “Cultura”, meaning cultivation. This suggests that the earliest form of production agriculture was crop production (Are, Igbokwe, Asadu, Bawa, 2010; Erebor, 2003). It may be noted that Agriculture is more than crop production. It also includes animal production, processing of primary products (or value addition) and marketing of produce and products. Erebor (2003) defines agriculture as the art and science of cultivating the soil, processing crops and livestock products for man, and the process of selling excess crop and livestock.</p> <p>Meanwhile, (Kricher,1997) defines agriculture in a more advanced way by saying that, agriculture or farming is the simplification of nature’s  food webs and the rechanneling of energy for human planting and animal consumption. To simplify, agriculture involves redirecting nature’s natural flow of the food web. The natural flow of the food web is the sun provides light to plants convert sunlight into sugars which provide food for the plants (this process is called photosynthesis). Plants provide food for herbivores (plant-eating animals) and the herbivores provides food for carnivores (meat-eating animals).  This simple illustration of food web provides the basis for analyzing the impact of agriculture on economic growth.</p> <p>In literature, economic history provides us with ample evidence that agricultural revolution is a fundamental pre-condition for economic growth, especially in developing countries. Development economists have focused on how agriculture can best contribute to overall economic growth and modernization. Todaro and Smith (2003) look at Lewis theory of development, and reported that the underdeveloped economy consisted of two sectors. These sectors are the traditional agricultural sector characterized by zero marginal labour productivity and the modern industrial sector. In Rostow’s linear stages of economic growth, agricultural revolutions is a pre-condition for take-off and take-off stages</p> <p>The importance of a vibrant and robust agriculture is reminiscent on its role in providing employment opportunities for the teeming population, eradicates poverty and contributing to the growth of the economy. The linkage between agriculture and economic growth is well documented in literature (Ogen, 2007; Okongwu, 1986; Atte and Muhammed- Lawal, 2006 to maintain few). According to Izuchukwu (2011), agriculture has been the backbone of the economy in Nigeria providing employment and source of livelihood for the increasing population,it accounts for over half of the GDP of the Nigerian economy as at independence in 1960.</p> <p> However, the role it plays in the regional and economic development of the country has diminished over the years due to the dominant role of the crude oil sector in the economy. With the increasing food demand in Nigeria, the country has available natural resources and potential for increasing the volume of crop production towards meeting the food and nutritional requirement of the rapidly increasing population and guarantee food security in the country. Therefore, the source of national wealth is essentially agriculture.</p> <p>Unquestionably, the neglect of agriculture in Nigeria owing to the discovery of oil has retarded the growth of the economy for the past decades.  The effect of this neglect could be felt in the poor quality of life of people as  average Nigerian was quoted as living in US$ 1 per day; if translated to Naira, this amount to N165 day at present. It may not be wrong to say that such a remark is a political cover. The faces we see daily on our streets and those we may not be able to see because of their inability to muster enough strength to walk up to the street as a result of several days of hunger and starvation, or even food associated ill-health and avoidable deaths of tens of people everyday, a better, more sincere and realistic assessment of the situation would be put an average income at US $0-0.5 per day. Studies in literature reveal that seven out of every 10 Nigerians live in abject poverty; hardly able to feed, cloth or house themselves. It is an indisputable fact that Nigeria and her sub-Saharan African neighbors have been dubiously christened by the world political and economic powers as citadels of hunger, poverty, ignorance, diseases, misery, debts, filths and crises. This unquestionable imagery will for long remain indelible in the world's archives unless a reasonable step is taken by people and Government of this doomed sector of the global village. It is against this backdrop that the study seeks to assess the impact of agriculture on economic growth.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>Besides oil, the major strength of the Nigerian economy is its rich agricultural resource base, its human resource and its huge markets. However, these resources have to be effectively mobilized so as to diversify the economic base and reduce dependence on oil and import. The economy remains vulnerable to external shocks emanating from fluctuation in the world prices of crude oil and the rising prices of imports. The resulting external and internal in balances are manifested in the adverse balance of payment position, unemployment and low capacity utilization in virtually all sectors as well as the deteriorating purchasing power of the populace (Atte and Muhammed- Lawal, 2006).</p> <p>The contribution of agriculture to the Nigerian economic growth is very low compared to what it used to be in the past 14 years. Nigerian agriculture to a large extent still possesses the characteristics of a peasant economy that was prominent in the pre-independence period. Given the information above, this study seeks to assess the impact of agriculture on economic growth in Ni</p>\n\nAN ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURE ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURE ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA", "id": 41}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div>THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION STRATEGIES ON FOOD CROP PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY IN SOUTHWESTERN NIGERIA</div> <div> <div>ABSTRACT<br/>This study examined the effects of climate change adaptation strategies on food crop<br/>production efficiency in Southwestern Nigeria.

The stochastic frontier analysis<br/>showed that labour, farm size and other agrochemicals are highly significant at 1% level of<br/>probability in food crop production. The computed mean technical efficiency estimate was<br/>0.84. The technical inefficiency model showed that land fragmentation (i.e. multiple farm<br/>plots) and multiple planting dates had significant positive relationship with technical<br/>inefficiency but years of climate change awareness and social capital had significant inverse<br/>relationship with it. The stochastic frontier profit function showed that rent on farm land and<br/>price of labour were highly significant at 1% level of probability. The computed average<br/>profit efficiency of the respondents was 0.67. The profit inefficiency model revealed that offfarm<br/>employment, multiple planting dates, crop diversification and education level had<br/>significant positive relationship with profit inefficiency but land fragmentation (i.e. multiple<br/>farm plots), years of climate change awareness and social capital had negative relationship<br/>with it. The factor analysis revealed that the major constraints to climate change adaptation<br/>among the food crop farmers were public, institutional and labour constraints; land,<br/>neighbourhood norms and religious beliefs constraints; high cost of inputs, technological and<br/>information constraints; farm distance, access to climate information, off-farm-job and credit<br/>constraints; and poor agricultural programmes and service delivery constraints. The study,<br/>therefore, recommends, inter alia, proactive regulatory land use systems that will make food<br/>crop farmers to participate in a more secured land ownership system should be put in place<br/>to enhance their investment in climate change adaptation strategies that has a long-term<br/>effect. Morealso, Government and non-governmental organizations should help the farmers<br/>in the area of provision and/ or facilitate the provision of input-based adaptation strategies in<br/>the study area. Again, intensive use of already proven adaptation strategies at farm-level by<br/>the farmers at their present resource technology will still make them to reduce technical and<br/>profit inefficiencies by 16% and 33% respectively, in the study area.</div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION STRATEGIES ON FOOD CROP PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY IN SOUTHWESTERN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION STRATEGIES ON FOOD CROP PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY IN SOUTHWESTERN NIGERIA", "id": 42}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  </p> <p>WOMEN LABOUR UTILIZATION IN CROP PRODUCTION</p> <div> <div>ABSTRACT<br/>The main aim of the study was to analyze women labour utilization in crop production in<br/>Abia State. The specific objectives included (i) identify specific farming operations that<br/>utilize women labour in the study area; (ii) compare the relative contribution of women and<br/>men to total labour utilization in different levels of farm operation in the study area; (iii)<br/>identify factors that affect the participation of women in different levels of farm operations;<br/>(iv) determine the effect of women labour utilization on the value of farm output ; and (v)<br/>identify and analyze the constraints facing women farmers in crop production in the study<br/>area. Using multi-stage sampling technique, the study area was zoned into three using the<br/>existing zoning arrangement of the Abia State Agricultural Development Programme (ADP).<br/>Nine (9) rural Local Government Areas (LGA) were randomly selected from the Zones. From<br/>the LGAs, 18 communities were randomly selected and from the communities, 36 villages<br/>were randomly selected. From these villages, 108 households having women farmers were<br/>randomly selected. A set of structured questionnaire was administered on the relevant women<br/>and men farmers in the household to obtain required information. Data were analyzed using<br/>descriptive statistics, multiple regression analysis, t-test, likert rating scale and multinomial<br/>logit model.<br/><br/> Results showed that among twelve crop production operations identified in 2010<br/>farming season, greater proportion of all the operations were executed by the women farmers<br/>e.g. harvesting 70%, planting 63%, weeding 60% and transplanting 58%. The men and hired<br/>labour were used for tedious operations like ridging and bush clearing. The multinomial logit<br/>result showed that the participation of women belonging to large families were less in<br/>clearing and cultivation. Their level of income had a negative relationship with clearing. The<br/>multiple regression analysis showed that greater number of variables like age, farm<br/>experience and household size were significant and have positive effect on output at 5 %<br/>level of significance. The multiple regression analysis showed that the value of Coefficient of<br/>determination otherwise known as R-square (R2) was 0.67. Despite the high level of<br/>participation of women farmers in crop production, they still face unique constraints which<br/>adversely affected their ability to increase food production. The identified problems included<br/>lack of finance, lack of improved inputs, lack of storage facilities among others. Poor<br/>implementation of agricultural projects and policies, lack of government commitment and<br/>intervention programmes not directed to the farmers needs were the major reasons why<br/>previous intervention measures did not achieve much success. The study therefore<br/>recommended that adequate finance should be provided by government to support women<br/>labour requirements. Government should ensure implementation of agricultural programmes<br/>by monitoring and evaluating them from the beginning to the end by independent consultants.<br/>The problem of illiteracy among rural women can be overcome if extension<br/>services extend their training to the rural women.</div> </div>\n\nWOMEN LABOUR UTILIZATION IN CROP PRODUCTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " WOMEN LABOUR UTILIZATION IN CROP PRODUCTION", "id": 43}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  </p> <p>THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION STRATEGIES ON FOOD CROP PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY </p> <div> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div><br/>This study examined the effects of climate change adaptation strategies on food crop<br/>production efficiency in Southwestern Nigeria.

Specifically, the study was designed to: determine food culture and practices of<br/>the respondents; determine the household food security status (energy availability) across<br/>ethnic groups; determine dietary diversity of the households across cultures; identify<br/>perceived constraints militating against household food security; and describe the coping<br/>strategies utilized by the households during food shortages. Seven hypotheses and a<br/>conceptual framework were developed for the study. The population of the study consists<br/>of all ethnic groups in North Central Nigeria. The zone comprises about 60 ethnic groups.<br/>Specifically, the study was carried out among Tiv, Igala and Eggon ethnic groups of<br/>Benue, Kogi and Nasarawa States. A multi-stage sampling technique was adopted for the<br/>study. Three ethnic groups (Tiv, Igala and Eggon) and one village per ethnic group were<br/>purposively selected based on differences in language and culture. The total sample size<br/>for this study was 340 respondents, made up of 120 Tiv households, 108 Igala households<br/>and 112 Eggon households. Data for the study were collected through the use of interview<br/>schedule.</p> <p>The data were analyzed using frequency, percentage, mean score, food security<br/>index, factor analysis; the comparative (reduced) coping strategy index (CSI), logit<br/>regression, Kruskal-Wallis (H) statistic and correlation. The study revealed that majority<br/>(91.2%) of the respondents were males. The mean age of the respondents was 43.36 years<br/>while their mean household size was 5 members. The mean farm size of the respondents<br/>was 3.3 hectares while their average fertilizer use was 4.73kg/ha per annum. Majority<br/>(53.2%) had no formal education; majority (89.4%) had no access to credit and about<br/>53.2% did not participate in non-farm activities. The average output from own production<br/>was 6211.79kg and majority (60%) of the respondents possessed goats. The mean farm<br/>income; mean non-farm income and average annual household income for the<br/>respondents were 69,539.00 naira; 22,486.00 naira and 91,752.00 naira, respectively.<br/>Majority (93.2%) of husbands took decisions on household agricultural activities; all<br/>respondents practiced subsistence farming; and 94.7% practiced mixed cropping.<br/>Majority (88.6%) of the respondents preferred major crops; about 92.5% acquired<br/>farmland through inheritance; and the family (67. %) constituted the main source of<br/>labour. Majority of the respondents used traditional processing (97.4%) and storage<br/>(96.2%) methods.

However, the farmers’ ability to effectively respond to climate change challenges<br/>is determined by the quality of information available to the farmers and how easily the<br/>information is accessed. The study sought to assess the information needs of rural farmers on<br/>climate change. A total of I52 respondents were selected using multistage sampling technique.<br/>Percentages, mean scores, standard deviations, factor analysis and multiple linear regression<br/>model were used in data analysis and presentation. The findings show that all the respondents<br/>indicated awareness of climate change. However, the knowledge score used indicated that none<br/>of the respondents had high knowledge on climate change. The respondents’ major and<br/>perceived reliable sources of knowledge were personal observations and friends. These<br/>information sources according to the findings were useful especially on adaptation. The major<br/>areas of information needs of the farmers on adaptation were use of improved varieties,<br/>occupational diversification, use of weed tolerant varieties, change in timing of farm operations,<br/>use of herbicides and pesticides and incorporating residue into the soil. However the findings<br/>indicate that the following were the perceived major constraints to effective communication of<br/>climate change: poor communication linkage between scientists, extension agents and farmers,<br/>lack of proper enlightenment, lack of participatory approach to communication, poor use of local<br/>dialect in translation and communication of climate change information jargon to rural farmers,<br/>lack of communication facilities etc.</p> <p>The respondents’ perceived strategies that can be used for<br/>effective communication of climate change information were: use of vernacular through mass<br/>media to disseminate climate change information, use of participatory approach in<br/>communicating climate change information, incorporating the needs, perception and concern of<br/>the target audience and ensuring relevance of information to the target audience, ensuring<br/>reliability of information, use of credible experts who have knowledge of vernacular, and<br/>bridging the communication gap between scientists, extension agents and farmers. Other<br/>strategies include: use of local and religious leaders to disseminate climate change information,<br/>use of local languages (dialect) and folks, use of audio visual aids and provision of timely<br/>information, training of communicators of climate change information, strengthening agricultural<br/>extension delivery system, provision of communication facilities by government to climate<br/>change communicators, and use of service providers to disseminate climate change information<br/>through short message service. The findings reveal that the following had significant influence<br/>on knowledge level (p≤0.05): years spent in formal education, membership of social/religious<br/>organization, number of climate change training, farm size, marital status, access to credit, and<br/>climate change training.</p> </div>\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE INFORMATION NEEDS OF RURAL FARMERS IN ENUGU STATE, NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CLIMATE CHANGE INFORMATION NEEDS OF RURAL FARMERS IN ENUGU STATE, NIGERIA", "id": 46}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  </p> <div>DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS FROM SORREL</div> <div> <p>ABSTRACT<br/>The objectives of the study were to develop products from sorrel calyces, leaves and seeds,<br/>evaluate the products for nutrients, phytochemicals, antinutrients, food toxicant, physicochemical,<br/>microflora, sensory, storage properties and compare the products produced with<br/>existing products.

Effects of these processing methods on the<br/>chemical composition, hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic potentials of the vegetables were<br/>evaluated. In vitro antioxidant potentials of processed and unprocessed vegetables were<br/>estimated using the 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl radical (DPPH) while superoxide<br/>dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were used for in vivo model. The hypoglycemic<br/>properties of aqueous extracts of VA and GL were evaluated in rats using a dosage of<br/>300g/Kg bodyweight.

This is partly true but for a better understanding of poverty it is necessary to go beyond this simple or common sense, definition of poverty. Poverty is much more than a simple lack of money. For example, if you were stranded on a desert island and you had several thousand dollars or pounds in cash, while those around you had things like food, clothing and shelter would be in poverty? You could not eat your money, nor could. Your fellow inhabitants might not even want your money, particularly if they believe that a rescue is not eminent. In such a situation, lack of money means equal poverty. This is, however, only part of the story<br/><br/>with regard to poverty yet in order to understand poverty and inequality, we must probe beneath surface reality and go beyond the common sense explanation which is simply another for cliché.<br/><br/><strong>Definitions of Poverty</strong>There are two different ways in which researchers define poverty; Absolute poverty and relative poverty.<br/>Absolute poverty refers to the situation in which a person lacks those things that help to sustain human life. The lack of basic human needs such as food, shelter and clothing. This form of poverty was once quite common in countries such as Britain and American but has since declined.... <strong>(91 pages)</strong></div> </div>\n\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " POVERTY REDUCTION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA", "id": 49}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>PHYSICAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF NERICA PADDY</strong></p> <p><strong>PHYSICAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF NERICA PADDY</strong></p> <p>                                                     <strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION:</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 RESEARCH BACKGROUND:</strong></p> <p>After harvest, agro raw materials are normally handled, transported, dried, stored and further processed into food, feed and fiber.</p> <p>In some basic post harvest activities, separation processes such as sorting, grading and cleaning are involved.</p> <p>In mechanized operations, these post harvest processes are supposed to be carried out with machines and equipment. The engineering design and efficient operation of the post harvest processing machines and equipment require adequate knowledge of engineering properties of the bio-materials. Knowledge of engineering properties such as physical and mechanical properties constitute important and essential engineering data in the design of machines; storage structures; processes and controls as well as in the analysis and determination of the efficiency of machines, development of new consumer products of plants and animal origin and in the evaluation of the quality of food products. (Mohsenin,1986; Oluka, 1991; Oluka and Nwuba, 2001).</p> <p><strong>1.2 RESEARCH PROBLEM DEFINITION:</strong></p> <p>             NERICA, also known as New Rice for Africa (NERICA) is a hybrid of the local African rice variety with high disease resistant traits and the high yielding variety of Asia.  The rice is quite new to Africa and is currently being adopted and tried across the continent.</p> <p>As a new product, there are on-going research studies on NERICA rice varieties. Studies on the engineering properties of the new rice variety are one of them.</p> <p>Physical and Mechanical handling of the post harvest processing operation of NERICA require adequate knowledge of the physical and mechanical properties. This is the challenge of this study.</p> <p>Knowledge of these properties will be valuable to Engineers, Food Scientists and Processors in designing of machines, storage structures, processes and controls as well as in the development of new products and quality assessment of food products.</p> <p>  <strong>1.3 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:</strong></p> <p>         The overall goal is to study the physical and mechanical properties of NERICA Paddy. The specific objectives include:</p> <p>(i) To determine the physical properties of NERICA paddy such as shape, size, volume, density, specific gravity, sphericity and surface area.</p> <p>(ii) To determine the mechanical properties of NERICA paddy such as rupture point, deformation, compressive strength, modulus of deformability, toughness, stiffness and the force at bio-yield point relevant to its milling and processing.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE:</strong></p> <p>     The information obtained are essential in the processing of rice paddy (NERICA) and prevention of mechanical damages during handling, processing and storage of the paddy. Equally, the knowledge of these properties will serve as a guide to designers of processing, storage and general handling equipments.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SCOPE OF THE RESEARCH:</strong></p> <p>  The scope of this study is limited to physical and mechanical properties of NERICA relevant to its milling and design of machines for its handling and further processing operations.  Only laboratory experimentation and measurements will be used as research procedures.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>2.0</strong>    <strong>LITERATURE  REVIEW</strong></p> <p><strong>2.1 ORIGIN OF NERICA:</strong></p> <p><strong>New Rice for Africa</strong> (\"NERICA\") is among the 3000 species of rice family. It is obtained from the improved rice obtained by crossing two species of cultivated rice namely African rice (<em>Oryza glaberrima Steud.) </em>and the Asian rice (<em>Oryza Sativa L.),</em> which produced a progeny that combine the best trait of both parents. (Jones et al, 1997b and 1998a).  </p> <p>NERICA is produced through conventional cross breeding and it is not genetically modified rice. NERICA was developed by the West African Rice Development Association (WARDA) at the Africa Rice Center, Cotonou Benin Republic in the early 1990’s by a team of rice breeders led by Dr. Monty Patrick Jones. It is a new group of rice grown in rain fed upland ecology in Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA). NERICA can grow without irrigation, chemical fertilizers or pesticides. It responds better than traditional varieties to higher inputs. (Somado et al, 2008).</p> <p>According to Jones et al (1997b and 1998a), NERICA seeds offer hope to millions of poor rice farmers and for countless others who struggle in urban squalor, spending most of their meager income on rice.</p> <p>2.2 TYPES OF MILLED RICE:</p> <p>Brown Rice:It is un-polished rice which has been milled to remove the hull from the kernel but retained the rice bran layer and the germ; and these give it a nutty flavor and chewy texture.</p> <p>Husked Rice: This is a rice from which the husk has been removed, still retaining the bran layers and most of the germs. Such a rice is sometimes referred to as bran rice, even though there are variations having them in red and white bran coats.</p> <p>White Rice: It is also called raw or milled rice. It is a husked rice from which all or part of the bran and germ has been removed by milling.</p> <p>Broken Rice: This can be husked or milled rice consisting of broken grains of less than ¾th size of the whole grain but not less than ¼th. (Michael and Ojha, 2005).</p> <p>2.3 DEFINITION OF TREMS:</p> <p>Paddy Rice: This is used to describe rice that has retained its husk after threshing. It is sometimes called rough rice (un-parboiled rice).</p> <p>Rice Grain: It is referred to husked, milled or hand produced rice which does not contain any broken grains smaller than ¾ of the size of the whole kernel.</p> <p>Rice Husk: This is the by-product from the milling of rice, consisting of the outermost covering of the rice kernels.</p> <p>Rice Bran: It is a by-product from the milling of rice consisting of the outer layer of the kernels with part of germ.</p> <p>Parboiled Rice: This is rice which has been specially processed by steaming or soaking in water, heating usually by steam and drying. It is milled rice processed from paddy or husked rice and it is known as boiled rice in some rice market. (Michael and Ojha, 2005).</p> <p>Longitudinal Loading: This is loading the rice in upright position.</p> <p> Lateral Loading: This is loading the rice laterally in lying  position.</p> <p>2.4 STUDIES ON NERICA:</p> <p>          NERICA Varieties are rice developed for Africans in order to reduce poverty, food shortage and a staple food security. A lot of studies have been carried out on the state of developments and achievements of NERICA varieties. (Somado et al, 2008).</p> <p> Akintayo, et al (2010), reported that NERICA varieties, being an  inter- specific crossing of  two rice species (African and Asian) led to progenies that were not sterile, have favourable agronomic characteristics, significant widening genetic variation and allowing rice farmers to profit from  the <em>Oryza. glaberrima </em>gene pool.</p> <p>They report that NERICA varieties have good agronomic performance and resistance to Africa’s harsh growth conditions, and especially short growth duration, much appreciated by farmers. They maintained that NERICA varieties resist pests, tolerate drought and grow in infertile soils better than most rice varieties.</p> <p> Okello et al (2012) studied NERICA cultivation and its yield determinants based on upland rice system and stated that the response of NERICA rice yield to nitrogen is as high as 46kg/ha of paddy per 1kg/ha of nitrogen applied; 1kg/ha of increase in seeds applied increases rice yield by 8kg/ha and that continuous planting of NERICA on the field reduces its yield by 130kg/ha for every additional season of continuous planting.</p> <p> Keijiro Otsuka and Sserunkuuma (2007) on assessing the impact of NERICA on income and poverty in the central and western Uganda, concluded that NERICA cultivation have achieved a sustainable reduction in poverty through increasing income of farmers in Sub-Sahara Africa by introducing a new profitable technology in traditional agriculture. This effect of NERICA can only be realized when its adoption is combined with the use of appropriate cropping patterns to maintain soil fertility.</p> <p><strong>2.5 STUDIES ON ENGINEERING PROPERTIES OF NERICA:</strong></p> <p>              Oni and Olaoye (2001), studied some physical and mechanical properties of sorghum, rice and millet at 17%, 13.3% and 10.2% (wb) and observed that the maximum loads for rupture and bio-yield points, 177.68N and 136.61N; 48,46N and 50.89N; and 7.08N and 10.08N  for sorghum, rice and millet respectively.</p> <p>The results indicated that any force below the bio-yield force will not damage the cellular system of the grains and spoilage will not occur during threshing operation. Also, it is possible to simulate a threshing mechanism that may be applicable for threshing operation of these selected grain crops and generalized model can be developed to describe the energy requirements for the three selected grain crops and their corresponding responds at threshing.</p> <p>         Sadeghi and Hemmat (2005), working on the physical-mechanical properties of rough rice grain as affected by variety and moisture content reveals that the effect of variety and moisture content on most physical and mechanical properties were significant.</p> <p>         Kibar et al (2010), studied the effect of moisture content on physical and mechanical properties of Osmancik-97 rice. The study reveals that physical and mechanical properties of rice grain depend on its moisture content, stating that the axial dimensions of rice grain increased with moisture content and this is due to water absorption by the rice; the bulk density of rice grain decreased with increase in moisture content; the Static coefficient of friction for rice grain was higher on concrete surface followed by galvanized steel and wood; and poission ratio decreased with increase in moisture content.</p> <p>           Arana et al (2007) studied the physical and mechanical properties of Urucuia, Confianca and Jequitiba rice varieties and concluded that the bulk density of all the varieties increased to 51% and differ statistically among them; the specific gravity of the rice grains is not influence by the processing or varieties; the porosity of bulk rice grains is affected by the processing, the rough rice recorded higher values and milled rice lower; having a difference of 26%  and the external static and dynamic friction coefficients decreased with processing in all type of wall materials; and the static friction coefficient was affected more by varieties than the dynamic friction coefficient. Also, they reported that higher friction coefficient was recorded by the wood surface, while steel surface recorded lower friction coefficient.</p> <p>           Zareiforoush et al (2010) studied the effects of loading rate and internode positions  on mechanical properties of rice staws and  concluded that the loading rate do not have any effect on the shear strength, shearing energy and young’s modulus; but have effect on the bending strength. They reported that internode positions have significant effect on the shear strength, shearing energy and young’s modulus; but do not have significant effect on the bending strength.</p> <p>          Review of literature indicates that there is no study so far on the engineering properties of NERICA. This research gap is to be filled by this study.</p>\n\n PHYSICAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF NERICA PADDY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  PHYSICAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF NERICA PADDY", "id": 50}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>AGRICULTURE MECHANIZATION IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Survey was undertake to assess the Anambra state Tractor Hiring Company.

It is recommended that an alternative shed be provide and the workshop should be properly equipped and it structure properly renovated, and in there should be adequate funding to it by the state government  in  order to help the unit serve the state better.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENT</p> <p>TITLE PAGE ……………………………..i</p> <p>Certification page………………………………ii</p> <p>Dedication………………………………………….iii</p> <p>Acknowledgement……………………………………iv</p> <p>Abstract………………………………………………..v</p> <p>Table of contents…………………………………vi</p> <p>List of table ……………………………………….viii</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0 Introduction……………………………………….1</p> <p>1.1      Back ground of study ……………………1</p> <p>1.2      Significance of the study ……………….9</p> <p>1.3      Scope of work…………………………………9</p> <p>1.4      Objectives of study……………………………..3</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>Literature review …………………………………………..5</p> <p>2.1   Brief history of tractor use in Nigeria…………….5</p> <p>2.2   Level of agriculture mechanization in Nigeria ……6</p> <p>2.3   Factors affecting agriculture mechanization in Nigeria …7</p> <p>2.4   Government role in the promotion of mechanized farming…………….9</p> <p>2.5  Scope of maintenance …………………………….11</p> <p>2.6 Common causes of breakdown…………………27</p> <p>2.7 problems faced by tractor hiring unit…………..28</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>3.0 Materials and methods……………………………….32</p> <p>3.1 Research design……………………………………….32</p> <p>3.2 Area of study …………………………………………..43</p> <p>3.3 Instrument of data of collection……………………..35</p> <p>3.4 Research of procedure ………………………………35s</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>   RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS</p> <p>4.1Results………………………………………………………..36</p> <p>4.2  Discussions………………………………………………..36</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p>Conclusion and recommendations…………………………..45</p> <p>5.1 conclusion……………………………………..43</p> <p>5.2 Recommendations……………………………..44</p> <p>Reference ………………………………..55</p> <p>                    LIST Of TABLES</p> <p>2.1 Agricultural power by source and geographical region</p> <p>2.2 Rates of some farm operation using Hand and Mechanical power systems</p> <p>2.3 Farm sizes, time and cost of ploughing/ hoeing operation using hand and mechanical power system .</p> <p>4.1 Machinery and equipment inventory</p> <p>4.2 Number of machines acquired for 1999-2013</p> <p>4.3 Tractor hiring prices</p> <p>4.4 Ownership of farm machines, implements and equipment in the state .</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1.   </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Agriculture was and until the discovery of oil and oil boom of the 1970s, the mainstay of the Nigeria Economy cash crops such as cocoa, cotton, groundnut and livestock products contributed more than 70% of total exports. It provided employment for over 60% of the populaces most of whom were resident in the remote and rural areas of the country (source). Various food crops were also cultivated in sufficient quantities to meet the demand of the teeming population and Nigeria was one of the food self-sufficient countries of the world.(Ado, 2005; Anen, 2005; Balogun, 2001; Ikpi and Ikpi, 1998; Moorhead, 2005; Nwuba, 2009, Opafa 2006).</p> <p>The discovery and exploration of crude oil as a more lucrative income earner for the country was the first major setback to the agricultural sector. Also the introduction of the nationwide Universal Primary Education (UPE) in the 1970s and free education in the country in 1979, further reduced farm labour are youths withdrew from the farms to go school. It becomes in caressingly difficult to feed the teeming masses and the country resorted to importing food to supplement the one grown at home. It was considered necessary to reserve the trend and the three approaches adopted were the use of improved and high yielding varieties of crops, use of agro-chemicals and expansion of hectares under cultivation by use of alternative source of power. These lead to the use of tractors as an alternative source of power since animal power wasn’t applicable in most regions of the nation due to tse- tse fly attacks, and also an encouragement youths who have been discouraged from farming operations due to its drudgery. But due to the high cost of acquiring these tractors, hiring schemes were set up at different levels of government to enable farmers increase their agricultural productivity. (Anon, 1990; Nwuba, 1986;Onwualu et al, 2006; Anazodo et al, 1987; Hamidu and Simmon, 1999)</p> <p>Thus, tractors – hiring scheme was adopted by almostall the states in Nigerian, aimed at helping the small scale farmers increase their farms sizes. Hamidu and Simon (1999) reported that even though the establishment of tractor hiring service were expected to make farmers have access to tractors and implements for various farm operations, this opportunity has not been fully exploited by farmers because of irregular and untimely availability of these tractors due to frequent” breakdown, lack of spare parts and bureaucratic bottleneck</p> <p><strong>1.2.   </strong><strong>Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>The work when adopted will provide data and information which will be useful in the following ways-</p> <p>1.  To provide knowledge on the level of mechanization available from the unit in the state.</p> <p>2.  To provide knowledge of the technical capacity of the unit in repairs and maintenance of equipment.</p> <p>3.  To provide solution to improve the quantity and quality of service at the unit.</p> <p><strong>1.4Objectives of the study</strong></p> <p>1.  To asses how the unit activities are coordinated in state, federal and private owned ministries.</p> <p>2.  To determine the equipment inventory and conditions in the units adequacy of the units’ personnel shed and workshop facilities.</p> <p>3.  To assess the nature of services rendered and their charges.</p> <p>4.  To asses the maintenance culture of the unit and common problems faced during maintenance, and proffer solutions.</p> <p>5.  To observe the impact of the unit on the farming community.</p> <p><strong>SCOPE OF WORK</strong></p> <p>The scope of this work covers the assessment on the technical and operational capacity of south east states tractor hiring company.</p>\n\nAGRICULTURE MECHANIZATION IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AGRICULTURE MECHANIZATION IN NIGERIA", "id": 51}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THERMAL CONVERSION OF PALM KERNEL SHELL</strong></p> <p><strong>AND MESOCARP FRUIT FIBRE INTO FUEL</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Palm Oil processing yields a considerable quantity of palm kernel shell (PKS) and mesocarp fruit fiber (MFF). This has been predominantly used as fuel through direct combustion which is inefficient and polluting. Better grade fuel could be derived through torrefaction. The objectives of the work therefore was to determine the optimum parameters for the conversion of palm kernel shell (PKS) and mesocarp fruit fiber (MFF) to high grade fuel via torrefaction. Samples of</p> <p>PKS and MFF were torrefied with a temperature range of 200°C to 350°C at the step of 30°C. The torrefied product yield were determined by weighing, proximate, ultimate analysis of the torrefied product were determined using A.O.A.C. method. The higher heating value was calculated using Dulong Petit. Percentage torrefied product decreases as the reaction temperature increases, from 71.70% to 56.32% for 200°C to 350°C. The higher heating value ranges from 8607.6MJ/Kg to 9510.4MJ/Kg for 200°C to 350°C respectively. Palm kernel shell has higher heating value when compared with mesocarp fruit fiber. PKS at 350°C had the highest value for HHV palm kernel shell and mesocarp fruit fibre torrefied.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>TITLE

system to do work on another object or system. Energy is fundamental to the survival of people, it is used in different areas of life such as; source of light and also for powering our vehicles, trains, planes, and rockets, machinery and tractor on the farm. The different forms of energy includes; electrical, fossil fuels with quite a number of availability in the form of coal, oil and natural gasses; hydro and energy, nuclear and wind energy.(www. energyquest.ca.gov,2015).</p> <p>The United States of America analyses the rate of depletion done to the ozone layer as a result of wide use of fossil fuel which serves as the bulk of energy in use and discovered that the rate of depletion has greatly increased. This was due to the harmful elements released after the burning of petroleum fuels as stated by Mark,(2005).</p> <p>These harmful chemical released to the atmosphere which cause changes in atmospheric condition, human health deterioration serves as point of the challenges to look into an alternative source of energy. However, increasing population and development of the third world countries caused an increased in the demand for traditional fuel which is a common type known as biomass energy.</p> <p>Biomass energy is another form of renewable energy source and it is derived from living or dead organisms like plants, waste and alcohol mostly (www.renewablesolarenergy.com,2015).</p> <p>The major sources of biomass include; waste materials from industrial processes, waste material from pulping industries and municipal waste. When energy is extracted from alcohol or from the fiber present in the corn, it is known as ethanol fuel. This ethanol fuel is really helpful in providing fuel to the cars and farm tractors.</p> <p>Biomass energy can also be sourced from various kinds of agricultural processed refuse like polar, willow, hem, corn, miscanthus, sugar cane, spice trees, eucalyptus, switch grass and sorghum. The mentioned sources of biomass energy have one or more effect on the living organism, human and the living environment. Some of the effect which includes deforestation, competition with food materials and other industrial usage which is a result of more demand for</p> <p>such product, hence the need for research into a less competitive products in term of the environment and the inhabiting organism which will reduce the use of other mentioned in term of their economic and industrial demand. Hence the need for the choice of palm kernel shell and mesocarp fruit fiber.</p> <p>The conversion of biomass into useful energy can produce heat and electricity. This includes: thermal conversion, biochemical method, and mechanical methods of conversion.</p> <p>The mechanical method of conversion involves compressing the materials together which is known as briquetting while biochemical method of conversion entails biological activities such as fermentation, aerobic activities on the materials and the introduction of micro organism on the material. This method of conversion works better for non- lignocellulosic.</p> <p>The thermal method of conversion involves the use of heat, which include; direct combustion, gasification, pyrolysis, torrefaction (www.renewablesolarenergy.com, 2015). Direct combustion ways of conversion is done in the presence of oxygen to produce heat, light and particulate, which can pose hazardous substances to the health of the user. Gasification process converts biomass completely to combustible gases as stated by Mark, (2005). However this process is good for on-site. Pyrolysis which occurs at temperature range of temperature range of 400°C to 800°C in the absence of Oxygen (Jianghong, 2007). The final products include the liquid, solid and gas, are about 70% efficient. Torrefaction on the other hand is another thermal method of biomass conversion which according to (Jianghong, 2007), has higher conversion efficiency of about 90%. Therefore this work focused on torrefaction. However, from literature available for review little has been done on this method. As a result, there is a need of determining optimum conversion parameters for torrefaction of Palm Kernel Shell(PKS) and Mesocarp Fruit Fiber(MFF).</p> <p><strong>1.1 Problem Statement</strong></p> <p>The rate of depletion of the ozone layer been increased due to the harmful or heavy elements released after the burning of petroleum fuels to be precise the invention of chlorofluoro carbon increased the rate of depletion. The increasing population and development of the third world countries caused an increase in the demand for traditional fuel. The fast rate of forest destruction (deforestation) and low rate of replacement (aforestation) has simultaneously rescued the availability of firewood</p> <p>Due to the over dependence of developing countries on firewood, deforestation has set in, which makes a country like Nigeria cost approximately 464 square miles of forest each year to these human activities.</p> <p>A quest for cleaner fuel in the developed country also lead to a series of research into what and what can be used to generate heat without having to burn fossil fuel. Hence the need for a less industrial and food competing materials which is the palm kernel shell and Mesocarp fruit fiber.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Objectives</strong></p> <p>The objectives of this work therefore include;</p> <p>i.                   Conversion of Palm Kernel Shell and Mesocarp Fruit Fiber samples to fuel at reaction temperature of 200°C to 350°C at the step of 30°C.</p>

<p><strong>1.1     </strong><strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Land application of wastewater is centuries old practice. This practice was introduced in US more thaii one hunched years ago but general interest on the subject waned after the turn of the century in favour of more mechanized method of waste treatment and disposal (Jewel and Seabrook. 2011). It allows disposal of the sewage effluents and fulfills the increasing demand of water for agricultural purposes. The cost of constructing. operating and maintaining a land treatment facility is generally considered to be lower than corresponding conventional waste water treatment system (Badger and Thomason. 2013). In the UK. treatment and disposal of sewage sludge from biological water plants accounts for approximately 50% of the total cost of sewage treatment, and the major US sludge disposal route is land application (Lake 2013). Due to the fact that toxic substances are concentrated in the solid phase during wastewater and sludge disposal. the sludge management can be more risky than irrigation with wastewater particularly in developing countries with economic and administrative constraints. Moreso. Mexico large quantities of sludge from a wastewater treatment plant containing pathogens and toxic substances as ionic aluminum have been deposited in open areas, causing damage on soils and problems to the inhabitants (Qrtiz-Hemandez <em>et a!., 20</em>11).</p> <p>The reuse of domestic wastewater to irrigate agricultural land seems to be a practical option for under developed world including India. One of the most important problem in the Municipal Corporation areas of cities like Ludhiana. The reuse of domestic wastewater to irrigate agricultural land seems to be a practical option for under developed world including India. One of the most important problem in the Municipal Corporation areas of cities like Ludhiana. Jalancihar. Amritsar in Punjab. India are that industries are not confined to industrial parks rather most of the small to medium industries are running in the residential area. The owners of these small to medium industries are unable to install their treatment plants and they are disposing their effluents in the domestic sewage system of the city. which is carried forward to rural areas through open sewage drains and farmers with fields adjoining to these drains irrigate purely or mixing it with underground irrigation water. In addition to domestic effluents. a number of industries to produce large volume of effluents requiring their proper disposal. May times. industries produce highly toxic effluents which can neither be thrown into water bodies nor used for agricultural purposes as the toxic elements are likely to enter food chain through plants. annuals and fish. However, effluents of some industries have useful characteristics and. therefore. have the potential to improve the productivity of soils. The land management of such wastes thus. not only brings the economic benefits but also protect the fragile ecosystem from degradation.</p> <p>The application of sewage effluent on farm lands as an alternative to fertilizer is increasingly receiving attention in the recent time due to high cost of fertilizer in some developing countries. Though sewage contains both organic and inorganic matter, but it has been discovered that farmers encounter many challenges each time they apply untreated sewage effluent on farm lands. Some of these problems include the presence of heavy metals in sewage. These heavy metals are harmful to farm land when they accumulate. They may also be harmful to human system when consumed through the plant. (Young-Jin, 2011)</p> <p>Untreated sewage effluence is referred as those domestic and industrial waste effluents which are discharged into septic tank or sterilization pond and have not undergone  treatment process. This untreated sewage effluent contains heavy metals such as sulphur, zinc, copper and other toxic metals. (Kharche, et al, 2011)</p> <p>Effluent from Municipal sewage treatment plants often contain high level of plant nutrient, particularly nitrogen and potassium, which are essential to crop growth. Agricultural application of untreated sewage effluent provides both water and nutrient for crop production (Chambers, et al, 2002). However, depending on the content of the potentially harmful component, which can accumulate in the soil of the farm land biologically prove hazardous (Rattan et al, 2005). Therefore when untreated effluent of the sewage is used on land for an agricultural purposes, the problem associated with its use should be considered (Emongor and Ramolemana, 2004). The continous use of untreated sewage effluent on farm lands by farmer may result in the accumulation of heavy metal on the soil and thereby affect the soil fertility.</p> <p>Therefore, the need for farmer to know the effect of untreated sewage on farm land is a necessity especially, in a developing country like Nigeria were farmers have limited access to chemical fertilizer.</p> <p>Therefore, this study shall evaluate the impact of untreated sewage effluence on farm lands using Sancaros Farm, Ihe town in Awgu Local Government Area of Enugu State as a point of reference.</p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The project aimed at evaluating the impact of untreated sewage effluent on farm land using Sancaros Farm, Ihe town in Awgu Local Government Area of Enugu State as a case study.</p> <p>The specific objectives are:</p> <p>(1) To characterize soil from farmland with sewage effluent deposit</p> <p>(2) To compare the soil properties of farmland with effluent deposit with that without effluent deposit</p> <p>(3) To highlight the negative effects of farmland with effluent to crops and possible recommendations for improvement</p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong>Justification of the Study</strong></p> <p>The significant of the project cannot be over emphasized. The need to understand the characteristic and composition of farm land with untreated sewage effluent is a necessity.</p> <p>Also these will serve as a research material for agricultural industries and student on the knowledge and understanding on the use of untreated sewage effluent for agriculture. The result of this study may enhance farmer decision to apply untreated sewage effluent instead of relying on prohibitive supply of chemical fertilizer.</p> <p><strong>1.4     </strong><strong>SCOPE OF THE PROJECT:</strong></p> <p>The scope of this project will involve the following:-</p> <p>i.            To locate a source of untreated sewage effluent</p> <p>ii.           Measuring the key chemical characteristic of the untreated sewage before the application</p> <p>iii.         Measuring the key parameter of soil after application of untreated sewage</p> <p>Key parameter – PH, Copper, Phosphorus, potassium, nitrate ND chloride and note charges.</p> <p><strong>1.5     </strong><strong>LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>During the research the researchers encountered some constraints which serve as limitation to the study. These limitations include time factor, funding of the project and difficulty in getting research materials.</p> <p>1. <strong>Time Factor: </strong>The time for the research is not enough since the researchers are engage with other task to be done such as receiving lectures, quiz, assignment and exams. Also, during the period of the research the researchers will also take care of some domestic work.</p> <p>2. <strong>Funding of the Project: </strong>The financial aspect of the project was another challenge. The cost of getting materials so as to complete the project is expensive.</p> <p>3. <strong>Difficulty in Getting Research Material: </strong>Materials for the research work are not easily come by. However, the researcher had to do all they can to make the research work valid.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Research Methodology</strong></p> <p>       The research methodology is divided into chapters. This include chapter one which is the introduction and it contains the background of the study, statement of the problem, objectives of the study, scope and limitation, methodology and significance of the study.</p> <p>Chapter two is the literature review which contains an indepth research of past works in the subject matter.</p> <p>Chapter three is methodology which include materials and methods.</p> <p>Chapter four contains the research result and discussion.</p> <p>Finally, chapter five contains conclusion and recommendations.</p> </div>\n\nEVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF UNTREATED SEWAGE EFFLUENT ON FARM LANDS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF UNTREATED SEWAGE EFFLUENT ON FARM LANDS", "id": 53}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p><strong>DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF GARI FRYING MACHINE</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1<strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p> <p>Cassava which is known biologically as “manihotesculentacrantz” is a crop which has many varieties. Cassava, is a perennial woody shrub in the Euphorbiaceous (Spurge family) native to South America, but now grown in tropical and sub-tropical areas worldwide for the edible starchy roots  (tubers) which are a major food source in the developing world, in equatorial regions including Africa, South America, and Oceania. Also known has yucca, manioc, and tapioca.</p> <p>It is a major food crop in Nigeria (kim, 2009). It supplies about 70% of the daily calorie of over 50 million people (Agbetoye, 1999) and about 500 million people in the world. It is a basic staple food to more than 70% of Nigerian population and it is consumed at least once every day (Njoku and muoneke, 2008). It was probably the emancipated slaves who introduced the cassava crop into southern Nigeria, as they returned to the country from South America via the Islands of Sao Tome and Fernando Po. At that time there was Portuguese colonies off Nigeria shores (Ekanem, 1962). Cassava, however, did not become important in the country until the end of the nineteenth century when processing techniques were introduced, as many more slaves returned home.The cassava root is long and tapered, with firm, homogenous flesh encased in a detachable rind, about 1mm thick, rough and brown on the outside. Commercial varieties can be 5cm to 10cm in diameter at the top and around 15cm to 30cm long (FAO, 2003).</p> <p>The cultivation of the cassava crop is by the propagation of stem cuttings. Roots can be harvested between 6 months and 3 years after planting depending on the cassava variety. It is rich in carbohydrates, calcium, vitamin B and C, and essential minerals.</p> <p>The roots are dug up from the soil, removed from the plant and washed before being processed.</p> <p>Gari is a processed fermented product from cassava and is consumed in Nigeria as well as in most countries of the West African coast and in Brazil.</p> <p>In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), cassava is mainly a subsistence crop grown for food by small Scale farmers, who sell the surplus(IITA, 2003). It grows well in poor soils (IITA, 2011). Nigeria is currently thelargestproducerof cassava in the world with an annual production of over 34 metrictons (Mt) of tuberous roots (FAO, 2002).Gari is a widely consumed Nigerian food; an estimated 4.2 million tons were produced in 2009 (NBS 2010).</p> <p>Cassava is largely consumed in many processed forms in Nigeria. Its use in the industry and livestock feed, is well known, but is gradually increasing, especially as import substitution becomes prominent in the industrial sector of the economy. As a cash crop, cassava generates cash income for the largest number of households in comparison with other staples (Adeniji, et al, 2011). Currently, quality of gari can be enhanced by adding few drops of palm oil. At the end of the frying operation, the product is still hot and a little bit damp. It is then allowed to cool and dry in a cool dry shade, until the moisture content is reduced to 12% (Gbasouzor, et al., 2012).</p> <p>Earlier designs on gari production machines did not produce the desired and acceptable cassava product for the producers and consumers. The designs of these machines did not take into account the specifications of the existing local technology. It has been quite difficultto mechanize this operation correctly and rightly because this operation was not well understood by many designers and manufacturers. Some have erroneously assumed garification to be the same as dehydration while others had taken it to be roasting. Before the construction and development of ESUT (2015) model, a lot of research were carried out ranging from the village technique, improved traditional methods and mechanized methods designed by different research institutions, universities and companies. It was discovered that village technique gives the best quality gari. The question is how this village technique can be simulated and mechanized using the same method to achieve the same or better quality of the product.</p> <p>ESUT (2015) model is a batch process like the village technique. It has an aluminum frying pan in place of cast iron pan used in village technique. A paddle is connected directly in the frying pan to an electric motor through a shaft to eliminate human hand used in stirring cassava mash in the village method.</p> <p>The aluminum frying pan is used, because it disperses heat faster than the stainless steel and does not buckle under high temperature. There is a charcoal chamber at the bottomof the fryer thatis fed with charcoal used in frying the gari. The chamber is constructed using metal rods, each separated from each other by a distance of 20mm. The ashes from the burnt coal, falls to the bottom of the fryer.</p> <p>The aluminum frying pan is located inside mild steel and the distance between the frying pan and mild steel is reinforced using fiberglass to prevent the escape of heat from the frying chamber. A blower of one horse power is used to blow/fan the charcoal chamber, to heat up the ignited charcoal and to avoid the nuisance of smoke. An exhaust pipe is connected to the charcoal chamber, to remove smoke from the charcoal chamber. The system has good electrical connections that sense the quantity of heat in use to the temperature gauge allows the operator to vary heat during frying and permits the machine to automatically turn off when there is excess current and load.</p> <p>After frying, the discharge port is opened to allow the fried gari to leave the machine; another batch of cassava mash is introduced into the machine by the operator who monitors the entire process. These components are allcontained in a control box.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this project is to design and construct a functional and cheap batch process gari frying machine</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>CONDITIONS NECESSARY</strong></p> <p>To achieve the above objectives, the following conditions must be met:</p> <p>-     Adequate agitation and processing in order to achieve uniform heat circulation.</p> <p>-     Ensure that the final product is cooked and dehydrated</p> <p>-     Avoidance of caking of the cassava mash.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>SCOPE OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>The garification process (gari frying), is not a straight forward drying process (Igbeka, 1995). The product is first cooked with the moisture in it and then dehydrated. The sieved cassava grit is spread thinly in the pan 3-5kg per batch, the paddle helps to stir the gari constantly to prevent the food produce from getting burnt, until frying is complete, when it reaches a temperature of 80 to 85oC, the rapid heating partially gelatinize the gari, which is dried during the operation of frying; the moisture content of dewatered and sieved cassava mash is between 40 to 45% which  has to be reduced to 10-12% moisture content in a time of 15 minutes.</p> <p>A mechanical “garifier” or a mechanized system of frying and drying, usually takes the form of an aluminum drum or trough, paddles fixed to a steel shaft and rotating on the axis of the drum, the rotating paddles sweep the gelatinizing mesh from the trough wall to prevent sticking and burning and at the same time to move the material through the chamber to the discharge port, or outlet.</p> </div>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF GARI FRYING MACHINE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF GARI FRYING MACHINE", "id": 54}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p><strong>VALUE ADDITION AS A BASIS FOR ENHANCING PRODUCTIVITY IN RICE PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING IN ADANI IN UZO-UWANI LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF ENUGU STATE</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>The struggles of Nigeria farmers in finding ways to increase farm income, interest in “adding value” to raw agricultural products has grown tremendously. The value of farm products can be increased in endless ways: by cleaning and cooling, packaging, processing, distributing, cooking, combining, churning, culturing, grinding, hulling, extracting, drying, smoking, handcrafting, spinning, weaving, labeling, or packaging. According to  (Kaplinsky, 2010) value addition means adding value to a raw product by taking it to at least the next stage of production. This can be as simple as retaining ownership of your calves and wintering them on wheat pasture or placing them in a feedlot. Value can be added through membership in a cooperative that processes your products, such<br/>as a cooperative cotton gin. Or, adding value may be as elaborate as going all the way to the consumer with a “case-ready” food product. Hence rice farmers have keen interest in adding value to their rice production and processing so as to enhance the product.</p> <p>Rice is an important staple food in Nigeria. Many Nigerians have developed tastes for polished and size-sorted medium to long-grained rice.  Local production of rice has been increasing over the years. Besides offering a higher return, value addition on rice production and processing can open new markets, create recognition for a farm, expand the market season, and make a positive contribution to the community like in the case of Adani in Uzo-Uwani Local Government Area of Enugu state of Nigeria. Though, value addition will enhance productivity in rice production and processing in the area but it is a long-term approach, not a “quick fix.” It requires the willingness and ability to take on risk, as well as adequate capital, management skills, and personal skills such as the ability to interact with the public to succeed (; Kaplinsky and Morris, 2000).</p> <p>Production is the process of transforming certain goods and services known as inputs into other goods and services known as products (Akubilo<em>et al.</em>, 2007). It implies a series of processes, techniques, activities or procedures involved in combining resources of land, labour, capitals, water and management to generate useful effect or products. Value on the other hand implies worth, Benefits<br/>price or measure of importance. It is a factor of utility. Value can also be seen as the monetary term in which the utility of a product or an item can be explained.</p> <p>Therefore, value addition in the production and processing of rice implies all the activities, processes or strategies and distribution of rice which in one way or the other contribute to benefit/utility maximization (Owoh, 2008). It<br/>seeks a careful exploration into all the activities, processes or strategies of operation carried out in the production, processing, packaging and<br/>distribution of rice which contribute to the maximization of profit or utility derived from rice.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Problem Statement</strong></p> <p>          Neglect of agricultural activities has been a very serious problem affecting both producers and marketers of agricultural produce in the country.</p> <p>This situation appears to be aggravated by government and policy makers who have not considered production and marketing of food crops as serious problems to the economic development of the nation. Nigeria has great potential to greatly enhance productivity in rice production and processing. Nigeria is one of the largest rice producing country in Africa. Though the rice locally produced and processed do not compare the foreign rice product in the market and this has made Nigeria the second world largest importer of rice. This is as a result of poor production and processing of locally produced rice. The application of value addition to rice production and processing will enhance the product.  Therefore, the basis for value addition is a necessity for enhancing productivity of rice production and processing.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>          The broad objective of this study is to study value addition as a basis for enhancing productivity in rice production and processing in Adani, Uzo-Uwani Local Government Area of Enugu state of Nigeria.</p> <p>The specific objectives are as follow;</p> <p>1. identify the socio-economic factors that affect the respondents in the production and processing of rice.</p> <p>2. determine the available technology that affects value addition in rice business.</p> <p>3. determine the cost and returns involved in rice processing</p> <p>4. examine the various value chains in the production and processing of rice in the area.</p> <p>5. identify the factors that encourage value addition.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>          From all indication the rate of rice importation is high due to insufficient production and lack of value addition to enhance the productivity of the rice production and processing. The result of this study will enable researcher, government and policy makers to know the problems and constraints that have hindered adequate local  rice production, as this will help them to make policies that will tackle this problem.</p> <p>          Also the result of this study will educate farmers on the importance of value addition on rice production and processing in order to improve productivity.</p> <p>          Furthermore, this study will serve as a useful tool in guiding policy makers and to students who intend to carryout a research on related topic..</p> <p><strong>1.5 Limitation of Study</strong></p> <p>          This project is centered on value addition as a basis for enhancing productivity in rice production and processing. However, the scope will be limited to Adani, Uzo-Uwani Local Government Area of Enugu state.</p> </div>\n\nVALUE ADDITION AS A BASIS FOR ENHANCING PRODUCTIVITY IN RICE PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " VALUE ADDITION AS A BASIS FOR ENHANCING PRODUCTIVITY IN RICE PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING", "id": 55}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p><strong>THE USE OF BITTERLEAF (<em>VERNONIA AMYGDALINA</em>) EXTRACT AS A MEANS OF EXTENDING THE SHELF-LIFE OF LOCALLY BREWED SORGHUM BEER</strong></p> <p><strong>                                        ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Locally brewed beer (sorghum beer) is an indigenous alcohol average. It is produced mainly from sorghum grain (<em>Sorghum vulgare )</em> and the process of brewing involves malting, mashing, souring, fermentation and packaging. Locally brewed beer without hops has a short shelf-life. The aqueous extract of a tropical plant, bitter-leaf was used as the hop .Two type of drink were produced, one with hops and another without hops. Chemical analyses were carried out on both drinks, which gave a significant (p≤0.05) difference. Sorghum beer with hops has a total acidity of 0.562±0.03, fixed acidity of 0.203±0.001, Volatile acidity 0.360±0.02, PH 3.93, specific gravity 1.042±0.003, total dissolved solids 1.12×105ppm, total suspended solids 1.65×105ppm, ethanol content of 3.43±0.03 respectively. While sorghum beer without hops has a total acidity of 0.652 ±0.002, fixed acidity of 0.176±0.002, volatile acidity of 0.476±0.03, PH of 3.50 specific gravity of 1.021±0.003,  total dissolved solid of 1.15×105ppm, total suspended solids of 1.5×105ppm and an ethanol content  of 3.65±0.02. The microbial count for sorghum beer with hop had no growth of E.coli, streptococcus and staphylococcus but aspergillus was present from the 4th day and heaviest on the 8th day. While the drink without hop had growth of staphylococcus and aspergillus which was seen from the 2nd day and heaviest on the 4th day but E.coli and streptococcus was absent. From the results, the drink with hops could keep for a longer period of time than the other drink without hops. Thus, the aqueous extract of <em>Vernonia amygdalina</em> could extend the shelf-life of locally brewed sorghum beer.                           <strong>TABLE OF CONTENT</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER

(Okafor, 2007). Beer is the world’s oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic beverage and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea. Grossman (1995) defined beer as a general name given to beverages resulting from the germination of a malt or cereal grain. The process of brewing beer is called brewing. It is produced by the brewing and fermentation of starches mainly derived from cereal grains most commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used (Gutcho, 1976). In Nigeria today, barley has been replaced by some locally grown cereals such as sorghum or guinea corn, millet and maize as the principal raw materials. The tropical beers (African local beers) are known by different names in different part of the world; burukutu, otika and pito in Nigeria, maujek among the Nandi’s in Kenya, mowa in Malawi, kaffir beer in South Africa, merisa in Sudan, bouza in Ethiopia and pombe in some parts of East Africa (Okafor, 2007).</p> <p>Burukutu is an indigenous alcoholic beverage. Burukutu, a popular alcoholic drink among indigenes of the middle belt region of Nigeria, is a local brew made from fermented sorghum and other protein enriched grains (Ekundayo, 1969). The age long drink, also known as BKT, serves as a source of alcohol for those who lack the financial means to patronize refined brew like beer and other foreign or imported drinks it is produced mainly from the grains of guinea corn (Sorghum vulgare and</p> <p>Sorghum bicolor). The process of production of burukutu involves malting, mashing, fermentation and maturation as described by Ekundayo (1969).The production process of these indigineous drinks involves fermentation at its initial production stage and comes out as an alcoholic drink. The microorganisms associated with fermentation include <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces chavelieria</em> and <em>Leuconostocmesteroides</em> (Faparusi et al., 1973).</p> <p> Sorghum is a large variable genus with many cultivars (Ettasoe, 1972). The method employed in brewing sorghum beer here involves, malting, mashing, wort boiling with hops, fermentation, (using brewer’s yeast and bakers yeast) and packaging. The tropical sourced hop extracts used here is <em>Vernonia amygdalina</em> (Bitter leaf) which have been found to contain an anti bactericidal agent which is capable of extending the useful life of these indigenous beers (Okoh et al., 1999).</p> <p><em>Chemical analysis on the prepared sorghum beer such as; ethanol content, PH value, specific gravity, fixed acidity, total acidity, total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids(TSS) were analysed quantitatively, using different methods.</em></p> <p><strong>1.1 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The aim of the project is itemized into the following objectives;</p> <p>1.  To determine the shelf-life of locally brewed sorghum beer.</p> <p>2.  To check the effect of bitterleaf  (Vernonia amygdalina) extract  on the locally brewed sorghum beer.</p> <p>3.

For 9 (weeks). Three research questions and hypotheses were raised. The parameter measured were live body weight gain, feed consumed and source of feeds. Data collected were subjected to descriptive statistics to obtain the mean, standard deviation and the variance for research question. Independent t-test was employed to test hypotheses. Findings showed that breed and age of birds had significant (P &lt; 0.05) effect on the performance of poultry broilers. Exotic breed of broilers had higher mean value and was superior to indigenous breeds of poultry in body weight gain. The indigenous breeds of poultry had a lower mean score and had a poor performance interms of live body weight. The overall performance of Exotic breeds was better as compared to indigenous breeds of poultry. In conclusion, Exotic breeds was adjudged good and profitable and was recommended to poultry farmers in Akwa Ibom State for increased productivity, income maximization and profit making since the grow and mature faster than the indigenous breeds of poultry.</p>\n\nASSESSMENT OF WEIGHT GAIN OF INDIGENOUS AND EXOTIC BREED OF BROILERS IN UYO, AKWA IBOM STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF WEIGHT GAIN OF INDIGENOUS AND EXOTIC BREED OF BROILERS IN UYO, AKWA IBOM STATE", "id": 57}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Agriculture is still regarded as one of the main stay of Nigerian economy, before and after independence with the production of food for vast teaming population. It contributes immensely to the production of raw materials which has translated into increased foreign exchange earnings, better social life and higher standard of living of people. For instance it has constituted about 70% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), provides increased food surplus (raw material) to the rapidly expansion of Nigerian industrial sector and account for the bulk of the non-oil export (Eke 1997). Therefore wise nations all over the globe make agriculture a priority by developing and exploiting this sector for the survival of the nation. This is done by formulating policies by the government of different countries.</p> <p>The term agriculture is derived from the Latin word “Ager” (field) and “cultura” (cultivation). This means field cultivation. This is not a complete definition of agriculture since agriculture has to do with animal production. Therefore agriculture can be defined as the art and science of cultivating the soil, producing livestock, preparing livestock feed, processing crops and livestock products for man and the process of selling excess crops and livestock. Agriculture may also mean just the production of crops, rearing of animals and general management of the soil. Agriculture also involves the science of preparing soil for the production of crops and rearing of animals for human use. It also embraces various preparations and processing of plant and animal products as well as the disposals of these produce through marketing (Cheghu 2004) observed that the sector generates employment for the teeming population over the years, the agricultural production has witnessed a drastic decline in productivity. This could be due to low impact on loan acquisition, lack of credit availability, lack of adoption of new technology and land fragmentation among other constraints to agricultural development (Nyong, 1993).</p> <p>Recently, due to current decline in the world oil market price and economic down turn which has also affected the oil sector in Nigeria; there is a realization of the importance of agricultural sector to get its former pride of place. Therefore, there is need for efficient credit facilities and a great impact of the acquisition of loan for increased productivity in the sector, since agriculture development require amongst other things increased used in modern input. Such as fertilizer, tractors, increased seeds (Ajakaiye, 1990). General impression about the agricultural sector opined that, local farmers as small scale operation characterized by low productivity and low income due to their capital formation. The inability to purchase the modern requisites needs to be supplied with loans from banks and other credit facilities which will be used to increase production. These facts have often led the Nigerian government to promote and support the supply of credits (loans) to farmers and make loan acquisition easy enough for farmers hence, enhance or increase agricultural productivity at a large scale.</p> <p>In the past years, the Nigerian government has lent financial intermediation through the establishment of lending agencies in addition to formal credit sources such as banks. This was done in the hope that such programs would have led to an effective supply of financial services in advances of demand for them from the sector. In spite of all these intermediations by the government, the impact of loan acquisition is still low and the demand for credit is still higher than the supply (Ago 2002).</p> <p>The problem of low impact of loan acquisition in agriculture seem to be a common feature of the public credit scheme to finance agricultural sector because of the problem of low productivity associated with low impact of loan acquisition and situations where individuals engage in business other than farming because of quick return and relative high degree of certainty (Okon and Nyienakuna, 2002).</p> <p>The impact of loan acquisition and other problems associated with agricultural financing reduce the funds available and requires disproportionate amount of administrative cost and time to recover the loan, thus profitability is reduced. These problems have persistently plagued the agricultural sector of loan and credit to the agricultural sector all to improve agricultural productivity.</p> <p>The shortages in the supply of loans and farm credit in Nigeria are caused by the inability of farmers to produce collateral to enable them collect loans for enhancement of their agricultural production and the relevance of commercial banks to release loans to farmers. Therefore farmers now depend on informal sources to agricultural financing which result in the ability of the farmers to accumulate enough capital. So it is argued that, if loans were made available to these farmers, the agricultural sector would develop more rapidly (Nwagbo 1981).</p> <p>Therefore, federal government of Nigeria initiated programs and established institution to serve as a strategy to increasing productivity as well as raising the income of farmers through:</p> <p>The Nigerian agriculture and co-operative bank (NACB 1973) now named Nigerian agricultural and co-operative rural development bank (NACRDB) through merger of defunct Nigerian agriculture and co-operative bank and defunct people bank of Nigeria by the decree 22 of 1990.</p> <p>Agricultural credit guarantee scheme (ACGS, 1978), operation feed the nation (OFN, 1976) and non-governmental organization (NGO). To make loans and credit available to farmers at a cheaper rate in all aspect of agricultural production, processing and marketing.</p> <p> <br/><br/>1.2  <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Farmers in Khana L.G.A are operating in the subsistent level due to lack of application of modern /heavy farm machineries and small sizes of farm holding. Also farmers are faced with problem of inadequate finance and restriction on formal source of finance.</p> <p>Over the years, advocacies have been made in increasing the access of farmers to agricultural productivity of rural farmers. They are believed to be indigenously efficient in their crop/soil management practices (Mathew 2002 and Ajayi 20005). Thus access to loans would ensure high productivity. In the study area, agriculture is still subsistent, it is perceived to be generally characterized by low productivity which is due to low impact of loan acquisition towards agriculture. Could it be true that if farmers have access to loans and credits their level of productivity would guarantee the repayment of such loans. Therefore, this study sought to ascertain the relationship between the impact of loan acquisition on agriculture and the level of agricultural productivity of the beneficiaries among other factors that could affect agriculture loan.</p> <p><strong>1.2      OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The general objective of the study is to ascertain the impact of loan acquisition on agriculture (crop production) in Rivers state (Khana L.G.A). However, in order to achieve these principal objectives, the specific objectives are to:</p> <ul><li>Identify the socio-economic characteristics of the farmers.</li> <li>Problems faced by farmers in acquiring loans</li> <li>Assess repayment performance of the farmer.</li> <li>Determine those factors affecting farmers’ repayment capacity.</li> <li>Compare the productivity of beneficiaries and non beneficiaries of loan.</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.4      JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The inability to payback agricultural loans has become a major source of concern towards sustainable financing of agricultural activities (Okon and Nyienakuna, 2000). This study considers it expedient to find out significant determinants that can be used as elements for reduction of low impact of loan acquisition among rural and peri-urban farmers by finance experts and will reveal a lot of knowledge on the circumstances surrounding loan acquisition by farmers.</p> <p><strong>1.5       DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>AGRIC LOAN: </strong>This refers to the amount of money collected from any sources for agricultural purposes.</p> <p><strong>REPAYMENT PERFORMANCE:</strong> This refers to a proportion of loan that a beneficiary was able to repay at the end of the loan repayment duration. Since the source of loans were from different sectors i.e. private but informal, public but formal and informal sector, with short repayment duration.</p> <p><strong>AGRIC PRODUCTION:</strong> refers to the level of technical efficiency index of a farmer based on the transformation of four primary input (labour (manday), land (hectare), seeding (kg) and fertilizer (kg) to output (kg)) in the course of utilization of the loan for agric production.)</p>\n\nIMPACT OF LOAN ACQUISITION ON AGRICULTURE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF LOAN ACQUISITION ON AGRICULTURE", "id": 58}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>INFLUENCE OF TOPOGRAPHY ON SOIL  PROFILE CHARACTERISTICS AND FERTILITY IN PART OF  AKWA IBOM STATE</strong></p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0    INTRODUCTION</p> <p>The cardinal objective of agriculture is to produce enough food to feed the population of the world and enough raw materials to meet the demand of our industries and earn foreign exchange for the country through exports of agricultural produce. Beautiful as these objectives are, non of them can be achieved if the soil is not fertile enough to support the growth of plants. This is because only fertile soil can provide nutrients in sufficient amounts to support the optimum production of plants. The soil therefore holds the hope of all in terms of food production. According to Brady and Weil (1999), to the farmer, the soil is more than useful, it is indispensable. Conscious of these facts therefore it becomes necessary that the soil should be given a very close attention in terms of management in order to achieve the objectives of agriculture.</p> <p>In modern agriculture, proper soil management remains one of the pivots upon which it revolves. This is because it ensures continuous fertility hence the continuous productivity of the soil. Proper soil management refers to using a piece of land in such a way that it can be expected to produce indefinitely at an optimum level at all times (Metalfe and Elkins, 1976).</p> <p>Unless a fertile or potentially fertile soil is identified and distinguished from a poor non-productive soil, it may be ignorantly used for other purposes. To the farmer, this is a negative development as rich agricultural soils should be reserved for the cultivation of crops while poor agricultural soils should be used for building of structures.</p> <p>To be able to identify a fertile soil and distinguish it from a non-fertile soil, the soil must be surveyed. It is in the process of surveying the soil that different soil types will be identified and possibly mapped out and its properties studied with a view to maintaining or sustaining the fertility of a fertile soil and improving the productive capacity of a less fertile soil. Also measures taken to improve or sustain fertility in soils with a given characteristic can also be used in solving the same problem at the different location where such soil types are found and where the same climate and the same geomorphic feature prevail</p> <p>Hence according to Metcalfe and Elkins (1976) one of the  functions of soil survey as a soil management tool is to relate conservation practices to the soil characteristics and climate conditions.</p> <p>In the course of survey, attention is paid not only to the soils physical and chemical properties alone but also to other factors which brought about these properties. These factors climate, parent materials, organisms, topography and time-play key roles in determining the soils physical and chemical characteristics. These characteristics influences the soils rate of nutrients adsorption and loss and the soils rate of water retention and loss. These factors in turn determine the agriculture worth of the soil and the need to protect them from destruction or abusive uses or recommend them for other forms of land uses.</p> <p>Among the soil forming factors, topography stands out as one of the most important not only in the soil forming process but also (the outline of the earth’s surface)is determining soil management practices that should be used to improve the fertility of a given soil to sustain its productive capability.</p> <p>Topography determines the temperature and rainfall regimes of a given area. (The basic constituents of climate), which in turn influences the soil formation and characteristics. Topography influences the type of soil formed on hill tops, on slopes and on valleys. Its ability to influences these and more necessities its study, inorder to be able to design suitable management practices to suit different locations and increase food production.</p> <p>In Ibiono Ibom Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, with a relatively hilly topography information on soil-topography relationship and the general fertility states and the area is very scared.</p> <p><strong>Objectives</strong></p> <p>This study was therefore carried out with the following objectives:</p> <ol><li>to determine the influence of topography on soil profile characteristics, and</li> <li>to assess if there is any relationship between different topographic positions and soil fertility variation in the study area.</li> </ol> <p>Justification</p> <p>The importance of this study is that information obtained in the course of the study will enrich our understanding of the soil characteristics and types is relation to topographic or geomorphic features in Mbiakpan Atan in particular and Akwa Ibom at large. This will go a long way in encouraging the continuous use of the soil management practise which is currently in use or help us discover the best management alternative for each soil type with a view to increasing food production.</p>\n\nINFLUENCE OF TOPOGRAPHY ON SOIL  PROFILE CHARACTERISTICS AND FERTILITY <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INFLUENCE OF TOPOGRAPHY ON SOIL  PROFILE CHARACTERISTICS AND FERTILITY ", "id": 59}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong><em>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF ACID RAIN</em></strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    OVERVIEW</strong></p> <p>Acid rain is a wide spread term used to describe all forms of acid precipitation (rain, snow, hail and fog) Atmospheric pollutants particularly oxides of sulphur, oxides of Nitrogen and carbonic acid can cause precipitation to become more acidic when converted to sulphuric and Nitric acids hence the term acid rain.</p> <p>Acid deposition, acid rain and acid precipitation all relate to the chemistry of air pollution and moisture in the atmosphere. Scientists generally use the term acid deposition but all three terms relate to the same issue (acid precipitation, Acid deposition and Acid rain). The term acid rain was first used by (Robert Augus Smith, 1870) a scientist working in the 1870s. The problem of acid rain is hence not a new one but the nature of the problem has changed from being a local problem for towns and cities to being an international problem (Johnson, 1972).</p> <p>In Smith’s (1870) time, acid rain fall was both in towns and cities whilst today pollution can be transported thousand of kilometers due to the introduction of tall chimneys dispersing pollutants high into the atmosphere. Precipitation is naturally acidic because of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels such as (coal, oil and gases) produces sulphur dioxide and Nitrogen oxides which can increase the acidity of rain or other precipitation. Sources of sulphur dioxide and oxide of Nitrogen may be natural such as volcanoes, oceans, biological decay and forest fires, or may arise from combustion sources. The increasing demand for electricity and the rise in the number of motor vehicles in recent decades has meant that emissions of acidifying pollutants have increased dramatically from human sources particularly since (1950s).</p> <p>Emissions of such pollutants are heavily concentrated in the northern hemisphere, especially in Europe and North America in 1970s. As a result precipitation is generally acidic in these countries. In the 1970s and 1980s Scandinavian countries began to notice the effect of acid deposition on trees and freshwater. Much of the pollution   causing this damage was identified as being transported from other more  polluting countries. Acid rain became an international concern.</p> <p>Acid rain is determined by the hydrogen ion content (H+) of the rain water pH. This scale was invented  by a Danish Scientist in (1909) it is called Sorenson. The pH scale ranges from O, which is strongly acid, to 14 which is strongly alkaline the scale point 7 being neutral. The pH scale  is logarithmic rather than linear, so there is a ten fold increase in acidity  with each pH unit, such that rainfall with pH5  is ten times more acidic than pH6 rainfall with pH4 is 100 time more acidic than pH6 and rainfall  with pH3 is 1000 time more acidic than pH6 (Baso, 1996).</p> <p>Acid rain became particularly prominent as a media issue during the (1980s). However during the (1970s) many countries started to notice changes in fish population in lakes and damage to certain trees. By the late 1970s concern led to international effort to identify the cause and effect of long range (transboundary). Transport of air pollutants, and thus during the (1980s) much research was conducted in Europe and Northern America.</p> <p>1.2 <strong>WHAT IS ACID RAIN</strong></p> <p>Acid rain is a broad term referring to a mixture of wet and dry deposition (deposited material) from the atmosphere containing higher than normal amount of nitric and Sulfuric acid, (Berresheim, 1995). The precursors, or chemical forerunners of acid rains  formation result from both natural sources, such as volcanoes and decaying vegetation, and man-made sources, primarily  emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and Nitrogen oxide (NO2)  resulting from fossil fuel  combustion.</p> <p>In the United States,  roughly 2/3 of all  SO2 and ¼ of all NO2 come  from electric power generation that relies on burning  fossil fuel, like coal.</p> <p>Acid  rain occurs when  these  gases react in the atmosphere with water vapour, oxygen, and other chemicals to form various acidic compounds. The result is a mild solution of Sulfur acid and Nitric acid. When Sulfur dioxide and Nitrogen oxide are released from power plants and other sources, prevailing winds blow these compounds across states and national borders, sometimes over hundred of miles.</p> <p><strong>Net Deposition</strong></p> <p>Wet deposition refers to acidic rain, fog and snow if the acid chemicals in the air are blown into areas where the weather is wet. The acids can fall to the ground in the form of rain, snow, fog or mist. As this acidic water flows over and through the ground it affects a variety of plants and animals.</p> <p>The series of the effects depends on several factors including how acidic the water is, the chemistry and buffering capacity of the soil involved and the type of fish, trees and other living things that rely on the water.</p> <p><strong>Dry Deposition</strong></p> <p>In areas where the weather is dry, the acid chemicals may become in corporated into dust or smoke and fall to the ground through dry deposition sticking to the ground building, homes, cars and trees. Dry deposition gases and particles can be washed from these surfaces by rain storms, leading to increased runoff. This runoff water makes the resulting mixture more acidic. About half of the acidity in the atmosphere falls back to earth through dry deposition.</p> <p><strong>1.3    CAUSES OF ACID RAIN</strong></p> <p>Acid rain is mainly caused by these substances that are being released into the air: (Hottmann, 1982).</p> <p><strong>Carbon dioxide (Co2):</strong> Carbon dioxide is released by burning coal, oil and natural gas, if you inhale carbon dioxide, then since it is toxic, it can cause you to have to breathe more than usual, unconsciousness and other serious health problems.</p> <p><strong>Carbon Monoxide:</strong> Carbon monoxide is released by burning gasoline, oil and wood. When carbon monoxide enter your body, it goes into the blood-stream and when this happens, it will slow down the delivery of oxygen to the rest of the body causing dizziness, headaches, fatique and ultimately death, if the situation is not arrested quickly enough.</p> <p><strong>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs):</strong> These are the chemical that are used in industry, refrigeration, air-conditioning system and consumer products. Whenever CFCs are released into the air, they reduce the stratospheric ozone layer. The stratospheric ozone layer protects earths surface from the harmful rays of the sun.</p> <p><strong>Lead:</strong> Lead is released by house and car paint as well as the manufacturing of lead batteries, fishing lures, certain parts of bullets some ceramic ware, water pipes and fixtures. In young children, lead can cause nervous system damage and learning problems.</p> <p><strong>Nitrogen oxides (NO):</strong> Nitrogen oxides are released into the air by burning fuels such as gasoline and coal.</p> <p>When Nitrogen oxides combine with Volatile Organic Compounds, they can cause breathing difficulty in people who have asthma, coughs in children and general illness in your respiratory system.</p> <p><strong>Ozone:</strong> Ozone is released by motor vehicles, industries, burning coal, gasoline and other fossil fuels, and in the chemicals that are in hairspray and paints. When ozone is close to the ground, it can cause chest pain, irritated respiratory tract, or persistent cough, can make unable to take deep breaths, and can make you more likely to get lung infections.</p> <p><strong>Sulphure dioxide (SO2):</strong> Sulphure dioxide are released by burning coal, paper production and melting metal sulphure dioxide can harm vegetation, harm metal and cause lung problems, which include breathing problems and permanent lung damage.</p> <p><strong>Volatile</strong> <strong>Organic Compounds (VOCs):</strong> VOCs are released into the air by burning gasoline, wood, coal, or natural gas, solvents, plants, glues and other products that are used at work or at home.</p> <ul><li><strong>EMPIRICAL MEASUREMENT OF ACID RAIN (ACIDITY)</strong></li> </ul> <p>The scale is used to measure the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution and is determined by the hydrogen ion content (H+). This scale was invented by a Denish Scientist called Sorenson in (1909). The scale ranges from zero, which is strongly acid to 14 which is strongly alkaline. The scale point 7 being neutral example of solution with differing pH values include carbattery acid (pH) lemon juice (pH2). Natural Lemon Juice (pH2) bear (pH4) Natural rain (pH5-6) milk (pH6) washing-up liquid (pH7) seawater (pH5) milk of Magnesia (pH10) and Ammonia (pH12).</p> <p>The pH scale is logarithmic rather than linear and so there is a ten fold increase in acidity with each pH unit, such that rainfall with pH is ten time more acidic than pH6, rainfall with pH4 is 100 time more acidic than pH6 and rainfall with pH3 is 1000 time more acidic than pH6. (Geophy, 1992).</p> <p>Rainfall acidity is measured in pH units normalor “unpolluted” rainfall has a pH of 5-6 this is slightly acidic due to the presence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which form weak carbonic acid in water it is not uncommon for acidified rain water to have a pH of 4 about 30 time as acidic as normal rain water.</p> <ul><li><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></li> </ul> <ol><li>To study the effects of acid rain on rocks and building materials.</li> <li>To highlight the chemical reaction of acid rain on building materials.</li> <li>To highlight the effects of acid rain on living organisms.</li> <li>To highlight the effects of acid rain on human health.</li> <li>To recommend remedial measures containing the effect of acid rain.</li> </ol>\n\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF ACID RAIN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF ACID RAIN", "id": 60}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong><em>THE ECONOMICS PROBLEMS OF CASSAVA PRODUCTION</em></strong><strong><em> IN ITU LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA</em></strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</strong></li> </ul> <p>This study is aimed at finding out the cost of economic cultivation of cassava in Itu Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State. It is one of the world’s most important staple food crops and provides a major source of carbohydrate to those who feeds on it.</p> <p>Agriculture is the backbone of Itu farmers and cassava production is their area of specialization. Cassava originated from Brazil and was introduced into tropical West Africa by the Portuguese in the 16th and 17th centuries (Woyengi – Ina 1969). Cassava production in Itu Local Government Area is as old as the community itself. Sweet cassava (<em>Manihot Ultilisima)</em> is a member of the Euphobieace species which originated from South Africa and is cultivated in all warm regions of the world (IR VINE 1969).</p> <p>Cassava was not known in wild state and its evolution as a species is directly linked to selection by man under cultivation. A famine reserve by Colonial governments such as Java and the British in West Africa and Southern India and of cassava processing export industries were established in Makker (Hinton, 1988) given extended maturity duration, cassava cultivation is limited to the tropics and sub tropical.</p> <p>In Itu, this root crop is only second to yam. This importance is traced to the colonial period when cassava was often famine reserve crop. Some farm holdings in cassava cultivation to the present day support this view. However, cassava today is a commercial crop inter planted so often with other crops. Hardwood stems  cuttings usually about 30mm long are planted either on moulds or ridges or on the flat bed. Manuring the soil improves the yield, but little attention with early weeding is beneficial. Cassava is consumed in many forms such as garri, fufu, tapioca, flour, boiled or roasted for consumption and can be consumed or boiled to pigs, and other herbivores. The leaves are eaten as vegetable.</p> <p>In Itu, Akwa Ibom State generally, there exist extensive trade in garri, cassava is widely produced, just like cash crop with existing market in future. Development of cassava production will require strengthening of the market for the crop. Finance is one of the problems that farmers from Itu encounter because most of the cassava farmers lack finance to purchase planting materials and to hire labour to support the farming operation. Sometimes government give grants, but farmers misused the fund.</p> <ul><li><strong>PROBLEMS STATEMENT</strong></li> </ul> <ol><li>To find out if there are suitable planting materials in cassava production.</li> <li>To determine if farmers in Itu find cassava production more lucrative.</li> </ol> <ul><li>To investigate if there are available resources and materials to enhance cassava cultivation in Itu.</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.3  JUSTIFICATION AND BENEFICIARIES</strong></p> <p>Cassava is an important crop in Itu Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State. It provides over 80% of the natives of Itu constant food on their table. It is therefore cultivated with pride. The justification of the study therefore is on the fact that there is need to analyze scientifically if cassava production is economically (profitably) viable in Itu Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State.</p> <p>The beneficiaries of the study include the farmers in the village, the clan, the state and the Nigeria in general. Also expected benefits from the study include researchers in the field of agriculture, economics and marketing research units of colleges of education and universities.</p> <p><strong>1.4  OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study is to analyse the problem of cassava production in Itu Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State.

Recent trends all over the world, point to a decline in landing from capture fisheries, an indicator that fish stocks have approached or even exceeded the point of maximum sustainable yield. Aquaculture therefore remains the only viable alternative for increasing fish production in order to meet the protein need of the people. Catfishes of the family Claridae comprise the most commonly cultivated fishes in Nigeria. The growth of aquaculture in Nigeria now is largely being boosted by a steady rise in catfish culture. Inadequate availability of seed for stocking and feed used to be major problems. Tremendous progress is now being made. The total value of the industry today is US$800 from the value of fingerlings, feed and farmed fish. Since the culture of Clarias gariepinus through hypophysation was initiated in Western Nigeria in 1973, the procedure has been widely practiced throughout Nigeria thus leading to increase of farm-raised catfishes from the 80’s to date. The favoured catfish species in Nigeria aquaculture include: gariepinus, Heterobranchus bidorsalis, Clarias, Heterobranchus hybrid (Heteroclarias) and Clarias, nigrodigitatus. Heterobranchus sp. is the more commonly cultured fish in the south eastern parts of Nigeria. African catfish is popular in the market and has great potentials to boost the rapidly growing Nigerian aquaculture.</p>\n\nPROBLEM AND PROSPECTS OF SMALL SCALE FISH FARMERS IN EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEM AND PROSPECTS OF SMALL SCALE FISH FARMERS IN EDO STATE", "id": 62}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>POULTRY FARMING IN ENUGU STATE</strong></p> <div> <p><strong> TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> CHAPTER ONE <p>1.0  Introduction</p> <p>1.1      Background Of Study</p> <p>1.2       Objective Of Study</p> <p>1.3      Justification Of Study</p> CHAPTER TWO <p>2.0  Literature Review</p> <p>2.1      Definition Of Poultry</p> <p>2.2      Types Of Poultry</p> <p>2.2.1                Fuel Range System</p> <p>2.2.2                Pesticted Range System</p> <p>2.2.3                Intestive Decp-Litter Of Battery Copar</p> <p>2.3      Poultry Diseases</p> <p>2.3.1                New Casttle Disease</p> <p>2.3.2                Fowl Pose Disease</p> <p>2.3.3                Gum Bow Disease</p> <p>2.3.4                Marese Disease</p> CHAPTER THREE <p>3.0      Phinomar Nig Limited</p> <p>3.1  Poultry Unit</p> <p>3.2      Feed Mill Unit</p> <p>3.3      Hatchiy Unit</p> <p>3.4      Deep Litter System</p> <p>3.5      Battery Cage System</p> <p>3.6      Management Of Poultry</p> <p>3.7      Management Of Chichs</p> <p>3.8      Management Of Boiler</p> <p>3.9      Management Of Commercial Lagers</p> <p>3.10  Diseases In The Farm</p> <p>3.11  Common Vaccine</p> CHAPTER FOUR <p>4.0  Findings</p> <p>4.1      Suggestion</p> <p>4.2      Recommendation</p> <p>References</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong> <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Poultry business and first introduce to Nigeria in the late fifties with the importation of selected breeds of exotic poultry.  The unitial success of the introduction and adaptation as evidence from improved production record, several fold higher than what could be drained for local breeds stimulate the expansion of the industry first by government firm and lat by entrepreneur who quickly understood the profit or gain of the men industry.</p> <p>       Consequently, the production marketing and consumption of the poultry production followed purely traditional method and channel.  Although cash income was the motivation there was rarely any good planning I this system of the poultry keeping.  No special provision or programme was made for breeding housing, recording or costing.</p> <p>       Prior, to the introduction of commercial poultry business in Nigeria a few commercial poultry business in Nigeria few commercial houses were importing eggs and broiler with the successful adaptation of exotil poultry in Nigeria around the middle and late fifties and in the main agricultural station like Umudike and summary the foundation for modern commercial poultry was first laid government programme were developed based on acceleration poultry production through the importation of laying flock and distribution of day old chick at subsidized price to farmers.</p> <p><strong>1.1  BACKGROUND OF STUDYD</strong></p> <p>The background of the study, poultry family in Enugu stage: as I have explained the introductory pent of this topic.  The background also gives the partial meaning of the study poultry faming more especially in Enugu state.</p> <p>       How poultry faming begging to exist in Enugu, the taking care of poultry and its management how to feed the fow chick, from the egg stage to the dual purpose stage enter for meat or for production of eggs for hatching which will give rise to the younger chicks.</p> <p><strong>1.2  OBJECTIVE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objective of study is to study the poultry farming system in Enugu State also to study the types of poultry system that are available or the existence.</p> <p>       Also to make a recommendation of optimum level of poultry system in used.  Also thus objective are geared toward for optimum, yield, it will also gain into poultry business to know the system and method of taking care off.</p> </div>\n\nPOULTRY FARMING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " POULTRY FARMING", "id": 63}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>IMPACT OF PRICES OF TOMATOE ON TOMATOE PRODUCTION AND MARKETABILITY</p> <p>ABSTRACT The potential to increase the production of tomato is dependent on its marketability. Factor that determine the marketability of a product include eating habits, knowledge, resources and tomato consumers preference of tomato. This study examined the factors that determine the price of tomato in the market. Primary data were used in the study. The analytical technique employed includes the descriptive statistics, the regression, marketing margin and marketing efficiency. The primary data were collected with the use of well structure questionnaires from 120 respondents. The study revealed that 82.8% of the respondents are female from the sample survey, 95.7% are married and age ranges from 21-40 years and 41-60 years. Most of the respondents have no formal education and primary education with a corresponding percentage 30.2% and 36.2% respectively. The household size ranges from between 1-10 with a percentage of 89.7. The study revealed also that there are variation in the price of tomato over time which was determined by the quantity purchased and amount purchased. The prices are at their highest peak in August and lowest in March. The study revealed that lack of good transportation; good storage facilities and high taxation from government affect the prices of tomato. The shelf life of four days and above e.t.c. when purchasing tomato, consumers prefer UTC variety because of long shell life and quality taste. The regression analysis also revealed that quantity purchased and amount purchased both measured in kilogram and naira respectively determined the variability of tomato price in the market.</p>\n\nIMPACT OF PRICES OF TOMATOE ON TOMATOE PRODUCTION AND MARKETABILITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF PRICES OF TOMATOE ON TOMATOE PRODUCTION AND MARKETABILITY", "id": 64}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>THE ROLE OF COMMERCIAL BANKS IN AGRICULTURAL GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA</p> <p>ABSTRACT The study examines the role of commercial banks in Agricultural development in Nigeria, spanning from 1986-2010. The methodology used is ordinary least squares (OLS), using P.C give 8.00 package. The findings from the study support the view that commercial bank loans are not getting to red farmers. The commercial banks loan to Agricultural sector is positive and significant at 5% level, contributing 67.65 percent variations in Real Agricultural output in Nigeria. Real interest rate and real exchange rate are both positive, but not significant at 5% percent level. The positive real interest rate shows that Investments in Agricultural sector in Nigeria has a very high rate of return. The findings suggest that real interest and exchange rates should be properly managed and periodically received so as to promote the growth of the Agricultural sector.   CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY Agriculture involves the cultivation of land, raising and rearing of animals and raw materials for industries. It involves cropping live stock, forestry, and fishing, processing and marketing of these agricultural products. Food is man‟s most important basic need before those of clothing and shelter. It is provision therefore, has been the major concern of man from the past years since it is both an essential condition and sinequanon to life. Agriculture being the provider of food can then be concluded as the life wire of any nation and thus be concluded as the life wire of any nation and thus its importance cannot be over emphasized. When Nigeria gained their political Independence in 1960, agriculture was dominant sector of the economy. It contributed over 65% of the country‟s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and provided the bulk of the foreign exchange earnings through the foreign exports of the cash crops. The sector catered adequately for nearly all food requirement and raw materials for industry in the country. Agriculture performs a number of functions in an economy such as:   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM Nigerian agriculture is confronted with many problems which ranged from low yield to low productivity and inadequate facilities among others. Oyatooye (1981) was on the same path when he noted that the problem of agriculture in Nigeria can be discussed under four headings. Technology Marketing III.   Finance and Government Such problems include problems of providing adequate extension services, agricultural inputs, storage facilities, agricultural credit, marketing information and efficient marketing arrangement, infrastructures such as feeder roads efficient power supply and institutional reforms where necessary. William (1981) pointed out that, the major problems facing Nigeria today are the needs to transform her agricultural industry from one traditional input with low productivity to one which enables her to meet the rising expectations of her people and to correct the social and economic imbalance created by lopsided development between her rural and urban areas which have encouraged the youths and others to migrate from rural areas. His statement is a valid one as when it was made from we have seen, the Nigerian economy is characterized by a high degree of rural to urban drift in search of greener pastures leaving the farm land to old aged men who are unable to provide all the food requirements of the growing population. This is responsible of the growing population. This is responsible for the high cost of food as there is pressure on the little produced. Adekanye‟s assertion (1988) when he stated that: it is a common knowledge that present farmers and artisans who the back of the rural population do not get adequate and timely loans from financial institutions and they have no collateral and equally they do not get supplies of raw materials of standard quality even at the market place as they come under the ditches of rich farmers and sellers in the urban areas. The need for setting up of rural based commercial banks is very urgent.   OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY The main objective of this study is to assess the role of the commercial banks in agricultural development in Nigeria from 1986-2009. Specifically the study tends to be achieving the following objectives. i. To access the scope and achievements as well as highlight new role of Nigerian Commercial Banks to Agriculture. II. Identify the inherent problems of agricultural financing which have hindered the smooth flow of credit from banks to agriculture. To offer solutions to identified problems.    HYPOTHESIS OF THE STUDY The hypothesis guiding this study are of two type H0 which is the null hypothesis and H1 which is the alternative hypothesis H0: the Banking Industry has played an important role in agricultural development in Nigeria. H1: the Banking Industry has not played an important role in agricultural development in Nigeria.   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY This study is useful in many ways. Firstly, Nigerian farmers can know the type of credit or assistance offered by Nigerian Banking Industry and the benefit from them. Secondly, it will help to update knowledge on how the banks especially commercial banks in Nigeria, thus making it useful for other researchers, schools and readers. Thirdly, it will enable the Nigerian government to take advantage of the suggestions and more result oriented policy towards boosting agricultural production in Nigeria. Finally, the salient findings of this study will also make the farmers to be more result oriented in agriculture.    SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY This study covers the period between 1986-2009; it will be an oversight to think that study such as this will be accomplished without impediments and constraints. Much as it seems incontrovertible that odds will be imminent there are some glaring inexorable cases. Some respondents to interviews are always simplified and simplify in relating information to researchers. Again, to think of development only in terms of increasing agricultural output is an under statement. There is also the clamored non-existence of relevant and indispensable literature as versatile as possible. The limitation put together explains why the research is scaled down from 1986-2009 The study only centers on the role of commercial Banking in agricultural development and factors surrounding their credit decisions to agricultural sector. Thus, it only assessed the performance of the banks in executing the role of financing agriculture. Since it was not possible to get the whole information needed in this study, the study is limited to the Nigerian Economy. The study is equally limited by time and limited sources of data. There are time constraints in the process of carrying out research due to in accuracy of data. It is sometime possible to underestimate or over estimate.</p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF COMMERCIAL BANKS IN AGRICULTURAL GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF COMMERCIAL BANKS IN AGRICULTURAL GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA", "id": 65}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT ON THE NIGERIAN ECONOMY</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong>     <strong>General introduction</strong></p> <p>One of the important objectives of macroeconomic policy in has been the rapid economic growth of an economy. Economic growth is defined as “the process whereby the real per capita income of a country over a long period of time.” Economic growth is measured by the increase in the amount of goods and services produced in a country. A growing economy produces more goods and services in each successive time period. Thus growth occurs when an economy’s productive capacity increases which in turn is used to produce more goods and services. In its wider aspect, economic growth implies raising the standard of living of the people and reducing Inequalities of income distribution. Economic growth is a desirable goal for a country. But there is no agreement over the annual growth rate which an economy should attain. (Jhingan, 2000).</p> <p>Generally, economists believe in the possibility of continual growth .This belief is based on the presumption that innovations tend to increase productive technologies of both capital and labour over time. But there is every possibility that an economy may not grow despite technological innovations. Production might not increase further due to lack of demand which may retard the growth of the productive capacity of the economy. The economy may not grow further if there is no improvement in the quality of labour in keeping with the new technologies.</p> <p>Economic growth is usually measured in terms of an increase in real gross national product (GNP) or gross domestic product (GDP) over time or by an increase in income per head over time. GDP measures increase in total output to a change in population. Thus, if total output rises higher as compared to population, then theirs an improvement in the average living standards. Growth is desirable because it enables the community to consume more private goods and services and the provision of a greater quantity of social goods and services such as health, education, etc. in this manner improving living standards. Government can also stimulate economic growth by increasing its current spending in the economy and through tax cuts (fiscal policy), and by increasing money supply and reducing interest rates (monetary policy).</p> <p>            Principally, there are three main determinants of economic growth, which are; the growth of its labour force, the growth of capital stock, and technical progress.</p> <p>Nigeria used to be heavily dependent on the agricultural sector prior to the oil boom. In the early 1950’s up to the early 1970’s before the discovery of crude oil, agriculture was the mainstay of the economy, employing 70 per cent of the total population. Although subsistence farming was predominant, it was a major revenue earner for the country. In the early 1980’s, it became more apparent that the agricultural sector could no longer perform its traditional role of meeting domestic food requirement, raw materials for industry and started to decline  as a  major foreign exchange earner through exports  due to economic , social and political problems.</p> <p>Nigeria's soils and climate allow cultivation of a wide variety of food crops, including cassava (of which Nigeria is the largest world producer), millet, sorghum and maize. Agriculture is Nigeria's biggest employer of labour, accounting for about 60 per cent of the workforce, working mainly in small-holdings using basic tools. Together with livestock rising, it provides a third of gross domestic product.</p> <p> Growth in agricultural output averaged 3.5 per cent over 1993-1997, higher than the population growth rate, 4.0 per cent, 5.2 per cent, 2.9 per cent, 5.1 per cent from 1998-2000 respectively (CBN 2000). This compares with a period of stagnation in the first half of the 1980’s when growth averaged just 0.5 per cent, due to low producer prices, marketing restrictions and a drought. Agriculture picked up after the economic reforms introduced in 1986, which included trade liberalization, dissolution of price-fixing marketing boards and improved producer prices facilitated by devaluation of the naira. Growth in the sector averaged 3.8 per cent in 1986-92, and there was a burst of activity in the cash crop sector, with many farmers returning to previously abandoned fields. However, the renewed interest was not sustained, nor did it result in increased investment in cash crop production, mostly carried out by smallholders. Improved food crop production contributed to a sharp fall in food imports, from 19.3 per cent of total imports in 1983 to 7.1 per cent in 1991, although this crept back up to 13.1 per cent in 1996. Much of the increase in agricultural output in recent years has resulted from expansion of the area under cultivation, rather from increased productivity. The sector has been hampered by lack of investment in improved farming technology. Over-farming of fragile soil has worsened.</p> <p>The share of agricultural products in total exports has plummeted from over 70 per cent in 1960 to less than 2 per cent today. The decline was largely due to the phenomenal rise of oil shipments, but also reflected the fall in the output of products like cocoa, palm oil, rubber and groundnuts, of which Nigeria was once a leading world producer. For example, production of cocoa, currently Nigeria's biggest non-oil export earner, has remained around 160,000 tonnes per year since 1995, compared with an annual average of 400,000 tonnes at its peak before the oil boom. The government has made some effort to encourage private investment in agriculture and agro-industries by providing incentives, including tax breaks, finance credit and extension services, but without much success</p> <p><strong>1.2     Background of the study</strong></p> <p>This area of study is quite broad and as such various studies have been carried out in the area in general and other sub-sectors, highlighting the relevance of the sector towards economic growth. With the understanding been identified, many researchers, scholars have developed models on improving and developing the agricultural sector especially in developing countries. However the study will attempt to review available literatures within its reach.</p> <p><strong>1.2.1  Socio-economic and development challenges in Nigeria’s agriculture</strong></p> <p>Nigeria is one of the largest countries in Africa, with a total geographical area of 923 768 square kilometres and an estimated population of about 126 million (2006 estimate). It lies wholly within the tropics along the Gulf of Guinea on the western coast of Africa. Nigeria has a highly diversified agro ecological condition, which makes possible the production of a wide range of agricultural products. Hence, agriculture constitutes one of the most important sectors of the economy. The sector is particularly important in terms of its employment generation and its contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) and export revenue earnings. Despite Nigeria’s rich agricultural resource endowment, however, the agricultural sector has been growing at a very low rate. Less than 50% of the country’s cultivable agricultural land is under cultivation. Even then, smallholder and traditional farmers who use rudimentary production techniques, with resultant low yields, cultivate most of this land. The smallholder farmers are constrained by many problems including those of poor access to modern inputs and credit, poor infrastructure, inadequate access to markets, land and environmental degradation, and inadequate research and extension services.</p> <p>Since the collapse of the oil boom of the 1970s, there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence and severity of poverty in Nigeria, arising in part from the dwindling performance of the agricultural sector where a greater majority of the poor are employed. Furthermore, poverty in Nigeria has been assuming wider dimensions including household income poverty, food poverty/insecurity, poor access to public services and infrastructure, unsanitary environment, illiteracy and ignorance, insecurity of life and property, and poor governance. In response to the dwindling performance of agriculture in the country, governments have, over the decades, initiated numerous policies and programs aimed at restoring the agricultural sector to its pride of place in the economy. But, as will be evident from analyses in the study, no significant success has been achieved due to the several persistent constraints inhibiting the performance of the sector. From the perspective of sustainable agricultural growth and development in Nigeria, the most fundamental constraint is the peasant nature of the production system, with its low productivity, poor response to technology adoption strategies, and poor returns on investment. It is recognized that agricultural commercialization and investment are the key strategies for promoting accelerated modernization, sustainable growth and development and, hence, poverty reduction in the sector. However, to attract investment into agriculture, it is imperative that those constraints inhibiting the performance of the sector are first identified with a view to unlocking them and creating a conducive investment climate in the sector.</p> <p>The development challenges of Nigeria’s agriculture are, therefore, those of properly identifying and classifying the growth and development constraints of the sector, unlocking them, and then evolving appropriate strategies for promoting accelerated commercialization and investment in the sector such that, in the final analysis, agriculture will become one of the most important growth points in the economy.</p> <p>            In spite of the existence of a well-articulated agricultural policy document for Nigeria since 1988, the country has never established a systematic focus in her agricultural planning history that shows a conscious effort to purposely prioritize her agricultural development based on the generally identified components that constitute modern agriculture. Over the years, there has been the development and adoption of programs that tended to generally support only increased production of commodities in the country. Such programs have included, among others :</p> <p>a.         Farm settlement schemes (FSS) in the early to mid 1950s for creating farmsteads of the Israeli Moshav-type agriculture intended to increase commodity output and create employment for young school leavers.</p> <p>b.         River basin development authorities (RBDA’s) for the purpose of harnessing water resources for farmers throughout the country.</p> <p>c.         Green revolution scheme (GRS) that encouraged all Nigerians in both urban and rural areas to go into agriculture for both commerce and provision of food for home consumption.</p> <p>d.         Agricultural development programs (ADP’s) in all states of the .federation to help organize farmers into more productive agriculture through the provision of modern inputs.</p> <p>Each of these programs/schemes succeeded in momentarily increasing food production only. There were no inbuilt components that purposely catered for the processing and/or commercialization of the food output. Thus, understandably, they failed as efforts aimed at developing the agriculture sector. Recent attempts that have recognized agriculture’s current level of performance and the fact that every aspect of Nigeria’s agriculture sector needs attention have only listed specified areas that require attention. For instance, the 2001 Rural Development Sector Strategy identifies the following areas for immediate attention if agriculture and rural development in Nigeria are to make the desired impact on the lives of the people:</p> <p>a.         Institutional restructuring and role reassignment in the agricultural extension sub sector.</p> <p>b.         Agricultural technology development and natural resource management</p> <p>c.         Physical and social infrastructural development.</p> <p>d.         Public intervention in specified areas of rural agriculture to measure effectiveness.</p> <p>e.         Human capacity building in the agriculture sector.</p> <p>Similarly, the 2002 Agricultural Policy document that listed the new directions that agricultural development in the country should take has also only listed the various components of the agricultural sector without any attempt at prioritizing the components.  </p> <p><strong>1.3       S</strong><strong>tatement of the problem.</strong></p> <p>The specific problems to address include;</p> <ul><li>Inadequate investment opportunities in the sector.</li> <li>What steps have been taken in past years and in recent times to fuse agricultural proceeds into a source of economic growth</li> <li>In what ways have the government policies on agriculture aid and encourage private and public participants in the agricultural sector.</li> <li>The damaging effects of inadequate storage facilities which has caused great post-harvest loss.</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.4       O</strong><strong>bjectives of the study</strong></p> <p>            The purpose of the study is to examine the impact of agricultural output on the growth of the Nigerian economy, specifically.

BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Agriculture is concerned with the husbandry of crops and animals for food and other purposes.  It is the foundation upon which the development of stable human communities, such as rural and urban communities has depended on in many parts of the world.  The study of economic history provides us with ample evidence that an agricultural revolution is a fundamental pre-condition for economic development.  The agricultural sector has the potentials to be the industrial and economic springboard from which a country’s development can take off.  Indeed, more often than not, agricultural activities are usually concentrated in the less developed rural areas where there is a critical need for rural transformation, redistribution, poverty alleviation and socio-economic development.</p> <p>The agricultural sector has the potentials to shape the landscape, provide environmental benefits such as conservation, guarantee sustainable management of renewable natural resources, preserve biodiversity and contribute to the viability of rural areas.  Through its spheres of activities at both the macro and micro levels, the agricultural sector is strategically positioned to have a high multiplier and linkage effect on any nation’s quest for socio economic and industrial development.</p> <p>The growth of the agricultural sector in Nigeria was not smooth. </p> <p>Anyanwu (1967) held that during the colonial period between 1861 – 1960, attention was given to agricultural research and extension services.  Among the activities that was done, the first was the establishment of a research station in Lagos by Sir Claude McDonald in 1893.  Landmarks of 10.4 km was acquired by the British Cotton Growing Association (BCGA) in 1899 for experimental purposes strictly for cotton and was named Moor Plantation in Ibadan.</p> <p>In 1912, the Department of Agriculture was established in each of the then Southern and Northern Nigeria, but the activities of the department were virtually suspended between 1912 and 1921 as a result of the First World War and its aftermath.  The period 1929 and 1945 was a difficult one for the agricultural sector of Nigeria.  This was the period of great depression when the world prices on commodities fluctuated.  This affected the agricultural sector negatively because the volume of agricultural produce increased but the value did not increase proportionately.</p> <p>The period 1945 – 1954 marked the period of export boom, because countries were just recovering from the Second World War and countries that needed to develop their destroyed industrial sector were many.  They depended on primary product for the beginning stage of industrialization.  They needed to revitalize their industrial sector by demanding primary goods.  Prices of primary products rose higher again because there were speculations that there would be a Third World War due to the outbreak of the Korean War.  However, after this period, there came another period of price instability.  This made the reliance on agriculture and its products to fall, leading to the establishment of a market board.  This board bought these products from the local farmers and sold them overseas.</p> <p>In spite of all the periods, Nigeria made a great revenue from agriculture.  In the pre-Independence era, the agricultural sector contributed most to the GDP of Nigeria.  Helleiner (1966) said that in 1929, export production amounted to 57% of Nigeria’s revenue and in that 57%, agriculture made up about 80% of the export.  On attainment of political independence in 1960, the trend was still very much the same, the Nigerian economy could reasonably be described as an agricultural economy, because agriculture served as the engine of growth of the overall economy (Ogen, 2003: 231-234), from the stand point of occupational distribution and contribution to the GDP.  Nigeria was the world’s second largest producer of cocoa, largest exporter of palm oil.  Nigeria was also a leading exporter of other major commodities such as cotton, groundnut, rubber and hides and skins (Alkali, 1997: 15-16).  Between 1964 – 1965, agriculture accounted for 55% of GDP and employed 70% of the adult workforce (Matton, 1981).  In 1970, agricultural export crops like cocoa, groundnut, cotton, rubber, palm oil, palm kernel, etc. accounted for an average of between 65% - 75% of Nigeria foreign exchange earnings and provided the most important source of revenue for the Federal as well as State governments through export products and sale taxes (Ekundare 1973), despite the reliance of Nigerian peasant farmers on traditional tools and indigenous faming methods, these farmers produced 70% of Nigeria’s exports and 95% of its food needs (Lawal, 1997: 195).</p> <p>However, the 1967 – 1970 Civil War in Nigeria coincided with the ‘Oil Boom’ era, which resulted in extensive exploration and export of petroleum and its products.  This led Nigeria to neglect its strong agriculture in favour of an unhealthy dependence on oil (United States Department of State, 2005).  Ever since then, Nigeria has been witnessing extreme poverty and insufficiency of basic food items.  The agricultural sector contributions now account for less than 5% of Nigeria’s GDP (Olagbaju and Fashola, 1996: 263).  It is against this back drop that we set out to research on the impact of agricultural development on Nigeria economic growth.</p> <p>As noted earlier, the neglect of the agricultural sector and the dependence of Nigeria on a mono-cultural crude oil based economy had not augured well for the well-being of the Nigerian economy.  In a bid to address this drift, the Nigerian government as from 1975 became directly involved in the commercial production of food and cash crops. </p> <p>Several large scale agricultural projects specializing in the production of grains, livestock, dairies and animal feeds, to mention but a few, were established (Fasipe, 1990: 129-130).  Sugar factories were also established at Numan, Lafiagi and sunti (Lawal, 1997: 196).</p> <p>The Nigerian Agricultural and Co-operative Bank (NACB) was established in 1973 as part of government’s effort to invest oil wealth into the agricultural sector through the provision of credit facilities to support agriculture and agro-allied businesses (Olagunju, 2000: 90).  By 1995 the bank had granted the sum of $3,179.6 million as loan to the Private Sector.</p> <ul><li>The River Basin Development Authorities (RBDA) were conceived in 1963 and were to cater for the development of land and mineral resources potentials of Nigeria.</li> <li>Operation Feed The Nation (OFN) was commissioned in the 1970s with the main objectives of:</li> </ul> <ol><li>Mobilizing the nation towards self sufficiency and self reliance in food.</li> <li>Encouraging the sector of population which relies on buying food to growing its own food.</li> <li>Encouraging general pride in agriculture through the realization that a nation which cannot feed itself, cannot be proud etc.</li> </ol> <p>The OFN which was launched in 1976 to generate public awareness of the importance of agriculture to national development, and mobilize both rural and urban dwellers to participate in agriculture, be it in conventional crop farms, fish farms, backyard gardens or poultry did not realize the objectives of reducing or eliminating food imports and achieving self-sufficiency so in 1980 it was replaced with the Green Revolution Programme.</p> <p>-  The Green Revolution; This was a more deliberate and calculated approach to the food production problem.  The programme was followed by the mounting of food strategies mission for Nigeria by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, which estimated the level of food production needed to achieve self-sufficiency.  Much of the recommendations of the programme, such as the expansion of the Integrated Agricultural Development Programme (ADP) to cover all States of the Federation, support for artisanal fishers and aquaculture and the establishment of grain storage facilities, among others, are still being implemented.</p> <p>-   The Directorate of Food, Roads And Rural Infrastructure (DFRI):  This was established by the Federal Military Government in 1986 and was intended to bring development to the rural areas where over 70% of the population reside and work principally as farmers.  The mandate given to DFRI is as follows:</p> <ol><li>To improve the quality of life and standard of living of the people in the rural areas.</li> <li>To use the enormous resources of the rural areas to lay a solid foundation for the security, socio-economic growth and development activities of the rural areas to those of the Local Government Areas; the States and the Federal Government.</li> <li>To ensure a deeply rooted and self-sustaining development process based on effectively mobilized mass participation.</li> </ol> <p>In spite of all these efforts, it is heartrending to note that as from the mid 70s, Nigeria became a net importer of various agricultural products.  In 1982 alone, Nigeria imported 153,000mt tons of palm oil at the cost of 92 million USD and 55,000mt tons of cotton valued at 92 million USD (Alkali, 1997:10).  Between 1973 and 1980, a total of 7.07million tons of wheat, 1.62 million tons of rice and 431,000 tons of maize were imported. </p> <p>Thus from N47.8 million in the 60s, the cost of food imports in Nigeria rose to N88.2 million in 1970 and N1,027.0 million in 1988 (Alkali, 1997:19-21).  Since the 1990s till the ban of rice importation, Nigeria has been spending an average of 60 million USD on the importation of rice annually.  In 1994, the agricultural sector performed below the projected 7.2 per cent of budgetary output.  (Lawal, 1997:197-198).</p> <p>Beginning from year 2000, Nigeria import expenditure on both food and live animals rose to N113,489.8 million in the year 2000 from N103,489.8 in 1999.  The cost of importation continued in its upward trend, in 2002 it was N144,297.6, N201,648.3 in 2003, then N178,747.4 in 2004, N193,259.1 in 2005 and N235,440.0, N271,679.7 and N355,287.0 from 2006 to 2008 respectively. (National Bureau of Statistics, and CBN Statistical Bulletin Golden Jubilee Edition, 2008).</p> <p>Between 1995 and 1998, the Government further embarked on the reformation of lending policies of the Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme (ACGS) for easier access to agricultural credit.  It also established the Calabar Export Processing Zone (EPZ) and initiated the Enugu, Kaduna, Jos and Lagos EPZs with each specializing in specified food and export crops.</p> <p>In fact, the National Rolling Plan for 1996 – 1998 assumed that by the year 2000, Nigeria would have been able to feed its population, develop the capacity to process agricultural raw materials both for local industries and for export and significantly increase the contributions of the agricultural sector to the GDP (Lawal, 1997:193).  These objectives have turned out to be a mirage mainly because of official corruption.</p> <p>In order to get out of this, the Nigerian Government need to actively promote the establishment of the kind of agro-based industries that are capable of processing Nigeria’s agricultural raw materials in a most efficient manner.  Thus the emphasis should be on the local processing of raw crops for local industries as well as for exports.  This will create more employment opportunities and additional income will be generated.  The provision of agricultural subsidies for fertilizer, farm implements and equipment would also boost agricultural production.  In addition, there is the need to protect the agricultural sector from foreign imports and competition.  It is also necessary to provide replanting grants to cash crops farmers so that they can replace their old trees with newer varieties.</p> <p>It has been observed that in spite of the fact that these newer varieties are higher yielding and relatively easy to maintain with a shorter maturation period, most farmers are reluctant to do away with their old, plantations because of the high cost of replanting new ones. (Ogen, 2004:135).  It is equally important to provide special welfare schemes for farmers that will form part of a social policy to alleviate rural poverty and the redistribution of income in favour of the rural poor.  Government should also strive to promote greater efficiency in the rural areas by extending equal social benefits, establishing national schemes for agrarian reforms and improving the quality of life in areas that are quite remote so as to alter the movement of people from rural communities to urban areas.  Furthermore, the resuscitation and development of the critically ailing Nigeria Sugar Industry and its bye-products, especially ethyl alcohol (ethanol) which comes from molasses (a bye-product of sugar cane) is of an urgent and critical necessity.  Given the intractable and embarrassing problem of fuel queues in Nigeria, ethanol could be used to produce a brand of automobile fuel known as alcogas or green petrol.  Apart from being a renewable source of energy, and unlike fossil fuels, alcogas has little or no adverse effect on the environment.</p> <p><strong>1.2. STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The agricultural sector has suffered from years of poor management, inconsistent and poorly implemented government policies, government neglect and lack of basic infrastructure.  Presently, it accounts for 40.6% of GDP and 65% of employment in the economy, (A.B. Sekumade, 2009, United States Department of State, 2005).  Nigeria is no longer a major exporter of cocoa, groundnut, rubber and palm products.  Cocoa production mostly from obsolete varieties and over-aged trees is stagnant at around 150,000 tonnes annually, 25 years ago, cocoa production was 300,000 tonnes.  There has been a similar decline in groundnut, palm oil and the other major export crops (United States Department of State, 2005).  The decline in agricultural production was largely due to the rise of oil shipments (A.B. Sekumade, 2009).</p> <p>Because of this backdrop, agriculture has not kept up with the rapid population growth and Nigeria once a large net exporter of food now imports most of its food requirements.</p> <p>Dependence on oil is not the only cause of the under-development of the Nigerian agricultural sector, but also:</p> <p>Falusi and Olayiole (1980) observed that Nigerian agriculture is characterized by illiterate farmers who live in rural areas producing over 90% of the total food consumed and other agricultural products and with regards to their educational status give little or no  room for improvement through scientific research.  Olayemi (1985) noted that more than 90% of the consumed food in Nigeria is provided by the small-scale farmers.</p> <p>-      Again, the bulk of agricultural activities are done using crude implements which are relatively less efficient when compared with modern machineries such as tractors, ploughs etc.</p> <p>-      Another problem is the issue of finance.  The agricultural sector is poorly financed.  They do not get credit easily from financial institutions, like commercial banks.  The agriculturists find it difficult to finance projects which are capital intensive.  The commercial banks cannot grant loans easily to a small scale farmer because of low produce and low profit which result to a failure in paying back the loan.</p> <p>-       The lack of storage facilities have led to much wastage and high cost of storage.  This hinders the availability of some perishable agricultural produce through the year, thereby hindering agricultural development.</p> <p>-      Dependence on weather is another problem that affects the increase in agricultural produce.  Agriculturists still depend on rainfall to produce instead of the use of irrigation that supply water all through the year.</p> <p>With all that has been said above, it is obvious that the agricultural sector, being one of the real sectors of the Nigerian economy, has got a lot to contribute to its economic growth.  But these are not attainable because of the multifarious problems besieging this sector of the economy.</p> <p>This work therefore is geared towards answering the patent question:</p> <p>What impact has the agricultural sector made in the face of the dire need for food security, employment creation and in all increased economic growth of Nigeria?</p> <p><strong>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY           </strong>                                        </p> <p>The broad objective of this study is to determine the extent to which agricultural development influences economic growth in Nigeria.</p> <p>1)    To determine the cause of decline in agricultural production today.</p> <p><strong>1.4      STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>For the purpose of this study, the following hypothesis is tested;</p> <p>Ho – Agricultural development has no significant impact on economic growth in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.5. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The significance of this work lies on the fact that with improved agriculture, the Nigerian economy stands to gain in its efforts towards development.  This study attempts to answer the question; what is the relevance of agriculture in economic growth, the cause of agricultural decline and how the present state of our agricultural productivity will be improved. </p> <p>This will form the basis upon which suggestions will be made as to how the full potentials of agriculture can be harnessed.</p> <p><strong>This work stands to benefit:</strong></p> <p>-   Nigeria as a whole.  The research intends to bring forth ways to increase agricultural output both for the purposes of consumption and exportation which ultimately will bring an increased favourable Balance of Payment for the nation.</p> <p>-    The research will be beneficial to schools (teachers and students) and will help them understand the importance of farming no matter how small the scale of production.</p> <p><strong>1.6    SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS</strong></p> <p>This study focuses on Nigeria and on the impact of agricultural development on the economic growth of Nigeria.</p> <p>The originality and reliability of any study or research work is based on the quantity and quality of available data.  Though it is the duty and intention of any researcher to bring out and show everything the study is to have, but there are constraints which include, time, finance, difficulty in getting data, etc.</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT ON NIGERIA ECONOMIC GROWTH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT ON NIGERIA ECONOMIC GROWTH", "id": 67}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>INFLUENCE OF INCREASE IN PRICE ON POULTRY PRODUCTION IN NIGERIA</p> <p>(A CASE STUDY OF AKURE, ONDO STATE)</p> <div> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Poultry are the smallest livestock investment a village household can make. Yet the poverty stricken farmer needs credit assistance even to manage this first investment step on the ladder out of poverty. Poultry keeping is traditionally the role of women in many developing countries. Female-headed households represent 20 to 30 percent of all rural households in Bangladesh (Saleque, 1999), and women are more disadvantaged in terms of options for income generation. In sub-Saharan Africa, 85 percent of all households keep poultry, with women owning 70 percent of the poultry. (Guéye, 1998 and Branckaert, 1999, citing World Poultry 14). Income generation is the primary goal of family poultry keeping. Eggs can provide a regular, albeit small, income while the sale of live birds provides a more flexible source of cash as required. For example, in the Dominican Republic, family poultry contributes 13 percent of the income from animal production (Rauen et al., 1990). The importance of poultry to rural households is illustrated by the example below from the United Republic of Tanzania. Assuming an indigenous hen lays 30 eggs per year, of which 50 percent are consumed and the remainder has a hatchability of 80 percent, then each hen will produce 12 chicks per year.</p> <p><strong>2.2 THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</strong></p> <p>One of the key pillars on which the neoclassical theory of the firm stands is the assumption of profit maximization. It is a simple but controversial assumption that states that the objective of the firm is wholly and single-mindedly the maximization of profit. Many adherents of profit maximization have advanced a lot of arguments in support of their position. These include one based on the realism and predictive value of the assumption of profit maximization itself and the other based on a supposedly long-run survivalist instinct of the firm. But there are three types of factors, which may militate against a firm achieving maximum profit (Olayemi, 2004). They are:</p> <p>(i) Uncertainty and lack of information needed for rational decision making;</p> <p>(ii) The pursuit of multiple objectives by the firm of which profit earning may be only one of them;</p> <p>(iii) Restraint imposed on the single-minded pursuit of profit maximization by such other considerations as the prevention of potential entry of new firms as competitors, the long-term survival of the firm and self-preservation of the top management of the firm, which short-run profit maximization alone, would not guarantee. The issue of profit maximization is, therefore, not about whether the simple types of firms envisaged in traditional theory do strive to earn the highest profit achievable, given real-life uncertainty, inadequate information and other constraints, or whether they behave as if they maximize profit, but rather about achieving a minimum satisfactory profit since firms can survive, even over the long period, without maximizing profit, if there are adequate barriers against actual entry or threat of new entry of firms in the forms of, say, limit-pricing, government legislation, product differentiation, absolute cost advantage, large initial capital requirement for entry, and large economies of scale.</p> <p><strong>Origin and Domestication of Chicken</strong></p> <p>Nigeria is a country with heavy human population and this population is continuously on the rise. This increase had lead to the high demand for the available animal and poultry products in all parts of the country. Among the cheapest and highly affordable protein source for this teeming population is mainly the poultry products. Poultry, particularly chickens are very important and has been recognised as an important genetic resource among the avian species (Olowofeso et al., 2005). Genetic evidence confirms that chickens are derived from multiple maternal origins in Asia (Liu et al., 2006). Chickens are the most widely distributed of all livestock species in Nigeria with a population of 166 million birds (FAOSTAT, 2007). Chickens play very significant socio-cultural and economic roles in most African societies. Quantifying the structure of genetic diversity in different African chicken populations is of significance in optimizing conservation and utilization strategies. The description of Nigerian local chickens is based on phenotypic traits (Nwosu et al., 1985; Adebambo et al., 1999). Such information if complemented with findings obtained using molecular markers could be useful in formulating long term inference or plans for genetic improvement programs. A detail genetic study of chicken populations in Nigeria is therefore imperative so as to integrate the resource into the poultry sector. The genetic variations of the chicken populations in the country need investigation so as to identify populations of particular merit.</p> </div> <div> </div>\n\nINFLUENCE OF INCREASE IN PRICE ON POULTRY PRODUCTION IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INFLUENCE OF INCREASE IN PRICE ON POULTRY PRODUCTION IN NIGERIA", "id": 68}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Tomato (Lycopersiconesculentum Mill.) is one of the vegetables with the highest production in the world and its production is increasing all over the world. Tomato is rich in minerals, vitamins, essential amino acids, sugars and dietary fibers (Ayandiji et al., 2011). World tomato production in 2001 was about 105 million tons of fresh fruit from an estimated 3.9 million ha. As it is a relatively short duration crop and gives a high yield, it is economically attractive and the area under cultivation is increasing daily. Tomato belongs to the Solanaceae family. This family also includes other well-known species, such as potato, tobacco, peppers and eggplant. Tomatoes contribute to a healthy, well-balanced diet. They are rich in minerals, vitamins, essential amino acids, sugars and dietary fibres. Tomato contains much vitamin B and C, iron and phosphorus. Tomato fruits are consumed fresh in salads or cooked in sauces, soup and meat or fish dishes. They can be processed into purées, juices and ketchup. Canned and dried tomatoes are economically important processed products. Tomato is an annual plant, which can reach a height of over two metres. In South America, however, the same plants can be harvested for several years in succession. The first harvest is possible 45-55 days after flowering, or 90-120 days after sowing. The shape of the fruit differs per cultivar. The colour ranges from yellow to red. In Ethiopia, tomato is one the important and widely grown vegetable crops. Both in rainy and dry seasons for their fruits by smallholder farmers and commercial state and private farm in Ethiopia (Ambecha et al.,2012;MoA,2013;AVRDC,2014).It is also a source of basic raw material required for fresh consumption and local processing industry for the production of processed Tomato like Tomato paste, Tomato juice and etc.(EIA,2008). Lemma et al. (2003) indicated that the total production of Tomato in Ethiopia has shown market increase ,indicating that it has became the most profitable crop providing a higher income to small scale farmers compared to other vegetable crops.However,average yield of Tomato in Ethiopia is low,ranging from 6.5-24 metric ton/ha(Ambecha et al.,2012)as compared with average yields of 51,41,36 and 34 metric tonne/ha in America,Europe,Asia and the entire world, respectively (FAOSTAT,2010).The national average of Tomato seed yield under farmers ‘conditions in Ethiopia is also very low, estimated at about 1.2 quintals /ha (Lemma,2002). Seeds are one of the least expensive but most important factors influencing yield potential. Crop seeds contain all the genetic information to determine yield potential, adaptation to environmental conditions, and resistance to insect pest and disease. Increasing agricultural production through the use of high quality seed, among other agricultural inputs, has become essential for providing enough food for rising number of people in the world (Barsa, 2006). Seed produced under controlled condition is likely to be higher yielding and is less likely to harbor pathogen than locally produced seeds (Rice et al., 1990; Barsa, 2006). Seed quality is determined by many factors, principally seed purity and germination. However, many other factors, Such as the variety, presence or absence of seed-borne disease, vigor of the seed, and seed size are important when considering seed purchase. Seed lots that have low germination also are less vigorous due to seed deterioration .As seeds deteriorate,loss of vigor proceeds loss of viability,so seeds with low germination usually will be less vigorous.Hence,in seed lots with poor germination, those seeds that do germinate often produce weakerseedlings with reduced yield potential (Barsa ,2006;Nemati et al.,2010). According to lemma (2002) ,the major production constraints of Tomato production in Ethiopia are shortage of varaties and recommended package of information ,unknown source and poor quality seeds, poor irrigation system, lack of information on soil fertility ,disease and insect pests ,high post-harvest loses, lack of awareness of existing improved technologies and poor marketing system. Supplying of high quality seeds is the basic requirement and it contributes greatly to the success of any crop. Various researchers (Gutterman, 1992; Uniyal et al., 2011) have reported variation in seed quality among population in some plant species to have been attributed to differences in environmental condition of mother-plant. Many cultural practices such as types of nutrient, water supply, and harvesting methods are also believed to be factors influencing both pre- and postharvest quality of tomato (Melkamu, 2008). Many postharvest quality losses are as a result of many pre-harvest factors. Controlling the number of flowers, fruits, or fruit trusses in tomatoes is an effective way of reducing the competition between fruits. Water loss from harvested fruit produce is predominantly caused by the amount of moisture present in the ambient air expressed as relative humidity (Suslow, et al 2009). Respiration and metabolic activities within harvested climacteric fruits like tomatoes are directly related to the temperatures of the ambient environment. High temperatures can hasten the rate of respiration (CO2 production) in harvested or stored fruits products. Seed yield and quality of Tomato is mainly dependent on the variety selected for seed production (George, 1999). A number of improved varieties and other agronomic packages have been recommended to the users to overcome the low productivity and quality of Tomato in the country. According to MoA (2013), Ethiopian National Agricultural System (NARS) has released about 25 Tomato varieties till 2013.</p> <p><strong>1.2  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Many agricultural practices such as types of nutrient, water supply, and harvesting methods are also believed to be factors influencing both pre- and postharvest quality of tomato (Melkamu, 2008).

The species originated in Central and South America. The Nahauti (Aztec language) word tomatl gave rise to the Spanish word \"tomate\", from which the English word tomato originates.Numerous varieties of tomato are widely grown in temperate climates across the world, with greenhouses allowing its production throughout the year and in cooler areas. The plants typically grow to 1–3 meters (3–10 ft) in height and have a weak stem that often sprawls over the ground and vines over other plants. It is a perennial  in its native habitat and grown as an annual in temperate climates. An average common tomato weighs approximately 100 grams (4 oz). It's use as a food originated in Mexico and spread throughout the world following the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Tomato is consumed in diverse ways, including raw, as an ingredient in many dishes, sauces, salads and drinks. While tomatoes are botanically berry-type fruits, they are considered culinary vegetables being ingredients of savory meals</p> <p><strong>Harvesting</strong></p> <p>Harvesting is the process of gathering a ripecrop from the fields. Reaping is the cutting of grain or pulse for harvest, typically using a scythe, sickle or reaper. On smaller farms with minimal mechanization, harvesting is the most labor-intensive activity of the growing season.</p> <p><strong>Post-harvest </strong></p> <p>In agriculture, postharvest handling is the stage of crop production immediately following harvest, including cooling, cleaning, sorting and packing. The instant a crop is removed from the ground, or separated from its parent plant, it begins to deteriorate.</p> <p><strong>1.8 ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        This research work is organized in five chapters, for easy understanding, as follows. Chapter one is concern with the introduction, which consist of the (background of the study), statement of the problem, objectives of the study, research questions, research hypotheses, significance of the study, scope of the study etc. Chapter two being the review of the related literature presents the theoretical framework, conceptual framework and other areas concerning the subject matter.     Chapter three is a research methodology covers deals on the research design and methods adopted in the study. Chapter four concentrate on the data collection and analysis and presentation of finding.  Chapter five gives summary, conclusion, and recommendations made of the study.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF POST-HARVEST HANDLING ON THE QUALITY AND MARKETABILITY OF LOCALLY HARVESTED TOMATO<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF POST-HARVEST HANDLING ON THE QUALITY AND MARKETABILITY OF LOCALLY HARVESTED TOMATO", "id": 69}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PROCESSING TECHNIQUES ON THE ORGANOLEPTIC QUALITY OF SOY MILK</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background of the study</strong></p> <p>His of Soymilk: Soybeans belongs to the family leguminous, subfamily papiliondase and the genus Glycine Max.

However as the first legume of which a written record was made. This was in the books of the Emperor Shen hung, dated 1800BC which describes the five principal and sacred crops of China, rice, bean, wheat barely and millet, lafter in his milliohm there were chinses writing, giving expert advice on growing soybean which was cultivated more extensively in North than in Southern China, it reached Hapan and other countries in East Asia at an early date.<br/> Soybean contain about 46% protein and 18% fat, characteristics which have influenced it’s history: the ancient Chinese evolved methods of making from it’s preparations with high protein content for example, Curd and Shoyu, Shoyu is a dark brown liquid made by fermentation of a combination of soybeans and cereals (F.A.O. 1970). The Chinese also ate soybeans as a vegetable after it ahs sprouted.<br/> The soybean was first heard of in Europe in 1712 through the German Botanist EgelbantKalmpfer who had visited Japan. In the 18th century, it was grown in some European botanical gardens (F.A.O, 1970), it is first appearance in the United States in 1804, when Commander Perry brought home two varieties from Japan (F.A.O, 1970).<br/> What was called the second stage in the history of soybeans did not begin until the first decade of the present century, when it become an important export from East – Asia at first mainly to Europe and alter to the importing countries was as a source of oil for soap making and other purposes and for the manufacture of livestock feed.<br/> Then the third stage began in the early nineteen thirties, it is silent feature has been the large stage cultivation of the soybean in the United States, combined with the application of Modern Technology which enable it to be put to a variety of uses both as food and folder and as raw materials for manufacturing processes, while soybean has to a considerable extent becomes an industrial crop in the United States, it continues to be grown in East Asia as a food crop processed for consumption by time honoured methods. (FAO, 1970).<br/> The fourth stage began during the first decade of the 20th century A.D. at the period in which this crop was first introduced of soybeans in Nigeria shows that middle belt of the country to be the best producer of soybean production (Ezedinmma, 1964). In Nigeria, nearly all of the soybean production estimated at 30,000 tons is used for human food. A response to increase in demand for soybean for soybean as a source of protein and vegetable oil, national programme in Nigeria have explained their research on the crop. Since 1987 (IITA; Annual Report 1985) currently more feather have been added to the number of products that can be obtained from soybeans in Nigeria, such products like soymilk as it had been recently demonstrated at the food investigation centuries in Enugu. <br/> Soymilk in the traditional sense is simply an aqueous extract of whole soybean, A detailed description of the technique used for the preparation of the soymilk as well as its composition will be found in chapter 3.<br/> Soymilk according to the nutritionist a possible substitute for cow or human milk particularly in the feeding of infant who are allegic to animal milk or where cows milk may be found to be two expensive or unavailable. Miller, (1962) soybean or vegetable milk or flu-changinchinse is reported to have been developed and used in china before the Christian era (paker and Morse 1943) by the philosopher who was credited with the first step in the processing of tofu and yuba. Then, the traditional milk is made by soaking the bean in water overnight, wet milling the bean, heating the wet mash to improve flavour and nutritional value and filtration. The milk produce is sold to the public in streets and canteens in china in 1984.<br/> In recent years large scale production ha evolved along with commercial marketing of soymilk in Hongkong, Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, Sinapere, Malaysiaa and not the United States (Babara, 1984). <br/> Uses of Soybeans<br/> Soybeans are a native crop of Eastern Asia where they have `served as an important part of the diet for centuries. The Japanese for example obtain 12 – 13% of their dietary protein from soybean product, for many of their traditional soy foods, the oriental people soak soybeans in water and then grind or cook them.<br/> Hot water extraction of ground beans yields soybean milk which is consumed as such or is treated with calcium salts to precipitate the protein plus oil in the form of bean curd or tofu, fermentation of cooked soybeans yield products including soy sauce, misso, notto and tempheh.<br/> Except for soy sauce, one of the traditional oriental foods is consumed in significant amounts in this country. Soybeans are a relative new corner to the American scene. They have only been gown in quantity since the late 1920’s when soybean processing become an established industry, the two major products were oil and defaulted meals.<br/> In the mid – 1`930’s large portion of the oil began to be used for foods such as shortening, margarine, cooking oil mayonnaise and salad dressing, because of its high protein content and good nutritional value, when properly processed, the meal was used primarily for animal feeds.<br/> Soybeans have expanded in the last 30 year from a minor crop to a major cash crops. Indeed in value to the farmer soybeans now rank second to corn and above wheat, potatoes, oats, cotton and a variety of other crops better known to the consumers, only within the last ten years however, have every many edible products. Containing soybean derivatives been directly associated with their source. In shortening their presence was “hidden” by statements similar to the followings. ‘A blend of hydrogenated vegetable oils or in salad dressing, merely “vegetable oil or a blend of vegetable oil”. Today a long list of foods containing soybean derived product can be prepared by careful reading of the labels in the supermarket, yet most of these are even not specifically identified as soybean. Product from corn, wheat, oats and many other commodities are so labeled for example corn flakes, wheat, garn, oatmeal, but not soybean. There are several reasons for this an enmity, soybean have a short history of sue in the U.S.A. the flavour and texture of soybean products are comparatively strange to people outside the orient.<br/> Although the Chinese and Japanese have covered soybeans into a variety of products most of these foods have little physical or flavour identity with the original bean. Some people agree that green soybean are a delicious dish when properly harvested and cooked but their sale and the sale and the ale of mature beans for baking are extremely small. Soybean products have problems related to their flavour and flavour stability to their ruction in foods and to their physiological effects. Despite these problems soybean oils have become a major material in our food industry. Soybean now supply more than half of the total visible fits and oils consumed in the U.S.A<br/> Soybean composition (PREXIMATE), commercial soybean constitute and 2% hypocotyls and phumule.

In the past 50yrs a vast literature was developed on the nutritive properties of soybean protein, but moist heat is still used to improve the nutritional quality of soybean protein product for foods and feeds.<br/> The literature on this subject is often confusing and contradictory ; two recent reviews gives concise summaries of pertinent work for the last 30yrs. Alleged antinutritional factors and protein quality therefore are discussed only briefly.</p> <p><strong>1.4 ANTINUTRITIONAL FACTORS</strong></p> <p>Since moist heat readily inactivates the anti-growth factors raw soybean meal, many workers believe that the factors are proteininhibitors and hemagluthins, non protein components such as sapynins have b suggested as anti-nutritional factors but recent work does not support this view.</p> <p><strong>1.5 TRYPSIN INHIBITORS</strong></p> <p>More than five trysin inhibitors are reported for soybeans but only two-the kenitz and the Bowman Birk inhibitors have been purified and studied in details Kaw soybean meal contains 1.4% kunity inhibitor and 0.6^ Bowman-Birk inhibitor.</p> <p>Although both inhibitors are active against boline trypsin the kunity inhibitor has any how activity the esterase activity of human trypsin. The activity of human trypsin however is inhibited to a significant extent by kunity inhibition when case is sued as a substrate to measure proteolytic activity. It is not known whether ingestion of the inhibiters affects the presence in humans.From the practical standpoint, Trypsin inhibitors do not appear to be a serious problem in feeds and food since they are largely inactivated by moist heat. Condition of heating time, temperature, moisture content and particle size influence the rate and extent of trypsin inhibitors inactivation for example, atmospheric steaming (1000C) inactivates more than 95% of the trypsin inhibitor activity of raw, defatted soybean flakes in 15mins. Protein efficiency shows an accompanying increase in this same time and flakes of 19% moisture gave a higher protein efficiency ratio than flakes of 5% moisture. In contrast, steaming whole soybeans chips, or cotyledons for 20mins only partially inactivated trypsin inhibitors apparently because of the large particle size. Atmospheric steaming inactivates most of the trypsin inhibitor in whole soybeans in 15mins. In initial moisture content is 20%. If the beans are soaked in water overnight 60% moisture 25mins. In boiling water sufficient to inactivate the inhibitors. Small bu<br/> the measurable trypsin inhibitors activity can often be deflected after heating the known stability of Bowman-kirk inhibitor suggested that the residual inhibitor may be of this types. Measurements of residual chymotrypsin inhibitor activity would clarify this point because the Bowman-kirk inhibitor is a strong inhibitor of chymotrtpsin.<br/> At recent study reports trypsin inhibitor activity commercial protein isolate but no inhibitor was detected in canned frankfurters containing 1.5% isolate. The heat treatment during canning inactivated the residual inhibitor.<br/> Many of the conclusion drawn from studies on kunity inhibitor must be viewed with some reservations because of the heterogeneity of certain commercial preparation even when crystallized five times. The possibility that a protein impurities or a tightly bound non-protein impurity is responsible for some of the biological properties of the inhibitor has received slight consideration until recently.<br/> Hemagglatinins –Soybean contain at least four proteins capable of causing clumping of red blood cells of rabbits and rates in invitrotests. These proteins are designated haemagluttinins; these proteins are in many legumes. Defected soy flour contains about 3% lemaglutinins. The major hemagluttinin in soybeans has been insolated and characterized. It is a glycoprotein containing 4.5% mannose and 1% glucesanine and has a molecular weight of 110,00 and appear to contain two polypeptide chains. The ability of hemaggluttinins to cause clumping of red blood cells in a test tube serves as a useful assay procedure but there is no evidence that agglutination of red cells occurs when hemagluttinins are ingested. Hemagglutinins is readily inactivated by pepsin; thus it probably does not service passage through the stomach. Furthermore, undigested hemagglutinin would have to be absorbed from the intestine to come into contact with red blood cells an occurrence which seems unliky because of the high molecular weight of <br/> the hemagglutinin.<br/> Soybean hemagglutinins are readily inactivated when maximum growth response is obtain. Hemagglutininsthis ;present no known problems in foods of preparation includes proper heating of the soy ingredient at some step of processing.<br/> Soybean saponings – saponins are complex glycosides of triterpenoid alcohols and occur in soybeans to the extent of 0.5% and because of their polarity, the saponins are insoluble in hexane and remain in defatted meal; defatted meal contains 0.6^ saponins. Although antinutritional properties have been ascribed to soybean saponins, recent studies show t hem to be harmless when ingested by chicks rates and nice aft 0.5 to 3% of the diet. At the highest level the saponins content was about three fold higher than in a 50% soybean meal supplemented diet. Neither saponings nor sapogenine were found in blood of rates, mice or chicks kept in diet containing 20% soybean seed, thus the saponins are not absorbed thy remain intact until they leave the enzymes in the colon. The saponin inhibit various enzymes including cholinesterase and chymotrypsin but inhibition is not specific. Soyprotein and other dietary protein will also bind saponins. Approximately 0.4% saponins were obtained from a laboratory preparation of soy<br/> protein isolate when isolates where ehated in dilate and solutions crystalline bit apparently modified. Saponins were obtained. The effect of interaction of the saponins with soy protein is still unknown, the saponins are an extremely complex mixture and only limited separations have been obtained to date.<br/> Protein quality of soybean.<br/> Until the 1960’s information on the nutritive value of soybean protein was largely limited to defatted flakes, meals and flours. Moreover most of the studied were concerned with use of soybean means as an animals feed. Since commercial introduction of concentrates and isolates in 1959 and their increasing use in foods, these fractions have received considerably more attention studies with human, however, are still limited. The quality of soy protein depends on several factors:-<br/> a) Amino acids composition<br/> b) Presence of anti-nutritional factors<br/> c) Digestibility<br/> d) Overall composition of the diet<br/> e) Nutrient requirement of the species involves. Item a, b, and c are of primary importance in considering the various soy protein forms as protein sources.<br/> In the preparation of isolates for example fractionation occurs; this results in a change in amino acid composition as well as in removal of the antinutritional factors occurring in the whey, items of and e are of greater importance when a specific food is being considered i.e. an infant food dietary item or a soack food nutritional requirements for an infant differ greatly from the needs of an adult who may be trying too loose weight.</p> <p><strong>1.6 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT </strong><br/>The processing of soybeans into soymilk is aimed at gaining consumer acceptance of the legume by removal of the toxicants that contain and also improving organoleptic qualities of soymilk with special consideration to some adverse effect of these operation in soymilk quality.<br/>This project re views the effects of different methods used in the processing of soybeans into soymilk on the quality of the milk produced during processing and storage.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PROCESSING TECHNIQUES ON THE ORGANOLEPTIC QUALITY OF SOY MILK<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PROCESSING TECHNIQUES ON THE ORGANOLEPTIC QUALITY OF SOY MILK", "id": 70}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>STRATEGIES FOR INVOLVING RURAL FARMERS IN AGRICULTURAL BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION IN AKWA IBOM STATE, NIGERIA</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTROUCTION</strong></p> <p>The conservation of biodiversity is one aspect of environment, which has recently receivedglobal attention. Biodiversity refers to the variety and variability among living organisms andthe ecological complexes in which they occur (Board on Science and Technology forInternational Development (BOSTID), 2002. It is a term used to describe the degree ofnature’s variety including both the number and frequency of ecosystems, species or genes ina given assemblage. It is essentially synonymous with life on the earth. It is usuallyJournal of Agriculture and Veterinary Sciences Volume 2, December 2010© 2010 Cenresin Publicationswww.cenresin.org103considered at three different levels: genetic diversity, specie diversity and ecosystemdiversity. Genetic diversity is the sum total of genetic characteristics of individual plants,animals and other living organisms inhabiting the earth. Such characteristics may includerapid growth, high yields, diseases and pests resistance, and environmental adaptation.Specie diversity refers to the variety of living organisms on earth, while ecosystem diversityrefers to the variety of habitats, biotic communities and ecological processes in the biosphereas well as the tremendous diversity within ecosystems in terms of habitat differences and thevariety of ecological processes.The concept of agricultural biodiversity or agrobiodiversity as it is sometimes referred couldbe identified within a macro concept of biodiversity. Agricultural biodiversity is restricted toplants and animals used in commerce or having potential use (Srivastava, Smith and Ferno,2001). It is the diversity of genetic resources (varieties, breeds, species, cultivated, reared orwild) used directly for food and agriculture; the diversity of species that support production(soil biota, pollinators, predators, etc.) and those in the wider environment that supportagroecosystems (agricultural, pastoral. forest and aquatic), as well as the diversity ofagroecosystems themselves (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2008) .Agroecosystems arethose ecosystems that are used for agriculture, and comprise polycultures, monocultures andmixed systems including crop-livestock systems (rice-fish), agroforestry agrosilvo pastoralsystems, aquaculture as well as rangelands, pastures and fallow lands (Pimbert, 2009).Agricultural biodiversity is of immense benefit to humanity. Man depends on various livestockand crop species for food, fuel, fibre, medicine, drugs and raw materials for a host ofmanufacturing technologies and purposes. The productivity of agricultural system is as aresult of a continuous alteration of once wild plant and animal germplasms. Also geneticengineering especially in. the pharmaceutical and food processing industries uses agrogeneticresources from sources worldwide. Besides these direct values, agriculturalbiodiversities arc important parts of the processes that regulate the earth’s atmospheric,climatic, hydrologic and biochemical cycles. It provides local ecological services including theprotection of watersheds, cycling of nutrients, combating erosion, enriching soil, regulatingwater flow, trapping sediments, mitigating erosion and controlling pest population (Ehrenfeld,2000)Furthermore, agrobiodiversity holds ethical and aesthetical values and also forms the basisfor sustainable rural development and resource management. In most rural areas of AkwaIbom State, the diversity of local plants and animals is being harnessed for sustainableeconomic development. Locally adapted traditional animal breeds (sheep, goats, cattle), cropvarieties (fruit trees, fodder plants and cereals) and wild fruits are being explored to generatelocal products jobs, income and environmental care.Inspite of the enormous potentialities of agrobiodiversity in retaining plants, animals, soils,and water as well as serving as the foundation of sustainable development, most of theStrategies for Involving Rural Farmers in Agricultural BiodiversityConservation in Akwa Ibom State, NigeriaCamilus Bassey Ben104environmental discussions in this regard draw attention to its being increasingly subjected todevastation and loss. The loss of agrobiodiversity is a relative phenomenon. Blaide andBroodfield (2007) maintained that agrobiodiversity is lost when it suffers a reduction inintrinsic qualities or a decline in its capabilities or complete extinction resulting from ‘acausative factor or a combination of factors which reduce its physical, chemical or biologicalstatus hence restricting its productive capacity. It also involves a loss of utility or potentialutility or the reduction or change of features or extinction of agro species which could not bereplaced (Dumsday, 2007).Akwa Ibom State occupies one of the geographical zones located in the rainforest belt – anarea known for high density of agro-genetic diversity. Throughout its ecological zones, thediversity of agroecosystem is being rapidly eroded. This erosion may be primarily due tointensive resource exploitation and extensive alteration of habitats. Other associated factorsinclude: the neglect of indigenous knowledge of agrobiodiversity conservation institutions andmanagement systems; the blueprint approach to development whereby monoculture systemsand uniform technologies are promoted; the quest for the transnational corporations thatmarket agricultural inputs and process food and fibres for commercial profits anduncontrolled over-production; inequitable access to and control over land, water, trees andgenetic resources on he part of local people; market pressures and the under-valuation ofagricultural biodiversity; demographic factors and oil spillage.It is acclaimed fact that rural farmers often have profound and detailed knowledge of agrospeciesand the related ecosystem’s with which they come in contact and have developedeffective ways of ensuring they are used sustainably (McNeely, Miller, Reid, Mittermeier, &amp;Werner, 2000). However, they are constrained by a number of problems in their attempt toadopt conservation systems that sustain its own capital – agricultural resources of plant andanimal sources. According to FAO (2009), the factor which causes a gap between the desiredand actual farmer behaviour in conservation border on knowledge, motivation andtechnology, type of incentives and disincentives, land use, population growth and povertyamong others.McNeely et al (2000) noted that at its most fundamental level agrobiodiversity is threatenedbecause people are out of balance with their environment. Benefits are being gained fromexploiting agricultural resources without paying the full cost of such exploitation. Theyidentify six main obstacles to greater progress in conserving agricultural biodiversity. Theseare:a. Development objectives give insufficient value to agro-resourcesb. Agro-resources are exploited for profit, not for meeting the legitimate needs of localpeople.c. The species and ecosystem upon which human survival depend are still poorly known.d. Conservation activities by most organization s have had to focus too narrowly.Journal of Agriculture and Veterinary Sciences Volume 2, December 2010105e. Institutions assigned responsibility for creating awareness on the need forconservation among rural farmers has lacked sufficient resources to do the job.On insufficient value being given to agro-resources in the national and private developmentobjectives, McNeely et al pointed out that maintaining a nation’s agro-agricultural diversity isintegral to maintaining its agricultural wealth, but the importance of species and ecosystem isseldom sufficiently considered in the formulation of national development policies. Ruralfarmers do not consciously consider the value of species and ecosystems in their farmpractices. Development tends to emphasize short-term exploitation to earn income or foreignexchange rather than long-term sustainable utilization of agricultural resources. Farmersfocused on their expressed immediate needs and tend to seek relatively short-term returnson their investments. Uncontrolled use of agricultural resources by farmers contributes tospecie extinction and loss of agricultural biodiversity. McNeely et al also pointed out thatmost conservation efforts made by the farmers have addressed a small species such asruminants, monogastrics, poultry, major species of plants or certain tree species. Farmerslack ability conserve if the conservation efforts are poorly paid. Besides, those responsible forcreating awareness opportunities for advancement, lack specialized training and have lowprestige, lack sufficient equipment and managerial capacity. These ultimately affect theconservation efforts of the rural farmers.Shepherd (2002) blames the poor conservation disposition of the rural farmers on tenure andland use changes. He noted that one of the facts which emerge of recent in the conservationcircle is the tremendous paucity of formal forester knowledge about the conservation offorest-based agro-resources. Set against this knowledge, one finds the imposition ofEuropean concept of property and land tenure, with disastrous effect. The most importantgap was the failure to understand the Swidden fallowing system which had used thelandscape sustainably for some years now. swidden fallowing is coming to an end and moremarginal lands are farmed with accompanying destruction of bush areas. Each householdhead now tries to spread his bets by sowing over as wide and varied an area as possible withthe result that conservation practices such as manuring, intensive sowing and weeding,planned fallowing and water conservation, have been replaced by quick easy farming(Thompson, Feeny, and Oakerson, 2006).Indirectly related to this is the land use changes relating to economic change and the loss ofauthority of elders in the traditional farming community. Thompson el al (2006) noted thatthe introduction of plantation crops such as oil palm, cocoa and rubber as major economiccrops has a negative effect on other many areas with attendant loss of agro-ecosystem andagrobiodiversity. He also said that in some local communities the authorities of the clanelders who were originally solely responsible for livestock and agro-resource management, isbeing eroded by modern education for the young and the promulgation of Land Use Acts bythe government. Pointing out the effect of this on conservation effort, he said that, theStrategies for Involving Rural Farmers in Agricultural BiodiversityConservation in Akwa Ibom State, NigeriaCamilus Bassey Ben106weakened position of the elders makes the conservation of agro-resources through theinstitution of sacred groves no longer tenable.Another factor which has tremendous adverse influence on the ability of the rural farmer’sconservation is unattended population growth. Nigerian Environmental Study/Action Team(NEST), (2001) rightly argued that a finite world can support only a finite population. Under agiven socio-economic system and technology, there is an upper limit to the number of peoplewhich land area can support. As long as the number of people is below this critical value theirdemand for agricultural land, grazing land and food at least in theory can be met without theenvironment being degraded or destroyed by population pressure, However, if the criticalpopulation density is exceeded, these human demands translate into excessive pressure onthe land and agro-resource, The partnership between population and the environmentbecomes endangered and may break down as problems of deforestation and loss ofagrobiodiversity Once the population sinks into a miserable state, what was once aharmonious and happy partnership between people and environment can easily become avicious cycle in which environmental degradation makes people desperately poor. Povertyforces people to over-exploit the available agro-resources with disregard to conservation.Population pressure seems to have led to the shortening of fallow periods under the shiftingcultivation, In its traditional form, shifting cultivation is known for a rich source of cropdiversity (BOSTID, 2002) In Nigeria, the whole cycle has less than halved in length and thefallow period is less than a third of what it was (NEST, 2002). The tendency is for thefallowing system to shrink in the end to the point where it is replaced by, crop rotation andmonocropping. In these systems conservation practices are often replaced by quick easyfarming (Thompson, Fenny, &amp; Oakerson , 2006).One of the constraints to the conservation of agrobiodiversity by rural farmers is lack ofeducation. Nigeian Conservation Foundation (NCF), (2005) pointed out that tacklingenvironmental problems (loss of agrobiodiversity inclusive), requires action mostly fromenvironmental education, Noibi (2002) noted that a person’s level of ignorance of theenvironment can be said to be positively related to the degree of damage to theenvironment. He exemplified this by relating a case of farmers who over-graze their land orsubstitute chemical fertilizer for organic manure and pesticides for biological means of pestcontrol without bothering about the implications of that action on land and agrobiodiversity,It could therefore, be inferred that lack of environmental education among the farmers is thesingle greatest contributor that constraints the conservation of agricultural biodiversity byrural farmers. Education can impart knowledge and determination necessary to resolve agiven set of environmental problems.The social and perceptual factors also influence the conservation attitude of the ruralfarmers. According to Kellert (2008), the development of compelling rational and effectivestrategy for protecting endangered agro-species will require an increasing recognition thatJournal of Agriculture and Veterinary Sciences Volume 2, December 2010107most contemporary extinction problems are largely the result of socio-economic and politicalforces. Norton (2008) pointed out that only a small minority of people possess much concernor empathy for the plight of endangered agro-species. Kellen (2008) while reflecting this viewnoted “the study of vanishing biodiversity is necessarily the study of man’s perception ofanimals and plants. What we fear, what we hope and what we admire in animals/plants willinevitably determine their fate. Agro-species are there but most of them figure as villain inour myths”.As Norton intimates, agro-species are viewed somewhat more positively when they possesssome aesthetic and utilitarian values. Human benefit factors include animal capacity toprovide food, clothing, recreation and companionship. Ecological factors include species rarityand its contribution to diversity and ecological balance. Important psychological factorsinclude the animal’s species aesthetic characteristics, spiritual and religious associations,habituating capacity and behavioural plasticity. These factors and values outline theperceptual categories rural farmers typically employ in deciding which species are worthy ofpreservation.Another factor affecting conservation by rural farmers borders on the conservation policiesoperating in the country. NEST (2008) pointed out that one of the biggest bio-resourcesmanagement problem is the absence of well coordinated rational policies and legislationoperating in the country, but such policies have often been implemented without reallyconsidering local socio-economic issues. Also conservation policies tend to be largely“western” in outlook and having been designed and possibly managed by governmentofficials can be poorly adapted to meet vital local needs (Barrow, 2008) He pointed outthat conservation can involve a range of different interests such as central government,state/local government, local farmers, and conservation group/development staff and theremay be conflict of interest between them. He concluded that developing conservation policieswithout taking the needs and demands of these different group’s will tend to end in difficulty.Constraints to the conservation of agrobiodiversity by rural farmers are also associated withculture and religious beliefs. NEST submits that because of the closer relationship betweenculture and the environment, any campaign for environmental awareness and conservationmust take on a new cultural time, calling for new ways of life and a new orientation. Duringpre-colonial times, religious beliefs and practices played important roles in the conservationespecially agrobiodiversity. Sacred grooves and sacred animals were not exploited by peopleand so they remained in their pristine state. However, with the institution of colonialgovernment and the spread of western values and culture, our traditional methods ofconservation gradually disappeared and sacred forests became hunting ground (NEST, 2001).On the adverse effects of religious influence on traditional conservation practices, varioustraditional farmers have developed over the centuries, effective method of using theenvironment sustainably.

Other associated factorsinclude: the neglect of indigenous knowledge of agrobiodiversity conservation institutions andmanagement systems; the blueprint approach to development whereby monoculture systemsand uniform technologies are promoted; the quest for the transnational corporations thatmarket agricultural inputs and process food and fibres for commercial profits anduncontrolled over-production; inequitable access to and control over land, water, trees andgenetic resources on he part of local people; market pressures and the under-valuation ofagricultural biodiversity; demographic factors and oil spillage.It is acclaimed fact that rural farmers often have profound and detailed knowledge of agrospeciesand the related ecosystem’s with which they come in contact and have developedeffective ways of ensuring they are used sustainably (McNeely, Miller, Reid, Mittermeier, &amp;Werner, 2000). However, they are constrained by a number of problems in their attempt toadopt conservation systems that sustain its own capital – agricultural resources of plant andanimal sources. According to FAO (2009), the factor which causes a gap between the desiredand actual farmer behaviour in conservation border on knowledge, motivation andtechnology, type of incentives and disincentives, land use, population growth and povertyamong others.McNeely et al (2000) noted that at its most fundamental level agrobiodiversity is threatenedbecause people are out of balance with their environment. Benefits are being gained fromexploiting agricultural resources without paying the full cost of such exploitation. Theyidentify six main obstacles to greater progress in conserving agricultural biodiversity. Theseare:a. Development objectives give insufficient value to agro-resourcesb. Agro-resources are exploited for profit, not for meeting the legitimate needs of localpeople.c. The species and ecosystem upon which human survival depend are still poorly known.d. Conservation activities by most organization s have had to focus too narrowly.Journal of Agriculture and Veterinary Sciences Volume 2, December 2010105e. Institutions assigned responsibility for creating awareness on the need forconservation among rural farmers has lacked sufficient resources to do the job.On insufficient value being given to agro-resources in the national and private developmentobjectives, McNeely et al pointed out that maintaining a nation’s agro-agricultural diversity isintegral to maintaining its agricultural wealth, but the importance of species and ecosystem isseldom sufficiently considered in the formulation of national development policies. Ruralfarmers do not consciously consider the value of species and ecosystems in their farmpractices. Development tends to emphasize short-term exploitation to earn income or foreignexchange rather than long-term sustainable utilization of agricultural resources. Farmersfocused on their expressed immediate needs and tend to seek relatively short-term returnson their investments. Uncontrolled use of agricultural resources by farmers contributes tospecie extinction and loss of agricultural biodiversity. McNeely et al also pointed out thatmost conservation efforts made by the farmers have addressed a small species such asruminants, monogastrics, poultry, major species of plants or certain tree species. Farmerslack ability conserve if the conservation efforts are poorly paid. Besides, those responsible forcreating awareness opportunities for advancement, lack specialized training and have lowprestige, lack sufficient equipment and managerial capacity. These ultimately affect theconservation efforts of the rural farmers.Shepherd (2002) blames the poor conservation disposition of the rural farmers on tenure andland use changes. He noted that one of the facts which emerge of recent in the conservationcircle is the tremendous paucity of formal forester knowledge about the conservation offorest-based agro-resources. Set against this knowledge, one finds the imposition ofEuropean concept of property and land tenure, with disastrous effect. The most importantgap was the failure to understand the Swidden fallowing system which had used thelandscape sustainably for some years now. swidden fallowing is coming to an end and moremarginal lands are farmed with accompanying destruction of bush areas. Each householdhead now tries to spread his bets by sowing over as wide and varied an area as possible withthe result that conservation practices such as manuring, intensive sowing and weeding,planned fallowing and water conservation, have been replaced by quick easy farming(Thompson, Feeny, and Oakerson, 2006).Indirectly related to this is the land use changes relating to economic change and the loss ofauthority of elders in the traditional farming community. Thompson el al (2006) noted thatthe introduction of plantation crops such as oil palm, cocoa and rubber as major economiccrops has a negative effect on other many areas with attendant loss of agro-ecosystem andagrobiodiversity. He also said that in some local communities the authorities of the clanelders who were originally solely responsible for livestock and agro-resource management, isbeing eroded by modern education for the young and the promulgation of Land Use Acts bythe government. Pointing out the effect of this on conservation effort, he said that, theStrategies for Involving Rural Farmers in Agricultural BiodiversityConservation in Akwa Ibom State, NigeriaCamilus Bassey Ben106weakened position of the elders makes the conservation of agro-resources through theinstitution of sacred groves no longer tenable.Another factor which has tremendous adverse influence on the ability of the rural farmer’sconservation is unattended population growth. Nigerian Environmental Study/Action Team(NEST), (2001) rightly argued that a finite world can support only a finite population. Under agiven socio-economic system and technology, there is an upper limit to the number of peoplewhich land area can support. As long as the number of people is below this critical value theirdemand for agricultural land, grazing land and food at least in theory can be met without theenvironment being degraded or destroyed by population pressure, However, if the criticalpopulation density is exceeded, these human demands translate into excessive pressure onthe land and agro-resource, The partnership between population and the environmentbecomes endangered and may break down as problems of deforestation and loss ofagrobiodiversity Once the population sinks into a miserable state, what was once aharmonious and happy partnership between people and environment can easily become avicious cycle in which environmental degradation makes people desperately poor. Povertyforces people to over-exploit the available agro-resources with disregard to conservation.Population pressure seems to have led to the shortening of fallow periods under the shiftingcultivation, In its traditional form, shifting cultivation is known for a rich source of cropdiversity (BOSTID, 2002) In Nigeria, the whole cycle has less than halved in length and thefallow period is less than a third of what it was (NEST, 2002). The tendency is for thefallowing system to shrink in the end to the point where it is replaced by, crop rotation andmonocropping. In these systems conservation practices are often replaced by quick easyfarming (Thompson, Fenny, &amp; Oakerson , 2006).One of the constraints to the conservation of agrobiodiversity by rural farmers is lack ofeducation. Nigeian Conservation Foundation (NCF), (2005) pointed out that tacklingenvironmental problems (loss of agrobiodiversity inclusive), requires action mostly fromenvironmental education, Noibi (2002) noted that a person’s level of ignorance of theenvironment can be said to be positively related to the degree of damage to theenvironment. He exemplified this by relating a case of farmers who over-graze their land orsubstitute chemical fertilizer for organic manure and pesticides for biological means of pestcontrol without bothering about the implications of that action on land and agrobiodiversity,It could therefore, be inferred that lack of environmental education among the farmers is thesingle greatest contributor that constraints the conservation of agricultural biodiversity byrural farmers. Education can impart knowledge and determination necessary to resolve agiven set of environmental problems.The social and perceptual factors also influence the conservation attitude of the ruralfarmers. According to Kellert (2008), the development of compelling rational and effectivestrategy for protecting endangered agro-species will require an increasing recognition thatJournal of Agriculture and Veterinary Sciences Volume 2, December 2010107most contemporary extinction problems are largely the result of socio-economic and politicalforces. Norton (2008) pointed out that only a small minority of people possess much concernor empathy for the plight of endangered agro-species. Kellen (2008) while reflecting this viewnoted “the study of vanishing biodiversity is necessarily the study of man’s perception ofanimals and plants. What we fear, what we hope and what we admire in animals/plants willinevitably determine their fate. Agro-species are there but most of them figure as villain inour myths”.As Norton intimates, agro-species are viewed somewhat more positively when they possesssome aesthetic and utilitarian values. Human benefit factors include animal capacity toprovide food, clothing, recreation and companionship. Ecological factors include species rarityand its contribution to diversity and ecological balance. Important psychological factorsinclude the animal’s species aesthetic characteristics, spiritual and religious associations,habituating capacity and behavioural plasticity. These factors and values outline theperceptual categories rural farmers typically employ in deciding which species are worthy ofpreservation.Another factor affecting conservation by rural farmers borders on the conservation policiesoperating in the country. NEST (2008) pointed out that one of the biggest bio-resourcesmanagement problem is the absence of well coordinated rational policies and legislationoperating in the country, but such policies have often been implemented without reallyconsidering local socio-economic issues. Also conservation policies tend to be largely“western” in outlook and having been designed and possibly managed by governmentofficials can be poorly adapted to meet vital local needs (Barrow, 2008) He pointed outthat conservation can involve a range of different interests such as central government,state/local government, local farmers, and conservation group/development staff and theremay be conflict of interest between them. He concluded that developing conservation policieswithout taking the needs and demands of these different group’s will tend to end in difficulty.Constraints to the conservation of agrobiodiversity by rural farmers are also associated withculture and religious beliefs. NEST submits that because of the closer relationship betweenculture and the environment, any campaign for environmental awareness and conservationmust take on a new cultural time, calling for new ways of life and a new orientation. Duringpre-colonial times, religious beliefs and practices played important roles in the conservationespecially agrobiodiversity. Sacred grooves and sacred animals were not exploited by peopleand so they remained in their pristine state. However, with the institution of colonialgovernment and the spread of western values and culture, our traditional methods ofconservation gradually disappeared and sacred forests became hunting ground (NEST, 2001).On the adverse effects of religious influence on traditional conservation practices, varioustraditional farmers have developed over the centuries, effective method of using theenvironment sustainably.

Poultry refers to domesticated birds that are reared majorly for meat and egg and sometimes, other by-products. In Agricultural resource management study (ARMS) formally known as farm cost and returns survey (FCRS) poultry include oestriches and other game birds but most operation raise only one specie of poultry for single purpose e.g. farmers keep laying hen  to produce egg for human consumption or for breeding purpose. Some raise starter, pullets and others concentrate on raising chickens or turkey for meet production. (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1954).  <br/>The three most common species of poultry are domesticated fowl, duck and turkey; few breeds of chicken are Andalusian, Orpintons which are made up of white, black and buff orpingtons, leghorns, Plymouth Rock etc. breeds of turkey include Norfolk turkey which is black with spotted white wing, Cambridge turkey, a bronze grey bird larger and leggier than the Norfolk. Breeds of duck; buff orpington duck, pelkin duck also known as the island duck, Australian spotted, American black etc. (Noris 2005). Since domestic fowl accounts for over 90% of the total number of poultry across the globe, more emphasis will be placed on domesticated fowl in the course of this study.<br/>More than 50 billion chickens are reared annually all over the world as a source of food (poultry farming – wikiedia, 2011). This is attributed to the importance of poultry products in terms of its nutritional values such as quality protein, liquids, carbohydrate, multitude of vitamins, minerals, cholesterols and pigments (Izunobi, 2002). Research has shown that in Nigeria poultry as a source of meat supplies about 20% of the total meat needs of the nation. This is grossly inadequate when compared with that in developed countries like America where as at 1915,poultry enterprise was already existing in the yard of many homes of the rural and small town families (U. S. Department of Commerce).<br/>Research has pointed out that in most part of Nigeria, poultry farms operate in a less equipped poultry houses under the care of less competent poultry farmers that are less concerned about the recent technologies that are relevant for the improvement of their poultry management and increasing the yield of their input. This is one of the major reasons why most developed countries in the world produce and consume higher poultry products than Nigeria. In the United States for instance, statistics has it that the estimate of egg consumption is 250 – 300 egg per head per annum, this is in contrast to Nigeria where the estimated egg consumption is 20-25 eggs per head per annum (Oluyemi and Robert, 2000). Therefore, there is urgent need for training poultry farmers in Nigeria as a whole and in Oshimili South Local government Area of delta State in particular in order to make up for this discrepancy. <br/>Training in simple terms refers to the imparting of specific skills, ability and knowledge through appropriate educational methodology to improve performance and efficiency of the trainee. Training is any attempt to improve current or future employee performance by increasing an employee’s ability to perform through learning, usually by changing the employee’s attitude or increasing his or her skills and knowledge. Training needs depends on lack or deficiency in skills. The need for training and development is determined by employee’s performance deficiency computed as follows<br/>Training need = standard performance ­- actual performance. (Human Resources Management,2010). <br/>Training is basically classified into lectures and on-the-job training. Lecture is the kind of training that takes place off-site i.e. in classrooms or lecture halls. It is used because of its low cost and its capacity to reach many people at a time. It is referred to as a one- way training device and it is sometimes criticized as a training device. On-the-job training takes place at the place of primary assignment. It is most time used as a supplement for the off-site training since it is usually impossible to teach someone everything she needs to know at a location off-site.<br/>Since training is so crucial in developing individual’s managerial ability, it may be referred to as the basis of economic development. Going by the quote by Thomas and portal, (1992) which says development is achieved through investing in human capital and raising the productivity capacity of the society, also the economist school of taught who viewed development primarily in terms of a nation’s relative prosperity, it is therefore of great need that the poultry farmers in Oshimili South Local Government Area of Delta State and those in Nigeria as a whole be assessed to determine whether they need training in order to increase their competence for better management of their farms.</p>\n\nMANAGERIAL COMPETENCE AND TRAINING NEEDS OF POULTRY FARMERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MANAGERIAL COMPETENCE AND TRAINING NEEDS OF POULTRY FARMERS", "id": 72}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The study examined the role of extension workers in educating farmers and constraints farmers face in plantain production in some selected areas in Edo State, Nigeria. A total of 120 Plantain farmers were randomly selected from the study area. Farmers were interviewed using well structured questionnaire. Simple descriptive statistics and multiple regression were used to analysis the data collected. The likert scale techniques was used to identify the constraints faced by the farmers, the result revealed that 68.3 percent of the farmers were male while 31.7 percent were female, then 33.2 percent of the farmers with above 61 years of age, also 85.8 percent of the farmers have farm size ranging from 5 to 10 hectare. 52.5 percent of the farmers had annual income ranging from 200,000 to 399,000. While 60.8 percent of the farmers has no form of formal education. 100 percent of the farmers had no contact with extension workers which imply that extension services in the study areas were either low or non-existing. The major constraints the farmers faced were transportation, labour, storage processing, finance, lack of government incentives, low price index, poor knowledge of technology. Based on the study carried out it is recommended that extension services be intensified in the study area, provision of credit facilities to farmers, betterment of framers socio economic status, employment of modern equipment in production e.t.c</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong><br/><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br/><strong>1.1    Background of the Study</strong><br/>Plantain belongs to the family <em>Musacea sp</em> and the genus <em>Musa.</em> It is a perennial herbaceous plant, 2 to 9 meter tall with an underground rhizome or corm. The principal species are <em>Musa paradisca</em> (French plantain) <em>Musa acuminate</em>  and <em>Musa corniculata</em> (Horn Plantain).<br/>The cultivars of plantain are French plantain, French horn plantain, false horn-plantain and horn-plantain. Plantain thrives on a wide range of tropical and sub-tropical climates. It requires an optimum temperature of 300C, mean monthly rainfall of 100mm, pH 4.5 and 7.5 and thrives on sandy loam soils (Faturoti, 2006).<br/>Plantain Originated in South India and moved to South East Africa, from where it spread to Central and West Africa, it is believed to be the oldest cultivated fruit in West Central Africa. Plantain is grown as a staple food in 52 countries and world wide or about 12.5 million acres (Food and Agriculture Organization. Agro stat data base, 2004). World production of plantain was estimated in 1985 at 25 metric tons of this, 19.6 tons was projected for Africa, Latin America was the second place producer at 4.1 million metric tons (IFAD, 2001). Annual production in Nigeria is 1, 855, 000 metric tones (RMDC, 2002).<br/>In Nigeria, the false horned type is the most widely distributed because of its ability to tolerate poor soil condition than others (John &amp; Marehel, 1995). In Nigeria, plantain is produced in large quantities in Edo, Delta, Ogun, and Ondo States. Other producing states are River State, Cross River, Imo, Plateau, Kogi, Abia and Enugu. Plantain cultivation is not limited to big plantation but is often grown in small orchards which sometimes go unnoticed (Jirgi and Baba, 2001).<br/>Agricultural Extension worker plays an important role in educating farmers on plantain production in the selected areas in Edo State because plantain is important in the diet of many Nigerian families, it is normally eaten in convenient form like “dodo” (fried ripe pulp), chip (fried unripe pulp) and as plantain flour (Akinwumi, 1999), this plantain flour has an advantage over other starchy foods because it contain protein, mineral &amp; vitamins. Medicinally plantain can be used to cure some ailment like sore throat, tonsillitis, diarrhea and vomiting, due to its high nutrients, plantain is used in the production of soymusa, which can be used in the treatment of Kwashiorkor (Idachaba, 1995).<br/>In Edo State some agricultural extension activities include the following:</p> <div> <ul><li>getting the farmers into a frame of mind and attitude conducive to acceptance or adoption of technological change. This function is achieved by educating the farmers on newly developed technology and to convince them of the visibility of the new technologies in agriculture.</li> <li>disseminating to the plantain farmers the result of research and to carry the farmer’s problem back to the research system for solution. In order to perform this function properly, effective communication exist among the research institute, the extension agent and the farmers and,</li> <li>helping farmers make wise decision in farm management processes. Extension is a significant tool in assisting the farmers to develop proficiency in the management of his farm and general agricultural advisory services (Agbamu, 2006).</li> </ul></div> <p>Broadly speaking the role of agricultural extension workers call for the unique blend of skills and attitude. They must have the competence to understand and apply technical information related to their work as well as the ability to diagnose problems and come up with possible solutions such as adopting to new innovation practices. They should plan and organized extension activities and willingness to interact with others. The delivery system that matter most in dealing with farmers are the subject matter specialists who will help in assisting the extension agents in educating the farmers. Extension agents are also involved in farm input distribution (e.g.  seed yam, hybrid maize, improved sucker e.t.c.) which invariably increase output and income generation.</p> <p><strong>1.2    Statement of Problem</strong><br/>For the past two decades, the major challenges be deviling developing countries like Nigeria is that of food insufficiency which is dependent on the frequency of extension workers effectiveness. Insufficient education of the farmers involved in plantain production contributes to food production shortage.  <br/>The backdrops of plantain production in agricultural extension are itemized in the following research questions:<br/>a.      What are the social-economic characteristics of plantain farmer in selected Local Government areas in Edo State?<br/>b.      How does farmers get information on plantain technology in the study Areas?<br/>c.       What are types of planting material used by the farmers in the selected local Government Areas in Edo State?<br/>d.      What is the level of adoption of technology in plantain production by the farmers in the study Areas?<br/>e.      What are the possible constraints faced by farmer in plantain production in some selected Local Government Areas?</p> <p><strong>1.3    Objective of the Study</strong><br/>The major objective of this study is to determine the role of agricultural extension workers in educating the farmers in plantain production in the study area.<br/>Specific objective were to:<br/>a.      identify the socio-economic characteristics of farmers in the study areas;<br/>b.      ascertain the source of information on plantain technology to the farmers in selected Local Government Areas in Edo state;<br/>c.       analyze the level of adoption of technology in plantain production by the farmers;<br/>d.      survey the types of planting material used by the farmers and<br/>e.      assess the constraints faced by farmers in plantain production.</p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION WORKERS IN EDUCATING FARMERS IN PLANTAIN PRODUCTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION WORKERS IN EDUCATING FARMERS IN PLANTAIN PRODUCTION", "id": 73}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study examined the effect of rural-urban migration on agricultural production in Ukwuani Local Government Area of Delta State, Nigeria. The specific objectives of the study were to establish the migrational trend in the study area. The study assessed rural farmers and migrants responses to migrational trends, category of migrants, reasons for migration and effects of migration on agriculture Data were obtained from 56 non-migrants and 55 migrants that were purposive sampled. 6 villages in the study area comprised the population and also constitutes the random sample. The instrument used was a structured questionnaire and interview schedule. Data analyzed revealed that in terms of gender, male migrate mostly and the current migrational pattern in the study area is rural-urban migration and rural-rural migration. Result showed an above average response to youths as the category of people that migrates to urban areas while responses to children and aged people were below average.  The category of people that migrates largely influence the effectiveness of agricultural productivity (x2t = 18.14, xi2 = 7.815, df= 3, p = 0.05). There is a significant relationship between socio economic characteristics of migrant and number of people that migrants out of the rural areas at (R2 = 0.74, F obtained = 4..575, DW = 2.03, P = 0.00 &lt;0.005). The results showed that education (0.003) farm size (0.17) household size (.000) are the major determinants of migration while marital status (.334), income (.078) gender (.949) and age (.115) has inverse relationship with migration. The study encourages governmental and non-governmental agency to make the rural areas attractive in order to reduce the stemming out of able bodies people to urban in order to sustain food sufficiency and security by governmental non-governmental agency. Loans should be provided and given to the targeted non-migrant as well as provision of subsidize and appropriate technology, adequate extension service and access to mechanization to reduce drudgery in agricultural sectors. Agricultural planning in the State should be done from a good data base through good and adequate agro-statistics gathering, processing and storage/retrieval, implementation and impact assessments.</p>\n\nEFFECT OF RURAL-URBAN MIGRATION ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF RURAL-URBAN MIGRATION ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION", "id": 74}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p> <p><strong>3.0     Research Methodology</strong><br/><strong>3.1     Study Area</strong><br/>This study will be carried out in Delta State. The state is bless with fertile soil and favourable climate which make it an important producer of food and cash crops. Delta state is an oil production state of Nigeria situated in the region known as the Niger Delta, south -south geopolitical zone with a population of 4,098,291 (Federal Republic of Nigeria official gazette, 2007). The state presented covers a landmass of about 18,050km of which more than 60% is land. The state has approximately between longitude 50.00 and 60.45 east and latitude 50.00 and 60.30 North. It is bounded in the north by Edo state, the east by Anambra State, South-East by Bayelsa. The state has a wide coated belt inter-lace with rivulets, which form part of the Niger Delta. Delta state was curved out of the former Bendel state on August 27th 1991. It consists of twenty-five (25) local government areas groups into three agricultural zones which are; The Delta North, Delta South and Delta Central. The Delta North (Delta Ibo) comprises of Aniocha, Ika, Oshimili, Ukwani, Ndokwa region while Delta South and Delta central are made up of Urhobo, Ijaw, Isoko and Itsekiri. The state enjoys tropical climate with two district seasons. These are the rainy season (April-October) and the dry season (November - March). The rainfall is heaviest in July. The temperature ranges between 200C and 340C with annual rainfall in the coastal areas is about 2557mm and 1905mm in the North.</p> <p>The natural vegetation of the state varies from the mangrove swamps along the coast to every green forest in the fresh water zone and derived savannah in the north. Farming and fishing are the main occupation of the indigenes of the state major food crops and cash crops produce in the state include yam, maize, cassava, plantain, vegetables e.g (green, pumpkin, bitter leaf, saint leaf, water leaf, etc) fruits e.g (orange, banana, mangoes pineapple, pawpaw, guava etc) rubber, oil palm etc. They also engage in livestock farming such as pigs, goats, fisheries, poultry bird etc.</p>\n\nEFFECT OF FOREST RESOURCES EXPLOITATION ON ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF FARMING HOUSEHOLDS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF FOREST RESOURCES EXPLOITATION ON ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF FARMING HOUSEHOLDS", "id": 75}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0  INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1  Background of the Study                                                                                                    </strong></p> <p>Agriculture is one of the most important sector of the Nigerian economy which accounts for about 42% of Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and over 70% of non-oil exports. It provides over 80% of the food needs of the country. About 70% of Nigerians live in rural area, and 90% of these are engaged in agriculture. This implies that agriculture is a key sector that stands to affect majority of Nigerians positively (Okolo, 2004). Despite its high contribution to the overall economy, this sector has been seriously facing challenges of many factors of which climate-related disasters such as drought and floods are the major ones (Deressa, 2008). According to Udofia (2001), the frightening effects of climate variability on the entire environment has reached a global dimension. Although its effects and the ecological and economic consequences are well perceived, they appear not to have been given the serious attention they deserve.</p> <p>Climate is defined as the statistical description interms of mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30yrs as defined by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO, 1992).These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. The difference between climate and weather is that climate is what you expect while weather is what you get. The term climate variability denotes the natural characteristics of climate that manifests itself within the changes of climate with regards to time. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2001) defines climate variability as “variations in the mean state and other statistics (such as standard deviations, the occurrence of extremes, etc.) of the climate on all temporal and spatial scales beyond that ofindividual weather events”. This definition allows the consideration of climate change as a low frequency component of climate variability that can be managed using the same quantitative tools and research approaches (Mertz and Stone, 2003). Climate variation can enhance or diminish a local area’s comparative advantage in agriculture.</p> <p>Changes in soil water availability, the increased occurrence of climate fluctuation, climate extremes and crop diseases, could lead to an overall reduction in crop yield and serious food shortage. Projections suggest that by the end of the 21stcentury, climate variability would have had substantial impact on crop production (Slater et al 2007). Humanity cannot accurately predict what the next season will bring but farmers, input suppliers, marketers and government would all like to know because it is critical to decision making. Climate variability has created uncertainties in temperature, rainfall and wind patterns. As a result, rural people in countries like Nigeria whose main occupation or economic activity is agriculture, are faced with so many challenges in decision making with respect to their agricultural activities ( Barnwal and Kotani, 2010).</p> <p> Climate variability adaptation methods according to Nyong, Adesina and Osman-Elasha (2007) are those strategies that enable the individual or the community to cope with or adjust to the impacts of the change in climate. Although, Zeirvogel et al (2008) had noted that the world has been undergoing series of adaptation in response to climate variability; the current climate change is expected to present heightened risk, new combinations of risks and potentially grave consequences. As such, adaptation has been identified as a policy option to mitigate the adverse effects of climate variability on farm productivity.  In agriculture, adaptation helps farmers achieve their food, income and livelihood security objectives in the face of changing climatic and socio-economic conditions including climatic variability, extreme weather conditions such as droughts, floods and volatile short term changes in local and large scale markets (Kandlinkar and Risbey, 2000). </p> <p> Agricultural adaptation has been described as one of the policy tools to ameliorate the ravaging effects of climate variability ( Kurukulasuriya and Mendelsohn, 2008). Mendelsohn and Dinar reported in 1999 that from farm level analysis, large reductions in adverse impacts from climate variability are possible when adaptation is fully implemented (FAO, 2007). Some adaptation strategies for crop production among farmers include adoption of efficient environmental resources management practices such as the planting of early maturing crops, mulching, small scale irrigation, adoption of hardy varieties of crops, tree planting and staking to avoid heat burns (Nyong, et al, 2007). There are lots of challenges facing agricultural adaptation in Nigeria. According to Nzeh and Eboh (2011) lack of awareness and knowledge on climate variability is perhaps the biggest obstacle to effective agricultural adaptation. Onyeneke and Madukwe (2010) also opined other barriers to include lack of information on appropriate adaptation option, poor access to market and shortage of farm labour.</p> <p>Apata et al (2010) reported that capital, land and labour serve as important factors for coping with adaptation, stressing that the lack of these factors as well as choice of suitable adaptive measures constitute severe challenge to agricultural adaptation. This is consistent with Deressa et al (2008) report that adaptation to climate variability is costly, and the need for intensive labour use exacerbate this cost. This therefore calls for development of various adaptation strategies in order to cope with the variability in climate. Such strategies focus on managing risks, reducing vulnerability, enhancing agricultural productivity, protecting the environment and ensuring sustainable development under the changing climate.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Recent studies confirm that Africa is one of the most vulnerable continents to climate variability and change and low adaptive capacity. Some adaptation to current climate variability has been taking place; however, this may be insufficient for future changes in climate (IPCC, 2007).  The uncertainty associated with climate variability is a disincentive to investment and adoption of agricultural technologies and market opportunities, prompting the risk-averse farmer to favour precautionary strategies that buffer against climatic change, particularly as a result of increased variability and extreme over activities that are more profitable on average (Barrett et al, 2007). It has been predicted that many farmers in Africa are likely to experience net revenue losses as a result of climate change, particularly as a result of increased variability and extreme events (TerrAfrica, 2009). </p> <p>The adverse consequences of climate variability includes damage on arable lands, livelihoods and biodiversity will take an irreplaceable toll on food production in developing countries like Nigeria which have a low capacity to cope and adapt to these challenges (Sha, Fischer van Velthuizen, 2009). Given the foregoing challenges a study of this nature will be a timely intervention. Many studies have been carried out in addressing the effects of climate variability on agriculture in Nigeria. However, not many of these studies have fully addressed the issues of adaptation strategies.  Enete and Amusa (2011) discussed the challenges of agricultural adaptation to climate change in Nigeria, but the study was based on review of relevant literature thus leaving a gap for more empirical approach to the study of this issue.Enete and Amusa (2011) in another paper made further attempts to investigate the most cost-effective and sustainable indigenous climate change adaptation practices in South East Nigeria but studies covering wider area such as Nigerian agro-climatic zones and several arable crops simultaneously appear not to have been documented yet.</p> <p>Umoh and Eketekpe (2010) attempted to study climate change adaptation measures by wetland farmers in Niger Delta region of Nigeria but did not study any other State beyond Bayelsa out of the nine States in the Niger Delta. The study focused only on a single Local Government Area. The study of Emaziye (2013) was based on perceptions of climate change among rural farming households in the Niger Delta area of Nigeria in other todetermine the direction of change of the climate change indicators thus leaving a gap for empirical studies on adaptation especially in Delta State where little or no work on adaptation strategies has been done.  Previous studies showed that the dimensions of use of these measures have not been effectively explored particularly in Delta State. This is considered important, considering the fact that farmers least able to adapt to climate variability will suffer most severely.</p> <p>In the light of this, this study has addressed the following research questions:</p> <p>What are the socio-economic characteristics of crop farmers?</p> <p>What is the perception of crop farmer’s about climate variability?</p> <p>What are the adaptation strategies adopted by farmers to mitigate the effects of climate variability?</p> <p>What socioeconomic and environmental factors influence farmers’ choice of adaptation strategies?</p> <p>What factors constrain farmers in adapting to the effects of climate variability?</p> <p><strong>1.3  </strong><strong>            Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study was to determine the Adaptation strategies to climate variability by arable crop farmers in Delta State.

Recent trends all over the world, point to a decline in landing from capture fisheries, an indicator that fish stocks have approached or even exceeded the point of maximum sustainable yield. Aquaculture therefore remains the only viable alternative for increasing fish production in order to meet the protein need of the people. Catfishes of the family Claridae comprise the most commonly cultivated fishes in Nigeria. The growth of aquaculture in Nigeria now is largely being boosted by a steady rise in catfish culture. Inadequate availability of seed for stocking and feed used to be major problems. Tremendous progress is now being made. The total value of the industry today is US$800 from the value of fingerlings, feed and farmed fish. Since the culture of Clarias gariepinus through hypophysation was initiated in Western Nigeria in 1973, the procedure has been widely practiced throughout Nigeria thus leading to increase of farm-raised catfishes from the 80’s to date. The favoured  catfish species in Nigeria aquaculture include:  gariepinus, Heterobranchus bidorsalis, Clarias,  Heterobranchus hybrid (Heteroclarias) and Clarias, nigrodigitatus. Heterobranchus sp. is the more commonly cultured fish in the south eastern parts of Nigeria. African catfish is popular in the market and has great potentials to boost the rapidly growing Nigerian aquaculture.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Fish farming has not been fully explored as a strategy to reduce poverty levels despite its potential to improve livelihoods in rural communities. Low productivity, prohibitive establishment costs, high farm-level losses and inefficient marketing often pose a problem.</p> <p>The low level of productivity results from lack of appropriate production knowledge and skills, suboptimal stocking and/or overstocking, poor fish  population control methods and inadequate feeding due to costly feeds.</p> <p>Complications arise from high capital requirements for establishing a fish  farm, especially for excavation, stocking of fingerlings and installation of protective chain link. The losses at farm-level arise from predators such as snakes, monitor lizards and birds, and from improper harvesting and post-harvest techniques. Inefficient marketing results from a lack of farmers  ability to integrate production and marketing activities.</p> <p>It is therefore imperative that youth and farmers are supported to initiate fish farming using the fish farm approach through provision of startup fingerlings and other technical inputs for developing business plans.<br/>Objectives<br/><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <ol><li>To promote <strong>fish</strong>-farming in Nigeria and contribute to increased household incomes</li> <li>To facilitate the development of fish farm project into a modern  fish farm project in Edo State. <ol><li>To highlight the problem associated with small scale fish farm in Oredo.</li> <li>Make some recommendation on how these problems could be solved so that fish production could be more profitable.</li> <li>To provide a basic for future research on this topic and will also be useful to students who have interest in small scale poultry business.</li> </ol></li> </ol> <p><strong>SOGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <ol><li>On completion of this study.

Okonjo-Iweala (2014) noted that Nigeria is one of the five countries in which two-thirds of the world’s extreme poor are concentrated; the others are India, China, Bangladesh, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The poverty in Nigeria is largely rural (poverties.org, 2013) where the effects of macro-economic shocks in terms of fiscal adjustment and monetary policy reforms are felt much more. Thus, whereas poverty is expected to decline by 40% in the urban centers, it would increase by 7% in rural areas which inhabit almost 80% of the population living below the poverty line and depend on agriculture for food and income (International Fund for Agricultural Development, IFAD, 2009). Consistent economic growth and prosperity are central to poverty alleviation and the oil palm industry has been identified as one effective avenue for rural income generation, especially among the women who process and sell palm oil in local and national markets, food security and economic stability (Partnership Initiatives in the Niger Delta, PIND, 2011).</p> <p>A huge percentage of farmers in Nigeria are small scale farmers. Small-scale farming involves growing crops, at least in part, to be used by an individual family, with farming being a significant source of their livelihoods (Lininger, nd.)Small Scale farming is usually characterized by intensive labour and in most cases, animal traction, limited use of agrochemicals and supply to the local or surrounding markets. Unlike large-scale commercial agriculture, it plays a dual role of being a source of household food security as well as income from sale of surplus. Although some claim small-scale agriculture is less efficient in output as compared to commercial agriculture (Kirsten &amp; Van Zyl, 1998), it is ecologically friendly in that less land is cleared for cultivation, there are less emissions due to less use of fuel-driven machinery and the market is usually local implying less carbon miles (Kutya, 2012).</p> <p>The oil palm (Elaeisguineensis) is the dominant source of vegetable oil consumed in the world (USDA, 2006), in the form of palmoil (mesocarp oil) and kernel oil (seed oil). Palm oil is the main edible vegetable oil produced and consumed in Nigeria where the oil palm tree features regularly in the natural vegetation of the lowland humid to sub-humid areas in a belt that covers almost 24 million hectares (ha) (Opeke, 2003). Dispersed smallholders harvest fruits from the wild/semi-wild palms and process them to produce 80% of the palm oil output and through which Nigeria accounted for 43% of global palm oil production up till the mid-1960s. The performance has declined such that the annual output at 850,000 metric tonnes (MT) leaves an overall supply gap of 0.5 million MT currently met through imports (Omoti, 2001).</p> <p>Palm oil production starts with the oil palm trees whose cultivation has formed the farming culture and a means of livelihood for millions of families in the rural landscape. Palm oil production is a major vocation which has played significant roles in poverty alleviation in some countries, especially in Malaysia and Indonesia (BusinessDay, 2013). The huge potentials for generating rural income and providing employment have enabled the poor to be part of the solution to the scourge of widespread poverty.AkwaIbom State which has been listed among civil service state in Nigeria is also one of the 24 palm oil-producing states. This implies that the potentials in palm oil production to transform the lives of the small-scale farmers in the rural sector of AkwaIbomState need to be harnessed. This study was carried out to evaluate the impact of the distribution and utilization of oil palm industry to the socio-economic development of the rural inhabitants of Oruk Anam LGA.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Price of palm oil is largely affected by production or output of the palm oil within the year and general inflation (Fly, 2003). Past policies have aimed at increasing agricultural productivity through increased investment in agronomic and production system research. The discovery of petroleum in the late 50’s and its exploitation and export in the early 70’s changed the economic scenario in favour of oil as the chief revenue earner for the nation. The global economic recession of the mid-80’s however exposed the inherent structural weakness of import substitution as a strategy for industrialization. With the coming of the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) in 1986 and the concomitant devaluation of the naira, Nigeria manufacturers found it’s difficult to import the needed raw materials and machinery to produced profitable policy formulation has failed to take cognizance of the fact that production and marking constitute a continuum and that the absence of the development in one retards progress in the other (Olayemi, 1972).It in view of this that the researcher intends to investigate the impact of the distribution and utilization of oil palm on the socio-economic development in Oruk Anam LGA.</p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study is to investigate the impact of distribution and utilization of oil palm on the socio-economic development of Oruk Anam LGA  ofAkwaIbom State. But to aid the completion of the study, specific objective includes:</p> <p>i)             To investigate the impact of oil palm distribution on the socio-economic development of Oruk Anam</p> <p>ii)           To ascertain the role of oil palm distribution on the socio-economic development of Nigeria.</p> <p>iii)          To evaluate the benefit of oil palm production on the economic development of Nigeria</p> <p>iv)         To ascertain the role of government in aiding effective production and distribution of oil palm in Oruk Anam LGA</p> <p><strong>1.4      </strong><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>To aid the completion of the study, the following research hypotheses were formulated by the researcher</p> <p><strong>H0:</strong>oil palm distribution does not play any significant role on the socio-economic development of Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>H1:</strong>oil palm distribution does play a significant role on the socio-economic development of Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>H02: </strong>government does not play any role in aiding effective production and distribution of oil palm in Oruk Anam LGA.</p> <p><strong>H2:</strong>government does play a significant role in aiding effective production and distribution of oil palm in Oruk Anam LGA</p> <p><strong>1.5      </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is believed that at the completion of the study, the findings will be of great importance to the rural farmers as the study seek to help them explore the benefit of oil palm production and distribution to the farmers, government, consumers and the general public. The study will also be of great importance to the government as the study seek to explore tha untapped potentials of oil palm production in Oruk Anam LGA and its contribution to economic growth. The study will also be of great importance to researcher who wants to embark on research on similar topic as the findings will serve as a reference point to them. Finally the study will be of great importance to the academia and the general public as the study will add to the pool of knowledge.</p> <p><strong>1.6      </strong><strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of the study covers the impact of the distribution and utilization of oil palm on the socio-economic development of Oruk Anam LGA of AkwaIbom state.

A total of 120 Plantain farmers were randomly selected from the study area. Farmers were interviewed using well structured questionnaire. Simple descriptive statistics and multiple regression were used to analysis the data collected. The likert scale techniques was used to identify the constraints faced by the farmers, the result revealed that 68.3 percent of the farmers were male while 31.7 percent were female, then 33.2 percent of the farmers with above 61 years of age, also 85.8 percent of the farmers have farm size ranging from 5 to 10 hectare. 52.5 percent of the farmers had annual income ranging from 200,000 to 399,000. While 60.8 percent of the farmers has no form of formal education. 100 percent of the farmers had no contact with extension workers which imply that extension services in the study areas were either low or non-existing. The major constraints the farmers faced were transportation, labour, storage processing, finance, lack of government incentives, low price index, poor knowledge of technology. Based on the study carried out it is recommended that extension services be intensified in the study area, provision of credit facilities to farmers, betterment of framers socio economic status, employment of modern equipment in production e.t.c</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong><br/><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br/><strong>1.1    Background of the Study</strong><br/>Plantain belongs to the family <em>Musacea sp</em> and the genus <em>Musa.</em> It is a perennial herbaceous plant, 2 to 9 meter tall with an underground rhizome or corm. The principal species are <em>Musa paradisca</em> (French plantain) <em>Musa acuminate</em>  and <em>Musa corniculata</em> (Horn Plantain).<br/>The cultivars of plantain are French plantain, French horn plantain, false horn-plantain and horn-plantain. Plantain thrives on a wide range of tropical and sub-tropical climates. It requires an optimum temperature of 300C, mean monthly rainfall of 100mm, pH 4.5 and 7.5 and thrives on sandy loam soils (Faturoti, 2006).<br/>Plantain Originated in South India and moved to South East Africa, from where it spread to Central and West Africa, it is believed to be the oldest cultivated fruit in West Central Africa. Plantain is grown as a staple food in 52 countries and world wide or about 12.5 million acres (Food and Agriculture Organization. Agro stat data base, 2004). World production of plantain was estimated in 1985 at 25 metric tons of this, 19.6 tons was projected for Africa, Latin America was the second place producer at 4.1 million metric tons (IFAD, 2001). Annual production in Nigeria is 1, 855, 000 metric tones (RMDC, 2002).<br/>In Nigeria, the false horned type is the most widely distributed because of its ability to tolerate poor soil condition than others (John &amp; Marehel, 1995). In Nigeria, plantain is produced in large quantities in Edo, Delta, Ogun, and Ondo States. Other producing states are River State, Cross River, Imo, Plateau, Kogi, Abia and Enugu. Plantain cultivation is not limited to big plantation but is often grown in small orchards which sometimes go unnoticed (Jirgi and Baba, 2001).<br/>Agricultural Extension worker plays an important role in educating farmers on plantain production in the selected areas in Edo State because plantain is important in the diet of many Nigerian families, it is normally eaten in convenient form like “dodo” (fried ripe pulp), chip (fried unripe pulp) and as plantain flour (Akinwumi, 1999), this plantain flour has an advantage over other starchy foods because it contain protein, mineral &amp; vitamins. Medicinally plantain can be used to cure some ailment like sore throat, tonsillitis, diarrhea and vomiting, due to its high nutrients, plantain is used in the production of soymusa, which can be used in the treatment of Kwashiorkor (Idachaba, 1995).<br/>In Edo State some agricultural extension activities include the following:</p> <div> <ul><li>getting the farmers into a frame of mind and attitude conducive to acceptance or adoption of technological change. This function is achieved by educating the farmers on newly developed technology and to convince them of the visibility of the new technologies in agriculture.</li> <li>disseminating to the plantain farmers the result of research and to carry the farmer’s problem back to the research system for solution. In order to perform this function properly, effective communication exist among the research institute, the extension agent and the farmers and,</li> <li>helping farmers make wise decision in farm management processes. Extension is a significant tool in assisting the farmers to develop proficiency in the management of his farm and general agricultural advisory services (Agbamu, 2006).</li> </ul></div> <p>Broadly speaking the role of agricultural extension workers call for the unique blend of skills and attitude. They must have the competence to understand and apply technical information related to their work as well as the ability to diagnose problems and come up with possible solutions such as adopting to new innovation practices. They should plan and organized extension activities and willingness to interact with others. The delivery system that matter most in dealing with farmers are the subject matter specialists who will help in assisting the extension agents in educating the farmers. Extension agents are also involved in farm input distribution (e.g.  seed yam, hybrid maize, improved sucker e.t.c.) which invariably increase output and income generation.</p> <p><strong>1.2    Statement of Problem</strong><br/>For the past two decades, the major challenges be deviling developing countries like Nigeria is that of food insufficiency which is dependent on the frequency of extension workers effectiveness. Insufficient education of the farmers involved in plantain production contributes to food production shortage.  <br/>The backdrops of plantain production in agricultural extension are itemized in the following research questions:<br/>a.      What are the social-economic characteristics of plantain farmer in selected Local Government areas in Edo State?<br/>b.      How does farmers get information on plantain technology in the study Areas?<br/>c.       What are types of planting material used by the farmers in the selected local Government Areas in Edo State?<br/>d.      What is the level of adoption of technology in plantain production by the farmers in the study Areas?<br/>e.      What are the possible constraints faced by farmer in plantain production in some selected Local Government Areas?</p> <p><strong>1.3    Objective of the Study</strong><br/>The major objective of this study is to determine the role of agricultural extension workers in educating the farmers in plantain production in the study area.<br/>Specific objective were to:<br/>a.      identify the socio-economic characteristics of farmers in the study areas;<br/>b.      ascertain the source of information on plantain technology to the farmers in selected Local Government Areas in Edo state;<br/>c.       analyze the level of adoption of technology in plantain production by the farmers;<br/>d.      survey the types of planting material used by the farmers and<br/>e.      assess the constraints faced by farmers in plantain production.</p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION WORKER IN EDUCATING FARMERS IN PLANTAIN PRODUCTION IN SELECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION WORKER IN EDUCATING FARMERS IN PLANTAIN PRODUCTION IN SELECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS", "id": 79}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>C<strong>HAPTER ONE</strong></p> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <p><strong>1.1     Background of the study</strong><br/>Fluted pumpkin is a very important vegetable that is popular in West Africa. It belongs to the family <em>Telfaria Occidentalis Hook F. cucurbitaceae</em>. It is a leafy vegetable that produces fruits. (Enabulele and Uavbarhe,  2001). Tindall, (1989) defined leafy vegetables as herbaceous plants used for culinary purposes. They are used to increase the dietary quality of soups. The fruit on full maturity has a weight of 10kg. and an appearance of 10 distinctive longitudinal ribs on the surface. It is popular in West Africa. The edible part of this vegetable are the large red seeds, leaves and young shoots used for traditional soup. Protein rich seed can be roasted or grounded for use in porridge. The flesh of the fruit has good oil content which can be used as cooking oil. Although fluted pumpkin is a minor oil crop it possesses healing properties that have been found effective in boosting blood levels and also in maintaining bone mineral density in older men when more of the seeds are consumed. It’s important role in ensuring food security for the populace has not been overlooked by the present administration through the 7 point agenda. Fluted pumpkin consumption has improved over the years and it is an important component of the daily diets of Nigerians (Okoli and Mgbeogu, 1983). Due it’s hypolipidemic action, it lowers blood cholesterol and thus protects from a large range of associated complications like cardiac problems, hypertension and diabetes Margret, (2011).</p> <p>The joint FAO/WHO 2003 consultation on diet, nutrition and prevention of chronic disease recommended a minimum intake of 400g of leafy vegetables which helps in preventing and managing of nutritional and also health related diseases that are rampant in rural areas. According to Chweya and Denton (2000) the nutritional contribution of fluted pumpkin is essential for good health and growth among lactating mothers. The seed of fluted pumpkin contains essential nutrients in significant amounts which can supplement other foods (Christian and Ejeafehe, 2007). It has been shown that adding fluted pumpkin seeds to diet compares favourably with conventional drugs in reducing inflammatory symptoms of arthritis (Doan, 2008).</p> <p>According to Koomolafe (1978), the uses of vegetables include:<br/>Practical study of crop plants in school gardens, good sources of food, reasonable income by selling the vegetables.<br/>Other uses of vegetables have emerged due to recent studies. They include:</p> <div> <ol><li>Medicinal value of some vegetables compare favourably with conventional drugs.</li> <li>Planted as cover crops that helps prevent and reduce soil erosion and leaching and also they out compete weeds (reducing the need for pesticides)</li> <li>Mitigate global warming by carbon sequestration.</li> <li>Vegetables have deep and extensive root system that can hold soil to capture dissolved nitrogen before it can contaminate ground and surface water.</li> </ol></div> <p>Apart from fluted pumpkin, other vegetables produced in Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta State include water leaf, bitter leaf, green <br/>leaf <em>(African spinach</em>), Okro, pepper etc. Fluted pumpkin producers in the study area are faced with challenges of seedbed preparation, seedlings, pest management, fertilization, harvesting, transportation, processing and marketing as other farmers.( Awerosuo, 2008).</p> <p>The problem assumes more importance as vegetables compete for the scarce farm resources including land, labour and capital. It is therefore necessary to examine and evaluate the economics of fluted pumpkin production in view of the resources constraints by farmers.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the Problem.</strong><br/>It is estimated that over 90% of the total land cultivated in Nigeria is in the hands of small scale farmers who also account for up to 90% of the total agricultural output (Onokerhoraye, 1995). In Nigeria, the output of fluted pumpkin has not been able to meet the demand for human food not to mention that for livestock feed, as a result of the growing need of vegetables thus the task of producing enough fluted pumpkin pose on increasing challenge (Ojo, 2002).</p> <p>In most rural communities of Ughelli North Local Government Area where this study is based, traditional agriculture prevails and farming is seen as a way of life rather than a business venture and often these farmers have no knowledge of advanced management techniques, they do not keep proper farm records and depend mainly on family labour. They are also faced with problems like pest and disease attack, high cost of agro-chemical, poor market structure, poor storage facilities, inadequate credit facilities, bad roads, high cost of hired labour, poor infrastructure/transport and land tenure systems problems.</p> <p>Fluted pumpkin is highly seasonal and the commodity itself is perishable and costly to store.

The study used endogenous components of Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme (ACGS) loans to Individual Farmers (LIF), loans to Informal Group (LIG), loans to Co-operative (LCO), and loans to Company (LCY) as explanatory variables to capture agricultural financing. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at constant prices was used to proxy economic growth. Data for the study were obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) statistical bulletin of various publications, and regression analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS statistics. The t-test coefficients which attests to the significance of each of the independent variables of the study reveals that three of the parameters of the explanatory variables; ACGS loans to Informal Groups (LIG), ACGS loans to Cooperatives (LCO) and ACGS loans to Companies (LCY) counter apriori expectation with negative signs respectively. This implies that they do not have significant impact on economic growth (GDP). On the other hand, the variable of ACGS loans to individual farmers (LIF) as revealed by the regression result proved to have significant impact on economic growth (GDP). This indication is as a result of the variable’s conformity to the aprori expectation with positive sign in the analysis. It was recommended that more loanable funds should be made available to individual farmers (for commercial purposes), as ACGS loans to individual farmers can be used to formulate policies that can impact significantly on economic growth (GDP) in Nigeria. Further recommendation made was that, all economic stakeholders, monetary and regulatory authorities; both at the public and private sector of the economy should combine efforts and formulate policies aimed at improving financial inter-mediation, in the area of providing  adequate credit to farmers in Nigeria. This will eventually lead to the achievement of a favourable productive-based economy and viable growth of GDP in the country. The study has contributed to the body of knowledge by providing current information on agricultural financing vis-à-vis Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme (ACGS), with an extensive period of 1981 to 2014 (34 years). This study thus has implications for global economy particularly in the area of food production and living standard of nations.</p> <p> CHAPTER ONE  INTRODUCTION 1.1     Background to the Study </p> <p>Finance for agricultural development has an increasing role in contemporary times. Finance affects economic growth, stagnation or even decline in any economic system. However, a growing concern has developed over time regarding the need for effective access to credit facilities for farming purposes. The Nigerian government recognizes that finance is an essential tool for promoting agricultural development because the agriculture sector is one of its main sources of sustainability. Access to finance for agriculture is an incentive for increasing the agricultural sector’s performance; it stimulates productive growth, and supports the survival of small and new enterprises. Access to finance increases the average inputs of labour and capital which has positive effects on production output. Irrespective of the benefits that can be derived from financing agriculture, there is an inherent risk of loan defaults amongst farmers, which discourages banks from lending to farmers.</p> <p>According to Beck and Demirguc-Kunt (2006), specific financing tools can be useful in facilitating greater access to finance. The government of Nigeria, being fully aware of the need for progressive policies, has introduced various initiatives and policies dating back to the 1970s to attract finance to enhance agriculture productions. Such policies have mainly been in the form of specialized agriculture lending, the supply of credit finance by the commercial banks in favour of the agriculture sector and through various programmes. While some of these efforts have failed, the operation of the remaining leaves one to wonder if they are actually achieving their intended objectives as rural poverty is on the increase and yet a large portion of the population is engaged in agricultural activities.</p> <p>The problem of access to finance for agriculture is not solely as a result of non availability of finance but it is caused by the reluctance of credit providers to give out loans without a certainty of recovering the loan. However, the banks are not to be blamed as they are not charity organizations who disburse money without recourse to repayment; rather they are in business to make profit from their lending operations. Unfortunately, the situation makes farmers a neglected group in the economy because they are not able to provide the adequate collateral needed to secure bank loans. Because of the challenges facing farmers, which have adverse effects on agricultural production, the government thought it fit to act as an intermediary through the Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme (ACGS) whereby the government stands as a guarantor for agricultural loans in order to mitigate the risk involved in agricultural financing.</p> <p>Agriculture contributes immensely to the Nigerian economy in many ways, namely; in the provision of food for the increasing population; supply of adequate raw materials to a growing industrial sector, a major source of employment generation, foreign exchange earnings; and provision of a market for the products of the industrial sector (Food Agricultural Organization, 2006). The agrarian sector has a strong rural base; hence, generation concern for agriculture and rural development. Support for agriculture is widely driven by both government and the public sector, which has established an institutional support in the form of agricultural research, extension, commodity marketing, input supply, and land use legislation to fast-track development of agriculture and rural economic empowerment. Central Bank of Nigeria (2010) asserts that over the years, the inability of this sector to expand and as well contribute meaningfully to the growth of Nigerian economy was due to inadequate financing to improve on the situation; that is, facilitating agricultural credit). Also, the problem of agricultural development in Nigeria indicates that efforts directed at achieving expanded economic base in the rural farmers were frustrated by the scarcity of, and restrictive access to loanable fund. One of the reasons for the decline in the contribution of agriculture to the economy is lack of formal credit policy and paucity of credit institutions which can assist farmers</p> <p>The role of financial capital as a factor of production to facilitate economic growth and development as well as the need to appropriately channel credit to rural areas for economic development of the poor rural farmers cannot be over emphasized. Credit is viewed as more than just another resource such as labour, land, equipment and raw materials (Rhaji, 2008). According to Shepherd (2002), credit determines access to all the resources on which farmers depend. Since banking cannot be separated from economic development, the banks (especially Deposit Money Banks) in the banking industry have been instrumental to various development schemes of Nigeria over the years. However, their performance in the facilitation of agricultural finance has not been adequately felt in the Nigerian economy; especially in the rural areas (farmers).</p> <p>Also, in line with Nigeria’s quest for development; the erratic nature of events within the banking industry vis-à-vis agricultural financing is a cause for concern. This uncertain nature of access to credit by farmers in the agricultural sector could result to total loss of confidence in banks by citizens in the sector, as well as growth impediment in the overall economy of Nigeria. Questions are been asked concerning the role of agricultural financing, its contribution to the attainment of agricultural growth and development. It is therefore pertinent to empirically analyze agricultural financing and its economic implication (impact) on Nigeria with the aim of identifying measures to tackle the existing challenges and rebuild the lost glory of the agricultural sector.</p>\n\nAGRICULTURAL FINANCING AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AGRICULTURAL FINANCING AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA", "id": 81}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>A<strong>BSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This research work problem into the place of impact of road network in the selling of agricultural products in Nigeria Anambra State.

Most of the food produced cannot get to the market due to the acute road network difficulties that will serve the food industry. Food production therefore depend upon road network for the creation and preservation of their values. The effect and the importance of road was critically investigated in this study with a particular product in Njikoka Anambra State Nigeria.</p> <p>         Food production is one of the priority facing most of the world’s people today. It is also a problem that may worsen rapidly in the years ahead.</p> <p>         According to the Food Agricultural Organization (FAO), food production of the developing countries will increase by a staggering 125% by 2010. On the other hand, problems relating to rural penetration have contributed to wooing the world and particular Nigeria Agriculture.</p> <p>         It is because of the above problems that the government must intensify efforts to improve the road networks especially in the rural areas.</p> <p>Collection and individual efforts should be directed towards fighting a war against hunger and the provision of road network to allocate the agricultural products. Investment decision in agricultural policy can help to ensure supply of additional food and its distribution to consumers.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>         Since the early years of man, agriculture and road network have always co-existed together due to the source of food and other economics products must be accessible for the collection distribution to market port and factories.</p> <p>It is important that adequate and effective road network should be introduced or encouraged to achieve the modern food selling system objectives. Transportation is therefore to serve as a means of marketing goods. In Njikoka Anambra State, most of the network do not pass within the agricultural areas and thereby hinder agricultural progress. In some rural areas, most of the road network which passes through agricultural areas from farm to the market places is often too bad all the years for easy transportation. Most of these feeders road networks are interfaced narrow, poorly drained that they prevent easy access to the interlard where the majority of the farmers are located.</p> <p>         There are also the problems of maintenance, adequate executive capacity suitable materials and management where the road networks are in fair conditions.</p> <p>         Beside the poor condition of the feeder road network delay in transport, bad loading and offloading and rough handling goods result to great damages spoilage and deterioration of products.</p> <p>          Poor road network also has the additional effect of preaching from the specializing in the corps that offer attempt to keep his family supplied with all their needs and therefore retains food than he adequately needs. This is because if he runs shortage, it will be difficult to tap other resources and this entails. Higher cost as a result of road network. It often poses a problem because urban dwellers will be faced with shortage of food staff and other essential goods manufactured from agricultural materials these problems will hinder the ability to import system of land use for agricultural production.</p> <p>         If agriculture is to respond to the growing demand then it will be necessary to involve a good progressive rural structure with rural roads to quicken and reduce the cost of the flow of agricultural commodities, information and ball sort of rural services to enable contribute meaningfully to generate growth.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>         The general objective of this study is to determine the impact of road network on the selling of agricultural products in Anambra State.

In nearly all African countries, poultry production in rural areas is predominantly based on a free-range system utilizing indigenous types of fowl, (Kitalyi, 1998; Horst, 1988). The system is characterized with family ownership of the birds. Then birds are then left to scavenge to meet their nutritional needs. The feed resources vary depending on local conditions and the farming system. Housing may or may not be provided, (Huchzermeyer, 1973; Atunbi and Sonaiya, 1994; Kuit, Traore and Wilson, 1986). Where housing is provided, usually local materials are used for construction. Low productivity is the main feature of this production system, which can be attributed to low genetic potential, poor disease control programmes and poor feeding. Recently, the highly infectious Newcastle disease (NCD) is reported to have caused 100 percent mortality. And it has been identified as a major poultry production constraint in the village chicken production systems of many African Countries (Chabeuf, 1990; Olayiwole, 1984; Achiempong, 1992).Livestock husbandry activities are minimal with some roles played by gender .The health of the birds is not guaranteed because; there are little to no disease control programmes such as vaccination of the birds at various stages and ages. The birds are exposed to many disease conditions at various seasons of the year .In most cases indigenous knowledge are used to treat/handle the poultry (Ugwu,et al., 2009).</p> <p>Disease like Newcastle and parasitic infection have been reported to be the most devastating and prevalent poultry disease in many developing countries especially in Africa, (Chabeuf, 1990; Chrysostome,1995; Bell, Kane and Le Jan, 1995). Parasites are also prevalent due to favourable environmental conditions, (Zaria, et al. 1993). In spite of low-input by rural poultry farmers in developing countries on poultry production, free-range birds play many socio-economic roles. In Africa, they constituted over 50 percent of the total poultry population and contributed 30 to 80 percent of total national poultry products (Sonaiya, 1990). Estimates based on human and livestock population in Ethiopia showed that the village chicken provides 125kg of poultry meat per capital per year, whereas, cattle provides 5.23kg, (Forsiddo, 1986).</p> <p>In Africa, mortality of indigenous chickens under free-range system was very high due to diseases, poor management, poor breeding system and malnutrition, (Dipleolu, Keripe, Gbadamosi, and Gbadamosi, 1998). Also, some diseases can appear more prevalent and devastating at certain seasons of the year. Newcastle disease and other respiratory diseases become more prevalent in the dry season while parasitic infections appear more during the rainy seasons.</p> <p>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM                    </p> <p>The prevention and management of diseases outbreak and the systems of poultry management in Sierra Leone remains the major challenge to the maximization of profits and other benefits that could be realized from poultry.</p> <p>1.3       AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Poor management system of poultry production and ineffective diseases prevention and control has been identified as a major constraint militating against the survivability of poultry enterprise in Sierra Leone in general and the rural set-up in particular. The poor management of the enterprise greatly favoured other seasonally-dependent poultry diseases that constitute a major threat to poultry business and its profitability.</p> <p>Thus, the objectives of the study were to:</p> <p>(a)  Identify the common system of poultry in Sierra Leone</p> <p>(b) Identify the pattern of disease outbreak and possible causes in the systems of poultry management identified</p> <p>(c)  To access the consequences in the growth and production of chicken in these (free range and intensive) systems.</p> <p>(d) To identify and access the methods of prevention and control of the diseases in the two systems identified.</p> <p>1.4       JUSTIFICATION</p> <p>The population of rural poultry in Africa has been estimated to account for more than 60 percent of the total national poultry population, (Sonaiya, 1990a). for example in Nigeria, rural poultry accounted for about eighty percent of the total national flock, (Awan, 1993). Despite the high percentage, the survivability of rural poultry industry in Nigeria is very low due to poor management techniques embarked upon by rural poultry farmers, and outbreak of seasonally dependent diseases that can account for high chick losses.</p> <p>The management of village chicken is complicated by the presence of multi-aged groups in the same flock. High chick mortality can be attributed to poor feeding, house and health control practices. There was usually no preferential treatment for the chicks, as they compete for the available feed resource with other animals. Where supplementary feeding and water are provided, the containers used are too deep for the chicks to reach the contents. Predation can also be a major cause of high chick mortality because; the young chicks are more vulnerable. Predators like hawks, rats, mongooses, snakes, dogs, cats and foxes prey on young chick especially those in free-range management system.</p> <p>This management system can leads to failure of health control programs due to poor administration of vaccine carriers whether food or water as the birds are unprotected. Feeding and health improvement programmes will only be successful if this situation is given due consideration to ensure that the different birds are protected. The mortality rate of naturally brooded chicks, whose only source of feed is from scavenging under free-range conditions, is very high and often exceed 50 percent up to eight weeks of age. (Chabeuf, 1990; Olayiwole, 1984; Achiempong, 1992).</p> <p>Therefore there is a need to adopt a better system of poultry management that reduces or prevent the loss of small chicks and the fowls to diseases and other environmental factors that are detrimental to the profitability of poultry management.</p> <p>1.5       PURPOSE OF STUDY</p> <p>It is hoped that this research work with many other relevant ones will not only inform but provide enough impetus to drive the needed change we need to see that will lead to increase profitability of poultry management in our country Sierra Leone.</p> <p>1.6 ASSUMPTION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This study was based on the following assumptions:</p> <ul><li>That poultry management especially within the rural communities could be improved through the sensitization of the major actors to the outcomes of this research.</li> <li>That diseases management in poultry could be improved upon by properly educating everyone involved about simple ways to prevent outbreak and by encouraging use vaccines.</li> <li>That through our contact with the farms, information could be shared and impacted by both parties for the mutual benefits of all.</li> </ul> <p>1.7 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The major constraints encountered in the course of this research were: financial problems, bad road network leading to farms and the farmers in charge, transport cost, logistic cost and cost of consumables, cost of research materials were also high.</p>\n\nASSESSMENT OF COMMONLY IDENTIFIED DISEASES IN THE 2 COMMON POULTRY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF COMMONLY IDENTIFIED DISEASES IN THE 2 COMMON POULTRY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS", "id": 83}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE EFFECT OF INFLATION AND INTEREST RATE ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY IN NIGERIA FROM 2000-2015</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Inflation has been apparent in Nigeria from the outset of her national life as it was propelled in the 1960s through the “cheap money policy” adopted by the government to stimulate development after independence (Bayo, 2005). Nigeria has experienced all manners of inflationary episodes, from creeping to moderate and from high to galloping (Olubusoye and Oyaromade, 2008). Inflationary pressure in Nigeria was largely contained in 2010 and 2011, though the rate remained above the national and the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) single-digit inflation rate target (CBN, 2011). However, the 12-month moving average headline inflation rate was 10.8 percent in 2011, compared with 13.7 percent at end-December 2010. The agricultural sector is strategic to national economic development and contributes 42.1% of the current GDP (Eleri et al., 2012). It remains a major source of food and raw material for agro-industrial processing and has strong links to employment, national income, market opportunities for industrial production and strong potentials for poverty reduction and health improvement. However, Nigerian agriculture faces tremendous challenges which include the rising food prices amongst others. Food price inflation has risen in recent years because of many factors, on and off farms throughout the world (Oppedahl, 2009). The future direction of world food prices will depend on whether research and development increases agricultural productivity faster than the growth in world food demand. Key sources and features of recent increases of food prices in developing countries have been identified as being the underinvestment in agricultural innovation and rural infrastructure, shift of land and crops towards biofuel feedstocks, natural disasters, high global energy prices, unequal distribution of resources, mismanagement of natural resources, population growth and competition for land and water (Alam and Shahiduzzaman, 2008) Global food prices registered a new high in February 2011, rising by more than 30 percent year-on-year, underpinned by large increases in the prices of cereals, edible oils, and meat (ADB, 2011). While the recent price increases were triggered largely by production shortfalls due to bad weather, structural and cyclical factors that were at play during the 2007–2008, food crisis continue to be relevant, especially in the light of the strong recovery of many emerging economies from the global economic crisis. Inflation is undeniably one of the most leading and dynamic macroeconomic issues confronting most economies of the world and has become a leading topic of discussion in Nigerian families and press as its effects penetrate more deeply into nation’s life due to prevailing increase in prices (Olatunji et al., 2010). The consumer price index for food over the years in Nigeria constituted a larger proportion of the composite consumer price index and as noted by Oppedahl (2009), households in developing countries spend more on food relative to overall spending and therefore, food price inflation had played a bigger role in overall inflation. Despite the critical position of inflation in the macroeconomic environment of Nigeria, research efforts have not hitherto addressed the links between the direction of inflation, agricultural productivity and economic growth over the years in Nigeria and therefore, this study was carried out to the effect of inflation and interest rate on Agricultural productivity in Nigeria from 2000-2015.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Inflation is undeniably one of the most leading and dynamic macroeconomic issues confronting economy of Nigeria and has become a leading topic of discussion in Nigerian families and press as its effects penetrate more deeply into nation’s life due to prevailing increase in prices (Olatunji et al., 2010).

The parameters measured were plant height, leaf area, number of leaves, number of branches, days to first flowering, days to 50% flowering, number of flowers, number of fruit, fruit diameter, fruit length, fruit fresh weight, fruit dry weight, shoot fresh weight and shoot dry weight. The result of this study indicated that poultry manure significantly affected all the parameters measured except plant height. All the parameter measured were increased in Roma VF than in UC82-B except the number of flowers, days to first flowering, fruit length, fruit diameter, shoot fresh weight, fruit dry weight and shoot dry weight where the two varieties were similar. Application of 5 and 10 tha-1 poultry manure were similar and significantly increased fruit fresh weight above the control and 15 tha-1. However, the highest yield was obtained from 5 tha-1 poultry manure with either Roman VF or UC82B which were significantly at par.<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>1.0INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>The tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum) belong to the family of solanaceae. It is one of the most important vegetable in Nigeria and in many parts of the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. According to Hussaini et al., (2000) the crop rank first in importance among vegetables in Nigeria. It is grown mainly for its fruits, which is used almost daily in every home.<br/><br/>Tomato is an annual herbaceous plant which takes about 75 - 85 days to attain maturity. The plant may reach a height of 2m depending on the variety. The leaves are large, greenish, deeply cleft, with many leaflets. The leaves are arranged alternatively along the stems. The flowers are pinkish to yellow in contour, borne in clusters of four to six flowers sometimes more, formed on the stems between the leaves. Tomatoes fruits exist in many shapes appearing large and round, oval or elongated, depending on the variety. The fruits may be orange, yellow or red when ripe, usually with numerous kidney or peer shaped, hairy, light brown seeds (Tindall, 1993).<br/><br/>Tomato is a warm season plant that requires temperature of about 20-270c for most cultivars. Excessive rainfall and high relative humidity can be harmful to it. A deep loamy soil well drained rich in organic material with a pH of 6.2 – 6.8 for optimum growth and development. It is a nutritious vegetable with increasing demand in Nigeria. As documented by United States Dietary Allowance (2008) tomato fruit provide 95% water of its edible portion and the remaining 5% compose of miscellaneous compound among which include carotenoids, ascorbic acids, alcohol, insoluble solids (proteins) cellulose, pectins, polysaccharides and inorganic compound which give the fruit its characteristic flavor and aroma. In addition, Micheal (2006) revealed that tomatoes are among the food plants to which moderate level of anti cancer activities is associated. It also contains Vitamin A which is a remedy for night blindness. <br/><br/>Tomato originated in South America, but its cultivation has today spread to nearly all parts of the world. But however, it was introduced to West Africa by the Portuguese in the 16th century. The world’s cultivation of tomato is put to about 4 million hectares of which 63,482 hectares are estimated to be cultivated. In Nigeria, FAO (2010) reported an estimated annual production of 1.7 million tones. But however, this was still far below demand as there was an increasing demand from human consumption.<br/><br/>However, most of the deficits were offset by importation. Although, despite a drive towards increased tomatoes production in Nigeria, an optimum production has not been realized by the framers to meet its demand among consumers. <br/><br/>Generally, tomato production in Nigeria has been low because of low yields obtained by small scale farmers resulting from the use of unimproved local varieties with low yielding capacity which often grown in mixtures and this may prevent exploitation of crop productive capacity, environmental hazards such as drought and incidence of pest and diseases, plant population including soil fertility decline and a host of other factors have also kept tomato yield output relatively low (Adekiya and Ojeniyi, 2002). <br/><br/>The use of inorganic fertilizers alone has not been helpful under intensive Agriculture because it aggregates soil degradation (Sharma and Mittra, 1991). The degradation is brought about by loss of organic matter which consequently results in soil acidity and low crop yields (Ojeniyi, 2000). The quantity of soil organic matter depends on the quality of organic material which can be introduced into the soil either by natural returns through roots, stubbles, sloughed-off root nodules and root exudates or by artificial application in the form of organic fertilizer such as poultry manures. (Agboola and Omueti, 1982). Poultry manure is an important means of maintaining soil fertility status. It is cheap, readily available and more environmentally friendly. Nutrients contained in organic manures are released more slowly and are retained for a longer time in the soil, thereby ensuring long residual effect (Sharma and Mittra, 1991). Inorganic fertilizer on the other hand have high concentration of nutrients and readily available to crops but its use is hampered by its inaccessibility to majority of the farmers due to high cost in developing countries including Nigeria (Webber et al., 1999). <br/><br/>The application of poultry manure was reported Ewulo et al., (2008) to significantly affect tomato plant height, number of branches, root length, number and weight of fruits of tomatoes.<br/><br/>In recognition of the increasing economic importance of tomatoes, intensifying production through the use of improved varieties and organic manure has become imperative.<br/><br/>Most of the varieties available to farmers are local and low yielding, generally sown in mixture with other vegetables or cereals. Therefore, the performance and yield potentials of high yielding varieties such as Roma VF and UC 82B released by NIHORT need to be evaluated to replace the low yielding local varieties currently in use by farmers.<br/><br/>Objective<br/><br/>The present study was conducted to determine the optimum poultry manure rate for these two varieties of tomatoes in rainforest zone of Nigeria. </p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF POULTRY MANURE ON THE GROWTH AND YIELD OF TWO VARIETIES OF TOMATOES (LYCOPERSICON ESCULENTUM)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF POULTRY MANURE ON THE GROWTH AND YIELD OF TWO VARIETIES OF TOMATOES (LYCOPERSICON ESCULENTUM)", "id": 85}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>The experiment was conducted at the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Benin, Ugbowo Campus Benin City Nigeria. The experiment was conducted under rain fed condition during the early cropping season (March to November) of the year 2013.<br/><br/>The experimental design was the Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with yam and egusi-melon as the test crops. The trial consisted of 4 levels of NPK 20:10:10 fertilizer (0, 200, 400, 600kg/ha) with 3 cropping systems and replicated 3 times.<br/><br/>It was observed that yam did well in sole than in intercropping. Average tuber yield of yam in fertilizer treatments was also greater than that of unfertilized plants. Also the average tuber yield and number of tubers were significant. The higher tuber yield of yam2.862t/ha and 2.991t/ha was obtained from 400kg/ha treatment in sole and in intercrop planting system. Higher number of tubers of 21.66 was obtained from 200kg/ha treatment in sole planting system.<br/><br/>The mean value of egusi-melon seed yield in intercrop and sole melon was 0.0513t/ha and 0.0511t/ha respectively. And the mean value obtained from average pods size was 28.97cm for sole and 34.0cm for intercrop. From the experiment, plot which was measured 4x1.5m per sub-plot, the average number of egusi-melon gotten was 34.0 for intercrop and 44.0 for sole.<br/><br/>The application of NPK 20:10:10 fertilizer at 400kg/ha had the greatest influence on the yield of egusi-melon both as a sole and as intercrop. The application of 400kg/ha at 6WAP influenced the pod number.<br/><br/>The application of NPK 20:10:10 at 600kg/ha had the greatest influence on vine length and stem girth of egusi-melon both as sole and as intercrop. Average stem girth of 1.19cm in sole and 1.33cm in intercrop was obtained. Vine length of 154.3cm in intercrop as against 156.3cm recorded in sole planting.<br/><br/>The longest vine and the widest stem girth of yam were obtained at 400kg/ha of NPK 20:10:10 fertilizer. Average vine length of 236.2cm in intercrop and 225.7cm in sole at 8WAP was obtained. Average stem girth of 1.55cm in intercrop as against 1.64cm recorded in sole planting.<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>1.0INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>Intercropping is an agricultural practice in which two or more crops are grown together in the field (Onwueme, 1978). One advantage of intercropping is that it increases yield: more can be grown on a single plot with intercropping.<br/><br/>Intercropping suppresses weed better than sole cropping. It provides an opportunity to utilize crops themselves as tools for weed management. In intercropping more complete crop coverage and high population density cause some competition to weed and thus reduce the weed growth. Compatible crop mixture which reduces weed competition viz a viz increases total yield should be selected. Result of a large number of experiment have indicated that short duration pulse like green grain, cowpea, soya beans as intercrop effectively smothers weeds. Intercropping short season crops e.g. maize and melon with large season crops like yam and cassava prevents weed from adapting to the growth cycle of either crops. Low growing crops like melon, sweet potato with maize, cassava, yam ass intercrops suppresses weed growth in Nigeria (Akobundo, 1987).<br/><br/>For farmers who don’t have much land, it reduces farmers risk because if one crop fails, other crop may continue to grow. Mixed intercropping is common when cereals, grain legumes, and root crops are grown together and when little or no tillage is practiced (Akinola and Agboola et’al 2007). Farmers in southern Nigeria plant two or more crops simultaneously in association and on the same piece of land. The most dominant crop mixture is:<br/><br/>Yam + melon + maize + vegetable,<br/><br/>Cassava + melon<br/><br/>Maize + melon + cassava<br/><br/>Yam + melon intercrops.<br/><br/>However, intercropping root crop like yam (Dioscorea spp) with egusi-melon (Colocynthis citrillus) is a common practice by farmers, as egusi-melon serves as a weed suppressant in the first 6 weeks of yam growth (Ogungbaigbe, et’al 1996).<br/><br/>1.1YAM (Dioscorea spp)<br/><br/>Yam is an annual or perennial climbing plant with underground tubers. Nigeria is by far the world largest producer of yams, accounting for over 70-75 % of the world production (FAO, 2004). More than 95 % of the world’s yams are currently grown in sub – Sahara Africa, with the reminder grown in the West Indies and parts of Asia and South and Central America.<br/><br/>Yam, a tropical crop in the genus Dioscorea has as many as 600 species out of which 6 are economically important staple species. These are: Dioscorea rotundata (white yam), Dioscorea cayensis (yellow yam), Dioscorea alata (water yam), Dioscorea bubifera (aerial yam), Dioscorea dumetorum (trifoliate yam), and Dioscorea esculanta (Chinese yam).out of these, D. rotundata, D. cayensis and D. alata are the most common species in Nigeria (Onwueme, 1978). Yam is in the class of roots and tuber, it is a staple of the Nigerian and West African diet, which provide some 200 calories of energy per capital daily. Yam have a cultural and traditional significance among many communities in Nigeria, this is exemplified by the occurrence of rituals to mark their harvest<br/><br/>Mono cropping is increasing in certain area of West Africa and Caribbean. However, in producing area of Nigeria, mixed cropping with yam and egusi melon with maize or yam with egusi melon is prevalent (Kurt, 1984).<br/><br/>1.2EGUSI-MELON (Colocynthis citrillus)<br/><br/>Egusi-melon is a vegetable crop commonly cultivated in West Africa (Vander-Vossen, et’al 2004). Because of its creeping nature and ability to use its leaves to provide cover on the soil, farmers use it as weed suppressant in mixed cropping (Achigan-Dako, 2008). Production of the crop is more popular in the northern parts of Nigeria where there is abundance of cultivable land which has made the practice of sole and mixed cropping possible. This is unlike the eastern part of Nigeria, where the sandy area of where scarcity of farm land has force majority of the farmers to raise the crop in mixed crop farms. Despite the socio-ecological important of egusi-melon, production output has been on the decline (Ugwumba, 2010).<br/><br/>Egusi-melon is grown for its seed, which is used in preparing assorted foods, especially soup and stew. The seed is rich in oil and protein and contains good quantities of most of the essential amino acids. <br/><br/>In traditional system of farming, egusi-melon is usually planted as lich much and smothering crops in midst of other crops. The benefit of intercropping yam with egusi-melon could possibly be harnessed by adjusting the planting sequence of yam minisetts (Ikeorgu, 1991). <br/><br/>The importance of egusi-melon in conserving soil moisture and reducing optimal soil temperature early in the growing season, earlier reported by Ikeorgu (1991), suggest the crops suitability for intercropping with yam.<br/><br/>1.3OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>The objectives were to determine:<br/><br/>the effect of NPK fertilizer on the growth and yield of yam and egusi melon in sole and in intercrop<br/><br/>yield advantage, if any due to intercropping 0f both crops.</p>\n\nEFFECT OF NPK FERTILIZER ON THE GROWTH AND YIELD COMPONENTS OF YAM (DIOSCOREA SPP), AND EGUSI-MELON (COLONCYNTHIS CITRILLUS) INTERCROP<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF NPK FERTILIZER ON THE GROWTH AND YIELD COMPONENTS OF YAM (DIOSCOREA SPP), AND EGUSI-MELON (COLONCYNTHIS CITRILLUS) INTERCROP", "id": 86}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>The effect of introducing garden egg (Solanum aethiopicum) to fluted pumpkin (Telfairia occidentalis) in a relay intercrop on the growth of crop mixture under rainfed conditions (September to November, 2014) was investigated at the Faculty of Agriculture University of Benin, Benin City Nigeria.<br/><br/>Garden egg and a local variety of fluted pumpkin were sown sole and intercrop. Garden egg and fluted pumpkin were planted sole and intercropped to evaluate their interaction effect on growth parameters such as plant height, stem girth, leaf number, and leaf area. Data obtained were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA).<br/><br/>The study reveals that intercropping of garden egg with fluted pumpkin significantly increased the growth of garden egg, as intercropped garden egg had significant increase as against sole garden egg.

However, most practices of modern agriculture, e.g. mechanization, monocultures, improved crop varieties, and heavy use of agrochemicals for fertilization and pest management, led to a simplification of the components of agricultural systems and to a loss of biodiversity. Restoring on-farm biodiversity through diversified farming systems that mimic nature is considered to be a key strategy for sustainable agriculture (Jackson et al., 2007; Scherr and McNeely, 2008). On-farm biodiversity, if correctly assembled in time and space, can lead to agroecosystems capable of maintaining their own soil fertility, regulating natural protection against pests, and sustaining productivity (Thrupp, 2002; Scherr and McNeely, 2008). Biodiversity in agroecosystems can be enhanced in time through crop rotations and sequences in space through cover crops, intercropping, and agroforestry (Altieri, 1999; Malézieux et al., 2009). While modern agriculture has brought vast increases in productivity to the world’s farming systems, it is widely recognized that much of this may have come at the price of sustainability (Tilman et al., 2002; Lichtfouse et al., 2009). This is because modern farming systems imply the simplification of the structure of the environment over vast areas, replacing natural plant diversity with only a limited number of cultivated plants in extensive areas of arable monocultures (Vandermeer et al., 1998). By contrast, on farm biodiversity is familiar to traditional farmers mainly in developing countries, where traditional farming systems are characterized by their great degree of genetic diversity in the form of mixed cropping and agroforestry patterns, based on numerous varieties of domesticated crop species as well as their wild relatives (Altieri, 1999). These farming systems offer a means of promoting diversity of diet and income, stability of production, reduced insect and disease incidence, efficient use of labor, intensification of production with limited resources, and also maximization of returns under low levels of technology (Anil et al., 1998; Malézieux et al., 2009). Intercropping, also referred to as mixed cropping or polyculture, is the agricultural practice of cultivating two or more crops in the same space at the same time (Andrews and Kassam, 1976; Ofori and Stern, 1987; Anil et al., 1998). The component crops of an intercropping system do not necessarily have to be sown at the same time nor they have to be harvested at the same time, but they should be grown simultaneously for a great part of their growth periods. In intercropping, there is normally one main crop and one or more added crop(s), with the main crop being of primary importance for economic or food production reasons. The two or more crops in an intercrop normally are from different species and different plant families, or less commonly they may be simply different varieties or cultivars of the same crop, such as mixing two or more kinds of wheat seed in the same field. The most common advantage of intercropping is to produce a greater yield on a given piece of land by achieving more efficient use of the available growth resources that would otherwise not be utilized by each single crop grown alone. There are many different kinds of species that can be used for intercropping such as annuals, e.g. cereals and legumes, perennials, including shrubs and trees, or a mixture of the two (annuals and perennials). In the case of shrubs and trees the term mostly used is agroforestry. The objective of this paper is to provide an overall view and evaluation of annual intercropping, summarizing its main advantages supported by a number of key examples from the published literature which point out its great value in the context of sustainable agriculture. This paper focuses on relay intercropping and not on agroforestry using garden egg and fluted pumpkin intercrop as case study.<br/><br/>The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of intercropped telfairia and its time of intercropping on the growth yield of garden egg.<br/><br/>Meaning of Intercropping<br/><br/>Intercropping is the practice of growing two or more crops in close proximity and it is practiced by majority of farmers in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The system is widely practiced because it suppresses weeds and reduces pest disease infestation. (Ibeawuchi, 2007).<br/><br/>The degree of spatial and temporal overlap in the crop or more crops can be varied. As a result, numerous types of intercropping in which the temporal and spatial mixture have been varied to some degree have been identified (Andrews and Kassam, 1975).<br/><br/>Types of intercropping (spatial and temporal patterns)<br/><br/>Several types of intercropping, all of which vary the temporal and spatial mixture to some degree, have been described (Andrews and Kassam, 1976). The degree of spatial and temporal overlap in the component crops can vary somewhat, but both requirements must be met for a cropping system to be an intercrop. Thus, there are several different modes of component crops (Willey, 1985). Yield advantage occurs because growth resources such as light, water, and nutrients are more completely absorbed and converted to crop biomass by the intercrop over time and space as a result of differences in competitive ability for growth resources between the component crops, which exploit the variation of the mixed crops in characteristics such as rates of canopy development, final canopy size (width and height), photosynthetic adaptation of canopies to irradiance conditions, and rooting depth (Midmore, 1993; Morris and Garrity, 1993; Tsubo et al., 2001). Regularly intercropped pigeon pea or cowpea can help to maintain maize yield to some extent when maize is grown without mineral fertilizer on sandy soils in sub-humid zones of Zimbabwe (Waddington et al., 2007). Intercropping maize with cowpea has been reported to increase light interception in the intercrops, reduce water evaporation, and improve conservation of the soil moisture compared with maize alone (Ghanbari et al., 2010). This yield advantage occurs when the component crops do not compete for the same ecological niches and the interspecific competition for a given resource is weaker than the intraspecific competition. Normally, complementary use of resources occurs when the component species of an intercrop use qualitatively different resources or they use the same resources at different places or at different times (Tofinga et al., 1993). In ecological terms, resource complementarity minimizes the niche overlap and the competition between crop species, and permits crops to capture a greater range and quantity of resources than the sole crops. Improved resource use gives in most cases a significant yield advantage, increases the uptake of other nutrients such as P, K, and micronutrients, and provides better rooting ability and better ground cover as well as higher water use efficiency (Midmore, 1993; Morris and Garrity, 1993). Thus, selection of crops that differ in competitive ability in time or space is essential for an efficient intercropping system as well as decisions on when to plant, at what density, and in what arrangement. Although in this way cropping management decisions specify the design of intercropping systems, intercrop performance is governed largely by the availability of and the competition for the environmental resources. Research has shown that intercrops are most productive when component crops differ greatly in growth duration (Wien and Smithson, 1981; Smith and Francis, 1986; Fukai and Trenbath, 1993; Keating and Carberry, 1993). For example, when a long duration pigeon pea cultivar was grown in mixture with three cereal crops of different growth durations, i.e. setaria, pearl millet, and sorghum, the Land Equivalent Ratio was highest with the quick-maturing setaria and lowest with the slow-maturing sorghum (Rao and Willey, 1980). It must be noted here that Land Equivalent Ratio shows the efficiency of intercropping for using the environmental resources compared with monocropping with the value of unity to be the critical value. When the Land Equivalent Ratio is greater than one (unity) the intercropping favours the growth and yield of the species, whereas when the Land Equivalent Ratio is lower than one the intercropping negatively affects the growth and yield of the plants grown in mixtures (Willey, 1979; Willey and Rao, 1980). Asynchrony in resource demand ensures that the late maturing crop can recover from possible damage caused by a quick-maturing crop component and the available resources, e.g. radiation capture over time, are used thoroughly until the end of the growing season (Keating and Carberry, 1993). By contrast, when the component crops have similar growth durations their peak requirements for growth resources normally occur about the same time and the competition for the limiting growth resources is intense (Fukai and Trenbath, 1993). <br/><br/>In intercropping crops could be arranged in any of the following forms.<br/><br/>Mixed cropping – Here component crops are totally, mixed in the available space without any form of arrangement.<br/><br/>Row cropping- The component crops are arranged in alternate rows. A variation of row cropping includes multiple rows of another.<br/><br/>Relay cropping- Here the second crop is sown at the onset of reproductive development or fruiting of the first crop such that when the fruit is harvested it gives room for the full development of the second.<br/><br/>Strip cropping- This involves sowing more than one crop in different strips.<br/><br/>Intercropping as previously mentioned has an increased yield advantage thus useful in poverty and hunger alleviation as an insurance against crop failure and positive effect on soil properties (Ehigiator and Ikhidero, 1999).<br/><br/>Garden Egg (Solanum aethiopicum)<br/><br/>The name “Garden egg plant” was derived from the shape of the fruits of some varieties which are white and shaped like chicken eggs (Chen et al., 2001). The plant (Solanum spp) is a vegetable with increasing popularity in the world (Pessarakli and Dris, 2003), and it originated from Tropical Africa (Norman, 1992). It is an economic flowering plant belonging to the family Solanaceae, of which members of about 1,400 species found throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world are mostly herbaceous plants. The fruit of the plant comes in a wide array of shapes and colours, some are yellow and small with green stripes; there are the big yellow ones with white colour and flat ribbed green types among others (Chen et al., 2001). The importance of the garden-egg cannot be overemphasized. It is consumed on daily basis by urban families and also represents the main source of income for producing households in West Africa (Danquah- Jones, 2000). Nutritionally, garden egg contains water (92.5%), protein (1%), fat (0.3%), and carbohydrates (6%). They contain between 30 and 50% of iron (Fe), fiber, potassium (K), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu) and vitamins; thiamin (vitamin B1), B6, folate, magnesium and niacin. Egg plant also contains phyto-nutrients such as nasunin and chlorogenic acid (Sabo and Dia, 2009). It is a very good source of dietary fiber, potassium, manganese, copper and vitamin B6, folate, magnesium and niacin. Egg plant also contains phyto-nutrients such as nasunin and chlorogenic acid. It is a valuable vegetable for canning industries for garden-egg paste, sautéed garden-egg and other products. The fruits are fried, stewed, marinated and prepared in other ways. The garden egg plant with its bitter taste and spongy texture could really make an amazing pot of stew with a nice aroma. When eaten with boiled yam or rice, it becomes a delicacy you do not want to miss at the slightest opportunity. Medicinally, they are processed and used in the preparation of condiments and products used in treating different diseases and health problems (Burkill, 1985). A meal of garden egg is proven to be of benefits to patients suffering from raised intraocular pressure (glaucoma) and convergence insufficiency, as well as in heart diseases and Arteriosclerosis (Harish et al., 2008). The plant can be regarded as a brain food because it houses the anthocyanin phytonutrient found in its skin, Nasunin, a potent antioxidant and free radical scavenger that has been shown to protect cell membranes from damage. Studies have shown that nasunin protects the fats in brain cell membranes. Nasunin is not only a potent free radical scavenger, but is also an iron chelator. Iron is an essential nutrient, necessary for oxygen transport, normal immune function and collagen synthesis, but when it becomes too much in the blood stream; it becomes a major concern. Excess iron increases free radical production and is associated with an increased risk of heart disease and cancer. Menstruating women, who lose iron every month in their menstrual flow, are unlikely to be at risk, but in post-menopausal women and men, iron, which is not easily excreted, can accumulate. By chelating iron, nasunin lessens free radical formation with numerous beneficial results including protecting the blood cholesterol from peroxidation, preventing cellular damage that can promote cancer, and lessening free radical damage in joints, which is a primary factor in rheumatoid arthritis. The predominant phenolic compound found in garden eggs is chlorogenic acid, which is one of the most potent free radical scavengers found in plant tissues. The chlorogenic acid performs antimutagenic (anticancer) activities in the body. It also performs anti- LDL (bad cholesterol) activities by increasing the levels of HDL (good cholesterol) in the body and at the same time has antiviral and antimicrobial properties. Consuming high amounts of garden eggs have been found to be beneficial for people with glaucoma because it lowers the eye pressure. Egg plant contains measurable amounts of oxalates which are naturally occurring substances found in plants, animals, and human beings. When oxalates become too concentrated in body fluids, they can crystallize and cause health problems. For this reason, individuals with already existing and untreated kidney or gall bladder problems may want to avoid eating egg plant. Chewing thoroughly while eating, can enable you get significant benefits, including absorption of calcium from calcium-rich foods plant foods that also contain oxalic acid. As such, eating garden eggs does not stop you from meeting your calcium requirements. Egg plant is low in calories and high in fibre. The egg plant is good for carbohydrate counters and dieters can actually snack on garden eggs in-between meals.<br/><br/>Production of garden-egg is highly concentrated with 85% of the output coming from five (5) countries.<br/><br/>Presently, China is the world largest producer (56% of garden-egg output), followed by India (26%), Egypt, Turkey and Indonesia. Meanwhile, more than 2,048,788ha are devoted to cultivation of garden egg (FAO, 2008). In the United State of America, Georgia is the largest producing State. African garden-egg is one of the most commonly consumed fruit vegetable in the Tropical Africa, in quantity and value and probably, the third after Lycopersicum esculentum (tomato) and Alum cepa (onions) and before Okra. According to Girth et al. (1989), a rough estimate for a few countries indicates an annual production of 8,000 tonnes in Senegal, 60,000 tonnes in Cote d’ Ivoire and 4,500 tonnes in Burkina Faso.<br/><br/>In Nigeria, garden egg is a very important vegetable crop grown on commercial scale in some parts of the country. However, the small scale growers account for at least 86% of the total production. In the South -East of Nigeria, specifically, in Abia State, garden-egg popularly called “Mikimiki “ (big sized green fruit with very deep and sweet “endocarp”) is grown commercially while in the savannah zone of Nigeria; the yellow, white and thick green skinned varieties are grown on large scale. <br/><br/>Fluted Pumpkin (Telfairia Occidentalis)<br/><br/>This leafy vegetable belongs to family Cucurbitaceae. The term fluted is used in description of the female flower which has a flute like appearance. It is believed to be indigenous to East, central and west Africa between latitude 7oS and 5oN and longitude 2oE and 38oN (Howes 1950). In Nigeria, it is referred to as Ugu by Igbos, Iroko by the Yorubas, Ubon by the Efiks. Its largest diversity in plant population can currently be found in Imo State and other surrounding areas in South-East Nigeria. Pumpkins are largely grown for their leaves which are used as vegetables and its fruit which is boiled and eaten as desert (Attere 1984).<br/><br/>The fluted pumpkin is a perennial dioecious crop although monoecious forms also exist. The female plants have distinctly stronger shoots and stronger shoots and larger leaves than male plants. The male plants however, flowers about 5 months from sowing while it takes the female plants another 3 weeks before its first flower is open ( Chigwe and Saka 1994).<br/><br/>Pumpkin seeds contain 20-55% oil rich in unsaturated fatty acid oleic and linoleic acid and 23-25% protein, rich in arginine, aspartate and glutamine but they are deficient in lysine and sulphur containing amino acids. Pumpkin seeds can be eaten in the dry season as snack after roasting or grinding into butter (Gwanan and Nitcherlein 1995).<br/><br/>Pumpkin also contains high levels of copper, Iron and Vitamin A Chandarasckhar et al (2000) reported that pumpkin leaves had the highest amount of beta-carotene in a form that promoted its absorption in adults, among selected green vegetables. Despite the importance of pumpkin in the small holder sector in Southern Africa, little research has been done on this crop (Chigwe and Saka 1994).<br/><br/>According to a research carried out by Ehigiator (1994) and Edo ADP crops grown in mixture by farmers in Edo State were in the order<br/><br/>Maize + cassava<br/><br/>Maize + egusi<br/><br/>Maize + egusi + cassava<br/><br/>Yam + maize + mellon<br/><br/>Yam + maize + egusi mellon + vegetable <br/><br/>Maize + cassava + cowpea<br/><br/>Despite the growing of these crop mixtures by farmers, little is understood on the effect of various crop components in an intercrop. Due to the importance of okro as a staple food crop and of fluted pumpkin in the diet of people in Nigeria, hence this study on the intercropping effect of both crops on their productivity in an ultisol in Benin City, Nigeria.</p>\n\nEFFECT OF INTRODUCING GARDEN EGG TO FLUTED PUMPKIN IN A RELAY INTERCROP ON SOLE AND COMBINED GROWTH OF THE CROP MIXTURES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF INTRODUCING GARDEN EGG TO FLUTED PUMPKIN IN A RELAY INTERCROP ON SOLE AND COMBINED GROWTH OF THE CROP MIXTURES", "id": 87}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1           </strong><strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Agriculture accounts for about 20 percent of GDP, in the African sub-region (World Bank, 2005); two third of the people derive from livelihoods and 40 percent of exports commodities come from this sector (World Bank, 2000). Despite the importance of the agriculture sector, its performance over the last 30 years has been disappointing: agriculture and food production per capital in West Africa has stagnated in last ten years (FAO, 2005) yield of grain crops are less than half, those of other developing regions in Asia and South America. If Africa is to feed itself, lift its people out of poverty and attain a satisfactory level of sustainable growth, the poor in the performance of its agricultural sector must be addressed. It is the dominant sector in the rural areas of Nigeria as it provides less than 50% of the country’s cultivable agricultural land is under cultivation particularly because smallholder and farmers who use rudimentary production techniques cultivate most of this land with resultant low yields. The smallholder farmers are constrained by many problems including those of poor access to modern inputs and credit, poor infrastructure, inadequate access to markets, land and environmental degradation and inadequate research and extension services (Oluwatayo, et al 2008).</p> <p>In an effort to overcome some of these issues, donor agencies and government have re-emphasized cooperative as a strategy to promote collective action to strengthen smallholder’s livelihoods by linking them to national and international markets. Cooperatives are defined as autonomous association of persons who unite voluntarily to meet their common economic and social needs aspiration, through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise (International Cooperative Association’s, (ICA) 1995). Cooperatives are established by like-minded persons to purse mutually beneficial economic interest and they provide a unique tool for achieving one or more economic goals in an increasingly competitive global economy. These goals include achieving economic of size, improving bargaining power when dealing with other business, purchasing in bulk to achieve lower prices and obtaining product and services otherwise unavailable. </p> <p>Develtere (1995), described cooperative as a medium through which services like provision of farm input, farm implements, farm mechanization, Agricultural loans, agricultural extension, members education, marketing of members farm produce and other economic activities and services are rendered to members. Cooperative can be multi-purpose or focused on area. An example of the latter is farmer’s cooperative provides smallholder farmers with economic of scale by facilitating cheaper and more efficient access to inputs, production technologies, market information and markets.</p> <p>Today in an area where many people (especially small-holder farmers) feel powerless to change their lives, cooperative can serve as a strong, vibrant and viable economic alternative. They are based on the powerful idea that are formed together, a group of people can achieve goals that none of them can achieve alone. It has being considered as a third force, an alternative and countervailing power to both big business and big government (ICA, 1995)</p> <p>Agricultural cooperative encourage members to engage in joint cultivation of food and cash crops among others. In view of the financial capacity and high level of underdevelopment, an individual farmer cannot achieve the desire for large-scale production. It is therefore; in the farmers’ interest that resources are pulled together so as to gain tremendous collective advantage and thus widening the industrial base of the economy and the management techniques of the farmers (Enikaselu et al, 2005).</p> <p>Group projects are increasingly being relied upon by governments, bi-and multi-laterals and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as the preferred model for rural development project implementation and poverty alleviation (Grootaet, 1998; Harris, 1997; World Bank, 1997). Thus despite the low performance of cooperatives, the World Bank (1997) claims they remain the preferred form of organization, and perhaps the only organization with which rural people are familiar (Hussi 199:12). For instance farmers cooperatives society are formed to bring in more agricultural inputs and product marketing services members, increase competition in the agricultural service sector and provide saving and credit to members, among many other function (Porvali, 1993). Small holder farmers stand a better chance with the formation of agricultural cooperatives.</p> <p>The cooperative as a social organization began early in human development. Cheney (1999) opined that cooperatives were always inspired by the doctrine of human fellowship, by the new spirit of social services and by a firm faith that the time would come when people would work for the whole community, instead of their own gains. Ghosh and Maharjan (2001), modern cooperatives started in 1904 in British India when the cooperative societies act was enacted. The purpose of the cooperatives at inception was to provide cheap credit to the farmers. Cooperatives was introduced into Russia in mid-19th century from Germany (Lohlein andWehrheim, 2003), but the exact years was not stated. However, Lohlein and Wehrheim (2003) reported that by 1883, there were about 981 cooperatives in Russia. Those in rural areas are called credit cooperatives while those in the urban centers are refer to as credit union.</p> <p>Furthermore, before Rochdale, cooperative pioneers societies had practiced most of the Rochdale principles. Gates (1998) found profit sharing and surplus sharing cooperatives between workers and owners, as far back as 1795 and (as might be expected) the genius of the Rochdale cooperative was that they actually developed principles, which they then practiced and popularized. Subsequently, following the guiding principles of cooperative promotions by the ICA, various cooperatives rapidly developed worldwide-both in developed and developing countries and this made immense contribution to social and economic development (ICA, 2008).</p> <p>The evolution of cooperatives has shown that the cooperative movement has been influenced by the social and economic conditions. Cooperative was created by their members to deal with their own difficulties, in relation to aspects of economic change (Fairbain, 2004a). Djik (1997) summarized the historical reasons to industrially firms which included the need for counterbalancing power; to gain access to industrially produced goods and services; efficiency by economies of scale; risk management and the improvement of members’ income and the rural economy.</p> <p>Illiopulous and Cook (2004) over-view the historical development of famers’ cooperatives in America, and divided them into two main types which included ‘Traditional’ cooperatives and; new generation’ cooperatives. Traditional cooperatives often refer to producer-owned, controlled with open membership, and risk capital generated primarily by means of retained earnings from member patronage and illiquid equity ownership rights. A new generation cooperative (NGOs) often adapts “a propertyrights structure that enables them to partially ameliorate the aforementioned constraint” (Illiopoulous&amp; Cook, 2004). Cook and Burress (2009) further research also proposed a dynamic life cycle framework includes five phrase of economic justification: organizational design. Growth, glory and heterogeneity, recognition and introspection, and choice (Cook and Burress, 2009).</p> <p>The early cooperative societies in Nigeria were established to facilitate cocoa farming which led to the establishment of the Cooperative Registrar of the Colonial Government in 1935.</p> <p>Later, these cooperative societies began providing intermediation to members (World Bank, 2000). Eventually multi-purpose cooperative societies were designed to simultaneous solve several problems facing members and marketing of farm produce. Consequently one could arguably state that the need to reduce shortage of loans to the low income farmers among the members thus promoting agricultural development brought about cooperative societies in Nigeria (Oluyombo, 2010). The operation of cooperative within and outside Africa varies from one nation to another. In some countries, there are rules and regulations guiding the operation of cooperatives which they are expected to comply with. The regulation may require the cooperative to be under the direct control the Central Bank of such nation or a separate agency may be created to monitor and control the affairs of cooperative depending on what the country deems acceptable to do (Henry and Schimmel, 2011).</p> <p>The survival of cooperative societies in any country depends largely on the overall political and economic environment of such nation because cooperatives exist within the wider economy of the particular country where it operates (Calkins and Ngo, 2005). The practice of cooperative has grown over the years across the globe either as formal or informal institutions. The regulation of farmers’ cooperatives is a function of the roles they are expected to perform in such economy vis-a-visthe level of economic development and poverty in such a nation (Oluyombo, 2010). Cooperative with track records of prudent management and cohesive membership stand to play a major role in agricultural and rural development in Nigeria.</p> <p>International organizations such as the United Nations (UN), the World Bank and the International Labour Organization (ILO) are convinced that agricultural cooperatives can play a vital role in achieving sustainable rural development. UN (2008) noted that cooperatives are by nature with concerned with democratic and human values, as well as car8ing for the environment.</p> <p>Successive governments in Nigeria recognize that cooperative societies are essential for the development of the agricultural sector. This laudable goal was supported by the establishment of the Agricultural Development Programme (ADPs) and he River Basin and Rural Development Authorities (RBRDAa). Both ADPs and RBRDAs always organize farmers under their programmes into cooperative group for better co-ordination of the farmers’ activities. The cooperatives approach to group action has been effectively utilized by these two programmes. Although, the primary objectives of forming group farming cooperatives in ADPs and RBRDAs is to increase agricultural outputs, it has been possible to get them involved in marketing of their produce as well.</p> <p>Farmers are the single largest group of users and managers of land, water, and other ecological resources throughout the world. Most small holder farmers regardless of gender require services and information obtainable through membership of agricultural cooperative. Such information includes appropriate technology and sound technical advice not only to increase their agricultural productivity and incomes but also make farming and rural life richer and more sustainable. Herein lies the retinal why agricultural cooperative is deserving of research attention particularly in Abaji Area Council where major farming activities are taking place around the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of Research Problem</strong></p> <p>Small-holder farmer including Nigeria has accounted for over 90% of all agricultural output in Nigeria (World Fact Book, 2011). The farmers are burdened with high cost of farm inputs, insufficient farming techniques, inadequate infrastructure, poor producers’ prices and heavy constraints in obtaining credits and insurance. Benson (2004) remarked that the situation is further compounded by the general economic downturn and governments drive to remove all subsidies on inputs such as fertilizers, vaccines and foundation stock. Consequently, the cooperative option comes into focus as viable way to effectively mobilize farmers to form groups and pool resources so as to become more effective in agricultural production.</p> <p>In addition to the values and principles of cooperatives, Veerakumaran (2005) explained that cooperative serve as fundamental tool for achieving food security at household level. Cooperatives are the best institution invention for attaining food security in any country.</p> <p>The developed national like United States of America, Canada, Australia, almost all European countries and socialist country like China have attained food self-sufficient through cooperatives (Chambo, 2009)</p> <p>Gertler (2001) using the profit model studied the potential impact cooperatives have in sustaining regional economies in Canada. The results show that cooperatives are practical vehicles for cooperation, collective action and they build and reinforce community, stabilize regional economies and provide a favourable climate for further investment cooperatives reduce inequality and promote equitable sharing of the cost and benefits of development. Cooperatives can promote economic democracy and the empowerment of marginalized groups a hallmark of sustainable development and a precondition for shared responsibility. </p> <p>Adefila (2012) examined the factors influencing the performance of farmers’ cooperatives organization in Gurara Area of Niger State, Nigeria using multiple regressions. The results from the regression analysis revealed that farmers’ cooperative organizations are variously involved in agricultural development and that factors’ influencing their role performance. </p> <p>Include annual income, experience in farming, leadership training and membership size. The author concluded that cooperative in whatever form are seriously viewed as catalyst in the process of rural socio-economic development and the law should empower cooperatives to perform certain functions, such as strengthening their bargaining power as effective agents of socio-economic rural transformation.</p> <p>Ojiako and Ogbukwa (2012) examined loan repayment capacity of small-holder cooperative farmers in Yewa North Area Ogun State, Nigeria using regression technique. The results show that farm credits played vital roles in the socio-economic transformation of the rural economies. However, loan acquisition and repayment were characterized by numerous challenges smallholder cooperative farmers’ loan repayment capacity would require conscious use of policies directed at increasing loan size and farmers’ farm holdings and/or reducing household size.</p> <p>Similarly, Ofuoku and Urang (2009) assessed the effects of cohesion of farmers’ cooperatives societies on loan repayment among members in Delta State, Nigeria using Spearman’s rank order correlation analysis. The study observed that there was almost perfect positive relationship between rates of loan repayment perception and cohesion. Consequently, they recommended that extension agents should take advantage of the effect of cohesion on loan repayment to promote cohesion in upcoming cooperative societies. </p> <p>In evaluating agricultural credit utilization by cooperative farmers in Benue State, Nigeria, Okwoche et al (2012), observed a significant difference between the agricultural output and income of farmers’ before and after the utilization of loan acquired. The t-test analysis shows that famers joined the farmers’ cooperatives societies mainly to access credit.</p> <p>They recommended that the farmers should be adequately motivated with needed credit facilities as this will further balance agricultural production.</p> <p>However, considering various studies (Gartler, 2011 Veerakumareen, 2005; Ofuoku and Urang, 2011; Adetila, 2012; Ojako and Ogbulewa, 2012; and Okwoche, 2012) it is on this aforementioned explanation that informed the choice in the development of agricultural in Abaji Area Council.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>       <strong>Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>In general, this study set out to determine the extents to which the cooperative societies can contribute to the development of agriculture in the specific objectives are:</p> <p>1.      provide insight into the role cooperative societies plan in the development of agriculture in Abaji Area Council.</p> <p>2.      identify the types of agricultural cooperative societies in the Area Council </p> <p>3.      examine problems militating against cooperative activities in Abaji Area Council </p> <p>4.      examinethe forms of benefit members derive from cooperative societies in Abaji Area Council.</p> <p>5.      provide insight into the process through which the community and cooperative leaders can ensure genuine development of agriculture in the Area Council through cooperative societies</p> <p>6.      examinethe measures which all the levels of government will embark on to enhance the cooperatives for better development in Abaji Area Council. </p> <p><strong>1.4       Significant of the Study</strong></p> <p>In recognition of the worsening food situation in Nigeria, successive developments have instituted different policies, programmes and project directly or indirectly connected with agricultural production these programmes include, the National Accelerate Food Production Programme (NAFPP of 1973), the Nigeria Agricultural Cooperative Bank (NACB in 1973) transformed to Nigerian Agricultural and Rural Development Bank (NACRDB) in the year 2000 to reflect the rural nature of cooperative activities in Nigeria (FGN Budget, 2000), the Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund (ACGSF of 1976), the Agricultural Development Projects (ADPs in 1975), operation feed the Nation in 1976, the River Basin and Rural Development Authority (RBDA in 1976), the Green Revolution in 1976 and very recently presidential instructive on food production, National FadamaProgrammes among others.</p> <p>Despite these programmes, policies and schemes instituted by the government to improve agricultural development, the sectors remain backward. Moreover as governments around the world cut services and withdraw from regulating markets, there is the need to continuously evaluate strategy that involves the reorganization of rural producers into viable cooperatives (ICA 2007). Cooperative constitute the most appropriate instructional mechanism for reaching the million of scattered peasant producer in the rural areas for ensuring their access to suitable markets and credits sources for introducing new technologies; skills and development oriented attitudes; for protecting these peasant farmers from the exploitation of the middlemen and money lenders and for ensuring effective participation by the peasants in the development process (Njoku, 1998). In other words, cooperative are considered the most effective instruments for mobilizing the pleasant farmers for rural development and for ensuring that they benefit substantially from the development process.</p> <p>This study concentrates on variables of agricultural productivity that makes for agricultural development. This helps to trace the role of cooperatives to ownership of farm assets, enterprises assets, enterprise productivity and increase in farm income to determine their contribution to agricultural development. This study seeks to contribute to the emerging body of knowledge on how best to make agricultural cooperative to be more productive, it will deepen the understanding of the values and principles of cooperatives, incorporating them into competitive strategies relying on cooperation, trust loyalty as coordinating forces of economic activities and as sources of competitive difference in agricultural system.</p> <p>The underlying argument of the study is that cooperatives, based upon some principles represent a unique third way of social organization that enhances technology development and extension markets information and organization, and government policy, it is particularly useful in cases of simultaneous markets and government failure to assure adequate credit, input delivery, technology training, output delivery and social development in poor areas of Africa (Brayerman et al 1991). </p> <p>The findings of this study will help to suggest to government and non-governmental agencies how social institutions like agricultural cooperatives could overcome the problem of low agricultural productivity and betterment of living condition</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong>       <strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The spatial scope of this study is Abaji Area Council Abuja, FCT. The area council is made up of ten wards: Abaji Central ward, Abaji Southeast ward, Abaji Northeast ward, NukuSabon-Gari ward, Rimba-Ebagi ward, Yaba ward, Agyana ward, Alumamagi ward, Guridi ward and Gawu ward. </p> <p>The content scope of the study focuses on the influence agricultural cooperativeshave in gradual but sustained in substitution of local implement with improved or modern ones and local species with improved ones. That is gradual transformation from subsistence farming culture to commercial farming.</p> <p>The choice of the study area is centered on the fact that agricultural cooperative are better and efficiently organized in those areas. In addition, the study area is dominated by poor peasant farmers who come together with common goal of influencing the value-chain with respect to agricultural production, distribution, transfer and marketing. The study focused on agricultural cooperatives such as producers, consumers, marketing and multipurpose. Thrift and credit and not in any way cooperative in general.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong>       <strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The objectives of the study will be served with the following research questions: </p> <p>1.      What role do cooperative societies play in the development of agriculture in Abaji Area Council?</p> <p>2.      How many types of agricultural cooperative societies are in Abaji Area Council?</p> <p>3.      What are the problems associated with the cooperatives in Abaji Area Council?</p> <p>4.      What forms of benefits do members derive from the cooperative societies in Abaji Area Council?</p> <p>5.      What are the processes that community and cooperative leaders take to ensure genuine development of agriculture in Abaji Area Council?</p> <p>6.      What measures can government embark on to enhance cooperative development?</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO </strong></p> <p><strong>CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND REVIEW OF LITERATURE</strong></p> <p><strong>2.1       Conceptual Framework of the Study</strong></p> <p>There are some fundamental and technical concepts that demand for clarifications in the way they are being used in this study and they include: the concepts of development, cooperatives agricultural development.</p> <p><strong>2.2       Concept of Cooperative</strong></p> <p>The idea of people working together is the basis for the formation of cooperatives. The International Cooperative Alliance (ICA, 2010) as an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise. This definition emphasizes that cooperatives are based on the values of self-help, self-responsibility, democracy and equality (ICA 2007).</p> <p>Cooperative societies are community based, self co0ntrolled and self funded microfinance institution (Simkhada, 2001) because they are meant to operate at the micro level in most cases to serve the low level strata of the economy, to people who in most cases lack access to formal banking system.</p> <p>Cooperatives are financial organizations that are owned and controlled by the members and they provide savings and credit services to their members in the community (Sharma et al, 2005). Cooperatives are a form of microfinance institutions owned by group of people who are the members and they provide small scale financial services-majorly savings and loans just like any other microfinance institutions to their members. This is different from the formal microfinance institutions such as the microfinance banks (MFBs) in Nigeria which are meant to serve the general public. Cooperatives are voluntary associations that are member owned, self managed and democratically controlled within a specific location (Adebayo and Yusuf, 2004). The existence of cooperative in a community suggest that they may be location bound or restricted which also apply to some formal microfinance institutions especially the MFBs in Nigeria with the microfinance policy delineating the operational locations of MFB (CBN, 2005) either as a unit MFB or a state-wide MFB.</p> <p>Cooperatives are independent association of people who voluntarily unite to form a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise called cooperatives, to meet members’ economic, social and cultural needs (Henry and Schimmel, 2011). Cooperative can be seen as an arrangement designed to improve the lot of individuals and enhance micro and small scale entrepreneurs both in the rural and urban areas in mobilizing savings and accessing fund as loans as at when needed from the scheme. Cooperative societies are privately organized association of individuals of like minds who come together to operate a savings and loan programme among themselves (Oluyombo, 2010).</p> <p>Cooperative is therefore, owned and controlled by the member who voluntarily come together based on share on share value to meet members’ needs. Cooperative is an association of individuals who voluntarily formcooperative societies (Lohlein and Wehrheim, 2003) who are united in their quest for the economic benefits of the members. Cooperative can be an intervention based on social intermediation in which poor people can mobilize their savings, link them with credit and finally become self employed (Singh, 2004). The social intermediation in cooperative societies includes training of members on different areas of vocations, health, literacy, business record keeping and management skills as found necessary. Social intermediation also include support for member in trouble such as sickness and those having essential social function to perform such as burials and weddings.   </p> <p>Cooperative is one of a range of financialarrangement design to attract the poor as either borrower and/or savers (Montgomery and Weiss, 2005). Cooperative is a microfinance arrangement to help the low income earners with financial services that will enable them to create wealth without any discrepancy as to access financial and non financialservices that are packaged in a manner that enable those who are unable to access formal financial services to access comparatively small loans, saving schemes and other services for working capital and income generation (Nathan et al, 2004).</p> <p>Cooperatives are privately organized institutions that are owned and controlled by their members (Branch, 2004). One person, one vote is therefore applicable to cooperative societies because the association is jointly owned and by the members. There is uniformity in membership class of cooperative members, unlike ownership of a limited company that can comprise of ordinary shareholders and controlled enterprise (Alladadi, 2011). “They appear to be the most standardized informal financial institutions with well organized savings mobilization strategy in the informal market” (Oloyede, 2008)</p> <p>Cooperative societies, also known as credit cooperatives, credit unions, financial cooperatives, and savings and credit cooperatives could be government sponsored, members sponsored or programme sponsored (Ghosh and Maharjan, 2001; Simkhada, 2004). Those names of cooperatives are used interchangeably in this study to mean the same. The government sponsored cooperatives are cooperatives established, owned and funded by the government to accomplish it economic objectives. Cooperatives that are established and owned by the individual members of the cooperatives are regarded and owned by an existing organization which may be an NGO, bank, donor etc. with specific purpose of poverty eradication, target towards a particular group of people in specified location.</p> <p>Government of different nations defines and promotes cooperatives according to their own social, cultural and economic conditions. In America, a cooperative is a business owned and democratically controlled by the people who use its services and whose benefits are derived and distributed equitably on the basis of use (USDA, 1997). In New Zealand, Cooperative Companies Act (1996) defined cooperative as an organization in which those who transact with the organization also own and formally control the organization and derive significant benefits from those transactions over and above any financial returns they derive from their investment in the organization (Evans and Meade, 2006). In China however, the newly enacted farmers’ cooperatives law defined cooperatives as a self-help organization which associated voluntarily and controlled by producers of the same agricultural products or serviceproviders and users of the same agricultural business operations (Zhang, 1999).</p> <p>The definition of cooperatives is built on four major words; first, they are formed by groups of people, who have a specified need or problem. Second, the organization is formed freely by members after contributing to its assets. Thirdly, the organization formed, is governed democratically in order to achieve desired objectives on equitable norms, and fourth, it is an independent enterprises promoted, owned and controlled by people to meet their needs (DFID: 2008). It is about peoples’ organization to capture different opportunities in the economy where they can address their economic needs and aspirations. A cooperative can therefore provide a hub for organizing particular local economic interest and/or for protecting common pool resources (Simmons and Birchall, 2008a).</p> <p>Agricultural cooperatives can therefore be defined as voluntary business association formed by people (mostly farmers) of limited means through contribution of share capital that forms the basis of sharing out the profits that accrue from the business (Wanyama, et al 2008). In developed countries, rural cooperatives have significantly contributed to the mobilization and distribution of financial capital, created employment, and constituted a forum for education and training, social welfare and poverty alleviation and other socio-economic problems (Tanzanian Federation of Cooperatives, 2006). Agricultural cooperatives offer new opportunities for farmers to expand and strengthen their own organization to reach their full economic and social potential. It is an organization created by people of common felt need and means to help their members both from a business point of view, as they enable private farmers to benefit from economies of scale and stimulate competition, and from a social point of view, since they encourage cohesion and cooperation at the community level.</p> <p>There are three main types of cooperatives: </p> <p>(i)     Consumer Cooperatives that enable members to buy or obtain goods or services close to cost price.</p> <p>(ii)      Producer Cooperatives that enable members to achieve higher profits through reduced input costs and better marketing.</p> <p>(iii)    Worker or employee owned Cooperatives that provide members with opportunities for employment and skills improvement (UN, 2009). Irrespective of the type, the Cooperatives business model operates on the same values and principles that confer to their members the triple benefits of ownership, control and utility. Cooperatives are classified as business and social enterprises (UN, 2009). Many key international development agencies such as the UN, World Bank, ILO and FAO recognize the enormous current and potential contribution made by cooperatives as social and business enterprises in terms of economic development, development of social capital including social inclusion, social integration and cohesion, gender equity, democratization, equity (fairness and Justice), community development and environmental management (Birchall, 2008).</p> <p><strong>2.3</strong>       <strong>Agricultural Development</strong></p> <p>Agricultural development is an integral part of national development. It is that aspect of development that is related to agrarians. Considering the contribution of agriculture to the socio-economic development of many countries, several scholars have postulated theories linking agriculture with national development. Agricultural development is defined as the process that creates the conditions for the fulfillment of agricultural potential. Those conditions include the accumulation of knowledge and availability of technology as well as the allocation of inputs and output. Therefore, Agricultural development can be viewed as another area of development, which connotes improvement in the principles and practice of agriculture given both human and material resources that will result in maximum output from a combination of minimum input (Ashley and Maxwell, 2001).</p> <p>Agricultural development in Nigeria faces several constraints; the most critical of these include lack of appropriate technology, land tenure system, inputs problems, under developed marketing system, lack of finance and lack of coherent national policy framework. While most of these problems have generated a lot of interest and debate among academics and policy makers in Nigeria. Much still needs to be done by the government in establishing tentative development projects and programmes for the achievement of national objectives. Again the most crucial, is provision of deliberate frame work for policy consistency in the execution of such Agricultural development programmes(Nkang et al).</p> <p>Today when population is increasing so fast, there is the need to think more seriously about the improvement of farming methods in order to get increasing yield of food and raw materials to the society and industries. Afterall, (Komolofe and Joy, 1990) had remarked that Agricultural development basically means getting more out of soil in the farm of crops and breading more live stock in order to meet the word’s increasing needs. The things that need to be developed include the soil growing crops breading and raising farm animals, processing, packaging and storing.</p> <p>However, Todaro (2009) viewed Agricultural development as the transformation of agricultural sectors through three stages of agricultural production. The first is the low productivity, mostly subsistence pattern of production characterized by peasant farmers still prevalent in Africa. The second stage is diversified or mixed family agriculture, where a small part of the produce is grown for domestic consumption and a significant part for sale to the commercial sector as food in parts of Asia. The third stage represent the modern farm, with high productivity engaging in specialized Agricultural development can be described in terms of global but sustained transition from subsistence to diversified and specialized production.</p> <p>Again Agricultural development was recognized as agricultural modernization as you have in irrigation schemes employing innovative ideas, modern techniques that dramatically reduces hunger and poverty and diversified the economy (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, 2009). In the context of Nigeria, Agricultural development can be expressed as a gradual transformation from subsistence’s farming culture to commercial farming, from the use of inefficient farming methods to the use of more efficient farming methods and techniques. The process will involve the gradual substitutionof local species with improved ones.</p> <p>Agricultural development promotes the proper conditions for farming so that planting, harvesting and processing of crops can be done effectively, which ultimately can empower small holders and reduce poverty (World Bank, 2002). In Nigeria problems with roads and infrastructure interface with farmer’s ability to sell his or her goods. Communication is another component to agricultural practices. This is because in other for a farmer to know the type of crop they must yield to generate a profit, they need to know the market prices for the type of crops they are growing. Solving these problems is where agricultural development and government funding come into play. Example, until some developing nations adapt aggressive funding programmes to improveharvesting conditions, agricultural development is limited. There are endowments and foundations, however, which embark large sums of capital towards improving farming conditions in development nations. </p> <p>The implementation of new technology may require new forms of social organization such as regrouping of peasant in peasant’s associations to allow the distribution of inputs, and information on the application. These continue efforts may affect peasant values, and, subsequently, goes. If this plan is successful, peasants may change their cropping patterns in favour of crops which provide more profitable (Birchall, 2004). This has effects on other parts of the farm, and may for instance; cause a reduction of animal husbandry. If the proceeds of animal husbandry belong traditionally to the women, as in some societies, this affects the internal relation of the family.</p> <p>A change in land tenure affects in turn the power structure and may change the goal-setters in the societies and, thus, the relevant goals (Serag, 1995). This example could be elaborated further. It all resolves in the recognition that then system approach reflects most closely in development process, and projects and programmes aiming at one isolated element of the system are dysfunctional. It is true that it often is very difficult to countrified the influence of individual elements. This, however, most not prevent understanding development as a system of interrelated changes which requires integrated intend of isolated measures. Development is one of the main goals that all communities try to achieved in other improve the living standards of individuals in those communities (Muhamed, 2004). Agricultural cooperatives haveplayed an important role in rural development through development of agriculture. The agriculture cooperatives are considered to be the most important organizations that pay attention and try to support rural development in general and the agriculture development in particular through the activities and services achieved for the sake of farmers (Mohamed 2004).</p> <p>Levin (2002) remarked that although cooperatives are economic organizations in the first place, they also have social aims in addition to the economic ones they seek. They aim at developing the agricultural processes with its various fields as well as participating in achieving the rural development in villages. The role of the cooperative is not only confined to providing farm inputs such as fertilizers, seedling and chemical materials, but also engaged in symposiums for the farmers to acquire necessary knowledge and skills on new technology that aims at increasing agricultural production and promoting rural welfare. The cooperatives also seek to urge members to participate in social activities (UN, 1990)</p> <p><strong>The Role of Agricultural Cooperatives in Agricultural Development.</strong></p> <p>A cooperative is a widespread and important governance structure within the agricultural sector. The cooperatives sector worldwide is comprised of approximately 800 million members in over 100 countries and it’s estimated to account for more than 100 million jobs around the world (ICA, 2007). Agricultural cooperatives in particular, account for 80 to 90% of milk production in Norway, New Zealand and United States; 71% of fishery production in the republic of Korea; and 40% of agriculture in Brazil (ICA, 2007). </p> <p>Cooperatives are important form of organizational structure in many agricultural markets. For example, in the EU, cooperatives firms account for over 60% of the harvest, handling and marketing of agricultural products, with a turnover of approximately 210, 000 Million Euros (Gertler, 2001). Furthermore, over 50% of global agricultural output is marketed through cooperatives (Bibby &amp; Shaw, 2005). There are several benefits that farmers receive from being part </p>\n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FOOD PRODUCTION IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE INFLUENCE OF AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FOOD PRODUCTION IN NIGERIA", "id": 88}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The research work on the topic “improving Agricultural production through co-operative (A case study of  Ndokwa West L.

<p>Every student requires a particular institutional framework.  One of such framework of the student is the co-operative.  The word co-operative can have different interpretation.  In a layman’s language, it means working together on working mutually.  The second interpretation , which is where the emphasis means a special type of co-operative.  The co-operative has been defined by different schools of thought but the various in the degree of emphasis on one aspect or the other.</p> <p>The school of thought describes co-operative as business undertaking owned and operated by voluntary associations in order to provide themselves with work and wages or with goods and services.</p> <p>But the International Co-operative Alliance (I C A) defined co-operative as an autonomous association of persons, limited voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprises.  The role of co-operative in agricultural is an important topic of study but already much has been done by co-operators to justify its prime role of score securing economic and political development particularly in developed countries like England known for consumer co-operatives.  France known for industrial co-operative and Germany known for credit co-operative.  Co-operative movement is world wide phenomenon.  It has developed from simple traditional form(s) of mutual institution  of modern formally organized institution.  This institution gained world wide acceptance because of the grate role.  It has been playing in the economic development of various countries particularly in the developing countries.  The improvement of agricultural production through co-operative inevitable has social effects.  Co-operative management bring better yield which in turn yields better living standard, better housing, better  education for members and their families.  This economic success of co-operative society has been witnessed invaluably in co-operative studies.</p> <p>In Delta State, most inhabitants survive through and the main occupation is substantial farming, which attracted interest many co-operative societies, both existing ones and new initiated ones.  Improving the agricultural production was their main target and interest and at the same time lifting the level of its individuals.  Improvement target was both in size and qualities were poor and could not be marketed most of the crops having pest scales and most couldn’t grow well in other to produce as expected.  The product that were severely affected were yam tubers, cassava stems and tubers, cocoa yams, vegetables.</p> <p>1.2   STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>Nigeria had embarked on various programmes and  policies  costing hundreds of millions of naira aimed at reviving the depressed agricultural sector.</p> <p>In view of this, agricultural co-operative was instituted so as to organize the small scale farmers who are still involved in manual labour type of farming in co-operative and had failed to produce enough food for our teeming population thereby the country to be involved in importation of large quantity of food with a huge percentage decline in agricultural exports.</p> <p>All those governmental effort have not actually had much significant improvement in this sector as much emphasis now being placed on agriculture.  The call for urgent re-examination of the role of these agricultural production sure it’s aim of facilitating the attainment of self-sufficiency in agriculture and making agriculture to take its prime position in the national economy of this country in danger.</p> <p>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The general purpose of this project report is undertaken as a study of the existing farmers co-operative societies and their effects in improving the development of agriculture specify.</p> <p>Finally, the study has the following objective:</p> <p>(a)   To examine the organizational set and the operations of co-operative movement in Delta State with particular reference to Ndokwa west local government are co-operative societies, Delta.</p> <p>(b)  To examine the impact of the farmer co-operative and societies.</p> <p>(c)   To investigate the problems facing the farmers co-operative.</p> <p>(d)  To suggest pragmatic ways and means for enhancing the effectiveness of these societies main attempt to be as food production and assist in further research into contemporary issue on the matter.</p> <p>1.4   IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Agriculture is so importance in order to sustain any economy.  Moreover, co-operative using the agricultural sector, thus any effort geared towards carrying out research aimed at improving the agricultural production should be considered work while any suggestion on  the improvement of agricultural co-operatives should have bearing on the sector.  This is therefore the most appropriate time to study the agricultural sector concerning the prevailing economic condition of Delta state.</p> <p>Presently, our farmers are not adequately remunerated despite the fact they bend over double trying to make the state sufficient and self-reliant in food production.  They cannot compete with their counterparts in Nigeria not to talk of the part of the world.</p> <p>If they are organized in co-operative, increased productivity enhanced the profit maximized to them and then farming will once more look attractive.</p> <p>Based on the findings of this study and suggestions proffered it is strongly believed that the policy makers government would encourage our peasant farmers to voluntarily join the co-operative societies.  Moreover, healthy progrant and policies on co-operative and development would be mounted in addition, it would enable the manager of co-operative and organization to adequately organize the co-operative farmer for increased food production.  Furthermore, colleges of co-operatives, schools and researcher who wish to carry  out research in this field have been provided a springboard from where they can take off.</p> <p>1.5   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>1.     Does co-operative helps to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of agricultural production?</p> <p>2.     Does agricultural product helps to improve peoples standard of living?</p> <p>3.     To what extent has agriculture contributed tremendously to the overall development of economic of Nigeria?</p> <p>4.     How can you as a member of co-operative help to remedy some of the problems facing the development of co-operative society?</p> <p>5.     Does government show much concern to appreciate the work of co-operative in increasing productivity?</p> <p>1.6   DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>Most of their term (words or phrase that are used in this projects report may be unfamiliar or may have peculiar meaning and connotation.)</p> <p>These terms includes:-</p> <p>1.  Agricultural Productivity:  The index of the ratio of the value of the total form output to the value of the total input used in farm production.</p> <p>2.  Farm Management: The application of farming science and technology as the solution of the day to day problems facing the farms.</p> <p>3. Bye –Laws:  We  mean the registered bye-laws made by a co-operative society which governs the activities of such society and which is made by a society in the exercise of any power conferred by the co-operative laws.</p> <p>4. Small-scale Individual farmers:  This implies that a farmer whose total cultivable farm land is not more than hectares and whose farm labour requirement are largely supplied by his family, his sells are good in a localized market.  He requires low initial capital investment farms on small holdings with simple technology and at least 60% of his annual income from agriculture.</p> <p>5. Enofed:  This means Ndokwa west local government area co-operative federal limited.  It is the highest co-operative body in this state that gives supervisory to other co-operative bodies in the state.</p> <p>6. Co-operative Society:   It is a form of organization whereby people voluntarily associate together as human beings on the basis of equality for the promotion of the economic interests of themselves.</p> <p>7. Auxiliary Co-operatives:  This type provides individual service to members.  The co-operatives main function are to provide credit supply and market and storage the co-operative has no hand in the supervision and management affairs of member farm.</p> <p>8. Productive Type:  Here there is a full integration.  The co-operation absorbs all the member business enterprise that is members’ economic responsibilities are borne be the co-operatives is found in Delta, Ndokwa West Local Government Area.</p> <p>9. Production Promotion Co-operative:  This is co-operative by integration, the farmer depends on society for his production activities.  This is a strong link between the co-operative and members in areas of management marketing credit and decision making.</p>\n\n IMPROVING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION THROUGH CO-OPERATIVE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn

Cocoyam is vegetative propagated using the corms and to a lesser extent the cormels. As food for human consumption, the nutritional value parts of cocoyam is primarily caloric (Davis et al, 1992). The underground cormels provides easily digested starch; and the leaves are nutritious spinach like vegetable, which give a lot of minerals, vitamins and thiamine (Tambong et al, 1997).</p> <p>There are two major types commonly grown in Nigeria namely; colocasia spp and xanthosma spp. In Nigeria, it is regarded as a major crop especially in X2 female headed household. Nigeria is one of the largest producers of cocoyam in the world contributing about 40% of total annual production okinpshectares of land out of the total arable land of 27,900.00 hectares under cocoyam production.</p> <p>Cocoyam grows in association with other food and tree crops a system mostly practiced by subsistence farmers in Nigeria. The bulk of the production of cocoyam is in South East, Nigeria (Enyinnia, 2001). Cocoyam  is regarded as a major food crop in Nigeria especially in female headed households. Nwabuzor (2001) noted that cocoyam can be consumed in various forms when boiled, fried, pounded or roasted. It can also be processed into chips (“achicha”) which has a long shelf and provides food all year round especially during lean planting season (Asadu, 2006). Cocoyam leaves are also used as vegetable for preparing soup in various part of the world. There is a decline in the yields of cocoyam on the past few years. As population pressure on land continues to increases, the importance of cocoyam in ensuring household food security is given adequate recognition even through the present yield are still below expectation. This could be attributed to a lot of factors such as climate variation, drought, poor cultural practices among cocoyam growers, pest and diseases infestation (Ezenwu, 2010).</p> <p>Despite the usefulness of cocoyam corms and leaves in human nutrition, its production and processing in Nigeria is faced with a lot of challenges. Some of these challenges are the alarming rate of land degradation and lack of improved varieties for commercial cocoyam and leaf production. Decreasing rainfall and poor soil have also been identified as some of the challenges processing of cocoyam in Nigeria (Osagoe, 2006). Therefore, this study was carried out with the broad objective of ascertaining strategies for improving cocoyam production and processing among women farmers in Edo State, Nigeria.</p> <p>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>        In any human endeavour, there are bound to be some obstacle or hindrance in any of achieving exception to this general rule. Hence this research is designed to find out the problem and prospects of cocoyam production in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State.</p> <p>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>        The main aim of the study is to examine and appraise the problem and prospects of cocoyam production in our society, a case study of Ovia North East Local Government Area.</p> <ol><li>To know the number of farmer producing cocoyam in the local government area.</li> <li>To know the type of production system.</li> <li>Identifying problem of cocoyam production</li> </ol> <p>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>        It is a common practice in Nigeria and other West Africa countries especially in area lying within the rainforest belt with thick vegetation cover, the aim of management should be avoid excessive and inadequate level of farming system and maintains enough stock raw materials in period of short supply and anticipate price changes.</p> <p>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>        This study is centred on planning of cocoyam in our local government council (Ovia North East) with more emphasis on cocoyam production.

It is situated in the western part of Nigeria, and it lies on the rain forest belt of the vegetation. Naturally, it is endowed with fertile land for the cultivation of crops. Agriculture is not only concerned with the cultivation of the soil for the production of crops. The main comprehensive definition is that agriculture is concerned basically with the husbandry of crops and animals for food and for commercial purposes. </p> <p>Mechanized farming plays a vital role in Edo State especially in the development of the secondary and tertiary sectors. During the pre-civil war in Nigeria, the predominant occupation in Edo State was agriculture and it was the main stay of the Nigerian economy. Besides other types of occupation existed, these are teaching, printing, trading etc but agriculture outplays them all. Farming can be traced to the earliest traditional societies although yet primitive they often gather wild fruits and roots for food and throw off the seeds in their surroundings. Though this process of trial and error, cultivation of crops started in the dwelling food and shelter are basic necessities for human existences and both originated from farming activities, workers in the secondary and tertiary relies on farming for their final output.</p> <p>Also, mechanized farming provides empowerment into agricultural opportunity to the labour force through direct employment into agricultural and its interrelated industries and manufacturing sectors. For this sector contribute efficiently, there is the implementation of good management, marketing, adequate returns to farmers and the better utilization of land available and provision of storage facilities. The failure of the country to adopt these innovative practices is accountable for the current food shortages, high prices, mass unemployment, under utilization of industrial result of this failure. Even though the nation progressed, the proportion of agricultural contribution to the gross domestic product becomes thinner because of the predominant peasant system of cultivation. The system is also characterized by the use of simple system is also characterized by the use of simple tools like fertilizers, chemicals and improved seeds are not widely used by most farmers.          </p> <p>The poor performances of the agricultural sector to provide adequate food for the growing population declining, productivity of most export crops which has contributed to substantial reduction in foreign exchange earnings and the declining condition of farming to gross domestic product in real terms. The report of the food strategy mission estimated that in 1982, the supply and demand for all food crops was about 2.5 million metric tones and the projected gap for 1985 was about 4.7 million metric tones. The study group on food production provided more detailed estimate of gaps between projected demand and supply for various commodities. These are presented in table 1.1 below projected food supply and demand compared 000 metric tones.</p> <p>Commodity</p> <p>Projected DD 1985</p> <p>Domestic production projected SS 1985</p> <p>Gaps</p> <p>Rice</p> <p>1791</p> <p>975</p> <p>-816</p> <p>Maize</p> <p>2634</p> <p>2374</p> <p>-260</p> <p>Cassava</p> <p>13300</p> <p>10000</p> <p>-33000</p> <p>Groundnut</p> <p>560</p> <p>300</p> <p>-260</p> <p>Palm Oil</p> <p>1012</p> <p>578</p> <p>-434</p> <p>Sugar</p> <p>4,000</p> <p>80</p> <p>-3920</p> <p>Bean</p> <p>400</p> <p>156</p> <p>-244</p> <p>Poultry for eggs</p> <p>260</p> <p>200</p> <p>-60</p> <p>Poultry for meat</p> <p>250</p> <p>126</p> <p>-124</p> <p>Fish</p> <p>795</p> <p>595</p> <p>-200</p> <p>Yam</p> <p>848</p> <p>535</p> <p>-313</p> <p>Source: Nigerian Agricultural Sector Report (1988, pg 28).</p> <p>        As far as agriculture export are concerned, the data available shows that performance of the sub-sector is on the decline.

The farmers only produce for themselves and immediate families and the quantity of goods produced are grossly inadequate for the growing population. There is an increased wide-spread in the level of poverty amongst the people especially those living in the rural areas. Small scale farming had become the major way to tackle the problem of lack and poverty in this area. An odd growing situation of unemployment in recent years had led many f the rural/urban dwellers into small scale farming and today, the small scale farmers are known for their important and huge contributions to the Gross National product, they are currently the producers of about 98 percent of the food consumed in Nigeria with the only exception of wheat.</p> <p>        It is imperative for government, non-government agencies and cooperate individuals to help in ameliorating the problems that militates against the farming activities of these small scale farmers in order to enhance a better food and raw amterials supplies in and around the Nigerian environment. Over the years deliberate, though ineffective effort have been made by donors and government to bring about agricultural development without much to show for it much of the failure can be attributed to the adapted transformation approach to agriculture which is characterized by the introduction of a variety of large scale farming and producing technologies. It is however gratifying to note that there is new a shift in emphasis from the big scale transformation approach to the small scale improvement strategy approach which attuned to our age long farm practice.</p> <p>        Information is an essential ingredient in agricultural development programmes but Nigerian farmers seldom feel the impact of agricultural innovations either because they have no access to such information or because it is poorly disseminated. This research work is aimed at revealing the problems faced by small scale farmers in Ughelli-South in order to showcase them for possible solutions by the various arms of government, non-governmental organizations and interested individuals.</p> <p>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</p> <p>        A redirection of attention to agriculture had long-time been strategized by government and non-governmental agencies as the right antidote to the crises of unemployment in Nigeria, yet majority of the rural dwellers seek migration opportunities hence, compounding the general unemployment situation and food shortages in the country. An investigation to know the problems that have made individual (small scale) farming unattractive becomes imperative.</p> <p>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>        The purpose of this study is to ascertain the major problems that hiders the production activities of small scale farmers (crops and animals production) which when addressed will serve as a direct measure to food shortages and an indirect measure to the lingering problems of unemployment.</p> <p>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <ol><li>Does small scale farming significantly increase the income earned by the people of Ughelli South Local Government Area?</li> <li>Is small scale farming the main activity available to the people of Ughelli South?</li> <li>Had small scale farming been able to reduce unemployment in Ughelli South?</li> <li>Had the food production from small scale farming in this area been able to meet the general food demand of the dwellers of Ughelli South?</li> <li>Are young school leavers attracted to small scale farming in Ughelli South?</li> </ol> <p>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>        Rural-Urban migration due to unattractive/farming problems and unemployment had complicated life existence in the urban environment resulting in a high population density, increase in food demand and cost, traffic congestion amongst others.</p> <p>        This research work is set to provide informative hints on the problems in Ughelli South and also to provide useful information to government establishment aimed at improving farming and lives of the rural dwellers.</p> <p>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>        The investigation is limited to farmers that have farmed for at least three to four years within the study area in Arable Crop farming with cultivated fields of less than five-hectares, domestic animal rearers with less than five thousand fishes in their ponds and also, home-garden vegetable farmers scattered around in the local government area.</p> <p>DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <ol><li>Small Scale Farming: This is the type of agriculture created in a subsistence level, void of commercialization.</li> <li>Large-Scale Farming: this is a commercial type of agriculture it involves a large production of crops and animals intended for a widespread distribution to wholesalers or retail outlets.</li> <li>Gross-National Product: The total values of goods produced and services provided by a country during one year, it is usually the sum total of the gross-domestic product and the net product.</li> <li>Rural-Urban Migration: It refers to the movement of people from the rural areas to the urban (more developed) centres for the purpose of getting a better education, job, health facilities, wages and standard of living.</li> </ol>\n\nPROBLEM AFFECTING SMALL SCALE FARMERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEM AFFECTING SMALL SCALE FARMERS", "id": 92}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This work is designed to examine the problems faced by small farm holders in accessing loan facilities in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State.

Agricultural is very important to the economy of must developing countries of the world and because of this, a supply of adequate finance is essential for national well-being. Since agriculture is the back-bone of Nigeria economy providing employment to about 70% of its population yet this important sector has suffered neglect since the oil boom days. Agriculture has totally declined since the early 1970s Nigeria export crops such as groundnut, oil palm and cocoa have suddenly disappeared and the country is net importer of food crops. Agriculture recorded growth rate in 1975 at about 2.6% while the population grew at about 70% compared to 57.7% in 1993. The small scale farmers according to the National Agriculture Policy Document of Nigeria (NAPDN) constitute over 90% of the food and fiber requirement of Nigeria on the other hand 1% of farmers out put in Nigeria. But tend to have greater access to farmers inputs including credit or loans.</p> <p>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>        This study is to investigate and analyze the problems associated with obtaining credit financing agriculture production in Edo State it would be seen that many problem arise mostly are problems encountered by the farmers in the area.</p> <ol><li>The inability of the farmers to meet up with the collateral security required. By the commercial bank is a major problem hindering agriculture sector. This is as a result of farmers to deposit the collateral security before obtaining credit for agriculture development.</li> <li>High interest rate is another factor that discourages farmers from obtaining credit in most commercial banks, payment of interest involve when fund is borrowed.</li> <li>The low educational background of the farmers also constitutes hindrance in obtaining agricultural credit.</li> <li>The bureaucratic process involved in the process of obtaining credit or loans for agricultural purpose have not being encourage on the part of the farmers.</li> <li>Credit facilities are not easily accessible to small farm holders. It is not that the researcher intends to identify some of the hindering factor in order to proffer solution.</li> </ol><p>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>        The main purpose of this study is to find the major problems of obtaining credit of loans for financing agricultural production in Nigeria with particular reference to Edo State. The objectives of the studies are.</p> <ol><li>To identify the problem militating against adequate financing of agriculture.</li> <li>To enumerate and analyze the agriculture credit grant to farmers in recent years.</li> <li>To find out how much the commercial bank have helps in financing agriculture.</li> <li>To look at how agriculture has developed in Edo State.</li> <li>To create awareness of the problem posted by agricultural financing inadequacies.</li> <li>To investigate how these problems can be tackled.</li> </ol><p>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>        This research study will be important to that future researcher in the economy and agricultural science who would like to use it as reference materials or for further investigation.  </p> <p>        The study is to create awareness to farmers in Edo State, the reason of low agricultural production and also to bring to the notice of the general public loans for financing agricultural production in the locality.</p> <p>        It will form a good basis to the government for the formulation of policies. To serve as encouragement to those farmers in the area of study.</p> <p>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTION</p> <p>        Some questions to be tackled in the course of this study have been raised.</p> <ol><li>Is collateral security a problem of obtaining credit from commercial bank?</li> <li>Does high interest increase the incidence of bad debts?</li> <li>Does educational background hinder the potentials of obtaining credit?</li> <li>Is a credit facility accessible for small farm holders?</li> <li>Does bureaucratic process pose a lot of problem in obtaining loan to farmers?</li> </ol><p>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>        The study is aimed at providing detailed knowledge and understanding of the operation function and to determine the problems of obtaining loans for financing agricultural production in Edo State through the Federal Government Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme (FGACGS) found since 1977 with the view of providing useful suggestion to ease the problem of agriculture development in Nigeria it is directed towards the application of problems obtained for financing agriculture view of this more emphasis will be placed in the success of credit facilities lending procedure as a criteria of measurement.        </p> <p>          The performance of the commercial banks in the regard will be assessed by using the present farmer’s areas to the agricultural credit facilities as well as the hindrance which the small farm holders face in obtaining loans from financial institutions.</p> <p>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>Credit: This is the process of obtaining control over the use of money, goods and services with promise to repay at a future data.                   </p> <p>Agricultural finance: This means way and means by which a farmer obtains the entire necessary fund required in order to carryout agricultural production.</p> <p>Interest: This means the price paid for the use of borrowed money and is usually expressed as a present on annuals basis.</p> <p>Collateral: This means anything offered as a promised of loan repayment to be given to a lender in case of non-payment.</p> </div>\n\nAPPRAISAL OF THE PROBLEMS FACED BY SMALL FARM HOLDERS IN ACCESSING LOAN FACILITIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " APPRAISAL OF THE PROBLEMS FACED BY SMALL FARM HOLDERS IN ACCESSING LOAN FACILITIES", "id": 93}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Bush burning removes the natural vegetation cover that protects the soil surface.

In general and in Okada in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State in particular bush burning generally is the method of removing the natural vegetable from the surface of the soil by setting fire on debris. Bush burning causes serious damage to trees and crops, its effect of public concern which should not be for farmer alone and should be handled with seriousness, practice of burning of fire could also lead to accidental burning of his land and other properties at his disposal, this ideals of burning his farm came to him with the food that fire has left behind after roasting his food, fire spread and destroyed all that was left behind in the environment. </p> <p>Burning the farmland for the cultivation of crops has a remarkable effect on the soil fertility. During burning process some nutrients that are highly needed by the plants are lost out in form of gasses such nutrient include phosphorous, nitrogen and sulphur. The ash which is the principle products of burnt material although rich in phosphorous, nitrogen and potassium can be easily washed away by rain. The heat produced during burning creates an unfavourable condition for activities of the soil organism such as earthworms, bacteria etc.       </p> <p>He also found out the seed of fruits he has eaten and thrown off has grown in his burnt land and as a result of this included burning in his farm system. The practice of burning can be traced back of about 2000 years ago, it was discovered that most of the vegetation debris after clearing, especially on a large scale farming and small scale farms. Apart from burning the land for cultivation purpose animals are also trapped.  </p> <p>1.2    PURPOSE OF STUDY</p> <p>Bush burning has become part and parcel of the activities of farmers in this area. The negative effects are not considered at all. Hence it is important to highlight these for the farmers to experience and observe the dangerous effects of bush burning as it affect the soil as a whole.</p> <ol><li>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</li> </ol><p>Since bush burning is the major lands preparation practice, it is important to study the effect of bush burning on agricultural lands and also to carryout investigation on how far bush burning has affected agricultural land in Okada in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State and possibly find alternative measure to avoid bush burning.    </p> <ol><li>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</li> </ol><p>The scope of this project is limited to Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State, some important towns and villages in Ovia North East Local Government Area such as Ekiadolor Town, Evboneka, Ughoton etc where farming operation is carried extensively and that burning issues form the scope of my study.

The study answers the following questions;</p> <p>1.           Does bush burning have effect on farm crop or plant?</p> <p>2.           Does bush burning reduce the effect of weed or a measure to control weed?</p> <p>3.           Is burning to fight against pest?</p> <p>4.           Do you consider bush burning as the cheapest method of land preparation?</p> </div>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF BUSH BURNING ON AGRICULTURAL LAND<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF BUSH BURNING ON AGRICULTURAL LAND", "id": 94}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This research was carried out in order to assess the causes and effects of deforestation in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State. the researcher collected his information by distributing questionnaire to the people living in Ovia North East Local government Area in Edo State and to the Ministry of Agriculture Department of forestry in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State. The information gathered were analyzed and presented in percentages. From the analysis, the researcher was able to identify the following. That it is only the government that can arrest the problem of deforestation. Deforestation can also lead to animal extinction That people resort to illegal felling of trees because employment opportunities are lacking elsewhere. Based on these findings the researcher made recommendations among which are; The government should employ more field staff to combat illegal entry destruction of forest production. These field staff should be made to carry arms while on duty patrol, not only to safeguard themselves but also to instill some fear on timber thieves. The use of village elders in guiding against illegal deforestation should be encouraged.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENT</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <ol><li>Introduction</li> <li>Background to the study</li> <li>Statement of the problem</li> <li>Objective of the study</li> <li>Research questions</li> <li>Significance of study</li> <li>Scope and limitation of the study</li> <li>Definition of terms</li> </ol><p>CHAPTER TWO </p> <ol><li>Literature review</li> <li>Definition and origin of deforestation</li> <li>Review of some factors responsible for deforestation in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State</li> <li>Effect of deforestation</li> <li>Proposed solution to deforestation</li> <li>Man and his environment</li> </ol><p>CHAPTER THREE       </p> <p>Methodology</p> <ol><li>Population</li> <li>Sampled sampling techniques</li> <li>Research instrument</li> <li>Method of data collection</li> <li>Method of data analysis</li> </ol><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>Data presentation and analysis</p> <ol><li>Discussion of results</li> </ol><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <ol><li>Summary, Conclusion and Recommendation</li> <li>Summary</li> <li>Conclusion</li> <li>Recommendation</li> </ol><p>REFERENCES    </p> <p>QUESTIONNAIRES    </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>The year 2011 is ‘The International Year of Forests’. This designation has generated momentum bringing greater attention to the forests worldwide. Forests cover almost a third of the earth’s land surface providing many environmental benefits including a major role in the hydrologic cycle, soil conservation, prevention of climate change and preservation of biodiversity (Sheram, 1993). Forest resources can provide long-term national economic benefits. For example, at least 145 countries of the world are currently involved in wood production (Anon., 1994a). Sufficient evidence is available that the whole world is facing an environmental crisis on account of heavy deforestation. For years remorseless destruction of forests has been going on and we have not been able to comprehend the dimension until recently. Nobody knows exactly how much of the world’s rainforests have already been destroyed and continue to be razed each year. Data is often imprecise and subject to differing interpretations. However, it is obvious that the area of tropical rainforest is diminishing and the rate of tropical rain forest destruction is escalating worldwide, despite</p> <p>increased environmental activism and awareness.</p> <p>Deforestation is the conversion of forest to an alternative permanent non-forested land use such as agriculture, grazing or urban development (van Kooten and Bulte, 2000). Deforestation is primarily a concern for the developing countries of the tropics (Myers, 1994) as it is shrinking areas of the tropical forests (Barraclough and Ghimire, 2000) causing loss of biodiversity and enhancing the greenhouse effect (Angelsen et al., 1999). FAO considers a plantation of trees established primarily for timber production to be forest and therefore does not classify natural forest conversion to plantation as deforestation (but still records it as a loss of natural forests). However, FAO does not consider tree plantations that provide non-timber products to be forest although they do classify rubber plantations as forest. Forest degradation occurs when the ecosystem functions of the forest are degraded but where the area remains forested rather cleared (Anon., 2010). Thirty per cent of the earth’s land area or about 3.9 billion hectares is covered by forests. It was estimated that the original forest cover was approximately six billion hectares (Bryant et al., 1997). The Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, the United States of America and China were the most forest rich countries accounting to 53 per cent of the total forest area of the globe. Another 64 countries having a combined population of two billions was reported to have forest on less than ten per cent of their total land area and unfortunately ten of these countries have no forest at all. Among these countries 16 are such which had relatively substantial forest areas of more 1than one million hectares each and three of these countries namely Chad, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Mongolia each had more than ten million hectares of forest. The forest area remained fairly stable in North and Central America while it expanded in Europe during the past decade. Asian continent especially in India and China due to their large scale afforestation programme in the last decade registered a net gain in forest area. Conversely the South America, Africa and Oceania had registered the net annual loss of forest area (Anon., 2010; 2011a).</p> <p>The forest is a good source of food, income, ecological resources, social and cultural features, as well as physical facilities like power and building materials. Other functions of the forest are prevention of erosion, as well as the provision of essential habitat for wildlife to survive. Hence, the necessity to conserve the forest and the biodiversity therein. In addition to conserving biological and cultural diversity, it is now widely recognised that many protected areas also have important social and economic functions. These include protecting watersheds, soil and coastlines, providing natural products for use on a sustainable basis, and supporting tourism and recreation (Lee et. al, 2003). Studies in China have also confirmed that medical herb production is a big business and that the suppliers have chosen to invest in forest protection and reforestation in order to guarantee future supplies (see Chen, 1983 and Hou, 1994 for greater details).</p> <p>In spite of the multi-various usefulness of the forest resources, rapid population growth and changes in land uses have put the forest resources under pressure. For instance, Poore 1989 opined that majority of logging operations in tropical countries are considered unsuitable and damaging. The widespred failure of forest governamnce – characterized by illegal logging, associated illegal trade, and corruption-directly undermines sustainable economic growth, equitable development, and environmental conservation. It puts at risk poor and forest-dependent populations, which rely on timber and non-timber forest products; undermines responsible forest enterprises by distorting timber and reducing profitability; and results in a loss of govenrment revenue that could be invested in sustainable forest management or general economic development (World Bank, 2006). The major determinants of deforestation are the available natural resources in an area, how the resources are being used, traditional beliefs and myths, conflicts in the use of resources, population pressure, vis-a-vis the problem of pollution (soils, air or water). According to Meyer and Turner (2009), societies have profoundly altered their environments in the pursuit of wealth and power have been punished by environmental catastrophes (natural and man-induced). They opined further that world forest area has been reduced by some 20 percent and a large area of land converted from its original vegetation cover to cropping. The major cause of deforestation are increasing demand for housing and infrastructural facilities, crop and timber export, poor agricultural practices cutting of fuel wood for urban areas, head loading (cutting of fuel wood for sale), forest fires, logging, and overharvesting. Other causes are overgrazing, road construction, dam construction, as well as careless exploitation of forest resources. A large empirical literature exists on the consequences of deforestation (see Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994; Western, 1999; Johnston, 1989; Bruijnzeel, 2004; and Brookfield, 1992). Deforestation is responsible for damage to habitate, biodiversity loss and aridity, extinction of rare species of plants and animals, climate change, environmental destruction and the subsequent damage to the sensitive living balance of the ecosystem. Also, empirical studies have confirmed that if we cannot look after the forest they will soon disapper (see Brockington, 2007; Hyde and Sedjo, 1992; Waston et al, 1998; Colin, 2001 and Khare et al, 2000). The threat to timber resources is being combated in most countries by vigorous afforestation. In addition, many have adopted stringent forestry laws, as in Norway and Sweden, to prevent waste, and elsewhere, experiments are taking place to find alternative materials for making paper (Whynne-Hammond, 1979).</p> <p>Other strategies of combating deforestation are the use of alternative sources of energy other than fuel and charcoal, sustainable agricultural practices rather than slash and burn method of farming, land management, avoidance of indiscriminate bush burning, as well as promulgation and enforcement of environmental laws and forest policies. Likewise, mitigating deforestation entails forest conservation, protection of endangered species, as well as the promotion of ecotourism. These are the measures of achieving sustainable development.</p> <p>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>The indiscriminate felling of trees in our forest and the attitude of the people in Oredo Local Government Area, Edo State towards our forest has necessitated a massive scale and the people seem to be unaware of its consequences. This study therefore is geared towards finding solutions to some of the problems of deforestation. This study intends to find out the following problems;</p> <ol><li>Do deforestation lead to flooding</li> <li>What are the causes of deforestation in Oredo Local Government Area, Edo State?</li> <li>Is deforestation cause by lack of proper management of forest?</li> <li>What are the measures being made to control deforestation?  </li> </ol><p>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The aims of the study are;</p> <ol><li>To identify the causes of deforestation in Oredo Local Government Area.</li> <li>To identify the problems created by deforestation in Ovia North East Local Government Area.</li> <li>To assess the attitude of people of Ovia North East Local Government Area towards the existing forest.</li> <li>To assess the efforts made by the government to reduce the problems of deforestation. </li> </ol><p>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>1.   Does deforestation cause flooding?</p> <p>2.   Does expansion of farmland lead to deforestation?</p> <p>3.   Does overgrazing lead to deforestation?</p> <ol><li>Does urbanization/industrialization lead to deforestation?</li> <li>Does Overpopulation and poverty lead to deforestation?</li> </ol><p>6.   Does deforestation lead to climate change?</p> <ol><li>Does deforestation lead to decreased biodiversity, habitat loss and conflicts?</li> <li>Does deforestation have any social consequences on the people?</li> </ol><p>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The fact that our forest is one of the beauties of nature and an effect means of controlling erosion, man has in either consciously or unconsciously and indiscriminately too. If no efforts are made to guard this, the younger generation may find it very difficult to know what a natural forest look like. They may also be denied of good forest produce for their economic needs and uses. Hence the effort being made by the government in preserving and consolidating the forest in form forest resources is highly impressive.</p> <p>The study is of importance in that it will enlighten the leaders and the public of our obligation of the forest. To point out the importance of forest to guide against erosion. It will also aid government and forestry officials on how to protect our forest.</p> <p>The study is of immense importance of the people of Oredo Local Government Area in the sense that to clearly preserve the forest and also on how to plant trees to check erosion.   </p> <p>SCOPE OF THE STUDY:</p> <p>The study is set out to determine the causes and effect of deforestation in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State. Therefore, the study is restricted to both men and women in the Local Government Area of Study. Respondents include students, teachers, civil servants, youths, and drivers.</p> <p>DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>Deforestation</p> <p>Urbanization</p> <p>Industrialization</p> <p>Infrastructure</p> </div>\n\nPROBLEMS OF DEFORESTATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS OF DEFORESTATION", "id": 95}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The research was carried out in Ovia South West Local Government Area and data was also collected from some produce marketers such as Ehomike Food Venture, the Martye Green World venture, Ighile Mojo Farm, Okomu Oil Palm Company Plc and Visco Farm Shop. From the result gathered, it shows that there is need for government to ensure constant deregulation of fuel to every states and local government of the federation, regulating the rate of increasing fuel and to arrest all forms and conditions that could easily lead to fuel scarcity which will have negative effects on farm produce. Finally, result gotten also shows that individual have to desist from all forms of fuel hoarding and vandalization of fuel pipes could threaten the availability of fuel in t he circulation which could at least bring untold hardship on the society by way of increasing price of food as a result of high cost of production and transportation from where it was produced to the market. It was recommended that, government should monitor marketers from diverting fuel met for our country to other countries and also government should built more refineries to ensure surplus of fuel in circulation.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENT</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE                                               </p> <ol><li>Introduction</li> <li>Statement of problem</li> <li>The purpose of the study</li> <li>Hypothesis</li> <li>Scope of the study</li> <li>Background of the study</li> </ol><p>CHAPTER TWO           </p> <p>2.0 Review of related literature</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>3.0 Research methodology</p> <p>3.1 Research Design</p> <p>3.2 Population of the study</p> <p>3.3 Sample of the study</p> <p>3.4 Research instrument</p> <p>3.5 Method of data collection</p> <p>3.6 Method of data analysis </p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>4.1    Data Presentation</p> <p>4.2    Data Analysis</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE:        </p> <p>5.0    Summary and Conclusion</p> <p>5.1    Recommendation</p> <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> <p>QUESTIONNAIRE     </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1    BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>        The aim of this project is to in-deptly looked into the adverse effect of fuel scarcity on farm produce as a case study in Ovia South East Local Government with a view to make known much to individual and the  government on how much this development has taken it heavy toll on farm produce in both marketing and cultivation as well as how this trend can be put under control.</p> <p>        Until the early 70’s the main stay of Nigeria economy was Agriculture. Then the country (Nigeria) was fame for her proficiency in the production and exportation of groundnut, oil palm, cocoa beans, pepper, sugar cane, kola nut, bitter kola, cassava and so many other produce. These produce were known to be the only source of income to Nigeria.</p> <p>        Not until 15th January (1958) when oil was discovered in Nigeria specifically Okolobiri in Bayelsa state, this discovering of oil in commercial quantity brought about radical change in the economy of the nation (Nigeria) all other sectors seemed to have gone into extinction, indeed were abandoned therefore making the country to become totally dependent on crude oil for foreign exchange earnings, not agriculture anymore. But with about 166.2 million people in Nigeria today, it’s certain that man must eat, clothes himself and will also need to satisfy one or more needs from farm products. For agriculturalist to carter for these numbers by producing food for sales, and reserve for the next planting seasons, the practice of producing food in bulk in agriculture must change from mere subsistence farming system to mechanization. The term mechanization means the practice of agriculture by way of using modern machines to facilitate farm works and to maximize product within a short period of time.</p> <p>        It’s not gainsay to say that modern farm machines depends on fuel to function because our modern global food system is highly oil dependent  even though petroleum is getting higher daily and becoming less and less affordable. And it’s also all true that virtually every operation in agriculture totally depends on machines.</p> <p>        According to normal .J. (2000) in a book titled “Eating oil” he said that the modern commercial farm miracle that feed all of us and much of the rest of the world is completely depend on the flow, processing and distribution of oil.</p> <p>        He further added oil refined for gasoline and diesel is critical to run the tractors, combines and other farm vehicles and equipment that plant, spray the herbicides and pesticides and harvest/ transport food and seed, and more  also, it’s all true virtually every operation carry out in nowadays agricultural practice depends on machines beginning from bush clearing, wood feeling, soil plugging, harrowing, fertilizer application, harvesting, application of pesticides, grading of products transportation and so many others areas. If these aforementioned areas suffered west back as a result of fuel scarcity, you will agree with me that at the of the day, nothing will be done to produce food or farm product that will be equal to carter for the upsurge population, or if fuel that is supposed to be available and affordable to power these areas. Earlier mentioned is not easily gotten, or gotten at a very high cost, it’s certain that the  little that will be produce at the end of the day as a result of fuel scarcity will now take it tolls on the selling price. Even the farmers that does rely on his strength to produce food for sale will equally have his own share of fuel scarcity as it will not go down well with the price of food production haven’t spent much money on transportation fro farm to the market is expected that this development will hike up the price of produce supplied to the market and this will in no doubt bring.</p> <p>        What is scarcity? According to Adams Smith (1989) define scarcity as the limited supply resources which are used to the satisfaction of unlimited want. With this, fuel scarcity can be defined as a limited supply of fuel which is used for the satisfaction of unlimited want.</p> <p>        According to Lionel Robbins (1990) scarcity as the fundamental economic problems of having seemingly unlimited human want in a world of limited resources. The event of 2nd January, 2012 substantiate the claim that fuel scarcity in no doubt is one of the greatest factor that triggered off the inflation of farm produce/products in the market today, following the pronouncement of the federal government of Nigeria that oil subsidy has been removed thereby bringing the price of fuel of 97 naira a liter as against the former pump price of 65 naira a liter. Few days after subsidy has been removed the price of produce/products skyrocket in which live, chicken that was sold between 1,500-2000, now goes for between 3,000-4,500 live goats that was used to be sold 7,000-8,500 is now sold for between 15,000-18000 while a bag of rice that was formally sold for between 6,000-7,500 now goes for between 12,000-14,000 likewise many other farm produce/products had witnessed tremendous change in price up till now, all that goes up, refuses to come down, and if the prove of fuel keep going up in the name manner, you will find out that almost all farm and agricultural produce/products will be price out of the reach of the common man and if nothing is done to check this situation on ground, certain the common man on the street and the entire society will soon be engulfed in hardship.</p> <p>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>        In recent time, fuel scarcity has become a strong determinant of the price of produce/products of agriculture in the market, with this, it is important that the government should take a proactive measure in tackling fuel scarcity. Also, many people thing that it is because many young people has refuse to go into farming that is solely responsible for the daily increase in the price of food and other agricultural related products but this research seek to find out the adverse effect of fuel scarcity on agricultural products/produce and to suggest possible ways of profiling solutions on it.</p> <p>        The researcher intend to identify some areas that the government should keenly look into in order to avoid fuel scarcity, such as constant deregulation of fuel products to every state steadily so as to make the product available and affordable for farmer who use fuel for carrying out farming activities, to severely fight against the division of fuel products by fuel marketer and to set out a severe penalty against those who indulge in vandalizing fuel pipe  line, which reduces the target of the nation and to also put in place measure to avoid people working in oil producing company from going on strike.</p> <p>1.3    RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <ol><li>Could there be a specific time of adverse effect on agricultural produce/products as a result of fuel scarcity?</li> <li>Does fuel scarcity affect the production of agricultural produce/products?</li> <li>Does fuel scarcity reduce the amount of farm produce?</li> <li>Does increase of transportation of food contributes to increase in selling price of food?</li> <li>Does modern agricultural practice depend on fuel?</li> <li>Does fuel scarcity increase the price of food?</li> </ol><p>1.4    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The main purpose of this study is to identify the problems associated with the increase in the price of agricultural produce/products in the market, its also met to identify ways to reduces this trend.</p> <p>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>        This study or research will be of immense benefit to the government because if there is fuel scarcity.

Rice is an annual crop and the most important stable food crop in tropic countries; commercially it is the most important cereal after wheat. It is widely consumed and there is hardly any country in the world where it is not utilized in one form or the other.</p> <p>        In Nigeria rice is one of the few food items whose consumption has no cultural, religious ethnic or geographical boundary. It is available in five stars hotels in the big city and towns as well as the “most local” of the eating places in the remotest villages throughout the country. It is highly priced and widely accepted for festivity. In some rural areas, it is so adored that if is eaten only on Sundays and sometimes on market days.</p> <p>        But unfortunately, the cultivation and production of this highly priced and very important food crop is dwindling consequently, the price has gone beyond the reach of majority of Nigerian’s. In order to stem the decline in the number of farmers participating in rice farming and at the same time increase the production of all staple food crops, the Federal Government introduced a number of agricultural development programmes/project among wish are Operation Feed the Nation (OPN), Green, Revolution National Accelerated Food Production Programmes (NAFPP), Directorate of Food, Roads and Rural Infrastructures (DFRRT) and new Agricultural Development Programme (ADP), River in and Rural Development Authorities (RBRDA) and Nigeria Agricultural co-Operative and Rural Development Bank to mention but a few. Irrespective of these programmes/project and other schemes and improvement in infrastructural facilities, food crop (especially rice) productions have persistently remained below market demand.</p> <p>        In the light of the above, conscious and effective efforts will be made to thoroughly examine and study the production as well as the financing of this production processes of rice, the problems and the prospect of rice production in Nigeria a specified study of Owan East Local Government Area Gomezka (2001).</p> <p>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>        The problem that prompted this research work is the need to investigate the major knowledge attitude and bring to light and understanding after proper research, how the production of rice in Nigeria, Edo State and in the Owan Eastern region is been managed, the problems and the prospective involved. The following significant questions come to mind.</p> <ol><li>The various sources of finance for rice.</li> <li>The basic problems faced by the processes of producing rice.</li> <li>How the climatic, biotic and abiotic factors in Edo State Owan East Local Government Area support the cultivation of rice there.</li> <li>How rice production in Edo State affects the distribution of rice in the country, Nigeria.</li> </ol> <p>This and with many of others the researcher hopes to examine with a notion to evaluating this unwholesome vices.</p> <p>1.3 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>        For the purpose of the research, the following research questions have been formulated to guide the study.</p> <ol><li>What are the various source of finance for the cultivation and production of rice?</li> <li>What are the basic problems associated with producing rice?</li> <li>Does the climatic, biotic and abiotic factors in Edo State supports the cultivation of rice there?</li> <li>Does the production of rice in Edo State, especially in Owan East L.G.A affects the distribution of rice in the country, Nigeria?</li> </ol> <p>1.4 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>          The purpose of this research work include;</p> <ol><li>Examine the knowledge and attitude involved with the financing of rice production in Edo State, Owan East L.G.A.</li> <li>Identify the problems involved with the production of rice.</li> <li>Highlight the prospects of rice production.</li> </ol> <p>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</p> <p>        In the world today, rice is one of the most important annual crop. This crop can be cultivated subsistent and both commercially, it can be planted and cultivated by the poor and also the rich, in a small scale of farmland or in a large scale of farmland. This study or research work should be of significance to students in enabling them (students) acquire every necessary knowledge, skills, values and information involved with producing rice.</p> <p>        It will also help already existing cultivators or farmers of rice to improve on their cultivation farmers wanting to endeavour in rice production, this research work will make available all the necessary information for the production of rice. This information will entail the method of cultivation, propagation, processing, planting, harvesting of rice etc.</p> <p>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>Finance: The management of money and other assets.</p> <p>Production: The act of making creating.</p> <p>Integral: Constituting a whole together with other parts or factors.</p> <p>Infrastructure: An underling base or foundation especially for an organization or system.</p> <p>Utilized: To use something.</p> <p>Persistently: Refusing to let go or give up.</p> <p>Climatic: Relating to or influenced by climate (weather conditions)</p> <p>Biotic: pertaining to life or living organisms.</p> <p>Abiotic: Non-living, inanimate.</p>\n\n AGRICULTURAL FINANCING OF RICE PRODUCTION IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  AGRICULTURAL FINANCING OF RICE PRODUCTION IN NIGERIA", "id": 97}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY Oil palm, Elaeis guineensis is believed to be indigenous to West Africa. In Africa, wild palm groves are found mainly in a 300 to 500 hundred kilometers wide Western coastal belt stretching from Gambia to Angola and extending inland toward the East as far as the equator in the region of the great Lakes (Omereji, 2005). Oil palm is a perennial plant which belongs to the family palmae, subfamily cocoideae and are of three basic types (varieties) namely the dura type, tenera type and the pisifera type, (Opeke, 2005). Oil palm is a low land crop although it can grow well up to an altitude of 900m. It has fibrous root system and prefers deep fertile well-drained soil; require plenty sunshine, thus productivity reduces drastically when subjected to areas with excessive humidity. The oil palm has large compound leaves (fronds), unbranched stem, fibrous root system, the oil palm fruit is a sessile drupe and consist of a leathery exocarp, fleshy oily mesocarp and a hard endocarp (shell) which encloses the kernel (seed) (Udoh, et. al., 2005).</p> <p>A well ripe oil palm fruit changes in colour of the fruit. The changes in colour at ripening which may be from black to red, green to reddish orange with greenish tip, from white to pale yellow, depends on the type of oil palm fruit.</p> <p>(Udoh, et. al., 2005) also discussed various agronomic practices involved in oil palm production including:- nursery establishment, time of planting, nursery maintenance, transplanting, pest and disease control, fertilizer application, harvesting and processing of palm fruits. However this research will dwell much on the processing of the oil palm fruit.</p> <p>PROCESSING OF OIL PALM FRUITS Oil palm fruits, after harvest are processed into various products including: – palm oil, palm kernel, fibre, kernel cake, shell etc. There are basically two methods of oil palm fruit processing as identified by Udoh et. al., 2005. (i) Traditional Method: – This include • Collection of fruits bunches from the field. • Cutting of bunches into pieces (Spikelets). • Fermentation • Stripping to separate out clean fruits. • Boiling/sterilization of fruits in large drums. • Milling/pounding in mortars or buried drums. • Separation by hand to remove nuts from the oily fibres (mesocarp). • Pressing of fibres to remove oil. • Clarification to separate oil from water and dirt. • Storage/marketing of products.</p> <p>(ii) Modern method of processing This involves:- • Sterilization: – This can be carried out in pots, drum or sterilization chambers. It is achieved by boiling to soften the fruits. It also disinfects the fruits and inhibits the action of lipophytic enzymes.</p> <p>• Stripping: The removal of fruit from sterilized or quartered bunches. The stripped fruits are reboiled for about 30 – 45 minutes before milling.</p> <p>• Digesting (Milling of Fruits): The pounding of sterilized fruits to separate the mesocarp from the kernel (de-pulping).</p> <p>• Pressing or Extraction: The pounded mass is then loaded into a press and oil is extracted with the use of a screw press, hydraulic press or centrifugal press.</p> <p>• Clarification: This is the removal of water from the oil. It is achieved by boiling and skimming. • Storage in Containers and Marketing</p> <p>According to Ndon (2006), oil palm is the second most important source of vegetable oil in the world, oil palm produces seven times more vegetable oil per hectare than other oil yielding crops such as soybean. Palm oil, an essential product obtained in oil palm fruits processing is an integral component of meals in West Africa as well as being used for diverse industrial purposes, (Onyeka, 2002). Other palm produce include palm kernel which are further processed to kernel oil, used for medicinal purpose and kernel cake which are possible raw material for livestock feed production. Kernel shell and fibre are used as fuel source for cooking. The oil palm is an environmentally friendly crop which is also efficient in its utilization of land resources and inputs for the manufacture vegetable oil.</p> <p>According to Olagunju (2008), between 1961 and 1965, world oil palm production was 1.5 million tons, with Nigeria accounting for 43%. However, since then, oil palm production in Nigeria has virtually been stagnated. But today, world oil palm production amount to 14.4 million tons, with Nigeria as one of the largest producers in West Africa accounting for only 7%. Kei et. al. (1997) compared the characteristic of the palm sectors in Malaysia and Nigeria and found out that Malaysia’s success is built on plantation management together with processing in large modern method or technique. The plantation mode of production is characterized by large scale mono-culture under unified management. conversely in Nigeria, 80% of production comes from dispersed small holders who harvest semi wild plants and used manual processing techniques. Several million small holders are spread over an estimate area of 1.65 million hectares in Southern part of Nigeria.</p> <p>In different agro-ecological zones of Nigeria, women are predominantly engaged in the processing of oil palm fruit. Report has it that women are responsible for at least 70% food production in Africa and are as well important in marketing cash crop and livestock (Ibekwe, 2008). Adeyeye (1984) noted that women spent about 1.4h daily in food processing vis-à-vis only 0.25h spent by men on similar activity. Still in comparing female labour with that of the male counterpart, Ibe and Nweke (1981), Onah (1987) and Ogbonna (1989) indicated that female labour are more productive than male labour in food processing and also that women account for more than half of the labour force in oil palm processing.</p> <p>Before the boom in crude oil sector which has become the mainstay of the economy, the country depended an agriculture particularly oil palm fruit processing and marketing in the Southeastern state. During the past decade, Nigeria has become the net importer of palm oil from Malaysia. Nigeria’s palm oil production which in the past accounted for 43% of the world production now only account for 7% of the world production (National Agriculture Project, 1997).</p> <p>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM Several traditional methods of oil palm processing still abound in the study area including manual separation of kernels from fibre after maceration, pounding in a mortar, squeezing out of oil by hand and water displacement.</p> <p>However, most of these processes are being replaced by modern method (Omereji, 2005). The oil palm processors are seen to be reluctant to adopt modern processing technique. Beside this, virtually all the processors engage in small scale of oil palm production leading to decrease in the total quantity of product. Not withstanding this rapid decline in palm oil production, oil palm fruit processing still provides for about 70% of rural small-scale farmers in which women forms a great percentage. However, with the tripartite burden of child bearing, domestic chores and other agricultural activities, women in the study area are sand witched between several constraints in the processing of oil palm fruit. Despite the constraints, the participation of women in processing of oil palm fruit is increasing as a result of increasing demand of the growing urban population for palm oil. Since the major processors of oil palm fruits are the rural farm household in which majority are women, the study is targeted at the role of women and their constraints in the processing of oil palm fruit in Etim Ekpo L. G. A. of Akwa Ibom State.</p> <p>Often Women’s Voices are ignored when research priorities are set and their needs are thus not addressed. But for the fact that women contribute immensely in socio-economic development of the rural areas with less authority and opportunity than men implies that the socio-economic constraints militating against their efficient resource management must be fully understood. This would suggest possible solutions to their efficient performance. It is against this background that the following research questions become relevant:- (1) What are the socio-economic characteristics of oil palm processors? (2) What is the level of women involvement in oil palm processing in the study area? (3) What are indigenous knowledge practices used by women oil palm processors in the study area? (4) What are the different technological practices open to them in the study area? (5) What are constraints to oil palm processing faced by women in Etim Ekpo Local Government Area?</p> <p>1.3 BROAD OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY The broad objective of the study is to determine women involvement in oil palm processing in Etim Ekpo Local Government Area.</p> <p>1.4 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY To meet the broad objectives, the study will specifically focus on the following objectives; (1) To examine the socio-economic characteristics of oil palm processors in Etim Ekpo Local Government Area. (2) To ascertain the level of women’s involvement in oil palm processing in the study area. (3) To asses the indigenous knowledge practices used by women oil palm processors in the study area. (4) To determine the technological practices they are exposed to in the study area. (5) To determine the constraints to oil palm processing faced by women in the study area.</p> <p>1.5 HYPOTHESIS OF THE STUDY There is no significant different between socio-economic characteristics and constraint to oil palm processing in Etim Ekpo Local Government Area.</p> <p>1.6 THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE STUDY Oil palm processing is a major source of income and employment to a large proportion of the resource poor rural population in Nigeria especially in the South-South/South-eastern part of the country. This study will generate information on constraints or set backs women encounter in oil palm processing in Etim Ekpo Local Government Area with the purpose of suggesting the possible solutions to the constraints. The results of the study will provide basis for developing appropriate policy by government that will enhance efficient and sustainable performance by women in oil palm processing.</p> <p>Furthermore, research institute, agricultural organization and students of agricultural extension will benefit from the study.</p>\n\nASSESSMENT OF WOMEN INVOLVEMENT IN OIL PALM PROCESSING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF WOMEN INVOLVEMENT IN OIL PALM PROCESSING", "id": 98}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Abstract </strong></p> <p>Pastoralism is the most traditional of ruminant livestock production systems in which extensive movement of the animals in search of pastures and water is its salient feature. Whereas the system is adapted to exploit the dry, arid climatic zone, it often overlaps into wetter, agricultural land, occasionally ending up into violent conflicts. Ranching is practically the intensive form of pastoralism but it has a weakness of being seen as antisocial and needing high initial capital. Whatever other truly improved system of exploiting the pastoral agro-ecosystem, it seems it seldom can indict sedentarized tendencies and rarely can it be less intensive than ranching. This study investigate the problems and prospect of cattle ranching in Nigeria. </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Ranching is a very significant change of the pastoralist system strategy. It changes the mobility nature of pastoralism where traditionally there are no limits of grazing of the available pastures, into controlled grazing. It also changes the common property character of the pastoralist land where all land is open for pastures without any individual ownership. Ranching is now the dominant system of ruminant livestock production in North America, Australia and parts of South America. This is because the advantages of cattle ranching and it importance cannot be over emphasize Some European systems could also be described as ranching, though enclosures are often small and animals are frequently given supplements in the field (Ibid). In countries like United States, (Ibid), communal grazing pastoralism was prevalent in the 19th century, but now the grazing systems are fully enclosed (Ibid) From 1990 to 2003, the cattle herd in the Northern part of the country grew by 140% from 26.6 million to 64 million heads. Increasing demand and the sector’s advantages in the region suggest that ranching will continue to grow in the region. Nevertheless, the growth of extensive ranching in the region is worrying especially because of increased deforestation. Scientific and modern economic intervention into pastoralism has generally targeted the mobility and communal grazing characteristics of the system which results into sedentarized and most likely the enclosed, ranching system. This intervention has implication that the pastoralist ecosystem is a limited and valuable resource. The traditional pastoralist perception is contrary to this implication, and considers and wishes to consider that pastoral land is essentially vast wilderness with no instituted limitation of use (no use limits except the availability of pastures). This obviously contradicts most intervention outlook. Even with most prominent advocates for promotion and improvement of pastoralist resource exploitation strategy, the baseline seems somewhere to be based on sedentarization or predictable location prior to other proposed measures like nutritional and veterinary assistance for livestock, services such as education (schools) and health; and setting up emergency grazing areas [Ibid]. There has been extensive scholarly analysis of the livelihood and sustainability of pastoralism as a way of life of a significant proportion of the human population. Much criticism exists arguing that mobility of large herds of livestock is stressful to the environment as it would cause extensive removal of vegetation. Repeated uncontrolled grazing often ends up into bare land where vegetation is completely removed. Due to livestock trampling topsoil of an area usually becomes much pulverized while the immediate subsoil beneath becomes severely compacted. Pulverized soil is prone to extensive loss of soil through wind erosion while when it rains sheet erosion sweeps away very easily most of the pulverized soil. The surface run-off becomes much enhanced by the compacted soil condition. Therefore, while rainfall would be stimulant for vegetation re-growth, because of extensive vegetation removal and compaction the rainfall instead becomes an enhancer of bareness of the soil after washing away all the soil that would support vegetation re-growth. In the Sahel in Africa, it has been reported that vegetation removal by livestock in the area is believed to have increased soil surface albedo to the extent of causing reduction of rainfall and rapid desertification. The worst thing about the unlimited mobility is that it can extend its impact beyond limits. Another criticism on pastoralism is centered on the system’s tendency against limited use rights of pastureland In this context all pastureland is communal and open to limitless grazing. Since communal use of pasturelands prevents any sense of ownership of the land, no individual pastoralist can think of expansion of his activities within the locality in which he is existing at any particular time. At the same time the pastoralist cannot intuit any idea of intensification because under communal ownership there is no ground on which this intensification can be exercised. Under the communal setup, for example, a pastoralist cannot think of possibility of substituting some of the livestock for more pasture land. This is the dilemma of the communal land tenure system of traditional pastoralism. In his much referred “Tragedy of the commons”, criticizes very categorically the communal grazing characteristic of pastoralism and insists privatization as a way to correct imbalances of the pastoralist practice. In his article he described how common property resources shared by pastoralists eventually become over-used and ruined. He argued that the pastoralist land use strategy is unstable and a cause of environmental degradation. Earlier more than a century ago, also criticized pastoralism and argued observing that as far as common grazing land is concerned there is everything against it. He asserted that where there is communal grazing, every peasant in the village would tend to maximize the opportunity within the same limited area, with the result that grazing lands become always overstocked, never given rest, and usually become little more than exercise grounds for cattle (Ibid). Facts about this are difficult to totally refute even though some more recent literature elaborate contrary opinion and argue for a more interdisciplinary apprehension. </p> <p><br/><br/><br/></p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong></p> <p>When ranching was introduced, the economic contribution of the livestock was the major consideration. This consideration relegated the multiple functions and non-economic uses of livestock, which might be more important to the Fulani. Ranching capitalized on enhanced production output, but overlooked the potential use of animals as self-reproducing wealth, symbol of prestige, medium of social exchange, and insurance policy (Cisse 1980; and Schneider 1981). A major policy mistake was that of failing to understand that traditional pastoralism was an important source of food and employment on a continuous basis to most of the household members (Sandford 1982; and Cossins 1983). It is against this backdrop that the researcher intends to investigate the problem and prospect of cattle ranching in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main the objective of the study is to ascertain the problem and prospect of cattle ranching in Nigeria.

The study adopted the quasi-experimental research design, precisely, pretest, posttest non-equivalent control group design which involved groups of students in their intact classes. A sample of 193 electrical and electronic trade year II students drawn by multistage sampling technique from a population of 354 from eight technical colleges in Ogun state was used for the study. Four research questions and four null hypotheses tested at 0.05 level of significance guided the study. Electrical Electronics Achievement Test (EEAT) is the instrument used for data collection. The EEAT and lesson plans for both control and experimental were all subjected to face and content validation by three experts. The reliability coefficient of the instrument was computed using KR-20 and found to be 0.81. Mean was used to answer the research questions, while Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was employed to test the hypotheses. The study revealed that mind mapping instructional strategy was superior to the conventional method in enhancing student achievement in abstract contents. It also discovered that gender grouping did not contribute significantly to variance in students achievement score, thus the effectiveness of mind mapping does not depend on gender. After pointing out some educational implications of the findings, it was thereafter recommended that mind mapping should be adopted in teaching abstract contents of electrical and electronic trades.</p>\n\nSKILL NEEDS OF SECONDARY SCHOOL GRADUATES FOR EMPLOYMENT IN RICE PRODUCTION ENTERPRISES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SKILL NEEDS OF SECONDARY SCHOOL GRADUATES FOR EMPLOYMENT IN RICE PRODUCTION ENTERPRISES", "id": 100}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT </p> <p>his research work is designed to x-ray deeply into the importance of improving agricultural production in Nigeria using some selected cooperative societies in Mbaise L.G.A as a case study.

It has been logically argued that climate change may positively and negatively affect  the growth of crop in agricultural system.</p> <p>In some broken down analysis, climate is a sole determinant for the success of  farm produce and its harvest as well. Emphasis are hereby made below under some given headings.</p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>According to Kolbert., (2006) climate encompasses the  temperatures, humidity, atmospheric pressure, winds, rainfall, atmospheric particle count and numerous other meteorological elements in a given region over long periods of time, as opposed to  the term weather, which refers to current activity of these same elements.</p> <p>The climate of a location is affected by its latitude, terrain, altitude, persistent ice or snow cover, as well as nearby oceans and their currents.</p> <p>Climates can be classified using parameters such temperature and rainfall to define specific climate types. (Seiz, 2007)     </p> <p>According to Haeberli, (2008) from Montana State University, climate change is any long term significant change in the expected patterns of average weather of a specific region (or, more relevantly to contemporary socio-political concerns, of the earth as a whole) over an appropriately significant period of time.</p> <p>&lt; </p> <p>Susanne, and Veizer (2008) revealed that climate change reflects abnormal variations to the expected climate  within the earth’s atmosphere and subsequent effects on other parts of the earth, such as in the ice caps over  durations ranging from decades to million of years.</p> <p>Reports revealed by the inter-governmental panel on climate change (IPCC 2007) stated that  climate change in the research of a  great many factors including the dynamic processes of the earth itself, external forces including variation in sunlight intensity, and more recently by human activities, which might in future be deliberate  geo-engineering. External factors that can shape climate are often called climate forcing and include such processes as variations in solar radiation, deviations in the Earths orbit and the level of greenhouse gas concentrations.</p> <p>There have been so many variations on carbondioxide(Co2) during the last 50 million years. The increased carbondioxide level are thought to exacerbate the heating effects of the greenhouse effect by reading the re-radiation of heat from the sun and, therefore, increasing the temperature contained in the atmosphere.</p> <p>As the ability of the atmosphere to capture and recycle energy emitted by the Earth’s surface is essential to a stable climate, this heightened temperature may introduce a de-stabilizing influence and potentially affect global weather patterns and eventually, long-term climate change.</p> <p>(Source: Buckley, and Wallace, 2008)</p> <p>Framers efforts on yielding mass harvest and encouraging large plantation may be seriously terminated and hampered from the perception of climate change. Where alternative instruments are not introduced to counteract the factors militating against favourable climate on farm produce this may lay a set back on agricultural input and output by our farmers.</p> <p>It obvioused that climate change had contributed towards initiating basic subsistence farming system order than the mechanized farming product for large market of farm produce. </p> <p>For example, a region where climate change had hampered the possibility of regular actual rainfall variably, water system irrigation can be applied to artificially supply wet contents on crop growth and improving regular harvest.</p> <p>Farmers in Nigeria today are faced with variable challenges on climate change making the agricultural sector prone to difficulties in enhancing crop production as a result of weak alternative facilities, equipments and scientific instruments to improve the range of farming.</p> <p>Dr Daniel (2008) from the University of Maiduguri revealed findings that climate change plays a significant role in agriculture by setting up limits for crop production. The main climatic elements in agriculture are temperature, moisture, sunlight, wind and evaporation. Most crops     are sensitive to episodes of high temperature. High temperatures between 45oc and 55oc that occur for at least 30 minutes directly, damage crop leaves in most environments, and lower temperatures between 35-40oc can be damaging if they persist longer.    </p> <p>Awosika, and Ajayi, (2002) opined that vulnerability of crops to  damage by high temperatures varies with developmental stage thus, high temperatures during reproductive development are particularly injurious.  For example, to maize at tussling, to soybean at flowering and to wheat at grain filling.`</p> <p>Soybean in one of crops that seems to have the ability to recover from heat stress, perhaps, because it is in determinate.</p> <p>Whereas as stated by Adefolau (2000) food crops like yam, cocoyam, potatoes, cassava can get damage (burnt) due to excessive heat temperature.</p> <p>Precipitation, being the primary source of soil moisture is probably the most important factor determining the productivity of corps. While global climate models predict an overall increase  in mean global precipitation, their results also show the potential for changed  hydrological regimes in most places.</p> <p>Ojo (2000) a change in climate can cause changes  in total precipitation, within season pattern, and between season variability for crop productivity, a change in the pattern of precipitation events may be even more important than a change in the annual precipitation. The water regime of crops is also vulnerable to a potential rise in the daily rate and alerted seasonal pattern of precipitation events may be even more important than a change in the annual precipitation. The water regime of crops is also vulnerable to a potential rise in the daily rate and altered seasonal pattern of evapotranspiration, brought on by warm temperature, drier air, or windier conditions.   Drought conditions may be brought about by lower amounts of precipitation falling.</p> <p>Oni (2001) opines that farm produce and yield quantity are likely to suffer if dry periods occur during critical developmental stages. In most grain crops, flowering, pollination and grain filling are especially sensitive to water stress, heat stress and drought stresses often occur simultaneously one contributing to the other.   High solar radiance and high winds often accompany these conditions. When crops are subjected to drought stress, their stomata close, such closure reduces transportation and consequently, raises plant temperatures. Excessively wet years, on the other hand, may cause farm produce declines   due to water logging and increased pest infestation (Dr. Daniel, 2008).</p> <p>Intense burst of rainfall may damage younger plants and promote water logging of standing crops with repining grain, as well as soil erosion. The extent of crop damage depends on the duration of precipitation and flooding, crop developmental stage, air and soil temperatures. </p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong>   </p> <p>The research tends to examine the perception of farmers of the effect of climate change on farm produce.</p> <p>Climate change may serve as a factor that can hinder crop yield and as such bring to an end the agricultural  activities of farmers.</p> <p>It is a problem that if farmers have no means to face and tackle the global climate models affecting yield processes farm produce can maximally decline due to acute change in climate. But it is believed that this can be controlled through some adaptation options as proposed and laid down by Dr. Adejuwon (2004) from Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU). It has been revealed in his findings and discussions and likewise other related scholars.</p> <p>Climate change will be a bone of contention on farmers posing barriers to actual farm produce until proper adjustment and technical adaptation models are absorbed and utilized by our farmers.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY </strong>   </p> <p>The objectives of the research are stated below as follows.</p> <p>i.             To examine the various climate change and how they affect farm produce in Nigeria.</p> <p>ii.           To appraise possible adaptation options that can be utilized by farmers for responding to climate change.</p> <p>iii.          To create an awareness on climate change and how it can be controlled on farm produce by farmers to assess the factors militating climate change and the problems faced by farmers.</p> <p>iv.          To assess the factors militating climate change and the problems faced by farmers on farm produce.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong>  </p> <p>The following research questions had been formulated for the research as follows:</p> <p>i.             Does climate change affect farm produce in Nigeria?</p> <p>ii.           Can farmers respond to climate change through possible adaptation options on farm produce?</p> <p>iii.          Can climate change be controlled in farm produce by farmers through a critical awareness?</p> <p>iv.          What are the factors militating climate change and the problems faced by farmers on farm produce?</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>The null hypotheses were formulated for the research as follows:</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>:</strong>   Climate change has no significant effect on farm produce in agricultural system in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>:</strong> There is no significant responses to farmers to climate change through possible adaptation models.</p> <p><strong>Ho:</strong> There is no significant relationship between the factors responsible for climate change and problems encountered by farmers on farm produce.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study reversals the factors responsible for climate change and the effects they have on farm produce.</p> <p>The research relates the basic problems encountered by farmers on farm produce through climate change.</p> <p>The research reveals alternative models as adaptation options that can be utilized and experimented by farmers in counteracting climate change on farm produce.

This project utilizes sustainable livelihood frame work to review how commercial poultry contributes to households and livelihoods.</p> <p>          It would be recalled that the rate of unemployment in Nigeria is very high as reflect by the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) with the statistics that 700,000 jobs were available in the country compared with 7,000,000 graduates being turned out by Nigeria Universities. This is as a result of imbalance in labour supply, rapid population growth rate and faulty educational system among others.</p> <p>          This project   write up will focus attention on commercial poultry farming production. A prospective commercial poultry farmer should consider the following factors for the establishment of poultry farming:</p> <p>These include broiler production, egg production, and marketing.</p> <p><strong>Broiler:</strong> is a North American term used to describe young male or female chicken less than 12 weeks old based on fast growing breeds, reared and sold specifically for poultry meat. For broiler production, the rapidity of turnover is very high and the current projected profit per broiler is 300.</p> <p><strong>Egg production:</strong> the expansion of the business of egg production can partly be attributed to quick turn over. The current estimated gross or net daily profit from the sale of eggs ranges from #2,000 layers is #5000 depending of course on the use of birds of superior genotype, provision of favourable environment and managerial skill.</p> <p><strong>LOCATION OF THE POULTRY FARMING</strong></p> <p>Legal clearance must be obtained from appropriate authority before establishing poultry enterprise to prevent the demolition of structures, culminating in the termination of the enterprise. The enterprise must not be a source of nuisance in the nature of fowl odor and noise to neighbor .  Ensure access to water, electricity and proper damage.</p> <p><strong>Capital Outlay:</strong> This will depend on the size and type of operation   and the management system. For the take off, personal savings of up to #250,000 can be utilized particularly for small scale broiler production. Alternatively Agricultural Bank Loans on liberal terns can be considered. Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme (ACGSF) and the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) poultry farming scheme can as well provide loans to prospective farmer.</p> <p><strong>Manpower Required: </strong>For a small scale operation, one poultry attendant should be able to manage a minimum of 2,000 birds either on the deep litter system or in cage. Occasional operations such as manual removal of drops and vaccination require additional labor which could be provided by the members of the family.</p> <p><strong>Feed Supply: </strong>In Nigeria, feed cost accounts for about 70% of the cost of poultry production. This is due to the high cost of some critical feed ingredients (e:g  maize and soya beans ) which are needed in poultry ration. From the standpoint of a profitable enterprise, the genetic potential of the birds is the beginning of employment. This research is determined to critically examine poultry farming as a veritable tool economic empowerment in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.1     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>          Poultry farming as a veritable tool for economic empowerment depends largely on the attractiveness of this agricultural sector to the Nigerian youth (young graduates), government support in terms of financial support (loan, overdraft) and market potentials for poultry products. In view of this, the following highlighted problems are intended to be solved by this research work.</p> <p>·        ­Can poultry farming actually provide economic power to the Nigerian youth?</p> <p>·        Is poultry farming business feasible in the Nigerian economy?</p> <p>·        Will the Land Use Act of 1978 (LUA 1978) not be a stumbling block to the attainment of poultry farming as a business concern?</p> <p><strong>1.2     OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The objective of the research study work is to examine poultry  as a veritable tool for economic empowerment.</p> <p><strong>1.3     SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>           This research work focuses on poultry farming as an economic tool tool for man`s empowerment. Majorly to be investigated is egg production as a means of livelihood. Therefore, it is limited to a local commercial poultry farm in Osun State as a case study.</p> <p>          This study intends to analyze the relevant process of egg production and the attracting factors to the Nigerian youth.</p> <p><strong>1.4     RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>          The research will be conducted to examine poultry farming as an economic tool in the hands of Nigerian youth. The source to be used for this study is based on data collected through the two available sources, which are primary and secondary data.</p> <p>          The primary source includes data collection through personal observation, interview, questionnaire, and other primary means of getting information.</p> <p>          The secondary source includes the use of journals, newspapers, internet, annual reports of agricultural agencies and some other relevant text books.</p> <p>In the analysis of questionnaire, which were administered in order to get information from the customers and the employees of the enterprise, simple percentage will be used to present the various data and Chi-Square will also be used test the relevant hypothesis.</p> <p>          Chi-Square is a non-parameters measure that does not depends on population but deals with frequency count.</p> <p>Chi-Square is defined by the formulae</p> <p>X2= (o-e)2</p> <p>                                  e</p> <p>= At 5% level of significance = 0.05</p> <p>= Degree of freedom is given by the formula =(r-1) (c-1)</p> <p><strong>1.5     STATEMENT OF RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>Since the paramount aim of this study is to examine poultry farming as an economic tool for economic empowerment. The following hypothesis is thereby drawn for the purpose of this study.</p> <p>H1: poultry farming as an economic tool enhances employment opportunity</p> <p>H0: poultry farming as an economic tool does not enhance employment opportunity.</p> <p><strong>1.6     RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>          Research question are declarative statement meant to obtain answer which will state what the researcher is looking for the purpose of this research, the major questions are:</p> <p>v Can poultry farming business feasible in the Nigeria economy?</p> <p>v Can poultry farming actually provide economic power to the Nigeria youth?</p> <p><strong>1.7     JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The researcher therefore, belief that by studying poultry farming, it will be of benefit to the economy and individuals alike. It will be beneficial to the economy in the sense that it will help us determined how self employable Nigeria youth can be by engaging in poultry farming.</p> <p>          This study will equally evaluate opinion of Nigerian on how they perceive poultry farming as a means of livelihood. In addition, this study will serve as a reference point for future researchers who  wants to embark on a project alike.</p> <p><strong>1.8     LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In the course of justifying this research work, information were difficult to access because of the strict knowledge and technical know-how of poultry farming which is not available to the researcher. Other constraints include among others:</p> <p>Transportation is one of the problem encountered during the period going up and  down to the industry to get the needed information.</p> <p>Another problem is the associated problem in the process of data collection in relation to scheduling of time.

Increasing the level of offer beyond 50g/kg live weight per day did not, however, promote a substantial increase in intake. No difference (P&gt;0.05) was observed in the pattern of feed selectivity between sheep and goats. Both species showed a similar preference for leaf and sheath matter as the level of offer was increased.Sheep gained weight faster (P&lt;0.001) than goats at all rates of offer, (28.0 vs 9.0; 54.0 vs 23.0; 62.0 vs 31.6 in favour of sheep). Those on a higher level of offer showed a faster rate of gain than those on a lower level of offer.</em><br/><em>It was concluded that both species can benefit from generous offers and that the benefit, judged by improved intake and growth, is due to selective feeding.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong><br/><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong><br/> Previous studies (Aboud et al, 1992) clearly indicate the value of selective feeding. Sheep were shown to perform better and consume more digestible matter through selective intake of leaf and sheath fractions of sorghum stover as a result of liberal offers. This observation is of practical value for small ruminants in the tropics because the traditional feeding systems depend largely on crop residues. However, there is little evidence in the literature that the approach adopted by Aboud et al (1992) would be as effective for goats as it was for sheep. Results from comparative studies between sheep and goats of selective efficiency are generally conflicting (Huston, 1978; Devendra and Bums, 1983). Goats in the tropics are more able than sheep to consume feed fractions of higher nutritional quality when offered the opportunity to eat selectively (Devendra and Burns, 1983; Hoppe et al, 1977; Huston, 1978). This observation does not agree with studies carried out in temperate countries, where sheep have been shown to perform better than goats under most practical feeding systems. A comparative feeding and performance study on Small East African goats and the Red Maasai sheep in Tanzania (Shoo, 1986) was inconclusive, although sheep appeared to perform better than goats when offered a basal diet of Chlorisgayanahay with Leucaenaas a supplementary forage. However, observations in Shoo’s (1986) study did not include an assessment of selective feeding ability between the two species. The inclusion of a supplementary forage may have confounded the results, as it is known that goats would preferentially consume browse species (Lu, 1988). Most of the comparative studies in the tropics were made under grazing conditions, whereas those in the temperate countries involved comparisons under stall-feeding conditions in which feed was offered at restricted levels, usually at 35 g dry matter M(D)/kg live weight per day or to achieve 10-20% rate of refusal. Comparative studies under grazing or in stalls at restricted levels of offer may give misleading results (Demment and Van Soest, 1983). Restricted levels of offer do not usually provide sufficient opportunity for selective feeding (Aboud et al, 1993). This is particularly serious where low-quality crop residues are used in comparisons.<br/> No performance comparison has been made between sheep and goats that have been fed untreated crop residues at levels that would allow selective intake. Alimon (1989) only measured the digestible organic matter (OM) intake of goats offered increasing levels of feed, but did not measure any related growth performance. Aboud et al (1993) showed that certain levels of offer encouraged sheep to eat selectively. By offering goats and sheep the same type of sorghum stover at these levels both species may perform similarly.<br/><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/> The general objective of the studies was to find better methods of feedingsugar cane and some protein-rich foliage species to get the highest feedintake and the best performance in small ruminants.<br/> The specific objectives were:<br/> • To assess the effect of animal factors such as animal species(sheep and goats) and group size (single and group pens) on feedintake, behaviour and growth rate.<br/> • To test the effect of some feed factors such as<br/> – processing method of sugar cane and Acacia foliage<br/> – Level of feed offered of sugar cane<br/> – Supplementation with concentrate<br/> – Method of presentation of foliage and mixtures of foliages<br/> -Utilization of bamboo charcoal to reduce the antinutritionaleffect of tannins in Acacia foliageon feed intake, behaviour and growth rate.<br/> • To identify the intake potential of sugar cane and three tropicalfoliage species by small ruminants.</p>                                                          \n\nFEEDS AND FEEDING OF SHEEP AND GOAT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FEEDS AND FEEDING OF SHEEP AND GOAT", "id": 104}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0    INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Nutrition is the science of food, nutrients and other substances, their action, interaction and balance in relation to health and disease and the processes by which the organism ingests, digests, absorbs transports, utilizes and excretes food substances.</p> <p>The development of nutrition made food to be recognized as the fundamental source of nutrients. Food and nutrition are basic human rights because they are necessary for human development.</p> <p>Malnutrition is the major contribution to illness and diseases in the world. This includes risk factors related to under nutrition, excess consumption of certain diet components (carbohydrates, fat, etc) and low consumption of other food items like fruits and vegetables. Rural dwellers food consumption pattern depends on many factors intervention into the life patterns of the community to which they belong. These factors affect food availability and how each food could be processed and stored.</p> <p>Food consumption patterns can be defined as the recognizable ways of eating foods rural dwellers tend to adhere to their old eating patterns rather than venturing to seek new and more proper eating habits. In order to maintain healthful diets, a variety and balance of foods from all food groups and moderate consumption of all food items is very important.</p> <p>Variety in diet implies choosing a number of different foods within any food group, rather than eating the “same old thing” day after day. Food consumption patterns has been observed to be influenced by socio-economic factors including sex, income, occupation, type of house and source of cooking energy, food consumption patterns of the mother prior to conception during pregnancy and lactation affects the reproductive cycle and health of the newborn infant. A mother with poor food consumption patterns has the risk of delivering a baby that is physically and mentally handicapped. Wright and Sims (1987) assert that many complex interacting systems affect man’s food consumption pattern and his consequent state of health. They further explained that natural environment (climate, topography soil conditions etc) determines what food can be produced. The man made environment (technological developments for processing, storing and distribution of food) affects what food will be made available for consumption.</p> <p>Proper and adequate food consumption patterns is the instrument for achieving other rural developmental goals, most especially those connected to reduction in child mortality and improvements in material health. Primary educational enrolment and achievement, gender equity and the capacity of resist disease, in order to be healthy and active women need to have food in adequate quantity, quality and variety in order to meet energy and nutrient. Consumption patterns of the mother prior to conception and during pregnancy and lactation affects the reproductive cycle and health of the newborn infant. A mother with poor food consumption patterns have the risk of delivery a baby that is physically and mentally handicapped.</p> <p>Adequate food plays an important role in rural development activities. It ensures their capacity to embark on livelihood activities that is sustainable.</p>                                                          \n\nFOOD CONSUMPTION PATTERN AND MICRO NUTRIENT INTAKE OF MOTHERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FOOD CONSUMPTION PATTERN AND MICRO NUTRIENT INTAKE OF MOTHERS", "id": 105}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Field trials were conducted at the Imopoly farmFarm, Imo State Polytechnic Umuagwo in 2014 to determine the effect rate of fertilizer application on vegetable (telfairiaoccidentalis). The treatments involved nine fertilizer types namely; Aleshinloye grade A, Aleshinloye grade B, Sunshine grade A, Sunshine grade B, Pace setter grade A, Pace setter grade B, Neem compost,. Fluted pumpkin served as the test crop. The fertilizer types were applied at two levels each (0 and 60 kg. N ha-1). The treatments were assigned into a randomized complete block design with three replicates. Data were collected on growth parameters, nutritional composition and yield attributes of fluted pumpkin. The parameters assessed were significantly influenced (P&lt;0.05) by the applied fertilizer types. The highest vine length, number of leaves, nutritional composition, fresh shoots and seed yields were recorded at 60 kg. N ha,-1 irrespective of the fertilizer types. Although, the best performance of fluted pumpkin in terms of growth and fresh shoot yield were obtained from neem compost fertilizer type, this was comparable with results obtained with tithonia compost. The highest P (0.83%), K (0.82%), Mg (3.20%), Ca (0.48%), Fe (4.63%) and protein (4.60 mg/kg) contents of fluted pumpkin shoot were obtained from the plants under poultry manure treatment while plants receiving no fertilizer application recorded the least values for all nutritional attributes assessed. Neem compost (86.1 kg/ha) closely followed by tithonia compost (62.7 kg/ha) gave highest seed yield of fluted pumpkin as compared to other fertilizer types. Although, neem compost and poultry manure gave the best performance in terms of yield and nutritional composition respectively, there is no significant difference between the values obtained from these treatments and that recorded from tithonia compost. In conclusion, the growth, nutritional composition and yield of fluted pumpkin were improved by fertilizer types.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.1    INTRODUCTION</p> <p>In Africa indigenous vegetables remain popular in rural areas where they are often considered to be more nutritive than exotic vegetables.Telfairiaoccidentalis commonly called fluted pumpkin is an important leaf and seed vegetable indigenous to Southern Nigeria and grown in the forest zone of west and central Africa (Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone being the major producers). It probably originated in south east Nigeria and distributed by Igbos who have been cultivated this crop since time immemorial.</p> <p>The leaf is of high nutritional, medicinal and industrial values rich in protein (29%), fat (18%) and minerals and vitamins (20%).The nutritional value of pumpkin seeds is different from that of leaves. The protein contents of seeds and leaves are 20.5g and 2.9g, respectively [5]. Seeds have high nutritive and calorific values which make it necessary in diets. Fluted pumpkin is of local ethnobotanical importance in the folklore, dietary and cropping systems of Igbos. The level of iron is the factor for use of the leaf extraction as blood tonic which can be administered to weak patient.</p> <p>Nitrogen is usually ascribed with the building up of leaf tissues. This is one of the essential elements most commonly used to increase crop yield. It is a constituent of all protein and chlorophyll. Plant tissue, usually contains more nitrogen than any other nutrients. Nitrogen application is used to produce rapid vegetative growth of vegetables. It promotes luxuriant growth, and increases number of leaves. These encourage photosynthesis and partitioning of photosynthesis rate into the economic parts of the plant. It is also necessary for reproduction andpromotes the uptake of phosphorus and potassium by plants. However, nitrogen requirement for vegetable is 50kg N/ha or more in savannah zone of Nigeria [8]. It has been reported that 100kg N/ha is suitable for vegetable based on dual purposes (leaf+ fruit). The recommended rate for the production of fluted pumpkin is 16okgN/ha.</p> <p>In Nigeria, farmers realize the need for soil amendments by using available resources such as crop wastes, farmyard manure and poultry waste [10]. The use of organic fertilizer as source of nutrients to crops has recently received comprehensive review by Awodun,;Akanbi et al. and Ojetayo et al.. This fertilizer type improves soil’s physical, chemical and biological conditions, which in turns improve crop growing environment and culminate in the better production of economic plant parts.</p> <p>Organic fertilizer fortified with inorganic materials specially formulated to replenish the soil and improve plant fertilization. It releases nutrients in soil in the form that plants can easily absorb, it will activate soil micro-organism and increase microbes, which will help decomposition process of organic matter and transform them into nutrients that plants can easily absorb. This will promote higher plant growth, healthier crops and better fruit yield. It reduces the needs of chemical fertilizer, which will lead to lower production cost and indirectly increases income. Organic crops contained higher levels of 21 essential nutrients than their conventionally grown counter parts including iron, magnesium, phosphorus and vitamin c. The organic crops also contained lower levels of nitrates, which can be toxic to body.</p> <p>Although, many research activities have reported better performance of crops with fertilizer application one of the method through which plants would display its potential genetic capability is by supplying the plants with adequate amount and types of fertilizer at the right time. Research efforts are therefore required to recommend fertilizer types for sustainable production of TelfairiaoccidentalisinUmuagwo, the Guinea Savanna zone of south west Nigeria.</p> <p>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>According to Jariene, the seeds contain about 50% fats, approximately 30% protein, sugar, B vitamins, ascorbic acid, Phytosteroles, Phytin, lecithin, oxycerotine, tyrosine, salicylic acid, and resins. The seed oil is also rich in glycerides of linoleic, oleinic, palmitin, and stearine acids. Omega-3 fatty acid was found to be present in pumpkin seeds; it helps to prevent artheriosclerosis, high blood pressure, and heart diseases; it also stimulates metabolism of accumulated fats. Oil-cake fats from pumpkin seeds contain large amounts of (almost 60%) of omega-3 acids twice that of cod liver oil. Pumpkin seed powder is used in China and the United States as an ingredient of salad dressings and in baked products. The seed oil is used as salad oil in Europe, and in India for cooking and lighting. The seed is used medicinally in the prevention of kidney stones. Seeds are eaten as an anthelmintic. In Mauritius an infusion of the seeds is used internally to treat hypertension and prostate complaints and externally to treat erysipelas.</p> <p>Seeds form a major part of the diet of Nigerians; They are consumed as a meal as well as ingredients of local soups. In southwestern Nigeria, pumpkin seeds are used locally as an alternative to “egusi” melon (Citrullus vulgaris Schrad) seed. Melon seeds are milled and used to prepare the popular “egusi” soup where they act as food thickeners. Pumpkin seeds are used alone or in combination with leafy vegetable.</p>                                                         \n\nTHE EFFECT RATE OF FERTILIZER APPLICATION ON VEGETABLE (TELFAIRIA OCCIDENTALIS)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT RATE OF FERTILIZER APPLICATION ON VEGETABLE (TELFAIRIA OCCIDENTALIS)", "id": 106}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p><p> 1.1 Background of the Study </p> <p>Financing formal education in Nigeria has become an issue of public concern as a result of the present economic down turn and worldwide inflation. According to Central Bank of Nigeria (2003), poor financing has been the bane of Nigerian education system to the extent that the budgetary allocation has been very low. Furthermore, the federal government allocation to education has declined steadily since 1999 and is much lower than average in the last five years. This is particularly important in view of huge increase in number of intake at all levels of education primary, secondary schools and tertiary. Ajetomob and Ayanwale (2004) observed that one of the approaches government adopts in financing education in Nigeria is the annual budgetary allocation to the sector that are distributed as subvention or grants to the different levels of education the grants or subventions are made through respective education ministry of government by the coordinating agencies of education such as the National University Commission (NUC), National Commission for Colleges of Education (NABTEB), Secondary schools Education Management Board (SEMB) and Universal Basic Education</p> <p>Commission. They went further to say that since the oil crisis in the eighties, the proportion of capital budget allocated to education has been consistently lower than the proportion of recurrent expenditure over the years, the government capital expenditure allocated to education as a percentage of total capital budgets ranged from as low as 1.7 percent in 1999 and not up to 9% in all case. Like total budget, the proportion was not consistent and this however, has retarded progresses in building facilities (Okunamiri, 2007). This view agrees with Moja (2000) when he asserts that building of classroom has not kept up with increased enrolment in all levels of Education in Nigeria. Worst affected are primary and secondary schoolsschools where classes are offered in the open air. In several secondary schoolsschools, as many as four classes are accommodated in one classroom and these are classes that are already over crowded and in poor state of repairs. In addition, laboratories and equipment are grossly inadequate and the attendant problems in terms of quality of education usually tell on the products (Ajetomobi&amp;Ayanwale, 2004). Abdullahi (2003) stated:</p> <p><em>“since independence there has been a consistent increasing demand for educational services in Nigeria. This demand arose as a result of population growth, increasing social demands (the desire to educate a good proportion of the population) and need for more skilled manpower in the country. The increasing demand on educational services means the establishment of more schools and provision of more teachers and materials. The result is that the burden of funding education in Nigeria, which rests mainly on the various tiers of government, is becoming unbearable. This fact is evident by the existence of numerous problems bedeviling the Education sector in the country. It is a foregone conclusion that in Nigeria with a population of over 100 million, a good percentage of which consists of young people, the funding of education can no longer be totally left in the hands of government (p:</em></p> <p><em>43)”</em></p> <p>The scenario described above, particularly the rapid changes in the education sector since independence, depicts a state of chaos in the sector. The result is that numerous problems are easily discernible in the sector including the following:</p> <p>1.    Poor infrastructural facilities in schools at all levels.</p> <p>2.    Poor number and quality of teachers particularly at primary and secondary schools level</p> <p>3.    Poor quality products (graduate) from schools at all levels.</p> <p>4.    Loss of confidence by the general pubic in the sector.</p> <p>Most of these problems arose from inadequate funding of the sector</p> <p>(Nwagwu, 2002).</p> <p>Fashina (2005) observe that in 1994, the funding formula was revised by the government so that the state would share 50% equally, thus educationally disadvantaged states 25%, pupil enrolment 25% and population of the states 10%. In 1999, the then government scrapped the National Primary Education Fund (NPEF) and reconstituted it under another name (the National Primary Education Commission). This action was taken in recognition of the states and local government’s constitutional responsibility for financing and managing primary education. Alternative source of funding explored by government is the Education Tax Fund (ETF) established in 1995. It ensured that companies with more than 100 employees contribute 2% of their pretax earnings to the fund. Primary education receives 40% of this fund; secondary schools education receives 10% and higher education 50%. Primary education has in the past also received from Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) for capital expenditure and provision of instructional materials. While in higher institutions, gifts, endowment funds, consultancy services farms, satellite campuses, pre-degrees are other alternative funding sources. Despite all the alternatives, the infrastructures, and facilities remain inadequate for coping with a system that is growing at a very rapid pace. The annual population growth rate was 3.3% (C.B.N, 2003). Due to poor financing, the quality of education offered is affected by poor attendance and inadequate preparation by teachers at all levels. The morale of teachers is low due to basic condition of service and low salaries.</p> <p>Furthermore, physical facilities need to be upgraded and resources such as libraries, modern communication and information technology equipment have to be provided (Anozie, 2000).</p> <p>The quest for meeting these basic education needs has been the cause of unending crisis between government trade union such as Nigerian union of teachers (NUT), Academic staff union of universities (ASUU),</p> <p>Non-Academic staff union (NASU). In the same direction, Ogbonnaya (2005) contends that education sector competes with the industrial, health, agriculture, communication sectors of the economy and as such demands effective funding from government. The same is true of other sectors. Thus, the funds made available for education are never enough as these sectors must receive attention as well. In view of the above, it may be observed that formal education is at cross roads in the country, especially when other sectors of the economy are competing keenly for attention as much as education does in the national budgetary allocation.</p> <p>In the same vein, Okunamiri (2007) observed that, at independence, government funding of formal education increased tremendously especially in the seventies following the increase in revenue from federation account due to the oil boom which made it possible for the introduction of Universal</p> <p>Primary Education (UPE) nationwide, in September 1976. Within same period, students in tertiary institutions enjoyed free tuition, scholarship loan and bursaries. The country began to set for herself priorities and these priorities were pursued and financed towards the actualization of objectives of education in national development. All these efforts were geared towards actualizing the federal government’s policy as spelt out in the national policy on Education, that government ultimate objectives is to make education free at all levels, that the financing of education is a joint responsibility of the federal, state and local governments and that in this connection, government welcomes and encourages private agencies in helping to finance education.</p> <p>Indeed, the policy highlighted the role of the three, tiers of government in the financing of education, such as provision of fund for the building of classroom block, laboratory equipment, payment of teachers salary by the tiers under which the institutions belongs to. But the government has failed to involve private and non-governmental</p> <p>especially now that present economic down turn, arising from the global economic recession could no longer permit government to fully meet its financial obligation to education sector. If formal education must achieve its laudable goals and objectives as entrenched in the National Policy on Education, its priorities such as funding by the government and participation by the private sector have to be addressed.</p> <p>Appraisal of the role of Ministry of Education towards funding is an attempt to evaluate the extent to which Ministry of Education existing in the communities meet up with their funding obligations to public secondary schoolsschools, putting into consideration certain bench marks for Ministry of Education participations in the financing of public secondary schoolsschools in the area in which they exist.</p> <p>According to corporate affairs commission report (2008), contends that “in order to promote school, community relationship, private organizations existing in the communities should directly or indirectly participate in the funding of public schools in the area in which they exist.</p> <p>Therefore, the following forms the bench mark for evaluation of nongovernmental organization participation in the funding of public secondary schoolsschools.</p> <p>1.    Donations for the development of school plants</p> <p>2.    Donations for award of scholarship</p> <p>3.    Provision for endowment fund.</p> <p>4.    Staff welfare and development</p> <p>5.    Provision of funds for purchase of stationeries.</p> <p>The apathy of the Ministry of Educations that is those organization that exist in the communities which are not owned by the government such as Christian Association of Nigeria, Rotary Club</p> <p>International,          Development         Association,            like town union,             Alumni</p> <p>Association and market women Associations in educational financing in Nigeria and which has put the major thrust of provision of formal education on government has been confirmed by Jaiyeoba and Atanada (2004) and Okunamiri (2007). These researchers observed that poor funding of schools and inadequate provision of resources to cope with the ever-increasing demand for educational provision have led to inadequate provision of facilities for effective teaching and learning and thus hinders achievement of educational objectives.</p><p> 1.2 Statement of the Problem </p> <p>Funding of formal education in Nigeria has been a topical issue due to the present bleak in economy arising from the global inflationary trend and economic down turn.  Inspite of the efforts of the different governments of the federation to provide funds for education, educational institutions still lack the necessary funds to implement various programmes.</p> <p>The problem of this study emanated from various inadequacies associated with the Nigerian educational system, inadequacies in terms of teaching and learning facilities, school plants, nonpayment of teachers salaries, modern technologies, uncondusive learning environment. This thus, arouses the interest of the researcher to investigate the extent to which different sources of income are used for the development of secondary schools school in Yola metropolis.</p> <p>Therefore, the problem of this study is to evaluate the extent to which different economic agent sources of income are used for the development of.</p><p> 1.3 Purpose of the Study </p> <p>The main purpose of this study is to carry out a survey on different sources of income for development of secondary schools school in Yola metropolis</p> <p>specifically, the study seeks to:</p> <p>1.    Find out the extent to which community development Associations fund post primary institutions.</p> <p>2.    Find out the extent to which rotary club international fund postprimary schools.</p> <p>3.    Evaluate the extent to which Christian Association of Nigeria funds public secondary schoolsschools.</p> <p>4.    Determine the extent to which Alumni Associations funds secondary schools.</p> <p>5.    Find out the extent market woman Associations fund secondary schools.</p> <p>6.    To determine the extent to which government fund and develop secondary schools school in Yola metropolis</p> <p><strong>1.4 Significance of the Study </strong></p> <p>The benefits that shall accrue from this study are many. Specifically, students, parents, school principals and researchers. This study will be of benefit to students because, they are the direct beneficiaries of what goes on in the schools. Therefore, appraising the extent to which non-governmental and government organizations funds schools will show a clear picture of the financial state of secondary schoolsschools, will spur suggestions on how to deal with the various inadequacies associated with the school system.</p> <p>Another group that will benefit from this study are parents. This is because these group of people have their children in schools where various inadequacies have been limiting effective teaching and learning. Therefore, if their children will benefit from this study as students, indirectly their parents would also benefit from this study.</p> <p>The findings of the study will be of immense benefit to various tiers of government such as local, state and federal government to whom the burden of educational funding seems to have left with. This study will show a clear picture on the extent to which Ministry of Education fund post-primary schools thereby serving as an appraisal report to the government.</p> <p>The findings of the study will be of immense benefit to school principals who have been the victims of inadequacies of resources needed for effective execution of educational programmes, since this study aims at appraising the extent to which Ministry of Education funds educational institutions. Probably, suggestions on how to improve private sector participation in funding may be arrived at thereby enabling school principals to have enough resources to execute educational programmes in schools.</p> <p>Lastly, the result of this study will be of importance to future researchers who may wish to carryout studies relating to the problem under study.</p><p> 1.5 Scope of the Study </p> <p>The scope of this study is delimited to Yola Education Zone of Adamawa State involving all the staffs of Ministry of Educations existing in the zone.</p> <p>The content scope of this study involves the extent Christian</p> <p>Association of Nigeria, Alumni Association, market Women Associations, Rotary club international and community development Association funds secondary schools.</p> <p> 1.6

North East Local Government Area of Edo State four research questions formulated and analyzed. The respondents were made up of pig farmers Ovia North East Local Government Area. All the respondents were randomly selected from the three main markets in Ovia North East Local Government Area and seven. One set of instrument was used in collecting data for the study i.e. questionnaires. The data collected from the respondents were analyzed using simple percentages from the analysis of data, the following were the findings. Transportation is one of the problem of pig farming and Finance contribute one of the major problem.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1  BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The pig is one of the oldest domesticated animals. Majority of the breeds we now know are descended from the Eurasian Wild Boar (<em>Sus scrofa</em>). Archaeological evidence from the Middle East indicates domestication of the pig occurs as early as 9,000 years ago while most livestock where utilized initially by nomadic peoples, swine are more indicative of a settled farming community. Pigs have become vital to the economy in parts of the world. (Ayivor, and Hellins, 2002).</p> <p>Piggery is another aspect of farming in Nigeria that is making smart investors huge money on daily basis. If you are into this pig farming, you sure wouldn’t lack money again for the rest of your life. The reason is because Pig meet is in high demand in Nigeria and sells very fast in the market. Another reason is that Pig reproduce in large number and grows very fast. A single pig gives birth to as much as 15 piglets at a time, making it one of the most reproducing mammal in the world. <em>Baby pigs</em> is known as shoat, farrow or piglet. Male pigs are <em>referred to as</em> the boar while females are sows. As a group they are <em>called</em> a herd or drove. Despite the huge profitability of Piggery, many Nigerian are still overlooking this goldmine because of ignorance of how it works. While some don’t just get the fact that it is a big business –  many who engage in it do it as part time business but if you can engage in this business fully, you are sure going to smile to the bank very soon.</p> <p>A fully grown Pig goes for as high as N30, 000 depending on the weight. Now Imagine for a year you are able to rear hundred to maturity, you will be making  N3 Million from the sales. If you can take it higher – lets say like 2,000 pigs in year, you will be talking of N60 Million here! Considering how fast pigs reproduces, it wouldn’t be a very much big deal to come up with 100 pigs in a year. (Ayivor, and Hellins, 2002)</p> <p>Livestock systems occupy about 30 per cent of the planet’s ice-free terrestrial surface area (Steinfeld <em>et al</em>. 2006) and are a significant global asset with a value of at least $1.4 trillion. The livestock sector is increasingly organized in long market chains that employ at least 1.3 billion people globally and directly support the livelihoods of 600 million poor smallholder farmers in the developing world (Thornton <em>et al</em>. 2006). Keeping livestock is an important risk reduction strategy for vulnerable communities, and livestock are important providers of nutrients and traction for growing crops in smallholder systems. Livestock products contribute 17 per cent to kilocalorie consumption and 33 per cent to protein consumption globally, but there are large differences between rich and poor countries (Rosegrant <em>et al</em>. 2009).</p> <p>Livestock systems have both positive and negative effects on the natural resource base, public health, social equity and economic growth (World Bank 2009). Currently, livestock is one of the fastest growing agricultural subsectors in developing countries. Its share of agricultural GDP is already 33 per cent and is quickly increasing. This growth is driven by the rapidly increasing demand for livestock products, this demand being driven by population growth, urbanization and increasing incomes in developing countries (Delgado 2005).</p> <p>The global livestock sector is characterized by a dichotomy between developing and developed countries. Total meat production in the developing world tripled between 1980 and 2002, from 45 to 134 million tons (World Bank 2009). Much of this growth was concentrated in countries that experienced rapid economic growth, particularly in East Asia, and revolved around poultry and pigs. In developed countries, on the other hand, production and consumption of livestock products are now growing only slowly or stagnating, although at high levels. Even so, livestock production and merchandizing in industrialized countries account for 53 per cent of agricultural GDP (World Bank 2009). This combination of growing demand in the developing world and stagnant demand in industrialized countries represents a major opportunity for livestock keepers in developing countries, where most demand is met by local production, and this is likely to continue well into the foreseeable future. At the same time, the expansion of agricultural production needs to take place in a way that allows the less well-off to benefit from increased demand and that moderates its impact on the environment.</p> <p>The modern pig has played and continued to play a major role in providing food for human consumption due in parts to its tremendous versatility and adaptability to a wide-range of environmental conditions. Donham,(2000). This ability to adapt plays a significant role in how pigs are raised and grown in various countries of the world. Hedegepath,(2008).</p> <p>Pig production is widely scattered across the globe. The estimated global pig inventory of over 801 million in 2002 was a slight increases over the global pig inventory estimate of over 782 million in (2006). The countries of Asia have the largest inventory of pig in the world, accounting for over 62% of the total global inventory in 2002. The countries of European Union account for nearly 15% of the global inventory followed by North America with approximately 10%. pig are produced primarily in regions of the world with available natural resource including arable land, cereal grains and water. Hedegepath, (2008).</p> <p>With ever increasing human population in Nigeria and virtually static agriculture productivity, the animal protein consumption among Nigerians has worsened in the past few years (Okpor, 2009). Many Nigerians feed on carbohydrate. This is because the average man cannot afford the cost of animal protein which is richer in amino acid. The deficiency of animal protein in the diet of so many people is often attributed to the low number of livestock (cattle, pigs, poultry, goats, sheep and their products), and the activities connected with their production which are not efficient (Morrison, 2001). Ugwu (2006) observed that animal protein apart from its palatability is essential for normal physical and mental development of man. He stated that its deficiency in the diet exerts adverse effects in terms of reduced human productivity due to abnormal development. Equally, he noted that animal protein energy deficiency causes high incidence of infant mortality, pronounced malnutrition and disease.</p> <p>Livestock production in Edo State has a great potential for commercial production of snail and shrimp in the coast line as well poultry and pig. Morison (2001). Huge market exists for livestock and animal product. The semi savannah climate to the Northern part of the state specifically areas like Auchi, Igarra and Ubiaja are suitable for livestock such as sheep, goat and cattle. The present livestock population in the state is estimated at poultry, 6000,000, Cattle 78,000, Goat 556,000, Sheep278,000, Pigs 189,000 while, cane rats (grass cutter) and snail rearing are in commercial production. Very huge opportunities exist in this sub-sector. Ugwu. (2006.)</p> <p><strong>1.2  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Pig products are good source of protein to every individual and a viable avenue of revenue to both the nation, the citizens of that country. But unfortunately the production of this product is faced with several problems among which are lack of finance, disease outbreak and transportation. If situation is not ratified more serious problems might develop.</p> <p><strong>1.3  RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In view of the foregoing, the study set out to answer the following questions in relation to the area of study:</p> <p>1.         Is inadequate finance a problem to pig farming?</p> <p>2.         Does disease outbreak affect the production of pig?</p> <p>3.         Does lack of adequate supply of genetically sound breeders affect pig farming?</p> <p>4.         Does high cost of feed affect pig farming?</p> <p>5.         Does poor infrastructure facilities affect pig farming?</p> <p>6.         Does fear of inadequate market for piggery products and the absent of pig product processing industry in Nigeria affect pig farmers?</p> <p><strong>1.4  OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is to find out the problem and prospect of pig farming in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State. The specific objectives are to:</p> <p>(i)examine the factors influencing pig production in Ovia North East Local Government Area;</p> <p>(ii)Find out if inadequate finance is a problem of pig farming in Ovia North East Local Government area of Edo State.</p> <p>(iv) Find out if disease outbreak affects pig farming in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State.</p> <p><strong>1.5  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The need for this investigation is to know the problems and prospect of pig farming in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State.

Five research questions were formulated and questionnaires were administered to hundred respondents in Oredo to determine the result for the study. At the end of the study, it was discovered that colour, size, texture and taste of garri depends greatly on hygiene practices, temperature and sequence right or wrong adopted during production. Recommendations included that hygiene practice especially in the early stage of processing garri should be taken seriously in order to avoid the risk of cross contamination must be properly controlled to avoid incomplete detoxification. Sieving must be carried out before consumption, and the temperature with which garri is been fried very important. Finally, garri produces must follow the right sequences to produce garri. </em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1 <strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The industrial processing of cassava into garri. Cassava is a very versatile commodity with numerous uses and by product. Each component of these plant can be valuable to its cultivator. The leaves may be consumed as a vegetable, or cooked as a soup ingredient or dried and used it to fed livestock as a protein feed supplement. The stem is used for plant propagation and grafting. The roots are typically processed for human and industrial consumption.</p> <p>In Nigeria, the consumption pattern varies according to ecological zones. Garri is a roasted granule, is the dominant product and is widely accepted in both rural and urban areas. It can be consumed without any additives or it can be consumed with a variety of additives such as sugar, groundnut, fish, meat and stew. The north east also use the cassava as fufu/akpu, garri abacha. Fufu is a fermented wet paste from cassava is also consumed throughout the country especially in the southern zones how every most processors complain that the wet paste are ready to eat forms of fufu, that are currently sold, have a short sheaf life. Estimates of industrial cassava use suggest that approximately 16 percent of cassava root production was utilized as industrial raw materials in 2001 in Nigeria. Ten percent was used as chips in animal feed, 5 percent was processed into a syrup concentrate for soft drink and less than one percent was processed into high quality cassava flour used in biscuits and confectionary, destrin pre-geled starch for adhesive, hydrolysate for pharmaceuticals and seasonings.</p> <p>Garri is cassava tuber should be free from microbial contamination garri should be processed within two days of harvest to prevent deterioration or loss of quality in garri. Garri is a creamy-white granular flour with a slightly fermented flavour and a slightly sour taste made from fermented gelatinized fresh cassava tubers. Fresh cassava tuber is most, low acid food that is susceptible to bacteria and fungi growth. Hygienic practices especially in the early stage of processing should therefore ensure minimal contamination, all waste material from the process should be removed from the site as they are produced to avoid contamination of the final product with peel sand.</p> <p>fermentation must be properly controlled as to short period will result in incomplete detoxification. Fermentation consists of two distinct methods Aerobic and Anerobic fermentation for aerobic fermentation, the peeled and sliced cassava roots are first surface dried for 1-2 hours and then heaped together, covered with straw or leaves and left to ferment in air for 3-4 days until the pieces becomes moldy. The fermented moldy pieces are sun-dried. After the mold has been scrapped off. Theprocessed and dried pieces (called “Mokopa” in ugandal are then milled into flour, which is prepared into a “fufu” called “Kowan” in Uganda. The growth of mold on the root pieces, increases the protein content of the final products three to eight times. (Amey, 1987, Sauti et al, 1987). This fermentation method is also very popular in other parts of East Africa as Tanzania, Rwanda and Zaire.</p> <p>A long period of too will result in given the product a strong sour tests. Both over-fermentation and under-fermentation also affect the texture of the final garri if too much liquid is press from the grinded cassava the gelatinization of starch, during sub-sequent roasting is affected and the product is white. It the sufficient liquid is not removed however the fermentation of granules during roasting is affected and the dough is more likely to form into lumps. The idea of moisture content is about 47-50% and this is assessed visually by experience to the starch, sieving is important because it enable one to obtain a higher quality product free of fibrous contaminated. The granules must be roasted to above 80oc/175oc to achieved partial gelatinization of the starch. If lower temperature are used the product simply dries and produces a dry white powder. Too high temperature will cause charring of the product and make it stock to the roasting pan.</p> <p>1.2 <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Garri today is a staple food in Nigeria and beyond for us to ascertain proper hygiene quality of the product there is the need to focus on the processes involved. However, due to high demand of garri by consumers the producers of garri no longer see the need to do the right thing to produce high quality of garri what they after this day is the money they will make from the sale of the product. Thus the problem of the study therefore is to find out whether proper hygiene practices are carried out following during the processing of garri to avoid the risk of contamination. The study will be concerned with the fermentation process of garri. Whether the texture of garri is as a result of the fermentation process or whether the grated cassava is over or under fermented. The study is also concerned to ascertain the cause of lumps in garri whether it is due to drought or not. More so, it will focus on the rational behind the charring of the product and why it sticks to the roasting pan during frying.</p> <p>Thus, the final product reduced to about 18%. This is a problem is commercial production. To produce garri at a fast rate and eliminates the problem of the traditional method.</p> <p>1.3 <strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is set to find out or to ensure that the final product is cooked and dehydrated. This study is therefore to find out the changes that caused friction between the cassava mash and the conveyor. Thus this study is concerned with, the proper hygiene practices can affect the production of a high quality of garr free from fibrous, contaminants and with similar sized granules. Finally this study will compare the garri production under lower temperature, to determine the extent to which temperature can affect the production of final garri, and under what temperature the product can be stored and the maximum drying time, rate of feed temperature control. Thus this study is to come up with a sound continuous process of garri frying machine, based on the avoidance of caking of the cassava mash.</p> <p>1.4<strong> RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In this study will sought from the following research questions;</p> <p>1)   Do proper hygienic practices increase the quality of good garri?</p> <p>2)   Does garri produced under fermentation posses better quality production?</p> <p>3)   Does sieving of garri bring better quality in the texture of garri?</p> <p>4)   Is it better to produce garri under a high temperature?</p> <p>5)   Under what temperature can garri be stored?</p> <p>6)   Is fermentation of garri important in the production of garri?</p> <p><strong>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The importance of the study will be overwhelming and have far reaching effects on all firstly it will enable the producers of garri to know the significance of hygiene in the processing production and storage of garri. Hygienic practices especially in the early stage of processing should ensure maximum contamination. It will help the producers to know how it control the fermentation process involved in garri production. It will also help to determine the temperature which a good texture dry white producer a lovely grain garri can be produced. Nevertheless it will help the producers to know the ideal moisture content required `in garri, apart from the overwhelming benefits the producers of gari will derive the study will help consumers of garri to know the process involved in the production of garri and this will help them to appreciate the product better than before.</p> <p>1.6 <strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The researcher selected some local garri producer in villages in Oredo Local Government Area of  Edo State. Nevertheless the research is delimited to the production of garri only. And not all product of cassava can be processed into garri.</p> <p>1.8 <strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Cassava</strong>: The root of cassava are rich in carbohydrate, mainly starch, according to some research that was carried out cassava is the third most important source of calories, in terms of consumption either by eaten, grated cassava food products are the most important staples of rural and urban households in southern Nigeria. Current estimates who that the dietary calories equivalent of per capital consumption of garri (toasted granules), chips/flow fermented pastes. Cassava has become a very popular crop and is fast replacing yam and other traditional staples of the area, gaining ground increasingly as an insurance crop against hunger, cassava is also a major cash crop.</p> <p><strong>Fermentation: </strong>Of experience the mash is placed in a porous bag and allowed to ferment for one or two days, while weights are placed on the bag and chemical change, because of the action of bacterial. It also reduced the glycosides in anaerobic fermentation, grated cassava for processing into “garri” is placed in sacks and pressed with stones or a jack fermentation is the heat of garri processing because it is where the poisonous acid (HCN) is detoxified and removed to make the garri edible.</p> <p><strong>Garri: </strong>Is a creamy-white granular flour with a slightly fermented flavour and a slightly sour tastes made from fermented gelatinized fresh cassava tuber. Garri is widely known in Nigeria and other West African countries.</p> <p><strong>Granules: </strong>It is a small hard pieces of garri after been sifted.</p> <p><strong>Hygiene: </strong>It is the practice of keeping the area where garri is been produced should be clean in order to prevent it from bacterial or fungi diseases.</p> <p><strong>Sieve: </strong>Is a tool consisting of a wire or plastic mach held in a frame, used for straining solids from liquids, for separating coarser from finer particles, or for reducing soft solids to a pulp. It is also a safer, a device use for separating wanted elements from unwanted material ort for characterizing the particles.</p>                                                           \n\n THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROCESSING PRODUCTION AND STORAGE OF GARRI<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROCESSING PRODUCTION AND STORAGE OF GARRI", "id": 110}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>This research was carried out in order to assess the causes and effects of deforestation in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State. the researcher collected his information by distributing questionnaire to the people living in Ovia North East Local government Area in Edo State and to the Ministry of Agriculture Department of forestry in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State. The information gathered were analyzed and presented in percentages. From the analysis, the researcher was able to identify the following. That it is only the government that can arrest the problem of deforestation. Deforestation can also lead to animal extinction That people resort to illegal felling of trees because employment opportunities are lacking elsewhere. Based on these findings the researcher made recommendations among which are; The government should employ more field staff to combat illegal entry destruction of forest production. These field staff should be made to carry arms while on duty patrol, not only to safeguard themselves but also to instill some fear on timber thieves. The use of village elders in guiding against illegal deforestation should be encouraged.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The year 2011 is ‘The International Year of Forests’. This designation has generated momentum bringing greater attention to the forests worldwide. Forests cover almost a third of the earth’s land surface providing many environmental benefits including a major role in the hydrologic cycle, soil conservation, prevention of climate change and preservation of biodiversity (Sheram, 1993). Forest resources can provide long-term national economic benefits. For example, at least 145 countries of the world are currently involved in wood production (Anon., 1994a). Sufficient evidence is available that the whole world is facing an environmental crisis on account of heavy deforestation. For years remorseless destruction of forests has been going on and we have not been able to comprehend the dimension until recently. Nobody knows exactly how much of the world’s rainforests have already been destroyed and continue to be razed each year. Data is often imprecise and subject to differing interpretations. However, it is obvious that the area of tropical rainforest is diminishing and the rate of tropical rain forest destruction is escalating worldwide, despite</p> <p>increased environmental activism and awareness.</p> <p>Deforestation is the conversion of forest to an alternative permanent non-forested land use such as agriculture, grazing or urban development (van Kooten and Bulte, 2000). Deforestation is primarily a concern for the developing countries of the tropics (Myers, 1994) as it is shrinking areas of the tropical forests (Barraclough and Ghimire, 2000) causing loss of biodiversity and enhancing the greenhouse effect (Angelsen <em>et al</em>., 1999). FAO considers a plantation of trees established primarily for timber production to be forest and therefore does not classify natural forest conversion to plantation as deforestation (but still records it as a loss of natural forests). However, FAO does not consider tree plantations that provide non-timber products to be forest although they do classify rubber plantations as forest. Forest degradation occurs when the ecosystem functions of the forest are degraded but where the area remains forested rather cleared (Anon., 2010). Thirty per cent of the earth’s land area or about 3.9 billion hectares is covered by forests. It was estimated that the original forest cover was approximately six billion hectares (Bryant <em>et al</em>., 1997). The Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, the United States of America and China were the most forest rich countries accounting to 53 per cent of the total forest area of the globe. Another 64 countries having a combined population of two billions was reported to have forest on less than ten per cent of their total land area and unfortunately ten of these countries have no forest at all. Among these countries 16 are such which had relatively substantial forest areas of more 1than one million hectares each and three of these countries namely Chad, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Mongolia each had more than ten million hectares of forest. The forest area remained fairly stable in North and Central America while it expanded in Europe during the past decade. Asian continent especially in India and China due to their large scale afforestation programme in the last decade registered a net gain in forest area. Conversely the South America, Africa and Oceania had registered the net annual loss of forest area (Anon., 2010; 2011a).</p> <p>The forest is a good source of food, income, ecological resources, social and cultural features, as well as physical facilities like power and building materials. Other functions of the forest are prevention of erosion, as well as the provision of essential habitat for wildlife to survive. Hence, the necessity to conserve the forest and the biodiversity therein. In addition to conserving biological and cultural diversity, it is now widely recognised that many protected areas also have important social and economic functions. These include protecting watersheds, soil and coastlines, providing natural products for use on a sustainable basis, and supporting tourism and recreation (Lee et. al, 2003). Studies in China have also confirmed that medical herb production is a big business and that the suppliers have chosen to invest in forest protection and reforestation in order to guarantee future supplies (see Chen, 1983 and Hou, 1994 for greater details).</p> <p>In spite of the multi-various usefulness of the forest resources, rapid population growth and changes in land uses have put the forest resources under pressure. For instance, Poore 1989 opined that majority of logging operations in tropical countries are considered unsuitable and damaging. The widespred failure of forest governamnce – characterized by illegal logging, associated illegal trade, and corruption-directly undermines sustainable economic growth, equitable development, and environmental conservation. It puts at risk poor and forest-dependent populations, which rely on timber and non-timber forest products; undermines responsible forest enterprises by distorting timber and reducing profitability; and results in a loss of govenrment revenue that could be invested in sustainable forest management or general economic development (World Bank, 2006). The major determinants of deforestation are the available natural resources in an area, how the resources are being used, traditional beliefs and myths, conflicts in the use of resources, population pressure, vis-a-vis the problem of pollution (soils, air or water). According to Meyer and Turner (2009), societies have profoundly altered their environments in the pursuit of wealth and power have been punished by environmental catastrophes (natural and man-induced). They opined further that world forest area has been reduced by some 20 percent and a large area of land converted from its original vegetation cover to cropping. The major cause of deforestation are increasing demand for housing and infrastructural facilities, crop and timber export, poor agricultural practices cutting of fuel wood for urban areas, head loading (cutting of fuel wood for sale), forest fires, logging, and overharvesting. Other causes are overgrazing, road construction, dam construction, as well as careless exploitation of forest resources. A large empirical literature exists on the consequences of deforestation (see Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994; Western, 1999; Johnston, 1989; Bruijnzeel, 2004; and Brookfield, 1992). Deforestation is responsible for damage to habitate, biodiversity loss and aridity, extinction of rare species of plants and animals, climate change, environmental destruction and the subsequent damage to the sensitive living balance of the ecosystem. Also, empirical studies have confirmed that if we cannot look after the forest they will soon disapper (see Brockington, 2007; Hyde and Sedjo, 1992; Waston et al, 1998; Colin, 2001 and Khare et al, 2000). The threat to timber resources is being combated in most countries by vigorous afforestation. In addition, many have adopted stringent forestry laws, as in Norway and Sweden, to prevent waste, and elsewhere, experiments are taking place to find alternative materials for making paper (Whynne-Hammond, 1979).</p> <p>Other strategies of combating deforestation are the use of alternative sources of energy other than fuel and charcoal, sustainable agricultural practices rather than slash and burn method of farming, land management, avoidance of indiscriminate bush burning, as well as promulgation and enforcement of environmental laws and forest policies. Likewise, mitigating deforestation entails forest conservation, protection of endangered species, as well as the promotion of ecotourism. These are the measures of achieving sustainable development.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The indiscriminate felling of trees in our forest and the attitude of the people in Oredo Local Government Area, Edo State towards our forest has necessitated a massive scale and the people seem to be unaware of its consequences. This study therefore is geared towards finding solutions to some of the problems of deforestation. This study intends to find out the following problems;</p> <p>1.    Do deforestation lead to flooding</p> <p>2.    What are the causes of deforestation in Oredo Local Government Area, Edo State?</p> <p>3.    Is deforestation cause by lack of proper management of forest?</p> <p>4.    What are the measures being made to control deforestation?</p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aims of the study are;</p> <p>1.    To identify the causes of deforestation in Oredo Local Government Area.</p> <p>2.    To identify the problems created by deforestation in Ovia North East Local Government Area.</p> <p>3.    To assess the attitude of people of Ovia North East Local Government Area towards the existing forest.</p> <p>4.    To assess the efforts made by the government to reduce the problems of deforestation.</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1.   Does deforestation cause flooding?</p> <p>2.   Does expansion of farmland lead to deforestation?</p> <p>3.   Does overgrazing lead to deforestation?</p> <p>1.    Does urbanization/industrialization lead to deforestation?</p> <p>2.    Does Overpopulation and poverty lead to deforestation?</p> <p>6.   Does deforestation lead to climate change?</p> <p>1.    Does deforestation lead to decreased biodiversity, habitat loss and conflicts?</p> <p>2.    Does deforestation have any social consequences on the people?</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The fact that our forest is one of the beauties of nature and an effect means of controlling erosion, man has in either consciously or unconsciously and indiscriminately too. If no efforts are made to guard this, the younger generation may find it very difficult to know what a natural forest look like. They may also be denied of good forest produce for their economic needs and uses. Hence the effort being made by the government in preserving and consolidating the forest in form forest resources is highly impressive.</p> <p>The study is of importance in that it will enlighten the leaders and the public of our obligation of the forest. To point out the importance of forest to guide against erosion. It will also aid government and forestry officials on how to protect our forest.</p> <p>The study is of immense importance of the people of Oredo Local Government Area in the sense that to clearly preserve the forest and also on how to plant trees to check erosion.</p> <p><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>The study is set out to determine the causes and effect of deforestation in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State. Therefore, the study is restricted to both men and women in the Local Government Area of Study.

It also analyses the problems of mass media to cassava and plantain farmer’s recommendation was also made.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.    <strong>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</strong></p> <p>According to the business dictionary, information is defined as a “Data that has been verified to be accurate and timely. It is specific organized for a purpose and presented within a context that gives its meaning and relevance which can lead to an increase in understanding and decrease in uncertainty. Reits (2010) defines information that when experienced at the conscious level as a  question, gives rise to a search for an answer, information is a fact and knowledge needed to answer some questions faced by people in their daily life.</p> <p>The world Encyclopedia defines information is any kind of event that affects the state of a dynamic system. The valve of information lies solely on its ability to affect a behaviour, decision or outcome. A piece of information is considered valueless, if after receiving it, and things remain unchanged. Agriculture play an essential role in everyday human activities ranging from the provision of primary needs like food, clothing and shelter to secondary needs like construction, manufacturing etc. while much of the world is still stuck in subsistence agriculture majorly in remote part of the country, a little proportion of agriculture is just being practiced under the light of civilization and mode4rnization. That is to say farmers in the remote part of the country need to be constantly fed with information, idea, knowledge and skills developed from the Research Institute for better Farming Practice and eventual increase in yield. Information might be inform of new technology like storage facilities, better farming system like mechanization, access to credit facilities etc. for Agricultural information to be effective, after the information has been conveyed from the door, i.e. ministry of agriculture and the subordinate like research institute, Agricultural Development Project (ADP) etc to the receiver to the donor of the information must be accomplished.</p><p>                             </p> <p>Also, Agricultural Information tend to connect the different departments of agriculture be elaborating on how judiciously individual department by products can be utilize by another department another, example, Nigerian is naturally fixed to the soil by some legumes like Callopogonuim Mucunoide, which will eventually increase the nutritive valve of livestock that feed on them while the excreta of the livestock is used to manure for crops to increase their yield. It can be represented sectionally as below.</p><p>                                                                               </p> <p>The means of transporting agriculture may be through extension agents or through mass media. Media transit their information electronically with television, film, radio, movies, CDs, DVDs and some other gadgets like cameras or video consoles. Alternative print media uses a physical object as a means of sending their information such as newspaper, magazines, Brochures, Newsletters, books, leaf lets and pamphlets. Outdoor media is also a form of mass media which comprises billboards, signs, placards, placed inside and outside of commercial buildings like shops/buses, public speaking and event, organizing e.g. demonstration are also considered as mass media.</p> <p>Mass media have been acclaimed to be a very effective medium for diffusing the scientific knowledge, innovation and technology to the masses in a country like Nigeria precisely Edo State where farmers literacy level is low. The choice of communication medium is of vital importance. Radio for example, because of its low  cost and affordability by virtually all classes of income  earners, it can transfer modern agricultural technology to both literate and illiterate farmers even in interior could serve as a suitable medium of disseminating information and latest technical know-how. The farmers can easily understand the operations technology and instruction through television. The print media widened the scope of communication. It is cheap and farmers can afford to buy and read them at their convenience. It is a permanent medium in that the message are imprinted permanently with high storage value which makes them suitable for reference and research.</p> <p>Cassava as the name implies is one of the staple foods consumed locally by the people of Edo State (Nigeria). Recently, the Federal Government has decided to increase the rate of cassava farmers so as to be able to produce food for the masses.</p> <p>Also the federal government launched an initiative aimed at consolidating Nigeria’s position as the largest producer of cassava in the whole world. In addition to what was included as part of the package is a research into some possible industrial linkage that would lead to making the cassava a key export product in no distant future.</p> <p>Cassava is presently used in the production of garri, industrial starch; alcohol, fufu and animal feeds cassava flour can also be gotten from cassava. This is one product that is found throughout the state and would support all sizes of investors. Investors are assured of relatively cheap and staple source of raw materials in Edo State. Opportunities also exist for large scale farming of cassava.</p> <p>The production of cassava is concentrated in the hands of numerous small holders farmers located primarily in south-south state which include Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta Edo and Rivers. These farmers use manual processing techniques in the processing of cassava. Cassava can be interplant with maize plantain etc. cassava can get matured within six month of cultivation and ready for harvest.</p> <p>Plantain (Musa Spp) occupies a strategic position for rapid food production in Nigeria. It is ranked among starchy food/staples. The consumption of plantain has risen tremendously in Nigeria. In recent years, because of the rapidly increasing urbanization and the great demand for easy and convenient foods by the non-farming urban populations. Besides, being the staple for many people in more humid regions, plantain is a delicacy and favoured snack for people. A growing industry, mainly plantain chips, is believed to be responsible for the high demand being experienced now in Nigeria. Plantain production in Nigeria has witnessed a steady risk for more than 20 years. As at (2004) Nigeria produce 2.10 million tons harvested from 389,000 hectare production (A.O 2006). Plantain is a majorly source of carbohydrate for more than 50 million Nigerians. In the country, all stages of fruit from immature to overripe are used as a source of food in one form or the other. The immature fruits are peeled, sliced, and made into powder and consumed as plantain fufu. The mature fruits (ripe or unripe) are consumed boiled, steamed, batch, pounded, roasted, or sliced into drips, overripe fruit serve as composite in the making of baby food (Babena and Sogamusa), bread, biscuit and others (Ogazi 1996, Akyyeampong 1999).</p> <p>The fruits are produced all years round, the major harvest comes in the try season (November to February) when most other starchy product or staples are unavailable or difficult role in the bridging the gap hunger (Wilson 1986). In Nigeria, plantain peels are used as feed for livestock, while the dried peels are used for soap production. The dried peels are used for soap production. The dried leaves sheath and petioles are used as tying materials sponges and roofing materials.</p> <p>1.    <strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>In Nigeria, the important of cassava and plantain industry cannot be underrated based on the vital role they play in human nutrition, source of employment and income generation at large international potash institution (1957) identified the principal product of cassava to be fain. The three main products gotten from cassava after being processed include garri, flour and fufu. The use of these products which may be locally for consumption by human and livestock or industrially used as raw materials, while plantain a major source of carbohydrate for more than 50 million Nigerians (Ogazi 1996). The ripe plantain is also a major source of iron and also a delicacy for diabetic patient.</p> <p>However, cassava and plantain farmers are faced with some problems which include.</p> <p>1.    Land tenure system problem.</p> <p>2.    Fund problems.</p> <p>3.    Problem of improved planting materials and pest disease.</p> <p>The agricultural role of mass media in disseminating agricultural information, innovation and idea in the study areas has never been recognized despite the fact that researchers are still trying to bridge the gap between  the research stations and these rural farmers (cassava and plantain farmers). This has consequently marginalized agriculture and farming family which resulted to low productivity in spite of the efforts of the mass media in communicating agricultural information to the farmers.</p> <p>Therefore this research attempts to address some of the following research question.</p> <p>·         Do socio-economic characteristics of the farmers have any influence on the sources of information through mass media?</p> <p>·         What are the available mass media that have been used to communicate extension delivery services to the cassava and plantain farmers?</p> <p>·         What are the problems cassava and plantain farmers face in accessing the mass media sources.</p> <p>·         What are the factors that constrain respondents from using mass media?</p> <p>·         <strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The general objective of the study is to examine the role of mass media in disseminating agricultural information to cassava and plantain farmers in Edo State while the specific objectives are to:-</p> <p>·         Examine the social- economic characteristics of cassava and plantain farmers</p> <p>·         Examine the farmers accessibility to mass media</p> <p>·         Ascertain mass media type through which respondents sought agricultural information.</p> <p>·         Ascertain respondents perceived role of mass media as information source</p> <p>·         Examine factors that constrain respondents use of mass media as information source.</p> <p>·         Identify the problems limiting farmers from cultivating cassava and plantain.</p> <p>·         <strong>SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope the study is limited to Ovia North East Local Government Area only</p> <p>1.    <strong>HYPOTHESIS  </strong></p> <p>There is no significant relationship between respondent’s access to mass media and their perception of relevance of mass media as information source.</p> <p>1.    <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It has been ascertained that mass media play an important role in transiting information to large number of audience simultaneously. Yet, Okwu and Obinne (2000) have indentified the main problem of agriculture in Nigeria as that of transfer of new technology information, innovations to farmers and not lack of them perse it is  known that mass media haves been making useful contributions to agricultural technology information and innovat6ion adoption. This study seeks to establish the clear5 existence of utilization by both cassava and plantain farmers in Edo Ovia North East Local Government Area Edo State</p> <p>Hence, the recommendation from this study will be useful to policy makers, researchers, ADP and other stakeholders in agricultural development agencies.

The problems are accessioned by high rate of population growth which has arisen the failure of food production to cope with national demand. Agricultural sector has a unique role to play in the quest of putting the Nigeria economy on the production of balanced self reliant and non inflationary growth. The study of economic history provides us with sample evidence that an agricultural evolution is a fundament production for economic development. The agricultural sector has a potential to be the industrial and economic spring boards more often than not agricultural activities are usually concentrated in the less developed rural areas where there is a crucial need for transformation, re- distribution, poverty alleviation and social economic development.</p> <p>Agricultural activities comprises of crop and animal production, there have been growing concerns in the recent years at the low level of protein intake, especially of animal origin in spite of various agricultural development strategies adopted in Nigeria, daily per-capita, animal protein intake estimated as less than log or remains as far cry from the food and agricultural organization (FAO) recommendation minimal requirement of 35g (Usman 2003) in order to bridge this gap, it has been suggested that there is the need to explore of or source animal protein in addition to the conventional source such as ruminants and poultry (Olayide and Heady 1981) one of the important alternative source of animal protein, which has received relatively scanty attention in Nigeria as the snail.</p> <p>The problem of animal protein intake in Nigeria has encouraged researcher to look for source of protein from animal which are reared with little or no capital. Micro livestock such as snail, glasscutter and rabbit have been domesticated and a lot of work is going on aimed to increase their availability at a reduced price, Snail farm environmental friendly and can be done with little skills (Alkinusi 1988 NCR 1991).</p> <p>In Africa countries snail production is also relevant and according to some researcher, snail in Africa is known as Achatina Fulica and other achatinal species, giant Africa snails. They can grow up to 326mm (1ft ¾ inch) in length. Their native range is south of the Sahara in East Africa. This snail was purposely introduced into India in 1847. There was an unsuccessful attempt to establish it in Japan in 1925. It has been purposely and accidentally transported to other pacific locations and was inadventenly released in California after World War II, in Hawaii, and later in North maimi Florida in the 1970s. In many places, it is a serious agricultural pest that causes considerable crop damage. Also, due to its large size, its slime and fecal material create a nuisance as does the odour that occurs when something like poison bait causes large numbers to die (Wikipedia, 19 may 2015).</p> <p>1.    <strong>STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>Roasted snail shells have been found in Archaeological excavations and indication that snails have been eaten since prehistoric times. Roman snail, was an ancient method of snail farming or horticulture in the region about tanquinia. This snail farming method was described by folvius lippinus (49BC) and mentioned by marcuc Terentis varro in De Re Rustica III, 12.</p> <p>There was an unsuccessful attempt to establish it in Japan in 1925. It has been purposely and accidentally transported to other pacific locations and was inadvently released in California after world war II, in Hawaii, and later in north maimi florida in the 1970s. also, due to its large size, its slime and fecal material create a nuisance as does the odour that occurs when something like poison bait causes large numbers to die. The U.S has made considerable effort to eradicate Achatina. The U.S. department of Agriculture (USDA) has banned the importation and possession of live giant Africa snails. However, they are still sought after as pets due to the vibrant “tiger stripes on their shells.</p> <p>Many who are into snail farming in Nigeria are also unwilling to let others know about the farming methodology. The techniques are often shrouded in secrecy. Nigeria economic recovery and programmes have necessitated a radical shift from total dependent on government for jobs to self employment in snail rearing. It is a great money-spinning business that can provide a substantial source of protein to complement Nigerian carbohydrate meals.</p> <p>Snail is an important source of protein, snail also plays an important role in folk medicine irrespective of snail considerable high potentials, local snails production has failed to meet the country demand is for higher than the supply (kehinde 2004).</p> <p>Considering the high prospect in the industry the provision of protein through snails availability and creating employment for the producers and marketers, people are therefore advised and encourage to go into snail farming. Hence the question seemed to arise.</p> <p>How profitable is the snail production as a snail and medium scale enterprise. What are the factors or constraints is removed so that snail farmers livelihood can be improved which will turn as an improvement on agricultural production of the nation.</p> <p>1.    <strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Snail farming is not a new concept. From the pre-historic age, human has been consuming snail meat because of its high rate of protein, iron, low fat and including almost all the amino acid which is needed for human body. Snail farming has many kinds of benefits in the recent years. Snail farming increasing day to day and turns into a large scale small voltage industry because of its real economic value, for the purpose of this research work the following are the objectives of the study:</p> <p>1.    Examine the socio-economic characteristic of snail producers in Uhunmwode L. G. A  in Edo state/Nigeria</p> <p>2.    Identify the production system adopted by snail farmers in Uhunmwode L.G.A in Edo state, Nigeria.</p> <p>3.    To develop a resilient programme that links agriculture with industry and commerce.</p> <p>4.     Examine the determinant of revenue accruing to snail production in the area.</p> <p>5.    Determine the cost and returns to snails production and determine it viability.</p> <p>6.    To develop human capacities for the empowerment of individuals and groups.</p> <p>7.    Identify the constraints of snail production in the study area.</p> <p>8.    <strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>SCOPE</strong></p> <p>In an attempt to carry out this research work on the economic analysis of snail production in Uhunmwode local Government Area in Edo State, I have decided to know the extent at which snail production or snail farming will undertake or undergo in the economic aspect of Uhunmwode community.</p> <p>Uhunmwode is a Local Government Area of Edo State, Nigeria. Its heads quarter is in the town of Ehor.</p> <p>It has an area of 2,033;Km2 and a population of 120,813 at the 2006 census (NIPOST, 2009).</p> <p>With her population the community can be said to account t for a significant quantity of farm produce that come out of Uhunmwode Local Government Area.</p> <p>Snail farming in Uhunmwode community have not yet be taking edge in the production processes but with my research work carried out concerning snail production in Uhunmwode community can pick up the snail business and use  it in developing their community internally,</p> <p>Snail is hermaphrodite animal and snail is a good healthy proteinous food compare to other meats. Snail is very easy to rear compare to other animals, it does not bite, kick, sting or harm and they don’t mess up the environment.</p> <p>The reproductive organ in snail are in both the male and female, although two snail have to mate in order to fertilize their eggs, so this has show that the Uhunmwode community need not much revenue to start up the business of snail farming in the community.</p> <p>As much, I the researcher hope to gather information that will be useful for this research topic and the above zone would represent the whole Edo State in Nigeria.</p> <p>1.    <strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS/ TERMINOLOGY </strong></p> <p>2.    ECONOMIC: Economics is the social science that seeks to describe the factors which determine the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services.</p> <p>3.    ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: this measures the social and economic outcomes of an initiative.</p> <p>4.    WHAT IS SNAIL: Snail is a hermaphrodites or a creeping animal.</p> <p>5.    PRODUCTION: it is the transformation of raw materials into finished goods and the provision and distribution of goods and services in order to satisfy the final consumer.</p> <p>6.    SNAIL PRODUCTION: This is the process of farming or raising snails.

The social relationship it builds around (in particular control over land). More than any other activity, agriculture fuels the imagination and forges peoples cultures, so care is needed when considering the evolution of agriculture. Peasant farming is a localized system of agricultural farming usually operated on a small piece of land. This type of farming is practice in poor communities, since the farmers do not have enough capital. It is concerned with the provision of t he basic needs of the family. Farming activities are carried out without the use of machine rather crude implements are used such as cutlass, hoe, spade etc., the farmer also relies on and operates with family labour, the total yield from the farm is usually low where there is little or no excess or surplus for sale or capital investment.</p> <p>This type of agriculture is mostly practiced by peasant farmers and cost of production is very low. The practice provides direct employment  for many people since machines are not used. It also makes the environment to be free from pollution and there is also less danger of environment degradation. In Uhunmwonde local government area vast majority of farmers are still peasants who farms small plot of land, usually in marginal environment utilizing traditional and subsistence methods for their consumption because it is associated with low capital for production use of crude implement. These farmers live in rural area and are poor in nature hence their standard of living is low. Despite of these characteristics, peasant farming system has vital role to play in agricultural sector. So solutions therefore must be found for empowering peasants to deal with such problems.</p> <p>It is also associated with the problems of land ownership, soil type, availability of inputs and availability of manpower thereby discouraging the hope of large scale production among the farmers, and farm products among the farmers and mainly subsistence as a result of this, the farmers cannot meet up with their standards. The main purpose of this study was to identify solution to deal with challenges facing peasant farming system in Uhunmwonde local government, Edo State.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>In this project work attempt was made to find out the appropriate measure to adopt to carefully identified the problems and prospect of peasant farming in the area of study. The researcher examined some of the following problems.</p> <p>Why is productivity low in Uhunmwonde local government area?</p> <p>What are the steps taken so far either by government or individuals to increase farm productivity in the area of study?</p> <p>What is the type of farming system practice by these people in the locality?</p> <p>What is the cause of low-standard of living of the people?</p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objective of the study includes the following:</p> <p>To investigate the various problems of peasant farming in Uhunmwonde local government area.</p> <p>To look into how peasant farming affects the people in the locality.</p> <p>To find possible situation to the problems and give some possible recommendation of enhancing peasant farming in the area of study.</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>As a farmer what type of farming method would you employ?</p> <p>Do farmers in your area have access to financial assistance to carry out large scale farming?</p> <p>What is your occupation?</p> <p>Are there problems of in accessible road in your area?</p> <p><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work covers Uhunmwonde local government area.

Firstly, the local farmers in the area of study will be aware of agricultural production.</p> <p>Secondly, the general public who are interested in agricultural activities will also be aware of the farming in the area of study, this will help them to show positive attitude to farming.</p> <p>Thirdly, this project work will help the agricultural policy making body to focus attention in their area of priority.</p> <p>Finally, this project work will also help the agricultural policy making body to play an important roles in the need to improve subsistence farming to a large scale mechanized farming.</p> <p><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Peasant farming</strong>: This means farming mainly made for consumption with little or no left for sales and usually done on a small scale of land. It is concerned with the provision of basic need of the family.</p> <p><strong>Crude Implements</strong>: These are implement use to carry out work in a small piece of farm land, they are also known as simple farm tools e.g. cutlass, here, spade shovel etc. this type to tools are mostly use by peasant farmers because of the size of their land.</p> <p><strong>Commercial farming</strong>: This is the type of farming that is done on a large scale. Most of its operations are usually mechanized and it has high yield. Few labourers are required on the farm hence it can lead to unemployment. This type of farming is very expensive in terms of money, skilled labour and management. It is mostly practice by rich farmers.</p> <p><strong>Land tenure system</strong>: Land tenure is the relationship whether legally or customarily defined among people as individuals or groups with respect to land. Land tenure may also be described as a set of property relationship between two, it means the holding of land and the term tenant include owners, lessees and other occupiers of the land. It also means the right to hold property.</p>                                                            \n\nTHE PROBLEM AND PROSPECT OF PEASANT FARMING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROBLEM AND PROSPECT OF PEASANT FARMING", "id": 114}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Dedication iii<br/>Acknowledgements iii<br/>Foreword vi<br/>Executive summary vii<br/>1 Introduction 1<br/>1.1 Understanding rural transformation 2<br/>1.2 Bioenergy and rural development 3<br/>2 Agriculture and development in Sierra Leone 6<br/>2.1 Agriculture, inclusive growth, and economic diversification 6<br/>2.2 Boosting the productivity of smallholder agriculture 7<br/>2.3 Promoting foreign investment in agriculture 9<br/>3 The Makeni Project 13<br/>3.1 Leasing arrangements 14<br/>3.2 Engaging with local communities 16<br/>4 Field research approach and findings 20<br/>4.1 Field research elements 21<br/>4.2 Socio-economic conditions in the study area 25<br/>4.3 Key change processes 30<br/>5 Increasing the benefits of agro-industrial FDI 35<br/>5.1 Implications for rural livelihoods 35<br/>5.2 Outgrower opportunities 37<br/>5.3 The roles of the public and private sectors 38<br/>5.4 Expanding energy access 40<br/>6 Conclusion: Seizing opportunities 43<br/>6.1 An agenda for further inquiry 44<br/>Endnotes 45<br/>References 48<br/>Annex 1: Summary of interviews 54<br/>Annex 2: Household survey questionnaire (2014 version) 57<br/>Annex 3: Field researchers training manual 62</p>                                                          \n\nINVESTMENT IN AGRICULTURAL PROPERTY AS A CATALYST TO RURAL DEVELOPMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INVESTMENT IN AGRICULTURAL PROPERTY AS A CATALYST TO RURAL DEVELOPMENT", "id": 115}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Conservation practices all over the world are changing from the traditional management approach with emphasis on managing natural resources in a way that ensures greater flow to all stakeholders especially local communities. The shift in emphasis is informed by the fact that the local communities are inextricably tied to their cultural resources based whether used as a source of food, medicine, fuel or for maintaining ecological balance (Bisong, 2001) Thus,  sustainable management of natural resources requires a more comprehensive approach which include strengthening the organization and technical capabilities of rural communities, as well as engendering support for sustainable resources use from larger community group (Food and Agricultural Organization, 2005).</p> <p>The rapid loss of natural resources in developing countries has become a subject of increasing international and National Concern. This is reflected in the substantial increase in the interest accorded to environmental conservation by various governments, donors and conservation agencies. The level of interest in conservation as an environmental and   development problem requires practical action (Flint, 1990). the justification for community participation in natural resources conservation as viewed by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) 1990 provides that human culture must be based on a respect for nature and that the present generation have a social responsibility to conserved Nature for the welfare of future generation. The view recognizes that mankind is part of nature and that all species have an inherent right to exist regardless of their materials value to humans.</p> <p>In recent times, the development communities in African have moved from “top-down” approach towards more participatory “bottom up” approaches. The shift in paradigm has occurred in recognition of the fact that local cooperation, participation and management are crucial to achieving both short term development result and long-term sustainability. Along the same lines, the conservation community is beginning to appreciate the necessity of incorporating local participating in environmental conservation Efforts. (Bamberger 1986).</p> <p>The development, community participation may be viewed as a process that serves as instrument of empowerment, building beneficiary capacity, increase effectiveness desire to share cost, improve efficiency in relation to project (Paul, 1987).</p> <p>To maximize the chances of sustainable conservation initiatives, rural communities need to be involved in both the concept and approach. This means that participation in decision-making process and in the evaluation, monitoring and management of resources and the environment is crucial.</p> <p>This inclusiveness is more likely to build a conservation ethics where people understand that their livehood depends on healthy maintenance of the environment.</p> <p>Many studies have shown community participation to be one of the critical empowerment of success is irrigation, livestock, water, forestry and agriculture projects (Sharp, 1984) community participation has become therefore very important to scholars, organizations and Nations. For instance, Ajake (1998) remarked that participation has been used to justify the extension of state forest control as well as the building of local capacity and self-reliance. It has been used to justify decision imposed by external agencies as well as describe the process of developing real power and decision making.</p> <p>Experience has shown that participation grows more out of practical than normative considerations. One of the most expensive forestry programmes with community participation is that operated by village forestry associations in South Korea (AHN 1978; Eckholm, 1979) and the afforestation sub-project in Nepal (World Bank, 1975). Other experiences include community conservation in Tsavo West National park, Kenya where the local communities are involved and have benefited from conservation of protected areas. A reforestation project in Senegal gained impressive results as Senegal forest service works in rural community and councils providing them with inputs, while the village councils contribute labour to plant trees. Income generated from the sale of wood was used by the council according to its own priorities (Uphoft, 1986).</p> <p>The need for communities to invest in natural resources conservation and to reduce the effect of environmental degradation is indisputable in Nigeria and particularly in Akamkpa Local Government Area of Cross River State. The people in the study area are highly dependent on forest ecosystem for its diverse and abundant Natural wildlife, land, food and water resources. The importance of these resources has caused indigenous people to diverse way of managing them sustainably. But evidence has shown that the activities of the rural people are not given consideration. In research and government policies and decisions on the management of Natural resources neglects their activities in the study area.</p>                                                           \n\nTHE LEVEL OF COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN THE CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE LEVEL OF COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN THE CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES", "id": 116}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Cheese, a popular food across many cultures has been subject of many studies.

In this study, we aimed at determining the proportion of calcium content in cheese. Thus, recommending a daily intake of cheese for Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for calcium. Samples of Cheese were collected from five zones in the Lagos environs. Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) and Titrimetric methods were used for determining the calcium content. The two methods used in this analysis have showed to be appropriate for the determination of calcium in cheese. From the results, the calcium contents inn local cheese (Wara) determined in the experiment ate within the permissible and allowable limit of Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAS) by the World Health Organization (WHO). Thus, a recommended daily intake of local cheese for Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for calcium was given in Table 4.2.

They are as old because they have got their history back in antiquity and contemporary because they are still with us today. Often, when technology is being talked about, the attention of many people first goes to the advanced technologies in countries like Europe and America without paying attention to the simple arts and crafts which emanated from Africa. This research essay aims at pointing out that modern science and technology in Europe today derived their origin from simple arts and crafts. There are abundant of arts and crafts upon which, the traditional skills are based, but I shall focus on oil-palm production with a view to stressing the fact that had long been in existence in Africa as it was the case in developed countries like Britain and America. It is aimed at bringing into limelight the technology involved in the oil-palm production since the earliest times.<br/>Oil-production had for a long time been an important phenomenon in Nigeria localities. It developed with the people. Oil-palm takes great part and parcel of the cooking of food, making of bath soaps, e.t.c. Its importance, therefore cannot be over-emphasized. The research aims at showing the active participation of indigenous people through the harnessing and utilization of local materials and national resources. The essay will show that all the materials tools, skills, and techniques used are locally available.<br/>Furthermore, the study will show the various ways and systems by which the oil-palm is being produced which vary from one locality to another based on geographical environment and beliefs.<br/>The study will further show that the oil-palm production has also been useful in cooking of meals and making of bath soaps. It presents the various sites of the community and also shows that Africans also engage in indigenous occupation such as oil-palm production.<br/>    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The scope of this research is from the period 20th century to 21st century. The different methods used in the industry i.e, oil-palm industry in Ejigbo community, Osun state. In this work also, attempt will be made at century prior to the 21st century.<br/>The researcher aims at showing the active participation of indigenous people through the harnessing and utilization of local materials and natural resources, and the different processing or processes used in the production of the oil-palm. Also, the production of the palm kernel in general which is being used for further production of other useful products.<br/>Through the oil-palm industry, quite a lot of needs of people were met in terms of local lamps which were used for illuminating in darkness. Oil-palm is being put on the local lamp which is made of clay with cotton on it. Oil-palm is used as medicine for treating ulcer and stomach-ache and cough for adults and children.It shall be seen at the end that indigenous industries have their rightful place in our local communities, abroad and areas where misconceptions are still rampant that Africans are technologicallybackward.The study will further show that oil-palm has also been useful by carpenters and wood workers to prevent decaying.<br/>    RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND PROBLEM.<br/>In writing this essay a number of works have been consulted with ranged from secondary to primary sources. A good number of past essays and textbooks were consulted. The bulk of this work depends mostly on oral interview. Also contacted is the Ejigbo community library. Though, there is dearth of journals by better Life Programme an arm of the local government. This publication, however, gives less attention to oilpalm industry in Ejigbo community and other indigenous technology in the area.<br/>Furthermore, the researcher interviewed a number of people in the town who were major producers of oil palm in Ejigbo community. It is also important to note that during the interview, the researcher usually asked of the age of the owners of those oil palm industries.<br/>It is from the information gathered from these various sources that the researcher had finially attempted to present objective account of indigenous technology in Ejigbo community, a study of oil palm industry since 1960-2000.<br/>A work of this nature cannot be fully undertaken without some constraints such as the unwillingness of the informants to gives information to the researcher, because some of them thought that the interviews would be used for tax assessment. In solving this problem, the informants had to be convinced and englightened on the purpose of the interview before they could pass some information to the researcher.<br/>In spite of this, some still demanded for gifts before information could be given. These limitations not withstanding, the researcher overcame such constraints through determined efforts and repeated calls which had proved quite successful for the study.<br/>    LITERATURE REVIEW.<br/>Various people have appreciated the works of arts, especially, the indigenous industry and have attempted to find out about its origin, its technique and its development through researches. Its is for this purpose that the present study had undertaken a review of the relevant literature on oil palm industry in Ejigbo community. Books consulted are not only limited to works on oil palm, but emphasis also placed on books written by scholars on social and Economics developments of oil palm Industry.<br/>Martin susan’s oil palm and protest discusses the demand and market for the industry. Olufemi Ekundare’sAn economic History of Nigeria provides information on the economic development of oil palm industry to the people and even to Nigeria as a whole. Brouk B’s plant consumed by Man, helps to butteress the fact that oil palm as a product is essential and very useful in the society for domestic and some other uses, it also helps in the aspect of patronage.<br/>Also relevant is T.M Ilesanmi;s book titled, Ise Isenbaye. The book also is of help to me especially in the area of production and technique. It was more clearer to the reader without any problem.<br/>    HISTORICAL BACKGROUND<br/>Ejigbo community is a major Yoruba town in Osun state of Nigeria. It is about 40kilometers from Oshogbo, the capital of Osun state. The 1963 Nigerian census estimated its population to be 46,000 with a landmass of 25square kilometers. Populated to be 132,641 as at the 2006 cenus.<br/>According to oral history, Ejigbo is an ancient settlement founded by Akinjole Ogiyan, abbreviation of Ogiriniyan, right after the old Oyo. Ogiyan has a rich pedigree been a descendant of Oduduwa and the ruling family of Ife. Together withhis brothers, particularly the Akire , the founder of Ikire-Ile, they left Ile- Ile with Oranyan(oranmiyan),the founder of old oyo,to establish their own towns. The fact that ogiyan, is from Ile-Ife is confirmed by Ejigbo Mekun’ the name of a market in Ile-Ife. Akinjole settled many other villages spread around yorubaland. He is the paramount ruler and prescribed authority over many, if not all of them.<br/>The following towns and villages ,among others were under him, Ika, igbon,olosin ologede,inisa, aato, ijimoba, afake , ilawo, inisa edoro, isundunrin, olia,ado ori-oke,ayegunle, idigba, ibogunde, songbe, olorin osuntedo and iwata.<br/>Around 1835, Ejigbo came under Ibadan, when the Ibadan army movedto protect Osogbo from Ilorin invaders. In fact, detachments from Ejigbo assisted the Ibadan army in the ijaye, jalimi, and kiriji wars between 1860 and 1866.<br/>Ajayi ogboriefon, balogun and leader of the Ibadan army in the jalumi war circa 1860 and 1878 was a native of Ejigbo from the Akala compound and his mother, Alagbabi was the daughter of an ogiyan of Ejigbo. In 1934, when the then government retioined to the terms of the 1893 treaty which recognized Ibadan’s independence and gazettes the baleand divisional council of Ibadan as an independent native authority, five district Obas including the ogiyan were made members of the Divisional Council.<br/>The traditional markets are the ones in the centre of the town, and few others in some other quarters. There is now a traditional markets fixed for every Saturdays as is the case in many Yoruba towns. It is situated at the centre of the town, in front of the palace and it is also the most favored for night shopping and other social activities.<br/>In the past, it was used as recreational centre for the town, and therefore, was attended by many who even had nothing to buy or sell.<br/>Ejigbo did not escape foreign influence especially, the nineteenth century events that permeated Nigeria. Its people and culture changed with the flow. For example, many people have been converted to Islam and Christianity. The Baptist, being the dominant Christian mission in the town, now has a number of churches and it was through its efforts that the people of the town established the first fully fledged secondary grammar school; the Ejigbo Baptist high school followed the Asarudeen Grammer School. Ejigbo is tolerant of its diverse faiths. This is demonstrated in the joint celebration annual Orisa Ogigan festival.<br/>Although, there is no substantial evidence as to the exact date of the origin of oil-palm industry in Ejigbo community, but oral evidence suggests that the industry is as old as the emergence of the town around 14th century AD. But Ejigbo community and its province have relatively nitrous land, there seems to be enough food materials and farm produce which are being planted in large scale. The palm tree of which so many materials are being got from such as brooms which are meant for cleaning of the environment, palm wine, palm kernel, to mention few is a very good example.<br/>Moreover, oral evidence suggests that the availability of these products by and large, made and encouraged the expansion of Ejigbo community market. The market became expanded as a result of settlement in Ejigbo community by people from far and near who participated in this flourishing business of buying and selling of the product of these oil-palm industries.<br/>These markets became avenues for heterogeneous population with different cultural background. Therefore, availability of Ejigbo community, made oil-palm industries a flourishing one in Ejigbo community to date.<br/>    CHAPTER ANALYSIS.<br/>This research covers four chapters ranges from 1960 – 2000. The first chapter deals with the aims and objectives of the study, scope of the study, research methodology and problem, literature review and historical background of the industry. While the second chapter deals with the organization of the industry that is, the labour, techniques of oil palm processing, and the product of oil palm. While chapter three entails the marketing of palm oil product, that is the local market, the long distance market patronage. And the last chapter deals with the value of the product such as the employment for the people, impacts on local economic developments.<br/>    NOTES AND REFERENCES.        <br/>1.     Martins Susan Oil palm and protects Cambridge University,        1980<br/>7.     Oral evidence, Mrs. Alirat Amoo.  20/07/2010<br/><br/><br/>\n\nOIL-PALM PRODUCTION IN EJIGBO COMMUNITY IN OSUN STATE, 1960-2000<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " OIL-PALM PRODUCTION IN EJIGBO COMMUNITY IN OSUN STATE, 1960-2000", "id": 119}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ANALYSIS OF LABOR USE AND FOOD SECURITY AMONG RURAL MAIZE FARMERS IN ODEDE LGA, OGUN STATE.</b><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>The study examined the Analysis of labor use and food security among rural maize farmers in odedelga, ogun state.<br/>More specifically, the study sought to assess the labor use and food security among farmers.<br/>The study consist of all farmers in Odeda Local government area, Ogun state, a two -Stage sampling procedure was employed in the selection of the respondents’ maize crop farmers within the study area,twenty-five maize farmers was randomly selected from each of the villages which one hundred and twenty (120) maize crop farmers gave complete information that was used for the final analysis.<br/>A well- developed questionnaire was designed to elicit information from the respondents, the data collected were analyzed using the descriptive statistics, food security index and the probit regression model.<br/>Result from the study indicated that maize farmers in Odeda Local Government Area of Ogun State make use of hired and family labour in varied proportion. Also the usage of more family labour tend to increase rural maize farming households’ ability to be more food secure while usage of more hired labour tend to decrease rural maize farming households’ ability to be food secure .<br/>Base on this, the study advised that credit facilities should be made available and accessible to the farming households,Government and Non-Governmental Organizations should encourage youths to go into farming so as to reduce pressure on white-collar jobs, and finally awareness creation on family planning should be made because it will go a long way in reducing rural farming household size since there is tendency of being food insecure with large household size.<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/>Food is any nourishing substance that is eaten, drunk, or otherwise taken into the body to sustain life, provide energy, promote growth, etc. It is an indispensible perquisite for the survival of mankind and its economic activities including food production. For food security to exist at the national, regional and local levels, food must be available accessible and properly utilized. It is a basic necessity of life. Food is regarded as the basic means of sustenance, and an adequate food intake in terms of quantity and quality, is a key, for healthy and productive life (FAO, 2005). It is perhaps the most important commodity linking rural producers and urban consumers (Rengasamy et al. 2003). Food accounts for a substantial part of the typical Nigerian household budget. Various foods serve as important vehicles for taking nutrients into the body and bringing about a healthy state, hence the need for taken, there classes, of essential nutrients, which must be combined in appropriate proportion to ensure an adequate food intake. These include: carbohydrates, proteins, fats and oil, vitamins and minerals (Omonona, Agoi and Adetokunbo, 2007). The need for food is topmost in the hierarchy of needs as it is essential for healthy living. Thus, achievement of food security is important in any given country.<br/>Africa with its vast land area covering 3 billion ha has 1.3 billion ha of agricultural land out of which only 252 million ha (19.36%) is arable (FAO, 2011). Africa is the center of origin and also a major producer of several cereals like sorghum, pearl millet, finger millet, teff, African rice and maize. Maize has overtaken these traditional cereals. In Africa, it is grown over an area of 34.08 million ha producing 70.08 million tons (FAO, 2015). Maize is a major staple crop in diverse agro-ecological zones and farming systems, and consumed by people with varying food preferences and socio-economic backgrounds. Of the 22 countries in the world where maize forms the highest percentage of calorie intake in the national diet, are in Africa. Maize accounts for almost<br/>The final report of the 1996 World Food Summit states that food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active healthy life.It is a condition related to the supply of food, and individuals’ access to it.A farming household is therefore, adjudged food secure when the trio of food availability, food accessibility and food affordability is guaranteed in the required quantity and quality (World Bank, 2001). At the 1974 World Food Conference the term “food security” was defined with emphasis on supply. Food security, they said, is the “availability at times of adequate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuations in production and prices”.Itis also a situation that exists when all the people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary food preferences for an active and healthy life (UNFAO, 2001).<br/>The WHO states that there are three pillars that determine food security: food availability, food access, and food use.The FAO adds a fourth pillar: the stability of the first three dimension of food security over time. In 2009, the world summit on Food Security stated that the “four pillars of food security are availability, access, utilization and stability.<br/>Food availability means that enough safe and nutritious food either domestically produced or imported from the international market. Food availability does not ensure food accessibility. For food to be accessible individuals or families must have sufficient purchasing power or ability to acquire quality food at all times the utilization demands sufficient quality and quantity intake (Omonona et. al, 2007). These elements availability, accessibility and utilization in a larger context, embraces the supply, demand and adequacy of food at all times.<br/>Food insecurity, is a situation of \"limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways\", according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Mohammed (2003) noted that food insecurity exists when there is physical unavailability of food, lack of social and economic access to adequate food/or inadequate food utilization. Food insecure households are households whose food intake falls below their minimum calorie (energy) requirements, and those who exhibit physical symptoms caused by nutrient deficiencies resulting from inadequate diets. The dimensions of food security make it clear that the concept of food problem is a complex one with many dimensions. At one level, the concern is with national food security, which is the ability of countries to produce or increase sufficient food all the year to meet their requirement for both private and public distribution. At another level, the concern is more with the problem of malnutrition which could also affect labor.<br/>Agriculture is an important tool and vehicle for reducing the effect of household food insecurity, unemployment and poverty which are major in Nigeria (Moore, 2000). Agricultural productivity is linked to food security as higher agricultural productivity would translate to larger food supplies, lower food prices, higher farm income and higher purchasing power for other basic necessities for the attainment of household food security (Wunderlich and Norwood, 2006). To have sustainable development in agriculture there is need to make efficient use of basic production factors, which include land, labor and capital (Bervidova, 2001). Labor is one of the most important inputs in agricultural production.<br/>Labor is a service (person-years per year) and includes all human time-using activities, including what is sometimes labeled separately as labor and management. Labor services are perishable and hence cannot be moved to another period in time for use; workers, on the other hand, are durable, potentially working for many years as well as being geographically mobile. Labor plays a central and crucial role in agricultural production, particularly under small scale peasant production system. Human labor activates other production factors and transforms other farm inputs into the required outputs. It is about the only source of labor available to small-holder farmers in Nigeria. The smallholder farmers contribute the largest proportion (about 85%) of total domestic agricultural output in their area. Thus, the hope of continuing supply of food need of ever growing population anchors very auspiciously on human labor. How it is measured and valued is critical for establishing the cost of producing agricultural commodities and accurately portraying labor's relative share of the total cost of production. Farm labor includes all hired labor/contract which may be subdivided into; seasonal labor and task-contracted casual labor, exchange, and unpaid or family labor used in agricultural production. However, .the contribution of exchange labor to family’s overall labor input is low (less than 10%). Some studies (Echebiri&amp;Mbanasor, 2003; King 1972) confirm that farm labor supplied by humans on the farm is not homogenous and job content differ. These studies found that in general, men performed heavy farm operations such as land preparation, staking and harvesting with women and children performing lighter operations such as planting, fertilizer application and weeding. Ajibefunet. al., (2000) noted that hired labor contributes 88.0% [1]of the total use on farms thus emphasizing its importance in agricultural activities. Other types of labor that could be found employed are family labor and exchange labor. Researchers on farm labor supply have observed the total supply of labor depends on factors such as the size of the population, its age composition and certain institutional factors (Hardwick, 1994).<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa with an estimate of 150 million people (Nigerian Population Census, 2006). Approximately 68% 0f this population consists of women and children with over 70% residing and securing their lively in the rural areas (Maziya-Dixon et al., 2004). Agriculture in Nigeria is of notable relevance in the country’s economic development and growth. It contributes more than 48% of the total annual GDP, employs about 68% of the labor force, account for the over 70% of the non-oil exports and provided over 80% the food need of the country (Adegboye, 2004). Despite these notable roles, food insecurity RANKS top most among the developmental challenges facing Nigeria (Babatunde et al 2007). Food insecurity has been on the increase in most rural areas in Nigeria (Oni et al., 2011). In Nigeria food insecurity has risen from about 18% in 1986 to about 41% in 2004 (Sanusi et al 2006). In fact, food security is considered a measure of poverty in many societies since it reduces access to food (World Bank, 1991; Nord et al., 2000; Adeniyi and Ojo, 2013). Therefore, food security of households will improve if poverty is reduced (Philip et al., 2009; Aewuyi and Hayatu, 2011).<br/>The recent increase of food prices call for serious attention, due to challenges and crises facing the globe is worsening food and other Agricultural products crisis period unheard of in the last 30 years and the potential of leading to scarcity. That is why this vital issue has taken the most attention among world leaders, thereby increasing and agitating the concern for the world’s ability to feed its 6.8 billion people, to prevent world-wide instability as reported in most countries like Nigeria (Food and Agricultural Organization, 2013). As a result, various international organizations and individual countries embarked on aggressive food security movement to find a concrete solution to the situation in order to make food affordable to all.<br/>The Food Security assessment in 2005 proves that about 750 million people were food unsecured in almost 70 low-income countries. Furthermore, Asia and other Commonwealth States experienced a 30% decline in the number of those that are hungry. In Latin American and Caribbean countries has varied a little over time, but there has been a noticeable trend across the area as a wholly. In spite of the strong growth in food production, Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region where hunger has increase in the last ten years. The challenge today is that high food prices has led to the increase in food insecurity and widespread food crisis in many developing countries in which Nigeria is not excluded. However, poor people in developing countries spend about 50-80% of their monthly income on food meet consumers need. Any increase in food prices will reduce food consumption and increase hunger. In Nigeria however, the prices of rice, corn and wheat recorded a high roof-tops recently (FAO, 2013).<br/>Generally, this overall food crisis has been attributed to a number of factors including climate change, population growth, poor storage facilities, increased demand for bio-fuels, failure to improve crop yield, high oil prices resulting to increased input loss for producers and traders. The structural problems like under-investment in agriculture and dominance in supply chain of food and agricultural policies sky rocket prices of food. However, Studies have revealed that agricultural-based livelihood in rural Nigeria has a higher level of poverty than other occupational groups.Rural agriculture is limited to local variations in weather conditions, and thus expected variations in income levels and thus access to food respectively (Omonona, 2009). Additionally, Hired and Use labor is not only applicable where family labor is insufficient. The much desired transition from small-scale farming to commercial level production by expansion of production resources definitely requires outsourcing for additional labor. Blanc et- al. (2008) opines that the proportion of use labor in total farm labor use in many developing countries has continued to increase over time which makes this present study relevant.<br/>Achieving food security is still a challenge due to the global approach being employed instead of formulating and applying solutions based on specific locations with an understanding of the social system and livelihood system (FAO, 2003). Hence the study intends to assess labor use and food security among rural farming household in Oyo state, Nigeria.<br/>In essence, the study attempts to provide answers to the following questions:<br/>What are the socioeconomic characteristics of maize farmers in the study area?<br/>What are different labor sources available to respondent in the study area?<br/>How do maize farmers use the available labor?<br/>What is the food security status of the respondent?<br/>What are the determinants of household food security of the respondent? <br/>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The general objective of this study is to assess labor use and food security in the study area.<br/>The specific objectives are to:<br/>discuss the socioeconomic characteristics of the maize farmers in the study area,<br/>identify thedifferent labor sources available to respondents in the study area,<br/>examine labor allocation among the maize farmers,<br/>know the food security status of the respondent,<br/>determine the factors influencing household`s food security of the farmers. <br/>ANALYSIS OF OBJECTIVES<br/>The table 1.1 below presents the analysis of each of the objectives in terms of data requirement, sources of data, method of data collection and method of data analysis.<br/>TABLE 1.1 MATRIX FOR ANALYSIS OF OBJECTIVES<br/>OBJECTIVES    SOURCE OF DATA    METHOD OF DATA COLLECTION    DATA REQUIREMENT     TOOL(S) FOR ANALYSIS <br/>Discuss the socioeconomic characteristics of the maize farmers in the study area    Primary data    The use of a well-structured questionnaire    Household size, age of the household head, marital status,  level of education, etc.    Descriptive data (frequency, percentage, mean mode)<br/>Identify the  different labor sources available to respondents  in the study area    Primary data    The use of a well-structured questionnaire    Type of labor used by the respondent    Descriptive data (frequency, percentage, mean mode)<br/>Examine labor allocation among the maize farmers    Primary data    The use of a well-structured questionnaire          <br/>Know the food security status of the respondent    Primary data    The use of a well-structured questionnaire    Household per capita food expenditure, educational status, average monthly income, household size, age, etc    Regression analysis (probit model)<br/>Determine the factors influencing household`s food security of the farmers    Primary data    The use of a well-structured questionnaire    Socio-economic characteristics’ such as educational status of household head, marital status of household head, age of the household head, household size, etc.    Regression analysis (probit model)<br/>  JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY<br/>Today, maize ranks highly as a major staple food particularly for the low income earners and resource poor farm households in developing economies of sub-Saharan Africa (FAO, 2009). Maize serves over 200 million Africans; its comparative production advantage over other staples serves to encourage its cultivation even by resource that there obsolete (Bamidele et al., 2008; FAO, 2000). However, it is an important source of carbohydrate, protein, iron, vitamin B, and minerals. Furthermore, Green maize (fresh on the cob) is eaten parched, baked, roasted or boiled; playing an important role in filling the hunger gap after the dry season and serving as a staple diet for 200 million people (Directorate Agricultural Information Services in cooperation with ARC-Grain Crop Institute, 2003), while in developed countries, maize is consumed as second-cycle produce in the form of meat, eggs and dairy products. The importance of maize cannot be overemphasized, with Nigeria producing 43% of maize grown in West Africa. Maize is the most important staple food in Nigeria. It accounts for about 43% of calorie intake (Nweke et al., 1983; NARP, 1994). Maize has consumption quantity of 53.20 g/capital/day (FAOSTAT, 2007). Furthermore, the average annual per capita maize output for 2005-2014 is 105kg (NBS, 2015), while the per capita maize consumption is 175kg (FAO STAT, 2015). As a result, maize has received substantial research and extension attention. This generally also calls for the need to intensify effort on adoption of improved agricultural technologies for improved productivity and ensure food security. Even though several adoption studies explored technology adoption decision in developing countries like Nigeria (Feder et al., 1985; Rauniya and Goode, 1992; Ouma et al., 2006; Ojaiko et al., 2007; Idrisa, 2009), the studies fall short of addressing the effect of adoption of improved seed technology on food security status of farming households.<br/>World Food Program (WFP) (2013) reported that about 842 million people (one in every eight) across the world suffer chronic hunger. Almost all the hungry people live in the rural areas of developing countries, and belong to mostly farming families and represent about 15% of the population of such countries (Hunger Notes, 2013). Fakiyesi (2001) reported that 66% of Nigerians live below poverty line when judged by level of food security. Also, over 40% of the Nigerian population was found to be food insecure in 2005 (Sanusi et. al., 2006).<br/>Agricultural production in Nigeria though the mainstay of the economy, still rests largely on the shoulders of small-scale, resources-poor farmers who inhabit the rural areas of the country. It is heavily labor intensive with farmers relying on households for labor and supply. Gocowski and Oduwole (2003) confirmed labor as a major constraint to peasant agricultural production in Nigeria especially during planting, weeding and harvesting.<br/>Human labor is about the only form of farm labor available to small holder farmers in Southwest of Nigeria. This form of labor accounts for up to 80% of total farm power and constitute between 80 and 90% of the cost of production in many farming systems (Awoyemi, 1981; Dvorak, 1996).<br/>Generally, the scarcity of farm labor has be found to have negative impact on planting precision, better weed control, timely harvesting and crop processing (Oluyole et. al., 2011). However,noted that labor is a major constraint in peasant production especially during planting, weeding and harvesting. Also, observed that rapid growth in population which increases farm labor supply exerts so much pressure on land and reduces farm size per hectare. Empirical evidencehave shown that available farm labor forces comprised mostly of old people (to the exclusion of young men and women within the active working age) therefore having negative effect on agricultural productivity (Oluyole&amp; Lawal, 2010). The increasing absence of young people in framing could attribute to farm drudgery, poor farm income, rural-urban migration, food insecurity as well as generally lowlife expectancy in rural areas (Gill, 1991).<br/>Labor supply from family level has been dwindling considerably over the past years due to a number of factors, some of which are related. The achievement of international labor organization in child labor prevention coupled with the increasing awareness of importance of education even in the rural areas has increased the proportion of children in schools hence reducing time available to work on the farm (Diallo et. al., 2013). Rural-urban migration leaving mainly the aged and less mobile farmers to work on the farms as stated by (Oluyole et. al., 2013), low income, hunger and poor nutrition has also negatively affected the availability of labor on the farm. Also, vulnerable households such as women headed or orphaned households are usually unduly disadvantaged on labor availability and productivity (Babatunde et. al., 2008).<br/>The general notion and idea of food security will continue to be a recalling one, as it affects the wellbeing of the world population. Rural farmers in particular will consistently feature, as their involvement in food availability is on the increasing side. Accordingly, the information contained in this study is expected to provide some vital information regarding the specific ways rural farmers contribute to household food security in Egbeda, Oyo state. Moreover, the government and its agents, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), welfare planners, fellow researchers, and the general public will find this work as an invaluable source of reference.<br/>There is a possibility therefore that agricultural productivity in Nigeria may be limited as a result of poor use of labor which affects food security. It is therefore important to examine the relationship between labor, agricultural productivity and food security.<br/>1.6 PLAN OF THE REPORT<br/>This study is divided into five chapters.

Two plant products, Mynistic fragans and Aframomum melegueta obtained from the local market were pulverized and dissolved in Alcohol and water at concentrations of 1gk, 1.sgk, 2gk, 2.sgk, 3gk, 3.sgk and 4gk. Sections of Clarias gariepinus (1cm Thinkness) were soaked in above solution for 24hours. These were smoke dried and allowed to condition the laboratory for 2days before introducing the insect pest, Demetes Maculatus. The insects were repelled by the treated fish for about 3days before they could does into it and establish. Dry powder treatment was administered at 1g-4g/10g fish. Myrfistica fragans instantly repelled insects while Aframomum Melegenta did not. Mynistica fragans powder at all levels of treatment caused significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher mortalities than in control experiment. Mynistica fragans dissolved in water (HzO) did not produce significant (P&gt;0.05) mortality at all concentrations. However Myristica in Alcohol treatment produced significantly higher mortalities over Nutmeg (Myristica fragans) in water treatments Alcohol solution of Nutmeg at 3.sg/1 produced significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher mentalities over all other concentrations. Treatment using Aligator pepper (Aframomum Melegueta) in water at 2g/L was significantly (P&lt;0.05) differences were found between Nutmeg in Alcohol at 3g/L, Alcohol and Aligator treatment at 3.5g/L water and Aligator pepper at 2g/L. In powder treatments the highest significant mortalities were found in the highest doses 3.5g/10g fishes when compared with other doses and Aligator pepper (Aframomum Melegueta) were there were in mortalities.       <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    Introduction<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0    Literature review<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0    Material and methods<br/>3.1    Handling of plant products<br/>3.2    Purchase and maintenances of insect culture<br/>3.3    Preparation of fresh uninfected fish samples<br/>3.4    Treatment of uninfected fish<br/>3.5    Studies on mortality of D. maculates after contact infection<br/>3.6    Palatability test<br/>3.7    Summary of experimental plan<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.1    Result<br/>4.1    Experimental findings<br/>4.2    Filling up ANOVA table<br/>4.3    Discussion<br/>4.5    Conclusion &amp; recommendation<br/>Reference<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>Fish protein is known to be the best and cheapest source of animal protein (Olayide 1973) the loss of protein in dried fish due to known fish pest D. Macuatus has been variously qualified.<br/>Fish is a perishable biomaterial especially in the tropics where high temperature and humidity accelerate spoilage and Biodeterioration of fish immediately after catch. As a result of this, efforts are primarily directed towards the preservation of fish for human food.<br/>   However, poor handling, inadequate processing facilities, lack of ice or storage facilities, remoteness of the fishing villages to urban market centers, poor distribution channels have drastically reduced fish utilization in the tropics (Ames,1992). Efforts at the use of synthetic insecticides and other methods to control D. Maculatus have not presented pleasant results. This has led to a search for alternative user friendly methods especially the use of botanicals to control D. Maculatus (Okorie et al 1991).<br/>   The use of chemicals has helped increase of yields obtained but one of the major problems with the constant use of chemicals is that resistance can be induced in target organisms. Biological method control has been preferred in some cases because it is selective with no side effect and cheap. Resistance to biological control is rare and biological control agents are self propagating and self perpetuating (Okigbo and Ikediugwu 2000; Okigbo, 2003----2005).<br/>   Plants extracts have been used successful to control insect and pest in the tropics. (Amadioha and Obi, 1999; Onitade 2000. Emoghene, 2004).<br/>   The practice of applying synthetic insecticides has been found to be potentially dangerous when such fish is consumed. In some villages in Ghana where fish have been treated in this manner, people who consumed them, suffered blurred vision, dizziness and vomiting (Bull 1982).<br/>   Losses due to this polyphagons pest of products of animal origin has been properly documented for a very long time (Aret, 1964, Willams 1956, Proctor, 1970, Kimura and Takakura).<br/>   Dry fish is however susceptible to pest infestation. Osuji (1973) noted that D. Maculatus is the major pest of dry fish with occasional presence of others like Necrobia, Rufipes, Tubolium, Castenum, and Trogoderma, granamium. The two are pests of other products.<br/>   The importance of D. Maculatus in Nigeria has been highlited (Hayward 1961). Researches have extended to the use of extracts water and alcohol extracts of such botanicals as P. guineese, X. Aethropica, Myristica fragrans etc.<br/>   All these have proved effective but methods of extraction have proved to be very expensive and not even within the reach of the common market woman hawking her dry fish in the market. The crude powder though is effective in most cases but may be cumbersome in application and may be even negate the rates of application and add to the appearance of dried fish. In overall assessment may make managements and general handling a hell.<br/>   This study is seeking the best and most effective way of applying these botanicals to the fish so that it will appear like ordinary dry fish and infestation of D. maculates and possibly other pest.<br/>   We have designed a means of using water and alcohol (Industrial) reasoning that since they are edible solvents that could be use to infuse the active ingredients which had been rather extracted and tried into the fish with some botanicals; A. Melegueta and M. fragrans through soaking the fish to be preserved in such media. This is the reasoning that poor fish handlers can afford to do this.<br/>  The simple methods engaged could be steaming fish, boiling fish and soaking fish in such media in which different doses of the botanicals are soaked. The botanicals to be used are alligator pepper; A. Melegmeta and nutmeg myristica.<br/>   Our target is to find out the following;<br/>Whether the active ingredients of M. fragrans and A. Melegueta can be infused into the fish through dissolving in water and absolute alcohol (Industrial) and still bring effect as then crude powders.<br/>The rather ineffective A. Melegueta as powder whose water and alcohol extracts have been found to be effective were to see if it could be effective in this circumstance on D. Maculatus<br/>If fish treated with solutions of these botanicals at different concentration will still be palatable and aesthetically attractive<br/>Our over all objective in this finding is to find a cheap effective means of do it yourself preservation that can be within the reach of the common man in an environmentally friendly way.<br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE COMPARATIVE EFFECT OF MYRISTICA FRAGANS (NUTMEG) AND AFRAMOMUM MELEGUETA (ALLIGATOR PEPPER) ON DEMESTES MACULATUS DEGEER.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE COMPARATIVE EFFECT OF MYRISTICA FRAGANS (NUTMEG) AND AFRAMOMUM MELEGUETA (ALLIGATOR PEPPER) ON DEMESTES MACULATUS DEGEER.", "id": 121}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECT RATE OF FERTILIZER APPLICATION ON VEGETABLE (TELFAIRIA OCCIDENTALIS)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Field trials were conducted at the Imo poly Farm, Imo State Polytechnic Umuagwo in 2014 to determine the effect rate of fertilizer application on vegetable (telfairiaoccidentalis). The treatments involved nine fertilizer types namely; Aleshinloye grade A, Aleshinloye grade B, Sunshine grade A, Sunshine grade B, Pace setter grade A, Pace setter grade B, Neem compost,. Fluted pumpkin served as the test crop. The fertilizer types were applied at two levels each (0 and 60 kg. N ha-1). The treatments were assigned into a randomized complete block design with three replicates. Data were collected on growth parameters, nutritional composition and yield attributes of fluted pumpkin. The parameters assessed were significantly influenced (P&lt;0.05) by the applied fertilizer types. The highest vine length, number of leaves, nutritional composition, fresh shoots and seed yields were recorded at 60 kg. N ha,-1 irrespective of the fertilizer types. Although, the best performance of fluted pumpkin in terms of growth and fresh shoot yield were obtained from neem compost fertilizer type, this was comparable with results obtained with tithonia compost. The highest P (0.83%), K (0.82%), Mg (3.20%), Ca (0.48%), Fe (4.63%) and protein (4.60 mg/kg) contents of fluted pumpkin shoot were obtained from the plants under poultry manure treatment while plants receiving no fertilizer application recorded the least values for all nutritional attributes assessed. Neem compost (86.1 kg/ha) closely followed by tithonia compost (62.7 kg/ha) gave highest seed yield of fluted pumpkin as compared to other fertilizer types. Although, neem compost and poultry manure gave the best performance in terms of yield and nutritional composition respectively, there is no significant difference between the values obtained from these treatments and that recorded from tithonia compost. In conclusion, the growth, nutritional composition and yield of fluted pumpkin were improved by fertilizer types.<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1   INTRODUCTION<br/>In Africa indigenous vegetables remain popular in rural areas where they are often considered to be more nutritive than exotic vegetables.Telfairiaoccidentalis commonly called fluted pumpkin is an important leaf and seed vegetable indigenous to Southern Nigeria and grown in the forest zone of west and central Africa (Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone being the major producers). It probably originated in south east Nigeria and distributed by Igbos who have been cultivated this crop since time immemorial.<br/>The leaf is of high nutritional, medicinal and industrial values rich in protein (29%), fat (18%) and minerals and vitamins (20%).The nutritional value of pumpkin seeds is different from that of leaves. The protein contents of seeds and leaves are 20.5g and 2.9g, respectively [5]. Seeds have high nutritive and calorific values which make it necessary in diets. Fluted pumpkin is of local ethnobotanical importance in the folklore, dietary and cropping systems of Igbos. The level of iron is the factor for use of the leaf extraction as blood tonic which can be administered to weak patient.<br/>Nitrogen is usually ascribed with the building up of leaf tissues. This is one of the essential elements most commonly used to increase crop yield. It is a constituent of all protein and chlorophyll. Plant tissue, usually contains more nitrogen than any other nutrients. Nitrogen application is used to produce rapid vegetative growth of vegetables. It promotes luxuriant growth, and increases number of leaves. These encourage photosynthesis and partitioning of photosynthesis rate into the economic parts of the plant. It is also necessary for reproduction andpromotes the uptake of phosphorus and potassium by plants. However, nitrogen requirement for vegetable is 50kg N/ha or more in savannah zone of Nigeria [8]. It has been reported that 100kg N/ha is suitable for vegetable based on dual purposes (leaf+ fruit). The recommended rate for the production of fluted pumpkin is 16okgN/ha.<br/>In Nigeria, farmers realize the need for soil amendments by using available resources such as crop wastes, farmyard manure and poultry waste [10]. The use of organic fertilizer as source of nutrients to crops has recently received comprehensive review by Awodun,;Akanbi et al. and Ojetayo et al.. This fertilizer type improves soil's physical, chemical and biological conditions, which in turns improve crop growing environment and culminate in the better production of economic plant parts.<br/>Organic fertilizer fortified with inorganic materials specially formulated to replenish the soil and improve plant fertilization. It releases nutrients in soil in the form that plants can easily absorb, it will activate soil micro-organism and increase microbes, which will help decomposition process of organic matter and transform them into nutrients that plants can easily absorb. This will promote higher plant growth, healthier crops and better fruit yield. It reduces the needs of chemical fertilizer, which will lead to lower production cost and indirectly increases income. Organic crops contained higher levels of 21 essential nutrients than their conventionally grown counter parts including iron, magnesium, phosphorus and vitamin c. The organic crops also contained lower levels of nitrates, which can be toxic to body.<br/>Although, many research activities have reported better performance of crops with fertilizer application one of the method through which plants would display its potential genetic capability is by supplying the plants with adequate amount and types of fertilizer at the right time. Research efforts are therefore required to recommend fertilizer types for sustainable production of TelfairiaoccidentalisinUmuagwo, the Guinea Savanna zone of south west Nigeria.<br/> 1.1    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/> According to Jariene, the seeds contain about 50% fats, approximately 30% protein, sugar, B vitamins, ascorbic acid, Phytosteroles, Phytin, lecithin, oxycerotine, tyrosine, salicylic acid, and resins. The seed oil is also rich in glycerides of linoleic, oleinic, palmitin, and stearine acids. Omega-3 fatty acid was found to be present in pumpkin seeds; it helps to prevent artheriosclerosis, high blood pressure, and heart diseases; it also stimulates metabolism of accumulated fats. Oil-cake fats from pumpkin seeds contain large amounts of (almost 60%) of omega-3 acids twice that of cod liver oil. Pumpkin seed powder is used in China and the United States as an ingredient of salad dressings and in baked products. The seed oil is used as salad oil in Europe, and in India for cooking and lighting. The seed is used medicinally in the prevention of kidney stones. Seeds are eaten as an anthelmintic. In Mauritius an infusion of the seeds is used internally to treat hypertension and prostate complaints and externally to treat erysipelas.<br/>Seeds form a major part of the diet of Nigerians; They are consumed as a meal as well as ingredients of local soups. In southwestern Nigeria, pumpkin seeds are used locally as an alternative to “egusi” melon (Citrullus vulgaris Schrad) seed. Melon seeds are milled and used to prepare the popular “egusi” soup where they act as food thickeners. Pumpkin seeds are used alone or in combination with leafy vegetable.<br/>1.2    OBJECTIVE OF STUDY<br/>Main objective<br/>The effect rate of fertilizer application on vegetable (telfairiaoccidentalis)<br/>Specific Objective<br/>To examine the chemical component of fertilizer<br/>To study the nutritional effect of fertilizer in telfairiaoccidentalis<br/>MATERIAL AND METHOD<br/>Experiments will be conductedon 2014 cropping seasons at the Imo State Polytechnic Umuagwo, Imopoly farm. The bimodal rainfall of the area is between 1100mm and 1250mm of rain. The temperature regime is high all year round. The mean minimum temperature is 280C and the maximum temperature is 330C with a high humidity of about 740C all year round except in January when the dry wind blows from the North. During the period of the experiment, the mean minimum temperature is 270C and the maximum temperature is 310C with a high humidity of about 75% while the rainfall of the area is 1126mm of rain.<br/> SOIL SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS:<br/> The experimental site soil will be well drained on sandy loam. An initial soil sample is to be collected from surface 15cm for laboratory analysis prior to land clearing. The soil particle size will be done by hydrometer method. The pH will be determined in 1:2 soils: water suspension using a pH meter. The organic carbon will be determined by dichromate oxidation , total N by the Micro-Kjedahl method and available P by the Bray P-1 method. The exchangeable bases wiil displaced by neutral N NH4OAC. The K and Na contents in the extract will be determined with atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The exchangeable acidity (A1 and H) will be extracted with 1 N KCl and estimate titrimetrically.<br/> EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN<br/>Fluted pumpkins will be planted at thespacing of 75 x 90 cm. Soil samples will be taken at a depth of 0-15 cm in each season and will be analysed. Fertilizer will be incorporated based on treatments two weeks before sowing. Weeds will be controlled through manual hoeing and subsequently by hand pulling as the fluted pumpkins vines spread and covered the plots to thus suppress weed growth. Harvesting of total herbage yield will be carried out once when the crops will be 15weeks after germination.<br/>FIELD PREPARATION AND TREATMENTS:<br/>The conventional tillage operations which include land clearing and preparation of beds will be carried out to conserve the soil and its nutrients. The land will be cleared and beds will be constructed. The experimental land will be divided into three blocks each containing 10 beds to give a total of 30 beds. Each bed size will be 4.0m x 1.2m and with about 1m gap between beds. The blocks will be spaced 1m apart to ease movement during cultural operations. A bed contained 10plants.<br/>The treatments involved nine organic fertilizer types namely; Alesinloye grade A, Alesinloye grade B, Sunshine grade A, Sunshine grade B, Pace setter grade A, Pace setter grade B, Neem compost , Tithonia compost and Poultry manure, with fluted pumpkin as the test crop. The organic fertilizer types will be applied at the equivalent weight of 60 kg. N ha-1 with non-fertilized plot as a control. The treatments will be assigned into the plots in a randomized complete block design with three replicates.<br/>DATA COLLECTION:<br/>At 10 WAS four plants will be randomly selected from each plot for data collection. Data collected at the early bloom stage (10 WAS) included length of primary vine, number of leaves and fresh shoot yield. At pod maturity, the pod yield and the yield components collected included number of pods per plant, fruit weight (kg) per plant; number of seeds per pod, seeds yield (kg) per pod; seeds yield (kg) per plant and total seeds yield (ton) per hectare. For the determination of plant shoot dry matter yield and tissue nutrient concentration, another three plants per plot will be uprooted at 10 WAS and oven dried to constant weight at 650C for 48 hours.<br/> DATA ANALYSIS<br/>The dried samples will be weighed for estimation of dry matter yield and milled and analyzed for nitrogen (N), using kjedahl digesting method, phosphorus (P) using technicon AA1, calcium (Ca) using flame photometer and magnesium (Mg) by the use of atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Iron (Fe) will be also determined by AOAC method. Data collected will be subjected to analysis of variance using the SAS-GLM procedure.

Two plant products, Myristica fragans and Aframomum melegueta obtained from the local market were pulverized and dissolved in Alcohol and water at concentrations of 1g/l, 1.5g/l, 2g/l, 2.5g/l, 3g/l, 3.5g/l and 4g/l. Chunks of Clarias gariepinus (1cm Thick) were soaked in above solution for 24hours. These were smoke-dried and allowed to condition in the laboratory for two days before introducing the insect pest, Dermestes Maculatus. The insects were repelled by the treated fish for about 3days before they could bore into it and establish. Dry powder treatment was administered between 1g-4g/10g fish. Myristica fragans instantly repelled insects while Aframomum Melegenta did not. Myristica fragans powder at all levels of treatment caused significantly (P&lt;0.05, ANOVA) higher mortalities than in control experiment. Myristica fragans dissolved in water (H2O) did not produce significant (P&gt;0.05, ANOVA) mortality at all concentrations. M. fragans in Alcohol treatment produced significantly higher mortalities over Nutmeg (M. fragans) in water treatments. Alcohol extract of Nutmeg at 3.5g/l produced significantly (P&lt;0.05 ANOVA) higher mortalities over all other concentrations. Treatment using Aligator pepper (Aframomum melegueta) in water at 2g/l gave significantly higher mortalities (P&lt;0.05, ANOVA) between Nutmeg in Alcohol at 3g/l, Alcohol and Aligator treatment at 3.5g/l, Water and Aligator pepper at 2g/l. In powder treatments the highest mortalities were found in the highest doses 3.5g/10g fish when compared with doses of Aligator pepper (Aframomum Melegueta) were there were  mortalities.       <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    Introduction----------------<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0    Literature review-------------<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0    Material and methods-----------------<br/>3.1    Study area description-----------------<br/>3.2  Experimental plan----------------------<br/>3.3    Handling of plant products.--------------------<br/>3.4    Purchase and maintance of insect culture --------<br/>3.5    Preparation of fresh unifested fish sample--------<br/>3.6    Treatment of uninfested fish-------------------<br/>3.7    Analysis of result -----------------<br/>               CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.1    Result-------------------------------------<br/>4.1    Experimental findings---------------<br/>4.2    Filling up ANOVA table -----------------<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>5.0    Discussion--------------------------------<br/>5.1  Conclusion &amp; recommendation-----------                           <br/>       Reference-----------------------------------<br/>        Appendix----------------------------<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>Fish protein is known to be the best and cheapest source of animal protein (Olayide 1973). The loss of protein in dried fish due to the fish pest, D. Macuatus has been variously studied. Fish is a perishable commodity especially in the tropics where high temperature and humidity accelerate spoilage and Biodeterioration of fish immediately after catch. As a result of this, efforts are primarily directed towards the preservation of fish for human food. However, poor handling, inadequate processing facilities, lack of ice or storage facilities, remoteness of the fishing villages to urban market centers and poor distribution channels have drastically reduced fish utilization in the tropics (Ames,1992). Efforts at the use of synthetic insecticides and other methods to control D. Maculatus have not presented pleasant results. This has led to a search for alternative source of user friendly methods especially the use of botanicals to control D. Maculatus (Okorie et al 1991).<br/>   The use of chemical pesticides has helped to increase the yields obtained but one of the major problems with the constant use of chemicals is that resistance can be induced in target organisms. Biological method of control has been preferred in some cases because it is selective with no side effect and cheap. Resistance to biological control is rare and biological control agents are self propagating and self perpetuating (Okigbo and Ikediugwu 2000; Okigbo, 2003----2005).<br/>   Plant extracts have been used successfully to control insect pests in the tropics. (Amadioha and Obi, 1999; Onitade 2000. Emoghene, 2004). The practice of applying synthetic insecticides has been found to be potentially dangerous when such fish is consumed. In some villages in Ghana where fish have been treated in this manner, people who consumed them, suffered blurred vision, dizziness and vomiting (Bull 1982).<br/>   Losses due to this pest of products of animal origin have been properly documented for a very long time (Aret, 1964, Willams 1956, Proctor, 1970, Kimura and Takakura).<br/>   Dry fish is however susceptible to pest infestation. Osuji (1973) noted that D. Maculatus is the major pest of dry fish with occasional presence of others like Necrobia rufipes, Tribolium, Castenum and Trogoderma, granamium. The two are pests of other products. The importance of D. Maculatus in Nigeria has been highlighted (Hayward 1961). Researches have extended to the use of extracts of water and alcohol extracts of such botanicals as P. guineese, Xylopia aethiopica, Myristica fragrans etc.<br/>   All these have proved effective but methods of extraction have proved to be very expensive and not even within the reach of the common market woman hawking her dry fish in the market. The crude powder, though effective in most cases are cumbersome in application and may even negate the rates of application and affect the appearance of dried fish.<br/>   This study is seeking the best and most effective way of applying these botanicals to the fish so that it will appear like ordinary dry fish edible and resistant to infestation of D. maculates and possibly other pest.<br/>   Water and alcohol are edible solvents that could be used to infuse the active ingredients in plant  extracts for the control of insect pests of smoke-dried fish.<br/>  The simple methods engaged could be steaming, boiling and soaking fish in such media in which different doses of the botanicals are tested. The botanicals to be used are alligator pepper; (A. Melegueta) and nutmeg M. fragans.<br/>   Our target is to find out the following;<br/>To investigate Whether the active ingredients of M. fragrans and A. Melegueta can be infused into the fish through water and absolute alcohol extracts and used to control insect pest (Dermestes maculatus) of smoke-drised fish.<br/>To compare the result obtained (mortality rate) with documented result of crude powder treatment which were found to be effective in controlling the insect pest.<br/>To find out if fish treated with solutions of these botanicals at different concentration will still be palatable and aesthetically attractive<br/>To compare the effective needs of the botanicals used.<br/>To profer recommendations based on my findings.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE COMPARATIVE EFFECT OF MYRISTICA FRAGANS (NUTMEG) AND AFRAMOMUM MELEGUETA (ALLIGATOR PEPPER) ON DEMESTES MACULATUS DEGEER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE COMPARATIVE EFFECT OF MYRISTICA FRAGANS (NUTMEG) AND AFRAMOMUM MELEGUETA (ALLIGATOR PEPPER) ON DEMESTES MACULATUS DEGEER", "id": 123}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>FEEDS AND FEEDING OF SHEEP  AND GOAT IN UMUNNEOCHI LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Comparisons were made between 24 Ethiopian rams and 24 Galla goats for voluntary intake, feed selectivity and growth performance when offered three levels of sorghum stover. The levels observed were 25,50 and 75 g/kg live weight per day. Measurements of intake, growth and feed selectivity were taken over a period of 10 weeks.<br/>Both sheep and goats consumed more stover (P&lt;0.001) as rate of offer was increased (22, 31, 32 gDM/kg live weight per day; 19,26,29 g/kg live weight per day, respectively, for sheep and goats). Increasing the level of offer beyond 50g/kg live weight per day did not, however, promote a substantial increase in intake. No difference (P&gt;0.05) was observed in the pattern of feed selectivity between sheep and goats. Both species showed a similar preference for leaf and sheath matter as the level of offer was increased.<br/>Sheep gained weight faster (P&lt;0.001) than goats at all rates of offer, (28.0 vs 9.0; 54.0 vs 23.0; 62.0 vs 31.6 in favour of sheep). Those on a higher level of offer showed a faster rate of gain than those on a lower level of offer.<br/>It was concluded that both species can benefit from generous offers and that the benefit, judged by improved intake and growth, is due to selective feeding.<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>Previous studies (Aboud et al, 1992) clearly indicate the value of selective feeding. Sheep were shown to perform better and consume more digestible matter through selective intake of leaf and sheath fractions of sorghum stover as a result of liberal offers. This observation is of practical value for small ruminants in the tropics because the traditional feeding systems depend largely on crop residues. However, there is little evidence in the literature that the approach adopted by Aboud et al (1992) would be as effective for goats as it was for sheep. Results from comparative studies between sheep and goats of selective efficiency are generally conflicting (Huston, 1978; Devendra and Bums, 1983). Goats in the tropics are more able than sheep to consume feed fractions of higher nutritional quality when offered the opportunity to eat selectively (Devendra and Burns, 1983; Hoppe et al, 1977; Huston, 1978). This observation does not agree with studies carried out in temperate countries, where sheep have been shown to perform better than goats under most practical feeding systems. A comparative feeding and performance study on Small East African goats and the Red Maasai sheep in Tanzania (Shoo, 1986) was inconclusive, although sheep appeared to perform better than goats when offered a basal diet of Chlorisgayanahay with Leucaenaas a supplementary forage. However, observations in Shoo's (1986) study did not include an assessment of selective feeding ability between the two species. The inclusion of a supplementary forage may have confounded the results, as it is known that goats would preferentially consume browse species (Lu, 1988). Most of the comparative studies in the tropics were made under grazing conditions, whereas those in the temperate countries involved comparisons under stall-feeding conditions in which feed was offered at restricted levels, usually at 35 g dry matter M(D)/kg live weight per day or to achieve 10-20% rate of refusal. Comparative studies under grazing or in stalls at restricted levels of offer may give misleading results (Demment and Van Soest, 1983). Restricted levels of offer do not usually provide sufficient opportunity for selective feeding (Aboud et al, 1993). This is particularly serious where low-quality crop residues are used in comparisons.<br/>No performance comparison has been made between sheep and goats that have been fed untreated crop residues at levels that would allow selective intake. Alimon (1989) only measured the digestible organic matter (OM) intake of goats offered increasing levels of feed, but did not measure any related growth performance. Aboud et al (1993) showed that certain levels of offer encouraged sheep to eat selectively. By offering goats and sheep the same type of sorghum stover at these levels both species may perform similarly.<br/>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The general objective of the studies was to find better methods of feedingsugar cane and some protein-rich foliage species to get the highest feedintake and the best performance in small ruminants.<br/>The specific objectives were:<br/>• To assess the effect of animal factors such as animal species(sheep and goats) and group size (single and group pens) on feedintake, behaviour and growth rate.<br/>• To test the effect of some feed factors such as<br/>- processing method of sugar cane and Acacia foliage<br/>- Level of feed offered of sugar cane<br/>- Supplementation with concentrate<br/>- Method of presentation of foliage and mixtures of foliages<br/>-Utilization of bamboo charcoal to reduce the antinutritionaleffect of tannins in Acacia foliageon feed intake, behaviour and growth rate.<br/>• To identify the intake potential of sugar cane and three tropicalfoliage species by small ruminants.<br/> <br/><br/>\n\nFEEDS AND FEEDING OF SHEEP  AND GOAT IN UMUNNEOCHI LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FEEDS AND FEEDING OF SHEEP  AND GOAT IN UMUNNEOCHI LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA", "id": 124}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EFFECT OF POULTRY MANURE ON THE GROWTH AND YIELD OF TERFERA <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>A field trial was carried out at the Imopoly Farm to determine the effects of rate of poultry manure on the growth and yield of Watermelon. Six different rates of poultry manure were replicated three times on eighteen beds. The treatments were; control plot, 2 tons/ha, 4 tons/ha, 6 tons/ha, 8 tons/ha, 10 tons/ha. The treatments were arranged in a completely randomized block design. The experiment was carried out between February, 2011 and April 2011.<br/>Data were taken on the growth and yield parameters. Five plants were randomly selected and tagged per plot for data collection. Establishment count; Plant height; Stem girth; Number of leaves per plant and Leaf area, were taken at 5 WAP and at harvest, to assess growth. Number of fruits per plant; Fresh fruit weight per bed, were taken to assess the yield.<br/>The results of this study showed that Watermelon growth is not significantly different at 5 WAP. At harvesting, highest stem girth of 32.40mm was obtained with 4tons/ha while the lowest of 28.50mm was from 6tons/ha. Watermelon yield of 1.69kg was highest from 6tons/ha, while the lowest of 0.87kg was got from 4tons/ha.<br/>The results of the study have shown that Watermelon will still perform fairly well without fertilizers on regular<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>EFFECT OF POULTRY MANURE ON THE GROWTH AND YIELD OF TERFERA.<br/>Watermelon, (Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus) is an important vegetable crop in the tropics, Nigeria inclusive. The fresh Watermelon pod contains approximately 86.1% water, 2.25% protein, 0.2% fats, 9.7% carbohydrate, 1.0% fibre and 0.8% ash (Purseglove, 1984). Watermelon is one of the most common vegetables available all year round in Nigeria due to regular rainfall and irrigation system. The fruit is considerably important in the diet of people around the world, particularly for those in West Africa and other tropical areas whose staple food consists of bulk starchy foods like pounded yam, cassava flour and others. Watermelon is also used to compliment such staple foods since it is a good source of vitamin, minerals, and proteins (Funso and Bassir, 1976). The fruit contains mucilage which gives a slippery texture on cooking which can be served as a thickener. Watermelon fruit contains vitamins A and C with traces of vitamin B. It is a good source of calcium, phosphorus and iron. It contains 2.7 - 3.0% protein and a significant amount of riboflavin. The consumption of these edible parts has been reported by Fatokun (1976) to promote digestion and helps prevent constipation. It is also used as a medicine for the treatment of peptic ulcer. It is also used in the manufacture of margarine. It is used in curries and chutneys and as a substitute for coffee in India. Watermelon seed cake is rich in protein and makes an invaluable animal feed. In various parts of the world, it is known as Watermelon, Ochro, Okoro, Quimgombo, Quingumbo, Ladies Fingers, Gombo, Kopi Arab, Kacang Bendi, Bhindi (S. Asia), Bendi (Malaysia), Bamia, Bamya or Bamieh (middle east) or Gumbo (Southern USA).<br/>Watermelon is a fruit vegetable, grown mainly for the pods. The tender fruits are used as vegetables<br/>either boiled or sliced and fried. Ripe seeds contain about 20% of edible oil. It is quite susceptible to frost and will not thrive where there is a continuous dry spell. It grows in all types of soils, thriving well in moist, friable, well drained and well matured soils (Tindal, 1983).<br/>The mucilage is extracted and used in gum production. Medicinal use of Watermelon is the role of the pod mucilage in plasma replacement or as blood volume expander. The immature fruits are used in the treatment of venerable diseases (Olajide, 1995).<br/>Nitrogen is an important and commonly deficient nutrient element in tropical soils and it is generally needed in large amount by plants. It is an integral part of the chlorophyll (Epstein, 1972). Nitrogen is a key element required for plant growth and the symptoms of soil nitrogen deficiency range from leaf chlorosis to stunted growth and eventually poor yield. Different opinions have been expressed with regards to Watermelon fertilization using organic manures like poultry droppings, cowdung. For instance, Schippers (2000) recommended poultry manure to be applied at the rate of 20tonnes /ha before sowing. This is consistent with Kogbe's (1976) recommendation of 20tonnes /ha. Among all the organic manures, poultry manure is the easiest to access in South Western Nigeria.<br/>Poultry manure has been found to produce higher seed yield in maize than cattle manure. This was attributed to the higher content of nitrogen and phosphorus in poultry manure coupled with the fact that it furnishes the soil with more magnesium and trace elements (Purseglove, 1984).<br/> 1.2 Problem statement<br/>Emphasis is now placed on use of organic manures instead of inorganic sources of nutrients because of the need to take pure foods devoid of chemical elements that are easily absorbed from inorganic sources of nutrients. Using inorganic fertilizers in lowland areas may also increase dangers of underground water pollution. Farmers cannot afford to use mineral fertilizers to boost their vegetable yields. Using these chemicals, especially on Watermelon or tomatoes that are consumed fresh may increase the dangers of ingesting these chemicals that are absorbed and partitioned to fruit or to economic yield of such crops (Williams and Harris 1986).<br/>Information on the effects of these organic sources particularly, poultry dropping on Watermelon fruit yield and utilization of the nutrients absorbed is still not too abundant in literature. Therefore, the need to assess poultry manure effect on the yield of Watermelon.<br/>1.3 Nutritional Benefits of Watermelon Composition per 100 g of edible portion in Watermelon<br/>Moisture    89.6 g    Minerals    0.7 g<br/>Protein    1.9 g    Carbohydrates    6.4<br/>Fat    0.2 g    Calcium    66 m<br/>Fibre    1.2 g    Iron    0.35 mg<br/>Calories    35    Potassium    103 mg<br/>Phosphorus    56 mg    Thiamine    0.07 mg<br/>Sodium    6.9 mg    Nictonic acid    0.6 mg<br/>Sulphur    30 mg    Vitamin C    13 mg<br/>Riboflavin    0.1 mg    Magnesium    53 mg<br/>Oxalic acid    8 mg    Copper    0.19 mg<br/>  1.4 Objective of the Study<br/>The objective of the study therefore was to evaluate the effects of rate of poultry manure application on the growth and yield of Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus)<br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nEFFECT OF POULTRY MANURE ON THE GROWTH AND YIELD OF TERFERA <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF POULTRY MANURE ON THE GROWTH AND YIELD OF TERFERA ", "id": 125}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>BROILER PRODUCTION AND VALUE IN IMO STATE <br/>A CASE STUDY OF EZINITTLE MBAISE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The cost and return analysis of different sizes of integrated broiler farms in Oru East in Imo State has been carried out based on the primary data collected from 150 broiler farmers for the period Mar 2011 to Feb 2012.

Broiler industry can be adopted under a wide range of climatic conditions and can generally be combined conveniently with other farm enterprises. The land and capital requirements for this enterprise being not large, it ensures a regular flow of income through the marketing of poultry products. In spite of a spectacular growth in the poultry sector during the past two decades, a huge gap exists between availability and requirement of poultry products. An increase in per capita consumption by one egg and 50 grams of poultry meat can create employment for about 26,000 persons per year (Kazi, 2003). The present per capita availability of poultry meat is 1.8 kg against the requirement of 11 kg, as per the National Committee on Human Nutrition in India. Therefore, to meet the domestic requirement, there is a need of about six- time increase in meat production. Increase in population growth, changing life-style, shifting of food habits, rapid urbanization, increased per capita income, awareness about health care, etc. are contributing towards rising demand of poultry products. Thus, the growth potential of this sector is bright due to regular flow of income throughout the year in the rural economy of the Imo Statestate. In India, the production of broilers increased from 1.89 lakh tones in 1989-90 to 23.13 lakh tones in 2009-10, at a compound annual growth rate of 13.21 per cent. In broiler production, India stands 5th in the world with 2.31 million tones of broiler meat, contributing Rs 9000 crore to the national economy.<br/>Poultry farming assumes special significance in the state of Imo State due to integration of Poultry sector, conducive weather condition and available land area. The productivity and production of food grains, particularly of cereals in Imo State have already reached a point of saturation with little scope to increase, resulting in looking for subsidiary occupations like poultry farming. At the same time, due to limited scope of further addition to the net area sown and huge indebtedness, diversification of agriculture through allied activities like poultry farming has acquired added significance for solving the agrarian crisis of the state.

It adopted the secondary data sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria covering the period 1985 to 2010. The study employed the modern Time Series of the Ordinary Least Square to test for the relationship between agriculture and economic growth in Nigeria. The results derived infer that there exists a significant relationship between agriculture spending and economic growth. What this implies is that agriculture revolution is a determinant to economic growth. Thus, it is important that the government placed greater emphases on this sector by increasing budgetary allocation to agriculture in Nigeria in other meet the recommendations of both Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and African Union (AU). It is recommended that  more funding be provided  for agricultural universities in the country to carry out more research on all aspect of agricultural output, such as livestock, crops, fishing and forestry, crop preservation and also establishment of more research institutes to improve seedling production, encourage the use of irrigation farming system and provision of storage facilities for seasonal products as means of improving the country’s agricultural output. <br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1 Background to the Study<br/>The term Agriculture is derived from the Latin words, “ager,” meaning field, and “Cultura”, meaning cultivation. This suggests that the earliest form of production agriculture was crop production (Are, Igbokwe, Asadu, Bawa, 2010; Erebor, 2003). It may be noted that Agriculture is more than crop production. It also includes animal production, processing of primary products (or value addition) and marketing of produce and products. Erebor (2003) defines agriculture as the art and science of cultivating the soil, processing crops and livestock products for man, and the process of selling excess crop and livestock. Meanwhile, (Kricher,1997) defines agriculture in a more advanced way by saying that, agriculture or farming is the simplification of nature’s  food webs and the rechanneling of energy for human planting and animal consumption. To simplify, agriculture involves redirecting nature’s natural flow of the food web. The natural flow of the food web is the sun provides light to plants convert sunlight into sugars which provide food for the plants (this process is called photosynthesis). Plants provide food for herbivores (plant-eating animals) and the herbivores provides food for carnivores (meat-eating animals).  This simple illustration of food web provides the basis for analyzing the impact of agriculture on economic growth. In literature, economic history provides us with ample evidence that agricultural revolution is a fundamental pre-condition for economic growth, especially in developing countries. Development economists have focused on how agriculture can best contribute to overall economic growth and modernization. Todaro and Smith (2003) look at Lewis theory of development, and reported that the underdeveloped economy consisted of two sectors. These sectors are the traditional agricultural sector characterized by zero marginal labour productivity and the modern industrial sector. In Rostow’s linear stages of economic growth, agricultural revolutions is a pre-condition for take-off and take-off stages The importance of a vibrant and robust agriculture is reminiscent on its role in providing employment opportunities for the teeming population, eradicates poverty and contributing to the growth of the economy. The linkage between agriculture and economic growth is well documented in literature (Ogen, 2007; Okongwu, 1986; Atte and Muhammed- Lawal, 2006 to maintain few). According to Izuchukwu (2011), agriculture has been the backbone of the economy in Nigeria providing employment and source of livelihood for the increasing population,it accounts for over half of the GDP of the Nigerian economy as at independence in 1960.  However, the role it plays in the regional and economic development of the country has diminished over the years due to the dominant role of the crude oil sector in the economy. With the increasing food demand in Nigeria, the country has available natural resources and potential for increasing the volume of crop production towards meeting the food and nutritional requirement of the rapidly increasing population and guarantee food security in the country. Therefore, the source of national wealth is essentially agriculture. Unquestionably, the neglect of agriculture in Nigeria owing to the discovery of oil has retarded the growth of the economy for the past decades.  The effect of this neglect could be felt in the poor quality of life of people as  average Nigerian was quoted as living in US$ 1 per day; if translated to Naira, this amount to N165 day at present. It may not be wrong to say that such a remark is a political cover. The faces we see daily on our streets and those we may not be able to see because of their inability to muster enough strength to walk up to the street as a result of several days of hunger and starvation, or even food associated ill-health and avoidable deaths of tens of people everyday, a better, more sincere and realistic assessment of the situation would be put an average income at US $0-0.5 per day. Studies in literature reveal that seven out of every 10 Nigerians live in abject poverty; hardly able to feed, cloth or house themselves. It is an indisputable fact that Nigeria and her sub-Saharan African neighbors have been dubiously christened by the world political and economic powers as citadels of hunger, poverty, ignorance, diseases, misery, debts, filths and crises. This unquestionable imagery will for long remain indelible in the world's archives unless a reasonable step is taken by people and Government of this doomed sector of the global village. It is against this backdrop that the study seeks to assess the impact of agriculture on economic growth.<br/>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Besides oil, the major strength of the Nigerian economy is its rich agricultural resource base, its human resource and its huge markets. However, these resources have to be effectively mobilized so as to diversify the economic base and reduce dependence on oil and import. The economy remains vulnerable to external shocks emanating from fluctuation in the world prices of crude oil and the rising prices of imports. The resulting external and internal in balances are manifested in the adverse balance of payment position, unemployment and low capacity utilization in virtually all sectors as well as the deteriorating purchasing power of the populace (Atte and Muhammed- Lawal, 2006). The contribution of agriculture to the Nigerian economic growth is very low compared to what it used to be in the past 14 years. Nigerian agriculture to a large extent still possesses the characteristics of a peasant economy that was prominent in the pre-independence period. Given the information above, this study seeks to assess the impact of agriculture on economic growth in Nigeria.<br/>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The main objective of this study is to analyze the impact of agriculture on economic growth in Nigeria. But for the successful completion of the study, the researcher intends to achieve the following sub-objectives;<br/>To analyze the impact of agriculture on economic growth in Nigeria.<br/>To evaluate the contribution of the agricultural sector on economic development<br/>To evaluate the relationship between agricultural sector and economic development<br/>To proffer solution to the identified problems<br/>1.4 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES<br/>For the successful completion of the study the following research hypotheses were formulated by the researcher<br/>H0: agriculture has no significant impact on the economic growth of Nigeria<br/>H1:agriculture has a significant impact on the economic growth of Nigeria.<br/>H0:Agricultural sector does not have any significant contribution to the economic development of Nigeria.<br/>H2:agricultural sector does have a significant contribution to the economic development of Nigeria<br/>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>It is believed that at the completion of the study, the findings will be of great importance to the federal ministry of agriculture, as the study seeks to evaluate the contribution of the agricultural sector to economic growth in Nigeria. The study will also be of great importance to all agriculturist  asthe study will guide them to take advantage of the tremendous opportunity that is available in the agricultural sector and contribute their own quota to economic growth and development. The study will also be useful to researchers who intend to embark on research in similar topic,Finally the findings of this study will also be immense benefit to government, academia, scholars, researchers and the general public.<br/>1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>The scope of the study covers the analysis of the impact of agriculture on economic growth in Nigeria. But in the cause of the study, there are some factors which militate against the scope of the study<br/>a)     AVAILABILITY OF RESEARCH MATERIAL: The research material      available to the researcher is insufficient, thereby limiting the study.<br/>b)     TIME: The time frame allocated to the study does not enhance wider         coverage as the researcher has to combine other academic activities        and examinations with the study.<br/>c)     FINANCE: The finance available for the research work does not     allow for wider coverage as resources are very limited as the        researcher has other academic bills to cover<br/>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Agriculture <br/>Agriculture or farming is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life.<br/>Economic growth<br/>Economic growth is the increase in the inflation-adjusted market value of the goods and services produced by an economy over time. It is conventionally measured as the percent rate of increase in real gross domestic product, or real GDP, usually in per capita terms<br/>Economic development <br/>From a policy perspective, economic developmentcan be defined as efforts that seek to improve theeconomic well-being and quality of life for a community by creating and/or retaining jobs and supporting or growing incomes and the tax base<br/>Government sector<br/>The general government sector includes all institutional units whose output is intended for individual and collective consumption and mainly financed by compulsory payments made by units belonging to other sectors, and/or allinstitutional units principally engaged in the redistribution of national income and wealth<br/>1.8ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDY<br/>        This research work is organized in five chapters, for easy understanding, as follows.

The study make use of primary method of data collection, the analysis of data collected was done through the use of simple percentage. The result revealed that agricultural productivity is faced with some problems such as lack of money to expand farm, to buy modern implements and to acquire/rent land, also lack of collateral to obtain loan from the bank and land ownership problem in the study area. Based on findings it is recommended that there is a great need for government to give the populace the right to own land for agriculture. Also government must formulate and implement agricultural policies aimed at improving or increasing agricultural productivity and to give subsides to farmers and also supply modern implements and chemical to improve and increase agricultural productivity. The findings also revealed that government should provide financial incentives to commercial farmers to increase their productivity.        <br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>        Agriculture is the systematic raising of useful plants and livestock under the management of man (Rimando, 2004). Broadly agriculture include cultivation of the soil, growth and man feed for animals and raw materials for industries. The role of agriculture in changing both the social and economic structure of an economy cannot be over emphasized.<br/>Agriculture is also a sources of employment opportunities, income distribution, foreign exchange of commodity and income. It has been the main sources of employment with about 8% of population include in it and a reliable source of government revenue (Anywill, 2002).<br/>Adeleke (1981) opined that agriculture is by far the most widely spread form of human activity and it is more basic than any industry and that agriculture is one more than three (3) quarter of human race, it yield fibers and raw materials for the industry on which a large proportion of people depend on.<br/>Crops have been raised since earliest time in civilization and they are still being grown. The soil, if carefully maintained is full of resources that is renewable and can even be improved. In other words, diminishing return may set in as regards soil fertility, artificial fertilizers can be introduced to improve yield.<br/>Agriculture can now be regarded as a primary industry which deals with the cultivation of soil and raising of food and animals for ma’s use. The uses are  numerous in the socio-economic development of any nation or country. Some analysts argued that for a nation to progress or move forward, the development of agricultural sector  before industrial sector will be most reasonable and increase in development (Essang and Olyide 1974).<br/>Agriculture has continued to play an important role in Nigeria economy over a long period of time. Before the oil boom, agriculture accounted for more than half (½) of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employed about 75 percent (75%) of adult working population (Olayiwola, 1989). As a result of the oil boom era of the 1970s and early 1980s, agriculture suffer a serious decline because attention of Nigerians was shifted from agriculture to petroleum since 1970 has done more harm than good to agricultural sector in Nigeria. <br/>The aftermath of the reduction in agricultural production discourage farmers from further production since there is insufficient capital to shoulder the cost mechanized farming due to the low level of demand for their product which eventually leads to increase in the level of poverty among farmers.<br/>Agricultural research as a vital component of integrated strategies for poverty reduction has a crucial role of productivity, changing from mono-economic to diversify economic system, unemployment, fluctuation in the price of agricultural products, fueling economic growth which serve as pre-condition for economic development.<br/>It is against this background that this research work is focusing on how poverty is affecting agricultural productivity and how agricultural product can reduce the level of poverty. Rural poverty appear to be endemic in sub-sahara African (SSA) and Nigeria particularly disheartening is the fact that this problem is interactable in certain area in Nigeria despite the measure to abate the problem.<br/>One of the serious effect of rural poverty is food and nutrition insecurity and its attendant socio-economic and political costs. A food of adequate quality and quantity to support a healthy and active life for all members of the household (HeidhuseEtali, 2004).<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>        Despite the contribution of agriculture to socio-economic development of Nigeria, farmers still suffer socio-economic and policy biases. The back of agricultural productivity in Nigeria takes place in the rural areas and majorly the level and incident of poverty is very pronounced.<br/>        Agriculture has a strong hold in an economy for without it, a country will always depend on foreign countries to feed its population. The potential contribution of agriculture to economic growth has been ongoing subject of controversy among development economist. Several author argued that growth in the over all economy depends on the development of agricultural sector (Scholts, 2004, Gollin parent and Rogerson 2002). The growth in agricultural sector could be a catalyst for national output growth through its effect on rural income and provision of resources for transformation into an industrialized economy (Eicher and Stact 1992).<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>        The main objective of this study is to examine how poverty is affecting agricultural productivity whilethe specific objectives are:<br/>To examine the extent at which the level of poverty affect agricultural productivity.<br/>To identify the impact of increasing in productivities in relation to the standard of living of the people.<br/>To examine the effect of government policy on agricultural production.<br/>To examine the impact of land ownership on agricultural production.<br/> 1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>What has been the impact of poverty on agricultural productivity.<br/>Does the level of agricultural productivity reflect in living standard of people?<br/>Does government intervention improve agricultural practices?<br/>Did the system of land ownership affect agricultural production?<br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY   <br/>        This study will educate the farmers on how to solve the problems of low utilization of farm lands, small farm size, low productivity and rural poverty.<br/>        Also it will enlightened the farmers to identify the types of agricultural practice, in a nutshell, the farmers and government would be able to examine the roles of agriculture in socio-economic development of the country.<br/>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>        This research work covers Oyo West Local government area of Oyo state. It evaluates how poverty is affecting agricultural productivity in Oyo west local Government area of Oyo.   <br/><br/><br/>\n\nPOVERTY AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY IN OYO WEST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF OYO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " POVERTY AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY IN OYO WEST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF OYO STATE", "id": 129}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECT OF BUSH BURNING ON AGRICULTURAL LAND IN OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The burning of natural vegetation no doubt removes the protective cover of the soil surface and depreciates the quality of the soil.

In general and in Ekiadolor in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State in particular bush burning generally is the method of  removing the natural vegetable from the surface of the soil by setting fire on debris. Bush burning causes serious damage to trees and crops, its effect of public concern which should not be for farmer alone and should be handled with seriousness, practice of burning of fire could also lead to accidental burning of his land and other properties at his disposal, this ideals of burning his farm came to him with the food that fire has left behind after roasting his food, fire spread and destroyed all that was left behind in the environment. <br/>Burning the farmland for the cultivation of crops has a remarkable effect on the soil fertility. During burning process some nutrients that are highly needed by the plants are lost out in form of gasses such nutrient include phosphorous, nitrogen and sulphur. The ash which is the principle products of burnt material although rich in phosphorous, nitrogen and potassium can be easily washed away by rain. The heat produced during burning creates an unfavourable condition for activities of the soil organism such as earthworms, bacteria etc.       <br/>He also found out the seed of fruits he has eaten and thrown off has grown in his burnt land and as a result of this included burning in his farm system. The practice of burning can be traced back of about 2000 years ago, it was discovered that most of the vegetation debris after clearing, especially on a large scale farming and small scale farms. Apart from burning the land for cultivation purpose animals are also trapped.  <br/>1.2    PURPOSE OF STUDY <br/>Bush burning has become part and parcel of the activities of farmers in this area. The negative effects are not considered at all. Hence it is important to highlight these for the farmers to experience and observe the dangerous effects of bush burning as it affect the soil as a whole.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>Since bush burning is the major lands preparation practice, it is important to study the effect of bush burning on agricultural lands and also to carryout investigation on how far bush burning has affected agricultural land in Ekiadolor in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State and possibly find alternative measure to avoid bush burning.    <br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>The scope of this project is limited to Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State, some important towns and villages in Ovia North East Local Government Area such as Ekiadolor Town, Evboneka, Ughoton etc where farming operation is carried extensively and that burning issues form the scope of my study.

Results obtained from the interview shows that credit disburse to the farmers constitute serious administrative problem which is hindering the effectiveness of the scheme. The loans applied for and the amount approved and disbursed to the farmers are not enough to move, so there are no through supervision on the part of the official of the co-operative and the ministry of agriculture. Recommendation we made on how to solve these problems in the existing farmer’s co-operative societies.  It was revealed that most of the respondents (80%) have made use of loan from one co-operative society or the other and also the access to loan and farming equipments has not been encouraging. To this effects some of the recommendation made was;(1) There should be a roaster or writing policy on the acquisition of loan and farming equipment so as the foster the accessibility to loan by the members.(2) There should be no bias in giving out of loans to members. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/> CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION <br/>Background of Study<br/>Statement of the Problem<br/>Objective of the Study<br/>Significance of the Study<br/>Scope of the Study<br/>Limitation of the Study<br/>Definition of terms <br/>CHAPTER TWO    <br/>Literature Review<br/>CHAPTER THREE        <br/>Methodology<br/>Design of the study<br/>Population Sampling<br/>Sampling Techniques<br/>Method of Data Collection    <br/>Method of Data Analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR   <br/>Presentation and Analysis of Data<br/>Data Presentation<br/>Data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FIVE     <br/>Summary<br/>Conclusion<br/>Recommendation<br/>REFERENCE          <br/>QUESTIONNAIRES     <br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>        In developing countries as in the case of Nigeria, Agriculture dominates the nation’s economy. It has been established that about to percent of Nigeria population is engaged in agriculture (Obasi and Aug, 2000) while 90 percent of Nigeria total food production comes from small farms and to percent of the country population earn their living from these small farms (Oluwatayo et al, 2008). The recent importation of food items into the country to make up for the short falls in food supply Is a dangerous indication of warning farm productivity and warning sign that if the nation continue with the business as usual, the prospect of food security will be black for million of people (Nwede 2003)<br/>        It terms employment agriculture is by far the most importance sector of Nigeria’s economy engaging about 70% of the labour force. Agricultural holding are generally small and scattered, family is often of the subsistence variety characterized by simple tools and shifting cultivation. These small farms produce about 80% of the total foods. About 30.7 million hectares (76 million acres) or 33% of Nigeria land area are under cultivation. Nigeria’s diverse climate from the tropical area of the coast the arid zone of the North, make it possible to produce virtually all agricultural products that can grown in the tropical and semitropical area of the world the economic benefit of large scale agriculture are recognized, and the government favors the formation of cooperative societies and settlements to encourage industrial agricultural. Large scale agriculture, however, is not common.<br/>        Despite an abundant water supply a favorable climate and wide area or arable land, productivity is restricted owing to low soil fertility in many areas and inefficient method of cultivation agriculture. Contributed 32% to GPD in 2001<br/>It’s widely recognized that co-operative form an indispensable component. Through community organization co-operative serves the basis and plant form for bring together the economically weak member of the society with a view of enhancing their individual capacities (Akali, 1991). The contributions of cooperative to the economy especially in the developing countries are enormous, ranging from provision of credit to its members and sourcing of inputs at reasonable price to scale of member produce (Okonkwuo, 1991). Cooperative are defined as “an autonomous association of persons who unite voluntarily to meet their common economic and social needs and aspiration through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. (ICA, 1995) cooperative are established by like-minded persons to pursue mutually beneficial economic interest. Researcher are of the opinion that under normal circumstance, cooperative play significant role in the provision of service that enhance agricultural development.<br/>Patrick, (1995) described cooperative as a medium, through which services like provision of farm input, farm implements, farm mechanization agricultural. Loans agricultural extension member education, marketing of member farm produce and other economic activities and services rendered to members regular and optimal performance of these roles will accelerate the transformation of agriculture and rural economic development. Ijere (1981) further explained that. It is the cooperative that embraces all types of farmers and a well organized and supportive cooperative is a pillar of strength for agriculture in Nigeria.  <br/>Ogunbameru (1986) also estimated that 52% of Nigerians population is women and that 70% of such women live in rural area. It is also on record (Adebayo and Amao, 2003) that 53% of the poor in Nigeria are women. In the rural areas a large number of women are illiterate, very poor, have high rate of infection and are economically oppressed (Essien, 2000) observed that only small fraction of woman in Nigeria had the benefit of higher education and that the majority is engaged in petty trading and peasantry farming. Despite the low educational and poor economic background of Nigeria women they are still responsible for more than half of the nations food basket and contribute more than two third of the working hours on the farm (Barret et al, 2001). They also reported that AFRICAN Women are responsible for 66% of micro processing activities, especially the processing of agricultural produce.<br/>In Nigeria, agricultural production is dominated by small-scale farmers most whom live in rural areas. Crops and animals are produced on scattered farm holding. Most of the farmers operate without modern production input. Their marketing system is unorganized with each farmer acting individually to produce farm inputs and to sell farm produce. Cooperative societies enable people to achieve through joint efforts what they are unable to achieve while working as individuals. They are legally established organization on the basis of specific set of principles cooperatives activities is one of the best method by which peasant farmer can take part in their own economic advancement and gain valuable experience of democratic produce and business management. Akinwumi (1978). They are association of persons who have voluntarily come together to achieve common objective through the formation of a democratically controlled organization, making equitable contributions to the capital required and accepting fair share of the risk and benefit of the undertaking (World Bank, 1999, Ebonyi and Jimo, 2002).<br/>1.2      STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS  <br/>        Cooperative has been regarded as one of the main institutional machineries for empowering the economically weak member of the society. With this official recognition and the determination of government (at all levels) to transform agricultural production and raise the standard of living in the rural areas many agricultural cooperative societies have been formed all over the country. Despite the efforts or contribution made by the cooperative societies towards agricultural development in Nigeria, this effort has not been evenly known and it was in an attempt to address such problem that this study was designed.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>1.     Determine farmer’s extent of participation in cooperative societies.<br/>2.     Determine the benefits derived by respondents by being member of various cooperative societies.<br/>3.     Determine major problems militating against the participation of farmer in cooperative activities.<br/>4.     Make policy recommendation based on the funding<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY  <br/>        This study is embarking upon to determine the impact of cooperative societies on agricultural production in Uhunmwonde Local Government Area of Edo State knowing the contribution of the impact of cooperative societies will encourage farmers and enlightened on the important of this society.

It is the third most important source of calories in the tropics after cereal crops (FAO, 2008). World production of cassava is estimated at 242 million tonnes, of which 54% (130 million tonnes) is produced in Africa. West Africa alone contributes about 68 million tonnes, equivalent to 52% of production. Ghana is the third African producer, after Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo with a yearly production of approximately 10 million tonnes representing 8% of total cassava production on the continent (FAO Food Outlook, 2009).<br/>In Africa, cassava production has more than quadrupled since 1961 from 33 million to 122 million tonnes in 2006 (IFAD, 2010). In countries like Nigeria and Ghana, wide adoption of high yielding varieties and better pest management has resulted in a sharp rise in production. Cassava is a perishable crop and a bulky product, which makes it costly to transport without initial processing. According to FAO (2011) between 35% and 40% of cassava produced in Ghana are lost through postharvest losses accounting for between 3.5 million tonnes to 4 million tonnes annually. This account for between 875 tonnes to one million tons of cassava chips worth about $200 million annually. In Nigeria, cassava is primarily produced for its roots which are a major and cheap source of carbohydrate in human diet, containing 20% amylose and 70% amylopectin, an important source of energy with a calorific value of 250 kcal/ha/day and is regarded as poor man’s food, a more appropriate food crop for the tropical world (RMRDC, 2004). In recent times, cassava has gained attention as a potential industrial crop. The tubers constitute an important component of livestock feed production in various parts of the world. The tubers are processed into cassava flour for bakery and confectioneries. Again, the high carbohydrate content and other qualities such as amylose and amylopectin ratio predispose cassava tubers for various industrial uses such as starch production, modified starch, ethanol, monosodium glutamate (MSG), glucose syrup, fructose syrup, sorbitol, sago, citric acid, adhesives, microbial enzymes, sweeteners among others. Rising oil prices coupled with the need to address concerns about emission from transportation fuels and the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol on carbon emission has led to the promulgation of a mandatory blending of biofuels (ethanol) with fossil fuels in Europe by 2020, which will require cassava chips as the alternative raw material feedstock (UNCTAD, 2009).<br/>According to FAO Food outlook (2009) cassava chips production will become a major emerging market opportunity for bio fuels. One huge challenge to cassava production and processing is its high moisture content of about 65% making it extremely perishable. According to IITA (1990), once tubers are harvested, they begin to deteriorate within 40-48 hours due to some physiological changes and decay by rot organisms.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>        This research is designed to address itself on the method of handling cassava processing in some selected villages in Edo State.<br/>the effect of modern method of handling cassava processing<br/>problems involved in the method of handling cassava<br/>It is intended to bring out the factors militating against the method of handling cassava processing.<br/>1.3    RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>1.     Does the traditional method affect the handling of cassava processing?<br/>2.     Does raining season affect cassava processing?<br/>3.     Does dry season affects the processing of cassava?<br/>4.     Does shortage of water affects cassava processing?<br/>1.4    HYPOTHESIS <br/>1.     There is no significant difference between shortage of water and cassava processing.<br/>2.     There is no significant difference between the traditional methods of cassava processing.<br/>1.5    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The purpose of this study is to identify the method of handling cassava processing in Esan South East Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>To know the areas needed to improve on in the method<br/>To enhance production of cassava in the locality.<br/>To make any useful recommendations for improvement of cassava processing.  <br/>1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>        It is hoped that the findings from this study would help us to:<br/>Come up with a better method of processing cassava without odours and proper handling and disposing effluent.<br/>To know the main economic importance of cassava processing especially in the ways of generating income<br/>To check the quality and consumption rate of the finished products.<br/>To compare and contrast of the two types of cassava e.g. the bitter and sweet cassava.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE METHOD OF HANDLING CASSAVA PROCESSING IN SELECTED VILLAGES IN EDO STATE: A CASE STUDY OF ESAN SOUTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE  <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE METHOD OF HANDLING CASSAVA PROCESSING IN SELECTED VILLAGES IN EDO STATE: A CASE STUDY OF ESAN SOUTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE  ", "id": 132}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AGRICULTURAL FINANCING OF RICE PRODUCTION IN NIGERIA: A CASE STUDY OWAN-EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, EDO STATE <br/>(PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This project work was carried out to investigate how rice production is financed in Edo State a case study of Owan East Local Government Area, Nigeria.

Rice is an annual crop and the most important stable food crop in tropic countries; commercially it is the most important cereal after wheat. It is widely consumed and there is hardly any country in the world where it is not utilized in one form or the other.<br/>        In Nigeria rice is one of the few food items whose consumption has no cultural, religious ethnic or geographical boundary. It is available in five stars hotels in the big city and towns as well as the “most local” of the eating places in the remotest villages throughout the country. It is highly priced and widely accepted for festivity. In some rural areas, it is so adored that if is eaten only on Sundays and sometimes on market days.<br/>        But unfortunately, the cultivation and production of this highly priced and very important food crop is dwindling consequently, the price has gone beyond the reach of majority of Nigerian’s. In order to stem the decline in the number of farmers participating in rice farming and at the same time increase the production of all staple food crops, the Federal Government introduced a number of agricultural development programmes/project among wish are Operation Feed the Nation (OPN), Green, Revolution National Accelerated Food Production Programmes (NAFPP), Directorate of Food, Roads and Rural Infrastructures (DFRRT) and new Agricultural Development Programme (ADP), River in and Rural Development Authorities (RBRDA) and Nigeria Agricultural co-Operative and Rural Development Bank to mention but a few. Irrespective of these programmes/project and other schemes and improvement in infrastructural facilities, food crop (especially rice) productions have persistently remained below market demand.<br/>        In the light of the above, conscious and effective efforts will be made to thoroughly examine and study the production as well as the financing of this production processes of rice, the problems and the prospect of rice production in Nigeria a specified study of Owan East Local Government Area Gomezka (2001).<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>        The problem that prompted this research work is the need to investigate the major knowledge attitude and bring to light and understanding after proper research, how the production of rice in Nigeria, Edo State and in the Owan Eastern region is been managed, the problems and the prospective involved. The following significant questions come to mind.<br/>The various sources of finance for rice.<br/>The basic problems faced by the processes of producing rice.<br/>How the climatic, biotic and abiotic factors in Edo State Owan East Local Government Area support the cultivation of rice there.<br/>How rice production in Edo State affects the distribution of rice in the country, Nigeria.<br/>This and with many of others the researcher hopes to examine with a notion to evaluating this unwholesome vices.<br/>1.3 RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>        For the purpose of the research, the following research questions have been formulated to guide the study.<br/>What are the various source of finance for the cultivation and production of rice?<br/>What are the basic problems associated with producing rice?<br/>Does the climatic, biotic and abiotic factors in Edo State supports the cultivation of rice there?<br/>Does the production of rice in Edo State, especially in Owan East L.G.A affects the distribution of rice in the country, Nigeria?<br/>1.4 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>          The purpose of this research work include;<br/>Examine the knowledge and attitude involved with the financing of rice production in Edo State, Owan East L.G.A.<br/>Identify the problems involved with the production of rice.<br/>Highlight the prospects of rice production.<br/>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>        In the world today, rice is one of the most important annual crop. This crop can be cultivated subsistent and both commercially, it can be planted and cultivated by the poor and also the rich, in a small scale of farmland or in a large scale of farmland. This study or research work should be of significance to students in enabling them (students) acquire every necessary knowledge, skills, values and information involved with producing rice.<br/>        It will also help already existing cultivators or farmers of rice to improve on their cultivation farmers wanting to endeavour in rice production, this research work will make available all the necessary information for the production of rice.

Several factors were identified as causes of this trend; such as lack of capital, use of old plantations, unavailability of land, price of latex etc. a questionnaires approach was used to obtain data from the farmers in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State. This was subjected to analysis based on stipulated hypothesis drawn from the questionnaires. The result of this analysis showed that lack of capital was not responsible for low production of rubber in Ughelli Local Government Area. Also, market prices of rubber products had no effect on low rubber production. However, government policies were identified as a cause of low production of rubber in Ughelli Local Government Area. Therefore, the government should promulgate policies that will encourage rubber production in Ovia North East Local Government Area and Nigeria. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE   <br/>1.1        Introduction<br/>1.2        Background of study<br/>1.3        Purpose of study<br/>1.4        Research questions<br/>1.5        Hypothesis<br/>1.6        Significance of the study<br/>CHAPTER TWO <br/>2.1        Literature review<br/>CHAPTER THREE        <br/>Method of study<br/>3.1        Research design<br/>3.2        Population of study<br/>3.3        Sample and sampling procedure<br/>3.4        Instrumentation<br/>3.5        Hypothesis<br/>3.6        Validity and reliability of instruments<br/>3.7        Administration of instruments<br/>3.8        Method of data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR          <br/>4.1        Presentation of data analysis and discussion of results<br/>4.2        Test of hypothesis<br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>5.1        Summary of Findings, Conclusion and Recommendation  <br/>5.2        Conclusion<br/>5.3        Recommendation<br/>REFERENCES     <br/>QUESTIONNAIRES     <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>Natural rubber, Para rubber, Hevea Brasiliensis, is a commercial tree economically grown in plantations. Para rubber plant is useful for the latex that bleeds from the stem in the event of wounding. The product of the coagulated latex is rubber. Rubber is used in the manufacture a number of industrial products which range from tires, balls, containers, shoes to bands and a lot of other items. Rubber is important in the socio-economic life of many tropical developing nations, such as Nigeria and Brazil. Before the 60s, before the era of the oil boom, rubber was one of the agricultural commodities that were the main stay of Nigerian economy. The cultivation of rubber provided bulk employment for the people of the then Mid-West now known as the Edo and Edo States. However, rubber is not native to Nigeria. As the name suggests, it is an introduction from Brazil.<br/>The rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis (Muell.) is a major crop for smallholders in Nigeria and an important commercial crop everywhere. It is grown for latex production, while rubber wood is considered as a secondary product. Therefore rubber is regarded as an agricultural crop. However, recent improvements in wood technology have led to rubber tree becoming increasingly important as a source of wood products (Evans and Turnbull 2004). Rubber wood has enjoyed an environmentally friendly reputation as a raw material, because it is a by-product of latex production, and when grown in renewable plantations, it can substitute timber from natural forests.<br/>The natural range of Hevea, of the family Euphorbiaceae, covers the Amazon river basin and parts of the nearby uplands. Within the genus, Hevea brasiliensis (also known as para rubber) is one of the most widely distributed species. (Wycherley 1992). The rubber tree has always been known for its latex, which was used by the ancient civilizations of Central and South America. The commercial and large-scale exploitation of the tree did not begin until in the last quarter of the 19th century. With the arrival of cars, discovery of the pneumatic tyre and following increase in rubber prices, the produced amount of plantation-originated rubber was soon larger than that of wild rubber. At the same time, there were strong geo-political pressures to move the rubber production away from South America (Jones and Allen 1992). While searching for a cash crop for its eastern colonies, the British identified rubber as a potential crop for planting in Southeast Asia (Hong 1999). Rubber was first introduced in Asia in 1876, when seeds were first shipped from the Amazonas to the United Kingdom and further to Ceylon and planted there. In the following year, rubber trees were planted in Singapore and Malaya (Hong 1999). Although rubber was first an estate crop, local individual farmers soon adopted the crop and so they were drawn into the world commercial economy (Courtenay 1979).<br/>Hevea brasiliensis is a tropical, deciduous tree, which grows 25-30 meters tall in its natural distribution area. Most of the planted trees are smaller, because they have been bred for the production of latex without taking much into account their wood production potential (Hong 1999). The bole of the rubber tree is usually straight but quickly tapered, and heavy branching is common. The branching pattern is very variable, and the leading stem can be dominant or soon divided into several heavy branches. The tree is easily damaged by strong winds (Lemmens et al. 1995). Clonal variation in wind-resistance has been observed, depending on types of branching (Cilas et al. 2004). Rubber tree matures at the age of seven to ten years, after which latex tapping can be started. When aiming at economic latex production, the life cycle of a rubber plantation is 30-35 years, after which replanting is necessary.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>Natural rubber performed three main functions in the Nigerian economy; firstly it provided some of the foreign exchange and placed Nigeria in the world map as an exporter of rubber products. Lastly it provided employment for a sizeable segment of the rural populace. The situation in Nigeria presently pretends a drift from beings a major exporter of rubber products into becoming a net importer in the nearest future. The important question or issue is what the reasons are for the observed down turn or reduction in productivity of rubber, especially I Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>PURPOSE OF STUDY <br/>This research was undertaken for the following reasons.<br/>a.           To ascertain the positive impact of rubber production in Ughelli LGA.<br/>b.           To find out the level of decline in rubber production in Ughelli Local Government Area.<br/>c.           To find out the causes of decline in rubber production<br/>d.           And lastly to proffer solution to the problems resulting to this decline. <br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>Considering the aforementioned purpose of this research, the following research questions are proposed as a guide in this study.<br/>a.           Does rubber production have any positive impact on the economic growth of the Nation?<br/>b.           What are the major reasons for decline in rubber production in Ughelli Local Government Area?<br/>c.           How much of rubber plantations have been substituted with food crops or other cash crops.<br/>d.           What is the level of market forces impact on rubber production<br/>e.           Are farmers still interested in cultivating rubber in Ughelli Local Government Area?<br/>f.            How willing are farmers to rehabilitate their rubber plantation.<br/>g.           What steps could be taken by farmers to facilitate rubber production.<br/>h.           What role could the government and non-government agencies play in encouraging rubber production.  <br/>HYPOTHESIS <br/>This study was considered on the basis of the following assumptions;<br/>Ho: Capital has no effect on the low production of rubber in Ughelli Local Government Area.<br/>H1: capital has effect on the low production of rubber in Owan-West LGA.<br/>Ho: Government policies have effect on the productivity of rubber in Ughelli Local Government Area.<br/>H1: Government policies has no effect o the productivity of rubber in Ughelli Local Government Area.<br/>Ho: Poor market prices of rubber products has no effect on the production of rubber in Ughelli Local Government Area.<br/>H1: Poor market prices of rubber products ahs effect on the production of rubber in Ughelli Local Government Area.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>This research which is basically investigating will help to achieve the following:<br/>a.           Give details of factors responsible for low production of rubber in Ughelli Local Government Area.<br/>b.           It will reveal the perception of farmers on the decline of rubber production.<br/>c.           It will help proffer solutions to these factors.<br/>d.           It will be a working tool for both government and non-governmental agencies on how to tackle the decline in rubber production.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE POSITIVE IMPACT OF RUBBER PRODUCTION ON THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF RUBBER PRODUCTION ON THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF EDO STATE", "id": 134}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN INVESTIGATION ON THE PERFORMANCE OF NIGERIA AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE <br/>AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK (NACRDB) IN AGRICULTURAL CREDIT DELIVERY IN EDO STATE; A CASE STUDY OF BENIN BRANCH<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The study investigating performance of Nigeria agriculture cooperation and rural development bank limited (NACRDB) this specific objective were to identify the different loan scheme, number of farmer did participated in these scheme, examine the bank services rate, their arrival  rate, the categories of customers served by the bank, a well structural questionnaire was used to elicit information.

It is undisputable that agriculture is the bedrock of any developing nation as it provides the food and fibre requirement of the teeming population. Agricultural development is one of the crucial requirements for overall economic growth. Although the oil sector has now dominated the Nigeria economy, contributing up to 80% of government revenue and more than 10% of the country’s foreign exchange. It is still the agricultural sector that is sustaining the majority (70-75%) of the country population estimated of over 84 million in 1980 (Olatunbode, 1990). The low level contribution of agriculture to the Nigerian economy over the years has been known to be the major reasons why huge amount of import, bills are incurred by the government on food/fibre importation since the discovery of crude oil in the 70’s.<br/>One characteristics of agriculture is that most of its product are seasonal and are susceptible to deterioration in storage, the rating of agriculture production in Nigeria make it a rather difficult sector for commercial bank lending. For exchange, a large number of the farmer are not literate and hence are not familiar with bank procedure. Also, then farmer often produce enough food to feed their families with little left for the market. (Ojo, et al 1981).<br/>Despite the huddle faced by the farmers they still produce food and raw materials for the nation. The development of agriculture involved the adoption of new and more efficient technologies by farmers, the new technologies includes the improve seed, breeds, agrochemical, as well as farm implement. These technologies must be purchased by only a few of the small holder farmer in Nigeria have the financial resources to make such purchase (Okpeku, 1992). Yet the estimated is more than 50% Nigeria food supply is produced by the rural small-scale farmers with farm size ranging from 0.1-0.2 hectares (Olayide, 1980). Under these circumstances therefore lack of credit poses a serious impediment to agricultural development hence the economic development of Nigeria.<br/>The research work is intended to assess the performance of Nigeria agriculture cooperative and rural development bank (NASCRDB) in meeting the credit need of farmer. Reluctance of the commercial bank and merchant bank to extend credit facilities to the agricultural venture and the low rate(s) of return that characterize agricultural business undertaking informed the laudable decision of the federal government of Nigeria to establish a national agricultural bank, the Nigeria agriculture and cooperative bank (NACB) now the (NACRDB) was incorporated in 1972 and commenced operation in 1973 as an apex development financing institution charge with the singular responsibility of providing credit facilities for agricultural and rural development in the country.<br/>The birth of Nigeria’s agricultural cooperative and rural development bank (NACRDB) limited as a single largest development finance institution in Nigeria followed the successful merging of the former people bank of Nigeria (PBN) the defunct Nigeria agricultural and cooperative bank (NACB) limited and risk assets of the family economic advancement programme (FEAP) in October, 2000. NACRDB is dedicated primarily to agricultural financing as well as micro-financing of small and medium scale enterprise. The bank is a registered limited liability company that is wholly owned by the government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria with the share capital fully subscribed by the federal ministry of finance (60%) and the central bank of Nigeria 40%) with its branches scattered all over the country including Edo State with six (6) bond office namely South-South bond office at Port-Harcourt, North East bond office at Bauchi, North West bond office at Kano and North Central bon office at Abuja. However, the bank performs this all important function of credit delivery is what this study is therefore set out to assess.<br/>MAIN OBJECTIVE AND FUNCTION OF NIGERIA’S AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK (NACRDB)<br/>             As the development financial institution Nigeria agricultural cooperative and rural development bank (NACRDB) limited was established to deliver credit to the agricultural sector of the Nigeria economy having the following specific objective as the central forces.  <br/>Promotion of agricultural production and rural development<br/>Assisting in the improvement of the income and quality of life of the Nigeria rural population.<br/>Contribution to the overall growth and development of the Nigeria economy<br/>Promotion of capacity building through the provision of received training and advisory services.<br/>Encouraging the formation of cooperative societies at all levels.<br/>Thus the function of the bank to achieve the above objective are;<br/>The provision of loan to industrial farmers, cooperative organization, limited liability companies<br/>Financing direct investment in the equity capital of major agricultural and agro-allied industrial venture<br/>Providing guarantee for viable agricultural and agro-allied venture to enable the rate raise finance either locally or internationally.<br/>Assisting in improving the income and welfare of farmer by promoting rural development.   <br/>Increasing the nation output of food and cash crop to meet the need of a rapidly increase population.<br/>Financing of all form of agriculture project which includes fishery, cattle, poultry, rabbitry, forestry and timber production horticulture, arable crops, and free crops.<br/>Provision of finance for the marketing of agricultural produce locally and for export.<br/>Financing of agro-allied project including tractor, living operation agro-processing and storage (NACRDB, 2000).<br/>NIGERIA’S AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK OPERATIONAL SCHEME <br/>        The bank operates a supervised loan delivery system through the following scheme;<br/>On-lending: Under theses scheme lending is made to established institution against repayment guarantee for on-lending to small scale farmer. The on-lending institution includes state government cooperative organization, state agriculture credit cooperation agricultural development project and river basin and rural development authorities.<br/>Micro-credit: The scheme is designed to directly reach small farmer who produce the bulk of our food, this step was taken in order to meet the increasing credit demand of the small scale farmer who produce 90% of the total output of food and fibre of the country, the security requirement such as certificate of occupancy of project land and other security requirement applicable to the micro credit are waived for turnover under micro credit scheme. What is require is only that the farmers  satisfies operational staff that he is largely a full farmer with a farmland belong to him or his family of what he has permission to use it. Also that he is residence in a village where farm land is located and can produce two guarantors to guarantee the loan is not to exceed N250, 000.00.<br/>Macro-credit: This loan scheme is specifically designed to meet the credit need of the medium and large scale farm, under the scheme, the bank deal directly with individual farmer and organization without going through on-lending intermediaries the loan is from N250, 000.00 and above (NACRDB, 2000).<br/>LENDING RATE <br/>        The bank interest rate regime on is generally concessionary and discriminatory in favour of small farmer and trader to who the bank buck of loanable fund is directed.<br/>Micro-credit – 80% per annum<br/>Macro credit<br/>Agriculture production – 16.5% (except cotton production) per annum      <br/>ii.  Agro-processing – 17.5% per annum.<br/>iii. Marketing – 18.5% per annum<br/>iv. Cotton production – 70% per annum  <br/>Special project – as prescribed and negotiated with donor agencies and state holder;<br/>i.  Interest on micro credit is calculated on simple basis.<br/>ii.  The listed rate are subjected to large from time to time (NACRDB, 2000)<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>        The major problem militating against the accelerated growth and development of the agriculture sector generally is the apparent lack and inadequacy of available capital for agricultural production and distribution by the rural farmers. In recognition of the severity of this problem, the federal  government of Nigeria established the (NACRDB) former (NACB, PBN and FEAP). In 2000 in place of NACB for better service to the farmer, though the bank and its former level has been in operation for over three decade the problem level inadequate capital is still paramount among the rural farmer, this raise such question as what could be responsible for this situation.<br/>        How effective is the performance of the bank in delivery credit for farmer. Are farmers not making use of this facility of is the bank serving other at the expenses of farmer? Does the bank delay the approval of loan request thereby building up queues? These and some other are the questions that study is set out to answer.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>        The main objective is to assess the performance of NACRDB in agricultural credit delivery in Edo State. The specific objectives are;<br/>To identify the different loan scheme available to the farmers.<br/>To identify the number of farmer that participate in the scheme per time period.<br/>To identify the category/type of customer served by the bank.<br/>To identify the presence of a queue and examine the bank service rate their arrival rate and waiting time.<br/>To determined the traffic intensity in order to access the level of effectiveness of the performance of the bank.<br/>To identify the problem militating against the performance of the bank in agricultural credit delivery.<br/>1.4    JUSTIFICATION <br/>The desire of any nation is to be self-reliant in food production for its citizen. One sort way of achieving this is adequate funding of the agricultural sector through the provision of loans to the farmers.<br/>Much work has been done on the different sources of loan to farmers but the assessment of the performance of such sources does not seem to have been done. This needs to be done for such credit sources to reorganize their strategy, the result of the study would be invaluable to the bank, farmers and policy makers.<br/><br/>\n\nAN INVESTIGATION ON THE PERFORMANCE OF NIGERIA AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK (NACRDB) IN AGRICULTURAL CREDIT DELIVERY IN EDO STATE; A CASE STUDY OF BENIN BRANCH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN INVESTIGATION ON THE PERFORMANCE OF NIGERIA AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK (NACRDB) IN AGRICULTURAL CREDIT DELIVERY IN EDO STATE; A CASE STUDY OF BENIN BRANCH", "id": 135}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CAUSES AND EFFECT OF EROSION IN OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT OF EDO STATE <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This research work was designed to examine the causes and effect of soil erosion in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State. Five (5) research questions were formulated and questionnaires were administered to one hundred (100) respondents in order to gather data for the research. Results showed that agricultural activities lead to soil erosion, improper soil management cause erosion, deforestation lead to erosion etc. Recommendations were made and it include that; <br/>Sustainable soil management systems must be developed to reduce further degradation and restore the productivity of the eroded land. T<br/>The management options to reduce the soil loss are to implement conservation measures and/or to change the crop to be planted. <br/>Soil conservation methods including terraces and bunds as well as semi-permeable structures like grass strips should be used as barriers to holdback runoff and sediment carried with it. <br/>Agronomic measures like contour plowing have the advantage to reduce runoff and soil loss.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>Erosion is recognized as one of the world's most serious environmental problems (Pimentel et al., 2005, Shiferaw and Holden, 2009). Globally, about 80% of the current degradation of agricultural land is caused by soil erosion (Angima et al., 2003). Erosion by water, at a global scale, is the main soil degradation process in agricultural areas (Bewket and Sterk 2002). It generates strong environmental impacts and major economic losses from decreased agricultural production and from off-site effects on infrastructure and water quality by sedimentation processes (Zinabu et al., 2002; Daba, 2003; Haregeweyn et al., 2005; Amsalu et al., 2007).<br/>Erosion creates severe limitations to sustainable agricultural land use, as it reduces on-farm soil productivity and causes food insecurity (Tadesse, 2001; Sonneveld, 2002; Beshah, 2003, Moges and Holden, 2006, Bewket, 2007). In most developing countries human activity triggers these losses (Mohammad et al., 2001, Belyaev et al., 2004, Bewket and Sterk, 2005, Hurni et al., 2005). This is associated with rapid population growth, inadequate attention to the basic natural resources (soils, water and vegetation), and the need to maximize production to meet the needs of the growing population (Shiferaw and Holden, 2009, 2000, Bewket, 2002, Feoli et al., 2002). This situation is more serious in poor developing countries where subsistence production predominates. The average farmer who cultivates one hectare of food crops and keeps some livestock, is nowadays dependent on natural conditions and cannot tolerate further deterioration of soil productivity (Sonneveld and Keyzer, 2003). Increasing population, intense land cultivation, uncontrolled grazing, and deforestation often lead to, or exacerbate, soil erosion (Tadesse, 2001 and Bewket, 2002). These factors undermine agricultural productivity and frustrate economic development efforts, especially in developing countries where there is heavy land dependence (Shiferaw and Holden, 2000) in low external-input farming systems.<br/>Statement of Problem <br/>Erosion is considered as one of major land degradation process in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State which is also the main source of environmental deterioration. It creates negative impacts on agricultural production, infrastructure and water quality (Vrieling, 2006).  Erosion is also the natural phenomenon (geological process) which is caused by natural force; it can be more accelerated when the process is influenced by human activities (human-induced erosion). It is considered that the accelerated erosion is a serious global problem and widely recognized (de Graaf, 2006). With the accelerated erosion, it can affect agronomic/biomass productivity (on-site effect) and flooding, sedimentation of reservoirs, siltation of agriculture field and decrease of water quality downstream (off-site effects). The two important agents of erosion are wind and water (Hudson, 2006).<br/>The study area is located in Ovia North East Local Government Area, Edo State. This area is an intensive agricultural areas in Edo State for years now. The conversion of the tropical rain forest to agricultural system has been taking place. With the increasing population, the cultivation in the mountainous area has been taking place. The primary forest is replaced by the maize, plantain, paw-paw, yams, and other crop types. The removal of natural forest and vegetation cover in steep slope and followed by improper land use practices have led to the various land degradation problems in the area. Each year during the rainy season a lot of topsoil is eroded and the agricultural lands are affected. On the other hand; the eroded soil and sediments which are transported by the surface runoff affect the downstream cultivation land.<br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of this study is to have clear understanding of the causes and effect of erosion in Ovia North East Local Government Area, Edo State.<br/>The specific objectives are:<br/>1) To identify the practices that accelerates erosion in the study area.<br/>2) To discuss the perception of the people in relations to the effect of erosion on the agricultural potentials and performance of the communities in Ovia North East.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTION <br/>Do agricultural activities lead to erosion?<br/>Does deforestation lead to erosion?<br/>Does improper soil management cause erosion?<br/>Is urbanization a major effect on erosion processes?<br/>Does climate change contribute to erosion problem? <br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>This study helps to know the extent at which the resident of Ovia North East participate in unhealthy activities that lead to erosion in the area. It will also provide the information about the major causes of erosion in the study area.<br/>It will enlighten the general public on the ways erosion can be control/reduced in the study area.<br/>It will serve as a source of information to government and the ministry of environments on steps to take in tackling the menace of erosion in the study area. It will also provide information to the local government authority on the causes and effect of erosion and ways to solving the problem of erosion in Ovia North East.   <br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is set out to determine the causes and effect of erosion in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State. Therefore, the study is restricted to five communities in the area of study. The communities include: Ekiadolor, Ovbiogie, Iguedaiken, Iguikhinmwin and Iyowa community.

Majority of the breeds we now know are descended from the Eurasian Wild Boar (Sus scrofa). Archaeological evidence from the Middle East indicates domestication of the pig occurs as early as 9,000 years ago while most livestock where utilized initially by nomadic peoples, swine are more indicative of a settled farming community. Pigs have become vital to the economy in parts of the world. (Ayivor, and Hellins, 2002).<br/> Piggery is another aspect of farming in Nigeria that is making smart investors huge money on daily basis. If you are into this pig farming, you sure wouldn't lack money again for the rest of your life. The reason is because Pig meet is in high demand in Nigeria and sells very fast in the market. Another reason is that Pig reproduce in large number and grows very fast. A single pig gives birth to as much as 15 piglets at a time, making it one of the most reproducing mammal in the world. Baby pigs is known as shoat, farrow or piglet. Male pigs are referred to as the boar while females are sows. As a group they are called a herd or drove. Despite the huge profitability of Piggery, many Nigerian are still overlooking this goldmine because of ignorance of how it works. While some don't just get the fact that it is a big business -  many who engage in it do it as part time business but if you can engage in this business fully, you are sure going to smile to the bank very soon.<br/>A fully grown Pig goes for as high as N30, 000 depending on the weight. Now Imagine for a year you are able to rear hundred to maturity, you will be making  N3 Million from the sales. If you can take it higher - lets say like 2,000 pigs in year, you will be talking of N60 Million here! Considering how fast pigs reproduces, it wouldn't be a very much big deal to come up with 100 pigs in a year. (Ayivor, and Hellins, 2002)<br/>Livestock systems occupy about 30 per cent of the planet's ice-free terrestrial surface area (Steinfeld et al. 2006) and are a significant global asset with a value of at least $1.4 trillion. The livestock sector is increasingly organized in long market chains that employ at least 1.3 billion people globally and directly support the livelihoods of 600 million poor smallholder farmers in the developing world (Thornton et al. 2006). Keeping livestock is an important risk reduction strategy for vulnerable communities, and livestock are important providers of nutrients and traction for growing crops in smallholder systems. Livestock products contribute 17 per cent to kilocalorie consumption and 33 per cent to protein consumption globally, but there are large differences between rich and poor countries (Rosegrant et al. 2009).<br/>Livestock systems have both positive and negative effects on the natural resource base, public health, social equity and economic growth (World Bank 2009). Currently, livestock is one of the fastest growing agricultural subsectors in developing countries. Its share of agricultural GDP is already 33 per cent and is quickly increasing. This growth is driven by the rapidly increasing demand for livestock products, this demand being driven by population growth, urbanization and increasing incomes in developing countries (Delgado 2005).<br/>The global livestock sector is characterized by a dichotomy between developing and developed countries. Total meat production in the developing world tripled between 1980 and 2002, from 45 to 134 million tons (World Bank 2009). Much of this growth was concentrated in countries that experienced rapid economic growth, particularly in East Asia, and revolved around poultry and pigs. In developed countries, on the other hand, production and consumption of livestock products are now growing only slowly or stagnating, although at high levels. Even so, livestock production and merchandizing in industrialized countries account for 53 per cent of agricultural GDP (World Bank 2009). This combination of growing demand in the developing world and stagnant demand in industrialized countries represents a major opportunity for livestock keepers in developing countries, where most demand is met by local production, and this is likely to continue well into the foreseeable future. At the same time, the expansion of agricultural production needs to take place in a way that allows the less well-off to benefit from increased demand and that moderates its impact on the environment.<br/>        The modern pig has played and continued to play a major role in providing food for human consumption due in parts to its tremendous versatility and adaptability to a wide-range of environmental conditions. Donham,(2000). This ability to adapt plays a significant role in how pigs are raised and grown in various countries of the world. Hedegepath,(2008).<br/>        Pig production is widely scattered across the globe. The estimated global pig inventory of over 801 million in 2002 was a slight increases over the global pig inventory estimate of over 782 million in (2006). The countries of Asia have the largest inventory of pig in the world, accounting for over 62% of the total global inventory in 2002. The countries of European Union account for nearly 15% of the global inventory followed by North America with approximately 10%. pig are produced primarily in regions of the world with available natural resource including arable land, cereal grains and water. Hedegepath, (2008).<br/>        With ever increasing human population in Nigeria and virtually static agriculture productivity, the animal protein consumption among Nigerians has worsened in the past few years (Okpor, 2009). Many Nigerians feed on carbohydrate. This is because the average man cannot afford the cost of animal protein which is richer in amino acid. The deficiency of animal protein in the diet of so many people is often attributed to the low number of livestock (cattle, pigs, poultry, goats, sheep and their products), and the activities connected with their production which are not efficient (Morrison, 2001). Ugwu (2006) observed that animal protein apart from its palatability is essential for normal physical and mental development of man. He stated that its deficiency in the diet exerts adverse effects in terms of reduced human productivity due to abnormal development. Equally, he noted that animal protein energy deficiency causes high incidence of infant mortality, pronounced malnutrition and disease.<br/>        Livestock production in Edo State has a great potential for commercial production of snail and shrimp in the coast line as well poultry and pig. Morison (2001). Huge market exists for livestock and animal product. The semi savannah climate to the Northern part of the state specifically areas like Auchi, Igarra and Ubiaja are suitable for livestock such as sheep, goat and cattle. The present livestock population in the state is estimated at poultry, 6000,000, Cattle 78,000, Goat 556,000, Sheep278,000, Pigs 189,000 while, cane rats (grass cutter) and snail rearing are in commercial production. Very huge opportunities exist in this sub-sector. Ugwu. (2006.)<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>        Pig products are good source of protein to every individual and a viable avenue of revenue to both the nation, the citizens of that country. But unfortunately the production of this product is faced with several problems among which are lack of finance, disease outbreak and transportation. If situation is not ratified more serious problems might develop.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>In view of the foregoing, the study set out to answer the following questions in relation to the area of study:<br/>     Is inadequate finance a problem to pig farming?<br/>     Does disease outbreak affect the production of pig?<br/>     Does lack of adequate supply of genetically sound breeders affect pig farming?<br/>     Does high cost of feed affect pig farming?<br/>     Does poor infrastructure facilities affect pig farming?<br/>     Does fear of inadequate market for piggery products and the absent of pig product processing industry in Nigeria affect pig farmers?<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The main objective of this study is to find out the problem and prospect of pig farming in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State. The specific objectives are to:<br/>(i)examine the factors influencing pig production in Ovia North East Local Government Area;<br/>(ii)Find out if inadequate finance is a problem of pig farming in Ovia North East Local Government area of Edo State.<br/>(iv) Find out if disease outbreak affects pig farming in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The need for this investigation is to know the problems and prospect of pig farming in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State. It is said that at the end of this investigation both the farmers and the consumers within the area in which the investigation was carried out will benefit from the findings of the study.<br/>        Therefore, this study will help farmers within Edo State to know the various systems of rearing pigs in order to help them to know the best marketing channels to sell their products. Also this study will help the consumer in the same area to know the best hygienic place to purchase their meat and other livestock products.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>        In this study, pig farming in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State will be carefully examined. This study will pay particular attention to factors affecting the production of pigs in Edo State. It will also investigate some problems faced by pig farmers in the rearing of pigs and make recommendations that will enhance more farming of pigs in Edo State.   <br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Archaeological: A person who study archaeology.

It includes domestic fowl, turkey, duck, geese, pheasant, guinea fowl e.t.c the need to provide sufficient animal protein for the human race is the paramount concern to animal scientists and vegetarians. Agriculturists and nutritionists are generally agreed that developing the poultry industry in Nigeria is the fastest means of bringing the protein deficiency gap presently prevailing in the country (FAO, 1965).<br/>Poultry production is one of the best available systems for the production of high biological value animal protein for human consumption and thus has emerged as a good substitute of beef and mutton, especially in underdeveloped countries. Therefore, poultry farming particularly, is playing a pivotal role in bridging the gap between supply and requirement of animal protein and it also stabilizing the prices of theses commodities. No doubt poultry industry has developed tremendously in the last four decades but still it is far behind the advanced countries while fulfilling the nutritional requirements of the Nation (Ayelea, G., Abdul Jabbar, M., Teklewold , H., Mulugeta, E. and Getahun Kebedec, 2003). There does, exist a huge potential for the growth of domestic poultry in order to meet the domestic requirements and also to generate exportable surpluses. Whereas, poultry farmers are still using the conventional methods of farming while advanced countries are using latest techniques and technologies in this sector. At present students and farmers don’t know how to use these techniques and technologies in a precise way. On the other hand some farmers are importing the modern equipments which are not applicable in our climatic conditions and are also difficult to handle. Therefore, it can be envisaged that there is a dire need to motivate the poultry farmers toward the adaptation of modern equipments through development of locally designed technologies.<br/>In the modern commercial poultry industry, there are challenges in the production of poultry product ranging from increases in disease and infections by enteric pathogens, problem of marketing poultry product. The major problem of the poultry production in Nigeria is that of low productivity and inefficiency in resource allocation and utilization (Onyenweaku and Effiong, 2006). The poultry industry in Nigeria is characterized by high production costs, low profit margins, and high feed bills. Andargachew (2006), showed that increase in livestock production in Nigeria derives mainly from average expansion rather than higher intensification and productivity of resources.<br/>This implies that the present production and supply chain is inadequate (Olaofe, 2004), hence the need to provide present and intending broiler farmers with useful information that will assist and sustain poultry industry in Nigeria. The concept of efficiency in the use of farm resources is concerned with the relative performance of the processes used in transforming given inputs into outputs. There are basically three major types of efficiency, viz, technical, allocative and economic efficiency. Technical efficiency refers to the ability of firms to employ the best practice in the production process so that not more than the necessary amount of a given set of inputs is used in producing the “best” level of output (Carlson, 2002). Allocative efficiency refers to the choice of optimum combination<br/>of inputs consistent with the relative factor prices (Nwaru, 2003). On the other hand, Economic efficiency is the ability of a farm to maximize profit (Onyenweaku et al, 2004).<br/>Poultry refers to all domesticated birds kept for meat and eggs production. Eggs and poultry meat are produced primarily for food consumption. Eggs are also used in various food industries like the manufacturing of confectionary (i.e. sweet chocolate cakes etc.). They are also used for the manufacturing of cosmetics of infection diseases while the feathers may be used for making pillows and mattresses. Some species of poultry are suitable for genetic nutritional and physiological studies because of their relatively low cost of maintenance, proliferation (a rapid growth or increase in numbers) and short generation intervals. In the earlier time, the keeping of poultry were not being considered as a major occupation; that is birds were kept to obtain some money and in most cases for pleasure and pastime cock figliting. In some areas or communities, fowls are still used in the past as a means of knowing what times of day, most especially the cock (i.e. male fowl). Poultry farming started those days when our local farmers used the old and extensive method in keeping fowls, goats, sheep, pig and other related domestic animals proved that the poultry section was a profitable venture too. Gradually, poultry keeping developed into a commercial enterprise involving thousands of birds, large poultry units, replace small ones while more efficient strains of birds, balanced feeds, intensive housing and better poultry equipment come into use. All these industrialized system of keeping poultry birds in a recent development in Edo state as in most humid tropical countries. The effect of some environmental factors like the industries are less capitalized consists of smaller units and depend more on manual labour. These lead to less production of the birds or the birds perform at a lower level. Due to this account, the cost of poultry production is higher. All these factors contribute to the lower consumption of poultry production in the tropical areas like Edo state. For example, the recent estimate of eggs consumption in Nigeria was far low when compared with the European countries and the United States. Moreover, the industries in the tropical areas are not as diversified as in the temperate. In the tropics, the emphasis is on egg production and only one species of poultry is used. Whereas economic and nutritional benefits can be derived from keeping other species, for example some strains of ducks are fast growing, resistance to many diseases of the domestic fowl and can produce as many as 300 eggs per annum. These can be used to increase the consumption of poultry products in the tropics. However, throughout the world, the domestic birds are unique for its popularity in producing both poultry meat and eggs while the other species are kept primarily for meat. In order for poultry birds to produce efficiently, there is need to raise them under a conducive environment. We have various ways of rearing birds like the industrialized system of rearing birds.<br/>During the past decades, the production of poultry table meat and eggs have changed from small backyard flocks to fewer and larger commercial operations. Before the advent of the poultry industry in Nigeria husbandry was of the free range system. The feeding of the birds is generally not controlled. They are left to scavenge on what is available from insects, earthworm waste grains to food left over. The only additional source of food is the scattering of guinenea corn or millet, especially during the growing phase in order to build up home attachment. In the 1960s, there was a giant stride in the poultry industry. Most of the poultry establishment that stated as backyard ventures or hobbies designed to expand after getting visible financial rewards from scale of eggs and birds, small scale poultry farms mostly of the deep litter system, sprang up sporadically through government encouragement. This led to further development of the poultry industry to a commercial status. The eastern and western region of the country experienced a vast production of poultry products. The problems in this decade were those of management and disease control. Despite all these problems the poultry production has a promising future in this country.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>Poultry products are good source of protein to every individual and a viable avenue of revenue to both the nation and the citizens of that country. But fortunately the production of these products are facing a lot of problems ranging from poor marketing strategy, outbreak of disease, poor technological knowhow, inadequate funding of the poultry industry in the country among others. If the situation is not ratified on time it may degenerate into a more serious problem.<br/>1.3    RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>Does disease outbreak affect the production of poultry products in the country?<br/>Is inadequate finance a problem to the production of poultry products in the country?<br/>Does poor marketing strategy affect the production of poultry product in the country?<br/>Does lack of equipment/technology affect the commercial production of poultry product in the country?<br/>Does poor allocation of resources by the government to the poultry industry affect the commercial production of poultry product in the country?<br/>1.4    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>        This research therefore examines the problems militating against commercial poultry production in Edo State using Ovia North East Local Government Area as a case study.  The specific objective of the study includes;<br/>To identify the problems militating against commercial production of poultry product in Edo State.<br/>To find out if lack of resource allocation by the government affect commercial production of poultry products.<br/>To find out how best the problems of commercial poultry production can be solved.<br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The need for this study is to know the problems militating against commercial poultry production in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State. This research is important because in the end both the farmers and the consumers in Edo State will benefit from the findings of the study.<br/>        Therefore, this study will help farmers within Ovia North East in particular and Edo State in general to know the problems of commercial poultry production and also be acquainted with how to solve the problems identified.<br/>        This study is significant because it will give a background knowledge of commercial poultry production. It will recommend to the people, the benefits, of commercial poultry production. It will reveal the prospects of commercial poultry production, thereby encouraging prospective farmers<br/>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>        In this study, commercial poultry production in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State will be carefully examined. This study will pay particular attention to the problems militating against the commercial poultry production in Edo State.<br/>1.8    DEFINITION OF TERM <br/>POULTRY: Consist monthly of local reared under free range     conclusion.

From the result gathered, it shows that there is need for government to ensure constant deregulation of fuel to every states and local government of the federation, regulating the rate of increasing fuel and to arrest all forms and conditions that could easily lead to fuel scarcity which will have negative effects on farm produce. Finally, result gotten also shows that individual have to desist from all forms of fuel hoarding and vandalization of fuel pipes could threaten the availability of fuel in t he circulation which could at least bring untold hardship on the society by way of increasing price of food as a result of high cost of production and transportation from where it was produced to the market. It was recommended that, government should monitor marketers from diverting fuel met for our country to other countries and also government should built more refineries to ensure surplus of fuel in circulation.<br/>  TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE                                               <br/>Introduction<br/>Statement of problem<br/>The purpose of the study<br/>Hypothesis<br/>Scope of the study<br/>Background of the study<br/>CHAPTER TWO            <br/>2.0 Review of related literature<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0 Research methodology<br/>3.1 Research Design<br/>3.2 Population of the study<br/>3.3 Sample of the study<br/>3.4 Research instrument<br/>3.5 Method of data collection<br/>3.6 Method of data analysis <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.1    Data Presentation<br/>4.2    Data Analysis<br/>CHAPTER FIVE:        <br/>5.0    Summary and Conclusion<br/>5.1    Recommendation<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/>QUESTIONNAIRE     <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>        The aim of this project is to in-deptly looked into the adverse effect of fuel scarcity on farm produce as a case study in Ovia South East Local Government with a view to make known much to individual and the  government on how much this development has taken it heavy toll on farm produce in both marketing and cultivation as well as how this trend can be put under control.<br/>        Until the early 70’s the main stay of Nigeria economy was Agriculture. Then the country (Nigeria) was fame for her proficiency in the production and exportation of groundnut, oil palm, cocoa beans, pepper, sugar cane, kola nut, bitter kola, cassava and so many other produce. These produce were known to be the only source of income to Nigeria.<br/>        Not until 15th January (1958) when oil was discovered in Nigeria specifically Okolobiri in Bayelsa state, this discovering of oil in commercial quantity brought about radical change in the economy of the nation (Nigeria) all other sectors seemed to have gone into extinction, indeed were abandoned therefore making the country to become totally dependent on crude oil for foreign exchange earnings, not agriculture anymore. But with about 166.2 million people in Nigeria today, it’s certain that man must eat, clothes himself and will also need to satisfy one or more needs from farm products. For agriculturalist to carter for these numbers by producing food for sales, and reserve for the next planting seasons, the practice of producing food in bulk in agriculture must change from mere subsistence farming system to mechanization. The term mechanization means the practice of agriculture by way of using modern machines to facilitate farm works and to maximize product within a short period of time.<br/>        It’s not gainsay to say that modern farm machines depends on fuel to function because our modern global food system is highly oil dependent  even though petroleum is getting higher daily and becoming less and less affordable. And it’s also all true that virtually every operation in agriculture totally depends on machines.<br/>        According to normal .J. (2000) in a book titled “Eating oil” he said that the modern commercial farm miracle that feed all of us and much of the rest of the world is completely depend on the flow, processing and distribution of oil.<br/>        He further added oil refined for gasoline and diesel is critical to run the tractors, combines and other farm vehicles and equipment that plant, spray the herbicides and pesticides and harvest/ transport food and seed, and more  also, it’s all true virtually every operation carry out in nowadays agricultural practice depends on machines beginning from bush clearing, wood feeling, soil plugging, harrowing, fertilizer application, harvesting, application of pesticides, grading of products transportation and so many others areas. If these aforementioned areas suffered west back as a result of fuel scarcity, you will agree with me that at the of the day, nothing will be done to produce food or farm product that will be equal to carter for the upsurge population, or if fuel that is supposed to be available and affordable to power these areas. Earlier mentioned is not easily gotten, or gotten at a very high cost, it’s certain that the  little that will be produce at the end of the day as a result of fuel scarcity will now take it tolls on the selling price. Even the farmers that does rely on his strength to produce food for sale will equally have his own share of fuel scarcity as it will not go down well with the price of food production haven’t spent much money on transportation fro farm to the market is expected that this development will hike up the price of produce supplied to the market and this will in no doubt bring.<br/>        What is scarcity? According to Adams Smith (1989) define scarcity as the limited supply resources which are used to the satisfaction of unlimited want. With this, fuel scarcity can be defined as a limited supply of fuel which is used for the satisfaction of unlimited want.<br/>        According to Lionel Robbins (1990) scarcity as the fundamental economic problems of having seemingly unlimited human want in a world of limited resources. The event of 2nd January, 2012 substantiate the claim that fuel scarcity in no doubt is one of the greatest factor that triggered off the inflation of farm produce/products in the market today, following the pronouncement of the federal government of Nigeria that oil subsidy has been removed thereby bringing the price of fuel of 97 naira a liter as against the former pump price of 65 naira a liter. Few days after subsidy has been removed the price of produce/products skyrocket in which live, chicken that was sold between 1,500-2000, now goes for between 3,000-4,500 live goats that was used to be sold 7,000-8,500 is now sold for between 15,000-18000 while a bag of rice that was formally sold for between 6,000-7,500 now goes for between 12,000-14,000 likewise many other farm produce/products had witnessed tremendous change in price up till now, all that goes up, refuses to come down, and if the prove of fuel keep going up in the name manner, you will find out that almost all farm and agricultural produce/products will be price out of the reach of the common man and if nothing is done to check this situation on ground, certain the common man on the street and the entire society will soon be engulfed in hardship.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>        In recent time, fuel scarcity has become a strong determinant of the price of produce/products of agriculture in the market, with this, it is important that the government should take a proactive measure in tackling fuel scarcity. Also, many people thing that it is because many young people has refuse to go into farming that is solely responsible for the daily increase in the price of food and other agricultural related products but this research seek to find out the adverse effect of fuel scarcity on agricultural products/produce and to suggest possible ways of profiling solutions on it.<br/>        The researcher intend to identify some areas that the government should keenly look into in order to avoid fuel scarcity, such as constant deregulation of fuel products to every state steadily so as to make the product available and affordable for farmer who use fuel for carrying out farming activities, to severely fight against the division of fuel products by fuel marketer and to set out a severe penalty against those who indulge in vandalizing fuel pipe  line, which reduces the target of the nation and to also put in place measure to avoid people working in oil producing company from going on strike.<br/>1.3    RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>Could there be a specific time of adverse effect on agricultural produce/products as a result of fuel scarcity?<br/>Does fuel scarcity affect the production of agricultural produce/products?<br/>Does fuel scarcity reduce the amount of farm produce?<br/>Does increase of transportation of food contributes to increase in selling price of food?<br/>Does modern agricultural practice depend on fuel?<br/>Does fuel scarcity increase the price of food?<br/>1.4    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>The main purpose of this study is to identify the problems associated with the increase in the price of agricultural produce/products in the market, its also met to identify ways to reduces this trend.<br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>        This study or research will be of immense benefit to the government because if there is fuel scarcity. It then means that there will be increase in price of foods produce/products in the agricultural sector.<br/>        The study is hope to provide insight to the government as to why they should stop increasing the price of fuel, when the cost of fuel is low, the cost of production and transportation will also be low and these can lead to low price of agricultural commodities been transported.<br/>        More also, it is hoped that information gathered from this research will propel the government to ensure constant deregulation of fuel, stop increasing fuel, waging war against oil bunker and fuel hoarders, and to explore every means to ensure availability of fuel.<br/>1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Agriculture: Simple refers to the practice of tilling the soil for the purpose of growing crops and the rearing of animals for man’s use.<br/>Scarcity: Means short supply of certain resources relating of demand at a given price.<br/>Mechanization: Mean the practice of agriculture by using modern machines to carry out farm operation to increase production and maximize profit.   <br/>Agricultural Produce: Refers to raw materials gotten from the farm (at it raw stage, not gone through secondary stage).<br/>Agricultural Products: Means agricultural produce that have passed through the raw stage to a second.<br/>Hike: Means increase in cost of something.<br/>Hoard: Means to secretly store a valuable products or money for further use.<br/>  <br/><br/>\n\nTHE ADVERSE EFFECT OF FUEL SCARCITY ON FARM PRODUCE: A CASE STUDY OF OVIA SOUTH WEST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE  <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ADVERSE EFFECT OF FUEL SCARCITY ON FARM PRODUCE: A CASE STUDY OF OVIA SOUTH WEST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE  ", "id": 139}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PROBLEMS OF DEFORESTATION IN OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This research was carried out in order to assess the causes and effects of deforestation in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State. the researcher collected his information by distributing questionnaire to the people living in Ovia North East Local government Area in Edo State and to the Ministry of Agriculture Department of forestry in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State. The information gathered were analyzed and presented in percentages. From the analysis, the researcher was able to identify the following. That it is only the government that can arrest the problem of deforestation. Deforestation can also lead to animal extinction That people resort to illegal felling of trees because employment opportunities are lacking elsewhere. Based on these findings the researcher made recommendations among which are; The government should employ more field staff to combat illegal entry destruction of forest production. These field staff should be made to carry arms while on duty patrol, not only to safeguard themselves but also to instill some fear on timber thieves. The use of village elders in guiding against illegal deforestation should be encouraged. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>Introduction<br/>Background to the study<br/>Statement of the problem<br/>Objective of the study<br/>Research questions<br/>Significance of study<br/>Scope and limitation of the study<br/>Definition of terms<br/>CHAPTER TWO  <br/>Literature review<br/>Definition and origin of deforestation<br/>Review of some factors responsible for deforestation in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State<br/>Effect of deforestation<br/>Proposed solution to deforestation<br/>Man and his environment<br/>CHAPTER THREE        <br/>Methodology<br/>Population<br/>Sampled sampling techniques<br/>Research instrument<br/>Method of data collection<br/>Method of data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR <br/>Data presentation and analysis<br/>Discussion of results<br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>Summary, Conclusion and Recommendation<br/>Summary<br/>Conclusion<br/>Recommendation<br/>REFERENCES     <br/>QUESTIONNAIRES     <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>The year 2011 is ‘The International Year of Forests’. This designation has generated momentum bringing greater attention to the forests worldwide. Forests cover almost a third of the earth’s land surface providing many environmental benefits including a major role in the hydrologic cycle, soil conservation, prevention of climate change and preservation of biodiversity (Sheram, 1993). Forest resources can provide long-term national economic benefits. For example, at least 145 countries of the world are currently involved in wood production (Anon., 1994a). Sufficient evidence is available that the whole world is facing an environmental crisis on account of heavy deforestation. For years remorseless destruction of forests has been going on and we have not been able to comprehend the dimension until recently. Nobody knows exactly how much of the world’s rainforests have already been destroyed and continue to be razed each year. Data is often imprecise and subject to differing interpretations. However, it is obvious that the area of tropical rainforest is diminishing and the rate of tropical rain forest destruction is escalating worldwide, despite<br/>increased environmental activism and awareness.<br/>Deforestation is the conversion of forest to an alternative permanent non-forested land use such as agriculture, grazing or urban development (van Kooten and Bulte, 2000). Deforestation is primarily a concern for the developing countries of the tropics (Myers, 1994) as it is shrinking areas of the tropical forests (Barraclough and Ghimire, 2000) causing loss of biodiversity and enhancing the greenhouse effect (Angelsen et al., 1999). FAO considers a plantation of trees established primarily for timber production to be forest and therefore does not classify natural forest conversion to plantation as deforestation (but still records it as a loss of natural forests). However, FAO does not consider tree plantations that provide non-timber products to be forest although they do classify rubber plantations as forest. Forest degradation occurs when the ecosystem functions of the forest are degraded but where the area remains forested rather cleared (Anon., 2010). Thirty per cent of the earth’s land area or about 3.9 billion hectares is covered by forests. It was estimated that the original forest cover was approximately six billion hectares (Bryant et al., 1997). The Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, the United States of America and China were the most forest rich countries accounting to 53 per cent of the total forest area of the globe. Another 64 countries having a combined population of two billions was reported to have forest on less than ten per cent of their total land area and unfortunately ten of these countries have no forest at all. Among these countries 16 are such which had relatively substantial forest areas of more 1than one million hectares each and three of these countries namely Chad, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Mongolia each had more than ten million hectares of forest. The forest area remained fairly stable in North and Central America while it expanded in Europe during the past decade. Asian continent especially in India and China due to their large scale afforestation programme in the last decade registered a net gain in forest area. Conversely the South America, Africa and Oceania had registered the net annual loss of forest area (Anon., 2010; 2011a).<br/>The forest is a good source of food, income, ecological resources, social and cultural features, as well as physical facilities like power and building materials. Other functions of the forest are prevention of erosion, as well as the provision of essential habitat for wildlife to survive. Hence, the necessity to conserve the forest and the biodiversity therein. In addition to conserving biological and cultural diversity, it is now widely recognised that many protected areas also have important social and economic functions. These include protecting watersheds, soil and coastlines, providing natural products for use on a sustainable basis, and supporting tourism and recreation (Lee et. al, 2003). Studies in China have also confirmed that medical herb production is a big business and that the suppliers have chosen to invest in forest protection and reforestation in order to guarantee future supplies (see Chen, 1983 and Hou, 1994 for greater details).<br/>In spite of the multi-various usefulness of the forest resources, rapid population growth and changes in land uses have put the forest resources under pressure. For instance, Poore 1989 opined that majority of logging operations in tropical countries are considered unsuitable and damaging. The widespred failure of forest governamnce – characterized by illegal logging, associated illegal trade, and corruption-directly undermines sustainable economic growth, equitable development, and environmental conservation. It puts at risk poor and forest-dependent populations, which rely on timber and non-timber forest products; undermines responsible forest enterprises by distorting timber and reducing profitability; and results in a loss of govenrment revenue that could be invested in sustainable forest management or general economic development (World Bank, 2006). The major determinants of deforestation are the available natural resources in an area, how the resources are being used, traditional beliefs and myths, conflicts in the use of resources, population pressure, vis-a-vis the problem of pollution (soils, air or water). According to Meyer and Turner (2009), societies have profoundly altered their environments in the pursuit of wealth and power have been punished by environmental catastrophes (natural and man-induced). They opined further that world forest area has been reduced by some 20 percent and a large area of land converted from its original vegetation cover to cropping. The major cause of deforestation are increasing demand for housing and infrastructural facilities, crop and timber export, poor agricultural practices cutting of fuel wood for urban areas, head loading (cutting of fuel wood for sale), forest fires, logging, and overharvesting. Other causes are overgrazing, road construction, dam construction, as well as careless exploitation of forest resources. A large empirical literature exists on the consequences of deforestation (see Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994; Western, 1999; Johnston, 1989; Bruijnzeel, 2004; and Brookfield, 1992). Deforestation is responsible for damage to habitate, biodiversity loss and aridity, extinction of rare species of plants and animals, climate change, environmental destruction and the subsequent damage to the sensitive living balance of the ecosystem. Also, empirical studies have confirmed that if we cannot look after the forest they will soon disapper (see Brockington, 2007; Hyde and Sedjo, 1992; Waston et al, 1998; Colin, 2001 and Khare et al, 2000). The threat to timber resources is being combated in most countries by vigorous afforestation. In addition, many have adopted stringent forestry laws, as in Norway and Sweden, to prevent waste, and elsewhere, experiments are taking place to find alternative materials for making paper (Whynne-Hammond, 1979).<br/>Other strategies of combating deforestation are the use of alternative sources of energy other than fuel and charcoal, sustainable agricultural practices rather than slash and burn method of farming, land management, avoidance of indiscriminate bush burning, as well as promulgation and enforcement of environmental laws and forest policies. Likewise, mitigating deforestation entails forest conservation, protection of endangered species, as well as the promotion of ecotourism. These are the measures of achieving sustainable development.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>The indiscriminate felling of trees in our forest and the attitude of the people in Oredo Local Government Area, Edo State towards our forest has necessitated a massive scale and the people seem to be unaware of its consequences. This study therefore is geared towards finding solutions to some of the problems of deforestation. This study intends to find out the following problems;<br/>Do deforestation lead to flooding<br/>What are the causes of deforestation in Oredo Local Government Area, Edo State?<br/>Is deforestation cause by lack of proper management of forest?<br/>What are the measures being made to control deforestation?  <br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>The aims of the study are;<br/>To identify the causes of deforestation in Oredo Local Government Area.<br/>To identify the problems created by deforestation in Ovia North East Local Government Area.<br/>To assess the attitude of people of Ovia North East Local Government Area towards the existing forest.<br/>To assess the efforts made by the government to reduce the problems of deforestation. <br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>1.   Does deforestation cause flooding?<br/>2.   Does expansion of farmland lead to deforestation?<br/>3.   Does overgrazing lead to deforestation?<br/>Does urbanization/industrialization lead to deforestation?<br/>Does Overpopulation and poverty lead to deforestation?<br/>6.   Does deforestation lead to climate change?<br/>Does deforestation lead to decreased biodiversity, habitat loss and conflicts?<br/>Does deforestation have any social consequences on the people?<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>The fact that our forest is one of the beauties of nature and an effect means of controlling erosion, man has in either consciously or unconsciously and indiscriminately too. If no efforts are made to guard this, the younger generation may find it very difficult to know what a natural forest look like. They may also be denied of good forest produce for their economic needs and uses. Hence the effort being made by the government in preserving and consolidating the forest in form forest resources is highly impressive.<br/>The study is of importance in that it will enlighten the leaders and the public of our obligation of the forest. To point out the importance of forest to guide against erosion. It will also aid government and forestry officials on how to protect our forest.<br/>The study is of immense importance of the people of Oredo Local Government Area in the sense that to clearly preserve the forest and also on how to plant trees to check erosion.   <br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY:<br/>The study is set out to determine the causes and effect of deforestation in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State. Therefore, the study is restricted to both men and women in the Local Government Area of Study. Respondents include students, teachers, civil servants, youths, and drivers.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Deforestation <br/>Urbanization<br/>Industrialization <br/>Infrastructure<br/><br/>\n\nPROBLEMS OF DEFORESTATION IN OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS OF DEFORESTATION IN OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE", "id": 140}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CAUSES OF LOW PRODUCTION OF RUBBER IN EDO STATE: A CASE STUDY OF IKPOBA OKHA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, EDO STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This research study was undertaken with a view to assessing the veracity of rubber production in Ikpoba Okha LGA, Edo State. Several factors were identified as causes of this trend; such as lack of capital, use of old plantations, unavailability of land, price of latex etc. a questionnaires approach was used to obtain data from the farmers in Ikpoba Okha LGA of Edo State. This was subjected to analysis based on stipulated hypothesis drawn from the questionnaires. The result of this analysis showed that lack of capital was not responsible for low production of rubber in Ikpoba Okha LGA. Also, market prices of rubber products had no effect on low rubber production. However, government policies were identified as a cause of low production of rubber in Ikpoba Okha LGA. Therefore, the government should promulgate policies that will encourage rubber production in Ikpoba Okha LGA and Nigeria. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>Chapter One      <br/>1.1        Introduction<br/>1.2        Background of study<br/>1.3        Purpose of study<br/>1.4        Research questions<br/>1.5        Hypothesis<br/>1.6        Significance of the study<br/>Chapter Two      <br/>2.1        Literature review<br/>2.2        Plant profile<br/>2.3        Natural rubber production<br/>2.4        Rubber production trend in Nigeria<br/>2.5        Nigeria natural rubber industry<br/>2.6        Why Nigeria should rehabilitate<br/>2.7        Rubber plantation<br/>Chapter Three   <br/>Method of study<br/>3.1        Research design<br/>3.2        Population of study<br/>3.3        Sample and sampling procedure<br/>3.4        Instrumentation<br/>3.5        Hypothesis<br/>3.6        Validity and reliability of instruments<br/>3.7        Administration of instruments<br/>3.8        Method of data analysis<br/>Chapter Four     <br/>Presentation of data analysis and discussion of results<br/>4.1        Test of hypothesis<br/>Chapter Five      <br/>5.1        Summary of Findings, Conclusion and Recommendation  <br/>5.2        Conclusion<br/>5.3        Recommendation<br/>References        <br/>Questionnaires <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>Rubber plant (Hevea Brasiliensis) was introduced from Brazil to Nigeria around 1895. It is a variety of plant of the genus Hevea (euphorbiaceae) family, native to Brazil. It commonly known as the rubber tree rubber is an important cash crop which contributed sustainably to the Nigerian economy prior to the oil boom. (Aghimien, 1997).<br/>        In recent years, there has been a drastic reduction in rubber production in Nigeria. A total of 207,500 which represented 86.0% of the country’s land area under rubber cultivation on small holdings in 1966, declined to 147,200 hectares in 1980. Recent field surveys showed that more than two thousand of the small holding has been lost to other crop.<br/>        Presently, rubber production in Nigeria has decreased and the rubber industries have continued to fold-up (Agra, 1986).     <br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>Natural rubber performed three main functions in the Nigerian economy; firstly it provided some of the foreign exchange and placed Nigeria in the world map as an exporter of rubber products. Lastly it provided employment for a sizeable segment of the rural populace.

This meant field cultivation. This is not a complete definition of agriculture since agriculture also has to do with animal production. Agriculture can therefore be defined as the art and science of cultivating the soil, producing livestock, preparing livestock feeds, processing crops and livestock products for man; and the process of selling excess crops and livestock. Or agriculture may also mean just the production of crops, rearing of animals and the general management of soil.<br/>        As men advanced from the hunting and gathering stage, they developed the art of cultivating certain plants and domesticating certain animals. This was the beginning of settled life, and people began to group themselves in villages. They made crude implements and learned to provide enough foods for the family. This practice is found today in every isolated areas where communication has been limited, the people have not been exposed to modern ways of farming, and surplus capital for investment is not available. Some farmers farm exclusively in specific domestic crops such as in west Africa like yam, cassava, maize, cocoyam etc. the practice involves the cultivation of small pieces of land under many crops.<br/>        Several questions have been raised in regards to this trend. It is therefore expedient to understand the problems affecting small scale farming in the area, which is a major emphasis of this project work. It tends to analyze these factors and suggest adequate measures and solutions in solving these problems. The history of the development of the human race is closely related to that of agricultural development. In his quest for food and shelter, man has adopted many agricultural practices through the ages as his technical skills and material resources grew. The four major types are;- hunting and gathering, pure subsistence agriculture; mixed subsistence with some cash crop production; and pure commercial agriculture. But between these main divisions are many transition stages, and different stages of economic development of local populations.<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS<br/>        The need for this study is necessitated by the fact that there are problems affecting small scale farming among the local farmers in my local government area. The positive and negative effects of these problems are therefore the concern of investigation.<br/>1.3 RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>Some questions to be tackled in the course of this study have been raised as follows:-<br/>1.   Does the land tenure system affect small scale farmers in Ovia North East Local Government Area?<br/>2.   Does the size of useful land in the area affect the small scale farmers in Ovia North East Local Government Area?<br/>3.   Does the religious beliefs affect the small scale farmers’ production in the area?<br/>4.   The cultivation practices affect the small scale farmers in the area?<br/>5.   What are the prospects and possible solutions to the problems?<br/>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study is designed to help the farmers in Ovia North East Local Government Area to improve their efforts on ways of increasing small scale production of farmers. It serves as a guide to extension of workers in charge of small scale production in Ike South and other areas on how to assist farmers. The study is hoped to motivate the farmers to go into large/commercial production in the area. Also, this study will serve as a resource material for any student that will be interested in. Finally, it serves as encouragement to those farmers in the study who takes small scale production as their last hope in life to pay more to small scale production by giving them the necessary assistance.<br/>1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study is focused on the problems of small scale farming in Ovia North East Local Government Area, which is one of the notable areas of small scale farming production in Delta State. For the purpose of this work, Ovia North East Local Government Area was used as a case study. The area is very large and consists of about twenty villages with an average population of two million people and majority of them are small scale farmers.<br/>1.6 DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Topography: This is the physical structure of land, within an area.<br/>Population: This is the total number of people living in an area.<br/>NITR: (National Institute for Trypanosomiasis Research) Kaduna, this body is set up by the federal government to carryout research on animal diseases and sicknesses.<br/><br/>\n\nPROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF SMALL SCALE FARMING IN OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF DELTA STATE, NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF SMALL SCALE FARMING IN OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF DELTA STATE, NIGERIA", "id": 142}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECT OF BUSH BURNING ON AGRICULTURAL LAND: CASE STUDY OF OKADA IN OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Bush burning removes the natural vegetation cover that protects the soil surface. This exposes the land to the effects of wind and water erosion. It should however noted that burning on agricultural lands in Okada in Ovia North East Local Government Area attention was focused on the merit and demerit of burning agricultural land in chapter five. At the later part of this chapter, useful suggestions and recommendations were given on how to carryout burning by trying to avoid bad effects on burning agricultural lands in Okada in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State. However these suggestions and recommendations are mainly on the part of the governments which are as follows: <br/>The government should help in prohibition of bush burning careless use of fire by enlightening the farmers and the public. <br/>The government is to ensure that there are fires services in the rural area are well equipped with materials to fight against the outbreak of fire especially in the forest reserves. The government should provide for some merchandised equipment to the local farmers to hire for use at a cheap rate in order to minimize the act of burning agricultural lands by local farmers. The government should also provide fertilizer to replenish lost nutrients during burning.    <br/>     TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE   <br/>Background of the study<br/>Statement of the problem<br/>Research questions<br/>Purpose of the study<br/>Significance of the study<br/>Scope of the study<br/>Limitation of the study<br/>Definition of terms<br/>CHAPTER TWO  <br/>Historical Literature review<br/>CHAPTER THREE         <br/>Research methodology<br/>Research design<br/>Population of the study<br/>Research instrument<br/>Data collection<br/>Statistical techniques<br/>CHAPTER FOUR <br/>Data presentation and interpretation of result<br/>CHAPTER FIVE  <br/>Summary, conclusion and recommendation<br/>REFERENCES               <br/>QUESTIONNAIRE       <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>        Burning with reference to land cultivation is a method of land preparation in Edo State. In general and in Okada in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State in particular bush burning generally is the method of removing the natural vegetable from the surface of the soil by setting fire on debris. Bush burning causes serious damage to trees and crops, its effect of public concern which should not be for farmer alone and should be handled with seriousness, practice of burning of fire could also lead to accidental burning of his land and other properties at his disposal, this ideals of burning his farm came to him with the food that fire has left behind after roasting his food, fire spread and destroyed all that was left behind in the environment. <br/>Burning the farmland for the cultivation of crops has a remarkable effect on the soil fertility. During burning process some nutrients that are highly needed by the plants are lost out in form of gasses such nutrient include phosphorous, nitrogen and sulphur. The ash which is the principle products of burnt material although rich in phosphorous, nitrogen and potassium can be easily washed away by rain. The heat produced during burning creates an unfavourable condition for activities of the soil organism such as earthworms, bacteria etc.       <br/>He also found out the seed of fruits he has eaten and thrown off has grown in his burnt land and as a result of this included burning in his farm system. The practice of burning can be traced back of about 2000 years ago, it was discovered that most of the vegetation debris after clearing, especially on a large scale farming and small scale farms. Apart from burning the land for cultivation purpose animals are also trapped.  <br/>1.2    PURPOSE OF STUDY <br/>Bush burning has become part and parcel of the activities of farmers in this area. The negative effects are not considered at all. Hence it is important to highlight these for the farmers to experience and observe the dangerous effects of bush burning as it affect the soil as a whole.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>Since bush burning is the major lands preparation practice, it is important to study the effect of bush burning on agricultural lands and also to carryout investigation on how far bush burning has affected agricultural land in Okada in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State and possibly find alternative measure to avoid bush burning.    <br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>The scope of this project is limited to Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State, some important towns and villages in Ovia North East Local Government Area such as Ekiadolor Town, Evboneka, Ughoton etc where farming operation is carried extensively and that burning issues form the scope of my study. This is due to some constraints  <br/>1.5       AIMS AND OBJECTIVES <br/>This aims and objective of this project are:<br/>1.           To analyze the effect of burning on economic tree crops<br/>2.           To analyze some of the effect of bush burning on different soil structures<br/>3.           To analyze the effect of bush burning in relationship to land in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State. <br/>4.           To analyze some of the effect of burning on crop plants.<br/>5.           To identify the effect of bush burning on agricultural land in Ovia North East Local Government of Edo State.<br/>6.           To analyze the use of bush burning as a weed control measure or method.<br/>1.6       STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS <br/>Burning is a major problem with agricultural land in our contemporary society especially Okada in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State.

In carrying out this study, the respondents were made up to farmers. A total sample size of fifty respondents were interviewed with the aid of questionnaire, the findings were analyzed and discussed the result of the study revealed that the problems are inadequate land, low level of soil fertility inadequate finance, non-adoption of modern farming techniques, inadequate storage facilities, poor marketing and pricing,. The prospect are the farmers already use improved varieties for planting and are accepting ideas from the extension agent, the potential for more prospect exist when solution are found for the above problems. Due to the usefulness of maize as one of the staple food and its industrial uses, it should not be allowed to remain at the present level of production. Therefore, effort should be geared towards solving the problems to make maize production encouraging and interesting to the farmers. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE   <br/>Introduction<br/>Background of the study<br/>Statement of the problem<br/>Purpose of the study<br/>Basic assumption<br/>Hypothesis<br/>Significance of the study<br/>Limitation of the study<br/>Definition of terms<br/>CHAPTER TWO  <br/>Literature Review<br/>CHAPTER THREE         <br/>Research design<br/>Population of the study<br/>Sample of the study<br/>Sampling techniques adopted<br/>Validation of instrument<br/>Method of data collection<br/>Method of data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR <br/>Presentation of data and discussion of results<br/>CHAPTER FIVE  <br/>Summary, Conclusion, and Recommendations<br/>REFERENCES     <br/>QUESTIONNAIRES     <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>One of the major tasks facing Nigerian agriculture is the provision of an adequate and well-stable food supply to meet the requirements of a growing population. One of such food crops is maize. The significance of maize to the modern society is first and foremost clearly reflected in the importance of the crop in the diet of man and animals throughout the world (Onwueme and Sinha, 1991).<br/>Abubakar (1999), ranked maize as the third most important cereal after wheat and rice globally. In Nigeria, maize is produced across the country right from the mangrove region in the south to the Sahel Savannah in the North (Edache, 1999; Tauna, 1999; Olukosi and Raphael, 1997). Maize production in Nigeria has also been on the increase both in terms of hectarage and production. A seven-fold increase in production occurred between 1984 and 1994. Similarly production increased from 6,515,000.0 to 7,019,500.0 tonnes (7.75%) between 1999 and 2003 respectively (CBN Annual Report 2003). In recent years however, production of maize in Nigeria has been declining due to low input usage. For example, in 2000 production was 6491MT as compared to 6515MT in 1999. Rapid population growth and increased pressure on land have led to a reduction in fallow periods to below the threshold needed for sustainability (FAO, 1985; Conways, 1997). To compound the situation, essential inputs such as fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides were often scarce and costly at a time when economic reforms have compelled reductions in farm inputs subsidies.<br/>Maize is a heavy feeder that requires sustainable amount of nutrients uptake. In the Savannah region, the enormous potentials for maize production can be realised only with the use of high levels of fertilizer, improved seeds, hectarage expansion and adequate weed control. With adequate supply of these inputs and the provision of adequate storage facilities, the rapid expansion of maize could be sustained. Since the 1970s, the federal government made it a policy to increase the agricultural production through the increased use of fertilizer. This led to the decision by the Federal Government to establish local fertilizer plants as against relying entirely on fertilizer importation as the case was prior to 1976. The effectiveness and sustainability of these plans varies with government. For maize farmers, access to fertilizer is an important input considered in the production decision. This have direct effect on the level of productivity, thus increased productivity contributed to economic development and policies for effective mobilization of the resources for transforming self-sufficient oriented maize farmers to commercial and market oriented agriculture (Nyako, 1999).<br/>The total area under maize cropping in Nigeria was estimated to be 3.0 million hectare (Lamarde, 1994). Traditionally, production ranged from 0.4 – 1.7 tonnes per hectare, but with improved methods and improved inputs, the yield could be up to 4 – 5 tonnes per hectare (Lamarde, 1994). Maize is the most important cereal in Nigeria and is grown either as a vegetable at the backyard or on the farm (Kehinde, 1997). Throughout Nigeria, the selling of roasted and boiled maize is a thriving business that provides employment for hundreds of thousand of young girls and women. Though 3 the nature of employment is part time and seasonal, it nonetheless provides an important source of livelihood for the hawkers. Maize is also widely processed into a variety of food drinks such as pap and “Kunu”. In addition, maize is used in making cakes such as ‘masa’. However, the predominant use of maize in Northern Nigeria is for making ‘tuwo’. It is also the main source of energy in livestock and poultry feeds. The growing plant can be cut and made into silage or hay for the feeding of cattle and other ruminants. Thus, maize production gives employment to people and provides food and drinks for man and feeds for poultry and livestock.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The year 2000 was set as a target date for the attainment of food self sufficiency by all African countries in the action plan agreed upon in Lagos, Nigeria (Salih, 1994). However, roughly 5 years after the deadline, little or nothing had been achieved. This failure is evident by the excess capacity in the agro industrial sector; rapid increase in food prices and the gradual resort to food importation among others. Rapid growth in agriculture is essential for broad based economic growth, but acceleration in agricultural growth requires sound use of science and technology embodied in improved seed, fertilizer, agrochemical and other agronomic practices. However without an efficient and cost effective supply of these inputs at the farm gate, science based growth in agricultural productivity cannot be achieved. Furthermore, with the phased withdrawal of subsidies and privatisation, the input markets remained underdeveloped and fragmented and farmers do not receive good quality inputs and pay unreasonable high prices despite the fact that the private sector in Nigeria has a potential to supply agricultural inputs in a cost effective manner (IFDC, 2001). One of the problems cited as constraining the production of maize in Nigeria is stagnant production technology among Nigerian farming community, majority of who are small-scale producers. The reason for this could be attributed to resource productivity as studies have confirmed inefficiency in resource utilisation in both food and cash crops in Nigeria (Olagoke, 1999 and Olayide, 1979). Furthermore, the extent to which inputs supply and productivity relates to a shortfall in food demand and supply in Nigeria is not clearly understood. At the same time, the impact of factors such as the policy environment, and the availability of markets for the disposal of farm outputs is not often considered despite the fact that such factors make farmers to work harder and thus, produce higher outputs. This study attempts to analyse the productivity of agricultural inputs in food crop production by taking the maize crop as a case study.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1. What are the socio economic characteristics of maize farmers in Kaduna State? 2. What are the inputs – outputs levels in maize production?<br/>3. What are the costs and returns in maize production?<br/>4. To what extent do the prices of Agricultural inputs affect Maize output?<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The general objective of this study was to assess the effects of inputs as well as the impact of input prices on maize production in Kaduna State, Nigeria. The specific objectives were to:-<br/>1. Describe the socio-economic characteristics of maize farmers in Kaduna state.<br/>2. Estimate the inputs-output levels in maize production in Kaduna state.<br/>3. Determine the costs and returns and hence profitability of maize production in Kaduna State.<br/>4. Determine the effects of input prices on maize production in Kaduna state.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>Policy makers have been making frantic efforts to attract people into farming. This study is expected to provide valuable benchmark information to these new entrants on resource productivity and profitability in maize production so as to enable them consider its production as a viable option. As for farmers who are already cultivating the crop, the study will go a long way in providing information on ways of boosting production. In order to increase the production of maize, sound micro and macroeconomic farm policies are needed. These require prior to their formulation, an understanding of the input prices and output relationship in maize production. This will obviously go a long way in generating employment opportunities for thousands of Nigerians, improve the food security status of Nigerians and most importantly, improve export and generate additional foreign exchange for the country.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The scope of study is limited to Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area in Edo State and the production of maize.<br/><br/>\n\nPROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF MAIZ PRODUCTION IN IKPOBA OKHA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF MAIZ PRODUCTION IN IKPOBA OKHA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE ", "id": 144}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>APPRAISAL OF THE PROBLEMS FACED BY SMALL FARM HOLDERS IN ACCESSING LOAN FACILITIES: <br/>A CASE STUDY OF OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This work is designed to examine the problems faced by small farm holders in accessing loan facilities in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State.

Agriculture is very important to the economy of most developing countries of the world and because of this, a supply of adequate finance is essential for national well-being. Since agriculture is the backbone of Nigeria economy providing employment to about 70% of its population yet this important sector has suffered neglect since the oil boom days. Agriculture has totally declined since the early 1970s Nigeria  export crops  such as groundnut, oil palm and cocoa have evaluate disappeared and the country is a net importer of food crops. Agriculture recorded growth rate in 1975 at about 2.6% while the population grew at about 70% compared to 57.7% in 1993. The small scale farmers according to the National Agricultural Policy Documents of Nigeria (NAPDN) constitute over 90% of the food and fiber requirement of Nigeria on the other hand large scale farmers produce has more than 1% of farm output in Nigeria but tend to have greater access to farmer inputs including farm credit or loan.      <br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS <br/>This study is to investigate and analyze the problems associated with obtaining credit for financing agricultural production in Edo State. it would be seen that many problems arise mostly are problems encounter by the farmers in the area.<br/>The inability of the farmers to meet up with the collateral security  required by the commercial bank is a major problem hindering agricultural sector., this is as a result of farmers to deposit the collateral security before obtaining credit for agricultural development.<br/>High interest rate is another factor that discourage farmers from obtaining credit in most commercial banks, payment of interest involve when fund is borrowed.<br/>The low educational background of the farmers also constitutes hindrance in obtaining agricultural credit.<br/>The bureaucratic process involved in the process of obtaining credit or loans for agricultural purpose have not being encourage on the part of the farmers.<br/>Credit facilities are not easily accessible to small farm holders. It is on this note that the researcher intends to identify some of the hindering factors in order to proffer solution.    <br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>The main purpose of this study is to find the major problems of obtaining credit or loan for financing agricultural production in Nigeria with particular reference to Edo State. the objective of the study are;<br/>To identify the problem militating against adequate financing of agriculture.<br/>To enumerate and analyze the agricultural credit granted to farmers in recent years<br/>To know how much the commercial banks have helped in financing agriculture.<br/>To look at how agriculture has developed in Edo State.<br/>To create awareness of the problem posted by agricultural financing inadequacies.<br/>To investigate how these problems can be tackled.   <br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>This research study will be important to that future researcher in the economy and agricultural science who would like to use it as reference materials or for further investigation.<br/>The study is to create awareness to farmers in Edo State, the reasons of low agricultural production and also to bring to the notice of the general public loans for financing agricultural production in the locality.<br/>It will form a good basis to the government for the formulation of policies. To serve as encouragement to those farmers in the area of study.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>Some questions to be tackled in the course of this study has been rise as follows;<br/>Is collateral security a problem of obtaining credit from commercial banks?<br/>Does high interest rate increase the incidence of bad debts?<br/>Does educational background hinder the potentials of obtaining credit?<br/>Is a credit facility accessible for small farm holders? <br/>Does bureaucratic process pose a lots of problem in obtaining loans to farmers?<br/>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>This study is aimed at providing detailed knowledge and understanding of the operation, function and to determine the problems of obtaining loans for financing agricultural production in Edo State through the federal Government Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme (FGACGS) found since 1977 with the view of providing useful suggestion to ease the problem of agricultural development in Nigeria, it is directed towards the application of problems obtained for financing agriculture view of this more emphasis will be placed on the success of credit facilities lending procedure as a criteria of measurement. The performance of the commercial banks in this regard will be assessed by using the present farmer’s areas to the agricultural credit facilities as well as the hindrance which the small farm holders face in obtaining loans from financial institutions.      <br/>1.8    DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Credit:  This is the process of obtaining control over the use of money, goods and services with promise to repay at a future date.<br/>Agriculture Finance: This means ways and means by which a farmer obtain all the necessary fund required in order to carryout agricultural production.<br/>Interest: This means the price paid for the use of borrowed money and is usually expressed as a present on annual basis.<br/>Collateral: This means anything offered as a promise of loan repayment to be given to a lender in case of non-payment.<br/>  <br/><br/>\n\nAPPRAISAL OF THE PROBLEMS FACED BY SMALL FARM HOLDERS IN ACCESSING LOAN FACILITIES:  A CASE STUDY OF OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " APPRAISAL OF THE PROBLEMS FACED BY SMALL FARM HOLDERS IN ACCESSING LOAN FACILITIES:  A CASE STUDY OF OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE", "id": 145}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PROBLEMS OF YAM PRODUCTION IN OUR COMMUNITY<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Declining productivity of yam in Nigeria highlighted the need for a study to determine both the effect of fertilization on yam (Dioscorea spp.) yield and biomass production, as well as the best agronomic management options available for stabilizing yam productivity, via the modeling of yam growth and development.

Yam plays important roles in the nutritional, social, cultural, and economic life of the people in the yam belt of Africa. Nutritionally, yam is a major staple providing food for millions of people in the world. It is eaten in different forms as fufu, boiled, fried, and roasted (Aidoo, 2009). In Ghana, yam constitutes about 13% of household food budget in urban centers (Aidoo, Ohene-Yankyera, Marfo and Blaise, 2009). Economically, yam is important in the local commerce in West Africa and accounts for about 32% of farm income (Chukwu and Ikwelle, 2000). The crop serves as a major source of foreign exchange earnings and is used as raw materials for starch industries and pharmaceutical companies (Amanze, Agbo, Eke-Okoro and Njoku, 2011). As the leading exporter of yam in the world, yam exports contribute significant foreign exchange earnings to the Ghanaian economy (Ohene-Yankyera, Aidoo and Ohenewa-Tawiah, 2011).<br/>        The entire production, processing and marketing chain of yam offers vast employment opportunities for millions of people. The supply of yam offers prospects for income generation due to the number of people involved and the value attached to it. The marketing system, which affects the prices received by farmers and those paid by buyers, has a profound impact on sustainable food security (FAO, 2003).<br/>        Yams are members of the genus Dioscorea and belong to the family Dioscoreaceae. Yams are dioecious plants and produce tubers and bulbils (aerial tubers) of economic importance. The stems are viny, leaves are cordate or ovate, tubers mostly cylindrical and rich in<br/>carbohydrate which make them suitable to be used as food (Mandal,2003). Tuber development is an evolutionary adaptation to a dry season, when leafy shoots die back and tubers become dormant (Purseglove,2002). During the evolution of the edible Dioscoreas, the thickening and lobbing of the ancestral rhizome gave way to a well developed tuber system (Burkill,2000). In most species, they are renewed and produced annually, while in others they are perennial. As crops, yams are harvested every season and replanted using tuber pieces to regenerate the plant. Unlike other tropical root and tuber crop species, once harvested, yams can be stored for 4-6 months in ambient tropical conditions without significant deterioration of their nutritional properties. Tubers are also often dried and later milled into flour for reconstituting as a stiff paste (fufu), which is highly appreciated in West<br/>Africa.<br/>The family Dioscoreaceae comprises six genera but the genus Dioscorea is the major one. About 600 species of Dioscorea have been identified, among which 12 species are edible (Coursey,2006). Within this genus, edible and marketable species are: Dioscorea rotundata (white yam or Guinea yam), Dioscorea alata (greater yam or water yam), Dioscorea esculenta (lesser yam or Asiatic yam), Dioscorea bulbifera (aerial yam or potato yam) and Dioscorea cayenensis (yellow yam) which produces edible tubers and bulbils (aerial tubers located in the axils of leaves).<br/>Some Dioscorea species, like floribunda and composite, are appreciated due to their high tuber content of steroidal saponins, being used in the manufacturing of oral contraceptives, sex hormones and cortisone (Purseglove,2002; Applezweig,2007). The drug yams are still essentially wild species (Coursey,2006). The English term “yam” is most likely derived from the Portuguese word, ynhame, found in early documents, itself being the transcription of niam, the word used in the Malinke language spoken widely through the Guineas, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast (Coursey, 2006).<br/>        Yams means many things to most people. To the farmers it is edible root tuber crop, which generate his income for the up-keep of his family and himself. It has helped raised the standard of living over the years. The oxford dictionary describe yam as a starch tuberous root largely replacing potato as a staple food in many tropical and sub-tropical countries of the world. Yam belongs to the botanical genes discovered, but there are very many species of great importance in West Africa.<br/>The white yam (Discoreal rotonlata) <br/>The water yam (Discoreal alata)<br/>The yellow yam (discoreal caganesis)<br/>Lesser yam (D. bulbfery)<br/>Trifoliate or three leave yam (D. dumetorum)<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>        Falling yam productivity has fuelled calls for increased research activities in yam – a crop that serves as staple food to millions of people in Africa. There are great differences in yield between individual countries (FAO, 2007), but for all countries, the average yield level is far below the potential one, which has been estimated (Gurnah,1974; Martin,1972) at 15-20 t for dry tubers ha-1 yr-1 (equivalent to 60-75 t ha-1 yr-1 on a fresh weight basis). One major constraint highlighted for its contribution to declining yam productivity is soil fertility degradation, due to nutrient depletion by leaching, and erosion, and the loss of organic matter from most soils in the savannah zone of Edo State. With increasing demographic pressure, land use intensity and reduced forest cover, suitable land for yam cultivation becomes gradually scarcer (Carsky et al., 2001). In Edo State, farmers practice slash-and-burn agriculture for yam production, which places great pressure on scarce virgin and fallow land resources. Natural fallow, crop rotation with grain legumes, and mineral fertilizer are the main soil fertility management strategies practiced here. However, most farmers do not use fertilizers and manures to any appreciable extent on yams.<br/>The edible yams are root crop groom on a field scale for the tubers. They provide staple carbohydrate food in the yam zone of west Africa, where daily consumption is 0.5, 1.0kg yam need a great deal of labour for their cultivation and to prepare them for food and they are usually expensive to buy for normal human consumption, the field or peal, sometimes after partial boiling in west Africa, they are usually eaten as pounded yam which is prepared by pealing cut up yam and boil before pounding them in a wooden mortal to produce a glutinous dough (pounded yam).<br/>Therefore, this study sought to obtain more quantitative information on the problem of yam production and to derive growth parameters that could further be used for modeling of yam growth.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTION  <br/>1.           Does lack of storage facilities affect yam production?<br/>2.           Do the uncertainties of market price affect yam production in Edo State?<br/>3.           Does lack of good road affect the production of yam in Edo State?<br/>4.           Is consumer taste a problem facing the farming or production of yam in Edo State?<br/>5.           Can the nature of the scarce of supply of yam tuber a problem of producing of yam?<br/>6.           Is nutritional value a problem facing the production of yam tuber?<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>        Yam production in Edo State have hither to received security attention from research workers and students, the main reason for this is that people are ignorant at the importance of yam production in the state.<br/>        One of the present day problems of yam production in Edo state has not been encouraging; the people regard the production of yam in the state as fit for only poor and the illiterate. Illiteracy is regarded as a passport to shirt and tie job in town.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>        Yam is a notable for its importance in human life.<br/>        To ensure it’s confined existence with better performance<br/>To ensure the awareness of people to the need for development of a positive attitude towards the production of yam in Oredo Local Government of Edo State.<br/>To improve the quantity and quality of yam production in our local government area of Edo State.<br/>To make people understand better effective and efficient modern methods of producing yam in the state.<br/>To find out why yam is not cultivated in lorry scale by the farmer in Edo State.<br/>To identify the different condition favourable for yam production in Edo State.<br/>The existence of yam is threatened by cassava production if care is not taking the survival of yam doubtfully.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>        This product works is centered on the production of yam in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>        The problems associated with yam production in Edo State and ways of finding solution to the problem encountered by the farmers.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>        This research of work or project should be centered on definition on the problems and prospect of yam production in Edo State. However, due to the complex nature of the villages in Edo State, some selected villages in the state are Edogbo Oregbani and Asoro.  <br/><br/>\n\nPROBLEMS OF YAM PRODUCTION IN OUR COMMUNITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS OF YAM PRODUCTION IN OUR COMMUNITY", "id": 146}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>APPRAISAL OF THE PROBLEMS FACED BY SMALL FARM HOLDERS IN ACCESSING LOAN FACILITIES: <br/>A CASE STUDY OF OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This work is designed to examine the problems faced by small farm holders in accessing loan facilities in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State.

Since agriculture is the back-bone of Nigeria economy providing employment to about 70% of its population yet this important sector has suffered neglect since the oil boom days. Agriculture has totally declined since the early 1970s Nigeria export crops such as groundnut, oil palm and cocoa have suddenly disappeared and the country is net importer of food crops. Agriculture recorded growth rate in 1975 at about 2.6% while the population grew at about 70% compared to 57.7% in 1993.

Cassava is a very versatile commodity with numerous uses and by product. Each component of these plant can be valuable to its cultivator. The leaves may be consumed as a vegetable, or cooked as a soup ingredient or dried and used it to fed livestock as a protein feed supplement. The stem is used for plant propagation and grafting. The roots are typically processed for human and industrial consumption.<br/>        In Nigeria, the consumption pattern varies according to ecological zones. Garri is a roasted granule, is the dominant product and is widely accepted in both rural and urban areas. It can be consumed without any additives or it can be consumed with a variety of additives such as sugar, groundnut, fish, meat and stew. The north east also use the cassava as fufu/akpu, garri abacha. Fufu is a fermented wet paste from cassava is also consumed throughout the country especially in the southern zones how every most processors complain that the wet paste are ready to eat forms of fufu, that are currently sold, have a short sheaf life. Estimates of industrial cassava use suggest that approximately 16 percent of cassava root production was utilized as industrial raw materials in 2001 in Nigeria. Ten percent was used as chips in animal feed, 5 percent was processed into a syrup concentrate for soft drink and less than one percent was processed into high quality cassava flour used in biscuits and confectionary, destrin pre-geled starch for adhesive, hydrolysate for pharmaceuticals and seasonings.<br/>        Garri is cassava tuber should be free from microbial contamination garri should be processed within two days of harvest to prevent deterioration or loss of quality in garri. Garri is a creamy-white granular flour with a slightly fermented flavour and a slightly sour taste made from fermented gelatinized fresh cassava tubers. Fresh cassava tuber is most, low acid food that is susceptible to bacteria and fungi growth. Hygienic practices especially in the early stage of processing should therefore ensure minimal contamination, all waste material from the process should be removed from the site as they are produced to avoid contamination of the final product with peel sand.<br/>        Fermentation must be properly controlled as to short period will result in incomplete detoxification. Fermentation consists of two distinct methods Aerobic and Anerobic fermentation for aerobic fermentation, the peeled and sliced cassava roots are first surface dried for 1-2 hours and then heaped together, covered with straw or leaves and left to ferment in air for 3-4 days until the pieces becomes moldy. The fermented moldy pieces are sun-dried. After the mold has been scrapped off. Theprocessed and dried pieces (called “Mokopa” in ugandal are then milled into flour, which is prepared into a “fufu” called “Kowan” in Uganda. The growth of mold on the root pieces, increases the protein content of the final products three to eight times. (Amey, 1987, Sauti et al, 1987). This fermentation method is also very popular in other parts of East Africa as Tanzania, Rwanda and Zaire.      <br/>        A long period of too will result in given the product a strong sour tests. Both over-fermentation and under-fermentation also affect the texture of the final garri if too much liquid is press from the grinded cassava the gelatinization of starch, during sub-sequent roasting is affected and the product is white. It the sufficient liquid is not removed however the fermentation of granules during roasting is affected and the dough is more likely to form into lumps. The idea of moisture content is about 47-50% and this is assessed visually by experience to the starch, sieving is important because it enable one to obtain a higher quality product free of fibrous contaminated. The granules must be roasted to above 80oc/175oc to achieved partial gelatinization of the starch. If lower temperature are used the product simply dries and produces a dry white powder. Too high temperature will cause charring of the product and make it stock to the roasting pan.             <br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>        Garri today is a staple food in Nigeria and beyond for us to ascertain proper hygiene quality of the product there is the need to focus on the processes involved. However, due to high demand of garri by consumers the producers of garri no longer see the need to do the right thing to produce high quality of garri what they after this day is the money they will make from the sale of the product. Thus the problem of the study therefore is to find out whether proper hygiene practices are carried out following during the processing of garri to avoid the risk of contamination. The study will be concerned with the fermentation process of garri. Whether the texture of garri is as a result of the fermentation process or whether the grated cassava is over or under fermented. The study is also concerned to ascertain the cause of lumps in garri whether it is due to drought or not. More so, it will focus on the rational behind the charring of the product and why it sticks to the roasting pan during frying.<br/>        Thus, the final product reduced to about 18%. This is a problem is commercial production. To produce garri at a fast rate and eliminates the problem of the traditional method. <br/>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>        This study is set to find out or to ensure that the final product is cooked and dehydrated. This study is therefore to find out the changes that caused friction between the cassava mash and the conveyor. Thus this study is concerned with, the proper hygiene practices can affect the production of a high quality of garr free from fibrous, contaminants and with similar sized granules. Finally this study will compare the garri production under lower temperature, to determine the extent to which temperature can affect the production of final garri, and under what temperature the product can be stored and the maximum drying time, rate of feed temperature control. Thus this study is to come up with a sound continuous process of garri frying machine, based on the avoidance of caking of the cassava mash. <br/>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>        In this study will sought from the following research questions;<br/>1)   Do proper hygienic practices increase the quality of good garri?<br/>2)   Does garri produced under fermentation posses better quality production?<br/>3)   Does sieving of garri bring better quality in the texture of garri?<br/>4)   Is it better to produce garri under a high temperature?<br/>5)   Under what temperature can garri be stored?<br/>6)   Is fermentation of garri important in the production of garri?<br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>        The importance of the study will be overwhelming and have far reaching effects on all firstly it will enable the producers of garri to know the significance of hygiene in the processing production and storage of garri. Hygienic practices especially in the early stage of processing should ensure maximum contamination. It will help the producers to know how it control the fermentation process involved in garri production. It will also help to determine the temperature which a good texture dry white producer a lovely grain garri can be produced. Nevertheless it will help the producers to know the ideal moisture content required `in garri, apart from the overwhelming benefits the producers of gari will derive the study will help consumers of garri to know the process involved in the production of garri and this will help them to appreciate the product better than before.<br/>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>        The researcher selected some local garri producer in villages in Oredo Local Government Area of  Edo State. Nevertheless the research is delimited to the production of garri only. And not all product of cassava can be processed into garri.<br/>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Cassava: The root of cassava are rich in carbohydrate, mainly starch, according to some research that was carried out cassava is the third most important source of calories, in terms of consumption either by eaten, grated cassava food products are the most important staples of rural and urban households in southern Nigeria.

This designation has generated momentum bringing greater attention to the forests worldwide. Forests cover almost a third of the earth’s land surface providing many environmental benefits including a major role in the hydrologic cycle, soil conservation, prevention of climate change and preservation of biodiversity (Sheron, 2011). Forest resources can provide long-term national economic benefits. For example, at least 145 countries of the world are currently involved in wood production (Anon, 2010). Sufficient evidence is available that the whole world is facing an environmental crisis on account of heavy deforestation. For years remorseless destruction of forests has been going on and we have not been able to comprehend the dimension until recently. Nobody knows exactly how much of the world’s rainforests have already been destroyed and continue to be razed each year. Data is often imprecise and subject to differing interpretations.<br/>Only 2% of China’s forests remain intaft, and only 0.1 percent of these surviving forests and properly protected. The rest are threatened by plantations, in Hainan and Yunnan, for example indigenous trees are felled to make way for fast growing ecouptus plantations, which are used to make paper pulp, unfortunately through they both contain trees plantation and ancient forests are not the same in terms of topology. Ancient forests are crucial to biodiversity and provide habitats for many native species of animals and plants.<br/>They also store millennium North of carbon, which is released as carbon dioxide (a green house gas) when the trees are logged. Logging alone, much of it illegal accounts for the less of more than 32 million acres of our planets natural forests every year, according to the nature conservancy.<br/>Not all deforestations is intentional. Some deforestation may be driven by a combination of natural processes and human interests. Wildfire burn large sections of forest every year, for example and although fire is a natural part to the forest life cycle, subsequent overgrazing by livestock of wildlife after a fire can prevent the growth of young trees.<br/>Forests still cover about 30 percent of the earth’s surface, but each year about 13 million hectares of forest (approximately 78,000 square miles) – an area roughly equivalent to the state of Nebraska, or four times the size of Costa Rica are converted to agricultural land or cleared for other purposes. Of that figure, approximately 6 million hectares (about 23,000 square miles) is primary forest, which is defined in the 2005 global forest resources assessment as forests of native species where there are no clearly visible indication of human activities and where the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed.<br/>However, it is obviously that the area of tropical rain forest is diminishing and the rate of tropical rain forest increased environment destructions escalation worldwide, despite increased environment activities and awareness our forest in Nigeria is gradually diminishing at 3.3 percent every year.  <br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>The indiscriminate felling of trees in our forest and the attitude of the people in Oredo Local Government Area, Edo State towards our forest has necessitated a massive scale and the people seem to be unaware of its consequences. This study therefore is geared towards finding solutions to some of the problems of deforestation. This study intends to find out the following problems;<br/>Do deforestation lead to flooding<br/>What are the causes of deforestation in Ovia North Local Government Area, Edo State?<br/>1.3    RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>1.   Does deforestation lead to climate change<br/>2.   Does overgrazing lead to deforestation?<br/>Does expansion of farmland lead to deforestation?<br/>Does fire outbreak lead to deforestation?<br/>1.4    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>The aims of the study are;<br/>To identify the causes of deforestation in Ovia North East Local Government Area.<br/>To assess the attitude of people of Ovia North East Local Government Area towards the existing forest.<br/>To identify the problems created by deforestation in Ovia North East Local Government Area.<br/>To assess the efforts made by the government to reduce the problems of deforestation. <br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>The fact that our forest is one of the beauties of nature and an effect means of controlling erosion, man has in either consciously or unconsciously and indiscriminately too. If no efforts are made to guard this, the younger generation may find it very difficult to know what a natural forest look like. They may also be denied of good forest produce for their economic needs and uses. Hence the effort being made by the government in preserving and consolidating the forest in form forest resources is highly impressive.<br/>The study is of importance in that it will enlighten the leaders and the public of our obligation of the forest. To point out the importance of forest to guide against erosion. It will also aid government and forestry officials on how to protect our forest.<br/>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is set out to determine the causes and effect of deforestation in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>The study is targeted at collecting data from farmers, loggers, hunters, saw millers, timber contractors in the local government area of the study.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Deforestation: Is a process whereby tresses are fell and used for domestic purpose without replacement. Deforestation is also when humans remove or clear large area of forest land and related ecosystems for non-forest use. These include clearing for farming purposes, ranching and urban use. In these cases, trees are never replanted.     <br/>Urbanization: is the social process whereby cities grow and societies become more urban in nature.<br/>Industrialization: This is the process which society or country (or world) transforms itself from a primary agricultural society into a base.  <br/>Infrastructure: is the basic physical and organizational structure needed for the generation of society or enterprise such as building road, power supplies etc.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE PROBLEMS OF DEFORESTATION: A CASE STUDY OF OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROBLEMS OF DEFORESTATION: A CASE STUDY OF OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE", "id": 150}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE ROLE OF MASS MEDIA IN DISSEMINATING AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION TO CASSAVA AND PLANTAIN FARMERS.<br/>A CASE STUDY OF OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA EDO STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This abstract is basically concerned to ascertain “The Role of mass media in disseminating Agricultural information to cassava and plantain farmers in Ovia North East Local Government Area.

It is specific organized for a purpose and presented within a context that gives its meaning and relevance which can lead to an increase in understanding and decrease in uncertainty. Reits (2010) defines information that when experienced at the conscious level as a question, gives rise to a search for an answer, information is a fact and knowledge needed to answer some questions faced by people in their daily life.<br/>The world Encyclopedia defines information is any kind of event that affects the state of a dynamic system. The valve of information lies solely on its ability to affect a behaviour, decision or outcome. A piece of information is considered valueless, if after receiving it, and things remain unchanged. Agriculture play an essential role in everyday human activities ranging from the provision of primary needs like food, clothing and shelter to secondary needs like construction, manufacturing etc. while much of the world is still stuck in subsistence agriculture majorly in remote part of the country, a little proportion of agriculture is just being practiced under the light of civilization and mode4rnization. That is to say farmers in the remote part of the country need to be constantly fed with information, idea, knowledge and skills developed from the Research Institute for better Farming Practice and eventual increase in yield. Information might be inform of new technology like storage facilities, better farming system like mechanization, access to credit facilities etc. for Agricultural information to be effective, after the information has been conveyed from the door, i.e. ministry of agriculture and the subordinate like research institute, Agricultural Development Project (ADP) etc to the receiver to the donor of the information must be accomplished.<br/>Also, Agricultural Information tend to connect the different departments of agriculture be elaborating on how judiciously individual department by products can be utilize by another department another, example, Nigerian is naturally fixed to the soil by some legumes like Callopogonuim Mucunoide, which will eventually increase the nutritive valve of livestock that feed on them while the excreta of the livestock is used to manure for crops to increase their yield. It can be represented sectionally as below.<br/>           The means of transporting agriculture may be through extension agents or through mass media. Media transit their information electronically with television, film, radio, movies, CDs, DVDs and some other gadgets like cameras or video consoles. Alternative print media uses a physical object as a means of sending their information such as newspaper, magazines, Brochures, Newsletters, books, leaf lets and pamphlets. Outdoor media is also a form of mass media which comprises billboards, signs, placards, placed inside and outside of commercial buildings like shops/buses, public speaking and event, organizing e.g. demonstration are also considered as mass media. <br/>        Mass media have been acclaimed to be a very effective medium for diffusing the scientific knowledge, innovation and technology to the masses in a country like Nigeria precisely Edo State where farmers literacy level is low. The choice of communication medium is of vital importance. Radio for example, because of its low cost and affordability by virtually all classes of income  earners, it can transfer modern agricultural technology to both literate and illiterate farmers even in interior could serve as a suitable medium of disseminating information and latest technical know-how. The farmers can easily understand the operations technology and instruction through television. The print media widened the scope of communication. It is cheap and farmers can afford to buy and read them at their convenience. It is a permanent medium in that the message are imprinted permanently with high storage value which makes them suitable for reference and research.<br/>        Cassava as the name implies is one of the staple foods consumed locally by the people of Edo State (Nigeria). Recently, the Federal Government has decided to increase the rate of cassava farmers so as to be able to produce food for the masses.<br/>        Also the federal government launched an initiative aimed at consolidating Nigeria’s position as the largest producer of cassava in the whole world. In addition to what was included as part of the package is a research into some possible industrial linkage that would lead to making the cassava a key export product in no distant future.<br/>        Cassava is presently used in the production of garri, industrial starch; alcohol, fufu and animal feeds cassava flour can also be gotten from cassava. This is one product that is found throughout the state and would support all sizes of investors. Investors are assured of relatively cheap and staple source of raw materials in Edo State. Opportunities also exist for large scale farming of cassava.<br/>        The production of cassava is concentrated in the hands of numerous small holders farmers located primarily in south-south state which include Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta Edo and Rivers. These farmers use manual processing techniques in the processing of cassava. Cassava can be interplant with maize plantain etc. cassava can get matured within six month of cultivation and ready for harvest.<br/>        Plantain (Musa Spp) occupies a strategic position for rapid food production in Nigeria. It is ranked among starchy food/staples. The consumption of plantain has risen tremendously in Nigeria. In recent years, because of the rapidly increasing urbanization and the great demand for easy and convenient foods by the non-farming urban populations. Besides, being the staple for many people in more humid regions, plantain is a delicacy and favoured snack for people. A growing industry, mainly plantain chips, is believed to be responsible for the high demand being experienced now in Nigeria. Plantain production in Nigeria has witnessed a steady risk for more than 20 years. As at (2004) Nigeria produce 2.10 million tons harvested from 389,000 hectare production (A.O 2006). Plantain is a majorly source of carbohydrate for more than 50 million Nigerians. In the country, all stages of fruit from immature to overripe are used as a source of food in one form or the other. The immature fruits are peeled, sliced, and made into powder and consumed as plantain fufu. The mature fruits (ripe or unripe) are consumed boiled, steamed, batch, pounded, roasted, or sliced into drips, overripe fruit serve as composite in the making of baby food (Babena and Sogamusa), bread, biscuit and others (Ogazi 1996, Akyyeampong 1999).<br/>        The fruits are produced all years round, the major harvest comes in the try season (November to February) when most other starchy product or staples are unavailable or difficult role in the bridging the gap hunger (Wilson 1986). In Nigeria, plantain peels are used as feed for livestock, while the dried peels are used for soap production. The dried peels are used for soap production. The dried leaves sheath and petioles are used as tying materials sponges and roofing materials.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>In Nigeria, the important of cassava and plantain industry cannot be underrated based on the vital role they play in human nutrition, source of employment and income generation at large international potash institution (1957) identified the principal product of cassava to be fain. The three main products gotten from cassava after being processed include garri, flour and fufu. The use of these products which may be locally for consumption by human and livestock or industrially used as raw materials, while plantain a major source of carbohydrate for more than 50 million Nigerians (Ogazi 1996). The ripe plantain is also a major source of iron and also a delicacy for diabetic patient.<br/>        However, cassava and plantain farmers are faced with some problems which include.<br/>Land tenure system problem.<br/>Fund problems.<br/>Problem of improved planting materials and pest disease.<br/>The agricultural role of mass media in disseminating agricultural information, innovation and idea in the study areas has never been recognized despite the fact that researchers are still trying to bridge the gap between the research stations and these rural farmers (cassava and plantain farmers). This has consequently marginalized agriculture and farming family which resulted to low productivity in spite of the efforts of the mass media in communicating agricultural information to the farmers.<br/>Therefore this research attempts to address some of the following research question.<br/>Do socio-economic characteristics of the farmers have any influence on the sources of information through mass media?<br/>What are the available mass media that have been used to communicate extension delivery services to the cassava and plantain farmers?<br/>What are the problems cassava and plantain farmers face in accessing the mass media sources.<br/>What are the factors that constrain respondents from using mass media?<br/>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>The general objective of the study is to examine the role of mass media in disseminating agricultural information to cassava and plantain farmers in Edo State while the specific objectives are to:-<br/>Examine the social- economic characteristics of cassava and plantain farmers<br/>Examine the farmers accessibility to mass media<br/>Ascertain mass media type through which respondents sought agricultural information.<br/>Ascertain respondents perceived role of mass media as information source<br/>Examine factors that constrain respondents use of mass media as information source.<br/>Identify the problems limiting farmers from cultivating cassava and plantain.<br/>SCOPE OF STUDY <br/>The scope the study is limited to Ovia North East Local Government Area only<br/>HYPOTHESIS  <br/>There is no significant relationship between respondent’s access to mass media and their perception of relevance of mass media as information source.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>It has been ascertained that mass media play an important role in transiting information to large number of audience simultaneously. Yet, Okwu and Obinne (2000) have indentified the main problem of agriculture in Nigeria as that of transfer of new technology information, innovations to farmers and not lack of them perse it is  known that mass media haves been making useful contributions to agricultural technology information and innovat6ion adoption. This study seeks to establish the clear5 existence of utilization by both cassava and plantain farmers in Edo Ovia North East Local Government Area Edo State<br/>Hence, the recommendation from this study will be useful to policy makers, researchers, ADP and other stakeholders in agricultural development agencies. This study will provide information which will be useful in solving the problem posed by cassava and plantain farmers.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE ROLE OF MASS MEDIA IN DISSEMINATING AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION TO CASSAVA AND PLANTAIN FARMERS.

Sixty questionnaires were drawn to generate the necessary information to satisfy the aim of this research and they were randomly administered in most of the farming location within the study area. The data analysis based on the findings shows that the most limiting factors to farming activities in the region is finance. 63.33% of the population depended on their personal income while only 36.67% had access to banks or cooperative societies for their farm funding. In addition, land was also noted to mitigate farming operations in the area due to the current multiple use of land in the area. <br/>  TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE   <br/>Introduction<br/>Background of the study<br/>Statement of the problem<br/>Purpose of the study<br/>Research questions<br/>Hypothesis<br/>Significance of the study<br/>Delimitation of the study<br/>Limitation of the study<br/>Definition of terms<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Literature review<br/>CHAPTER THREE         <br/>Research methodology<br/>Population of the study<br/>Sample and sampling technique<br/>Research instrument<br/>Validity and reliability<br/>Method of administering the research instrument<br/>Method of data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>Presentation and analysis of data<br/>CHAPTER FIVE  <br/>Summary, conclusion and recommendation<br/>Summary of findings<br/>Conclusion<br/>Recommendation<br/>REFERENCES     <br/>QUESTIONNAIRE       <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>        Agricultural production in developing countries has largely been on subsistence basis. The farmers only produce for themselves and immediate families and the quantity of goods produced are grossly inadequate for the growing population. There is an increased wide-spread in the level of poverty amongst the people especially those living in the rural areas. Small scale farming had become the major way to tackle the problem of lack and poverty in this area. An odd growing situation of unemployment in recent years had led many f the rural/urban dwellers into small scale farming and today, the small scale farmers are known for their important and huge contributions to the Gross National product, they are currently the producers of about 98 percent of the food consumed in Nigeria with the only exception of wheat.<br/>        It is imperative for government, non-government agencies and cooperate individuals to help in ameliorating the problems that militates against the farming activities of these small scale farmers in order to enhance a better food and raw amterials supplies in and around the Nigerian environment. Over the years deliberate, though ineffective effort have been made by donors and government to bring about agricultural development without much to show for it much of the failure can be attributed to the adapted transformation approach to agriculture which is characterized by the introduction of a variety of large scale farming and producing technologies. It is however gratifying to note that there is new a shift in emphasis from the big scale transformation approach to the small scale improvement strategy approach which attuned to our age long farm practice.<br/>        Information is an essential ingredient in agricultural development programmes but Nigerian farmers seldom feel the impact of agricultural innovations either because they have no access to such information or because it is poorly disseminated. This research work is aimed at revealing the problems faced by small scale farmers in Ughelli-South in order to showcase them for possible solutions by the various arms of government, non-governmental organizations and interested individuals.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS<br/>        A redirection of attention to agriculture had long-time been strategized by government and non-governmental agencies as the right antidote to the crises of unemployment in Nigeria, yet majority of the rural dwellers seek migration opportunities hence, compounding the general unemployment situation and food shortages in the country. An investigation to know the problems that have made individual (small scale) farming unattractive becomes imperative.<br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The purpose of this study is to ascertain the major problems that hiders the production activities of small scale farmers (crops and animals production) which when addressed will serve as a direct measure to food shortages and an indirect measure to the lingering problems of unemployment.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>Does small scale farming significantly increase the income earned by the people of Ughelli South Local Government Area?<br/>Is small scale farming the main activity available to the people of Ughelli South?<br/>Had small scale farming been able to reduce unemployment in Ughelli South?<br/>Had the food production from small scale farming in this area been able to meet the general food demand of the dwellers of Ughelli South?<br/>Are young school leavers attracted to small scale farming in Ughelli South?<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>        Rural-Urban migration due to unattractive/farming problems and unemployment had complicated life existence in the urban environment resulting in a high population density, increase in food demand and cost, traffic congestion amongst others.<br/>        This research work is set to provide informative hints on the problems in Ughelli South and also to provide useful information to government establishment aimed at improving farming and lives of the rural dwellers.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The investigation is limited to farmers that have farmed for at least three to four years within the study area in Arable Crop farming with cultivated fields of less than five-hectares, domestic animal rearers with less than five thousand fishes in their ponds and also, home-garden vegetable farmers scattered around in the local government area.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Small Scale Farming: This is the type of agriculture created in a subsistence level, void of commercialization.<br/>Large-Scale Farming: this is a commercial type of agriculture it involves a large production of crops and animals intended for a widespread distribution to wholesalers or retail outlets.<br/>Gross-National Product: The total values of goods produced and services provided by a country during one year, it is usually the sum total of the gross-domestic product and the net product.<br/>Rural-Urban Migration: It refers to the movement of people from the rural areas to the urban (more developed) centres for the purpose of getting a better education, job, health facilities, wages and standard of living.<br/>  <br/><br/>\n\nPROBLEM AFFECTING SMALL SCALE FARMERS IN UGHELLI-SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF DELTA STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEM AFFECTING SMALL SCALE FARMERS IN UGHELLI-SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF DELTA STATE", "id": 152}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>SOCIO-ECONOMIC STUDY OF RHYCHOPHORUS PHOENICS LARVA IN EDO/DELTA<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The study was embarked upon to investigate the socio-economic indices of producers (farmers), processors, marketers and consumers of Rhynchophorus Phoenicis (Edible worm) in some selected communities in Edo and Delta State. The study was the descriptive survey type of research design. The main instrument used for data collection in the study was the focus group discussion and the research questionnaire Analysis of data collected revealed that Rhynchophorus Phoenicis was highly accepted and consumed as a delicacy and as a substitute for fish and meat in their diets. Quite a number of people are involved in its farming, processing and marketing as a means of livelihood or the main source of income. It was also revealed that, its farming and marketing is more lucrative than my similar consumables like pork meat and suya. The farmers limits include basic edible worm production, preservation and processing techniques and to the consumers, the high cost of processed edible worm. Based on the findings, it was recommended that enabling policies and programmes be initiated and implemented to attract new comers into its farming in this era of high rate of unemployment in the country. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>Chapter One – Introduction <br/>Socio-economic study of Rhynochophorus Phoneninics<br/>Scope of the study<br/>Justification of the study<br/>Objectives of the study<br/>Chapter Two – Review of Related Literature <br/>Introduction<br/>Geographical location<br/>Common names of edible worm<br/>Morphology<br/>Location and isolation<br/>Rhynochophorus Phoneninics larve supply chain<br/>Economic value of Rhynochophorus Phoneninics larva<br/>Rhynochophorus Phoneninics sustainability<br/>Processing of Rhynochophorus Phoneninics larvae<br/>Drying<br/>Roasting<br/>Boiling<br/>Factors affecting the quality/utilization of Rhynochophorus Phoneninics<br/>Poor handling<br/>Poor preservative measures<br/>Unsanitary conditions<br/>Poor processing techniques<br/>Solutions to the above problems<br/>Rhynochophorus Phoneninics as a source of nutrients<br/>Insects as a multiplier of nutrients<br/>Chapter Three – Materials and Methods<br/>Study area<br/>Population<br/>Issues for focus group discussion<br/>Field survey<br/>Statistical package<br/>Supply chain<br/>Flow chart of edible worm<br/>Chapter Four – Data Presentation and Analysis   <br/>Presentation, analysis and discussion of results<br/>Focus group discussion results<br/>Chapter Five – Summary, Conclusion and Recommendation<br/>Appendix<br/>LIST OF TABLES<br/>Table 2.1 Common names of edible worm among different ethnic groups<br/>Table 2.2 Proximate composition of Rhynchophorus Phoenicis<br/>Table 2.3 fatty acid composition of Rhynchophorus Phoenicis<br/>Table 2.4 reported oil value for aquatic sources<br/>Table 2.5 reported oil value for legumes<br/>Table 2.6 Amino acid composition<br/>Table 2.7 Mineral composition of Rhynchophorus Phoenicis<br/>Table 4.10 Sex of respondents<br/>Table 4.11 Age brackets of respondents (Harvesters)<br/>Table 4.12 Marital status of respondents (Harvesters)<br/>Table 4.13 Educational level of respondents<br/>Table 4.14 years in edible worm farming<br/>Table 4.15 Edible worm processing<br/>Table 4.16 level of acceptance of edible worm<br/>Table 4.17 Economic contribution of edible worm<br/>LIST OF FIGURE<br/>Figure 1 Supply chain of edible worm<br/>Figure 2 bar chart showing sex of respondents<br/>Figure 3 bar chart showing sex of processors/marketers<br/>Figure 4 bar chart show sex of consumers<br/>Figure 5 Age of harvesters<br/>Figure 6 Age of processors/marketers<br/>Figure 7 Age of consumers<br/>Figure 8 Marital status of respondents (Harvesters)<br/>Figure 9 Marital status of consumers<br/>Figure 10 Educational level of respondents<br/>Figure 11 Number of years in edible worm farming<br/>Figure 12 Number of years in edible worm<br/>Figure 13 Method of processing<br/>Figure 14 Level of acceptance of edible worm<br/>Figure 15 Food value of edible worm<br/>Figure 16 consumers of edible worm<br/>Figure 17, 18, 19 Economic value of edible worm<br/>Figure 20 Income generated from sale of edible worm<br/>LIST OF PLATES<br/>Plate 1 Raphia palm<br/>Plant 2 Findings/Harvesting of edible worm<br/>Plate 3 Method of harvesting edible worm<br/>Plate 4 Edible worm<br/>Plate 5 Boiled edible worm<br/>Plate 6 Processing of edible worm<br/>Plate 7 Processing of edible worm<br/>Plate 8 Processing of edible worm<br/>Plate 9 Sale of edible worm<br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>SOCIO-ECONOMIC STUDY OF RHYNCHOPHORUS PHOENICIS (EDIBLE WORM)<br/>Rhynchophorus Phoenicis larva is a maggot stage of the African palm weevil (Rhynchophorus Phoenicis) it is the second stage of the common complete metamorphosis of the life cycle of the African weevil. It belongs to the group of insects. Insects, generally has played a well known role in the diet of both human and animals nutrition from the inception of life on earth (Defoliant, 1992 and Aiyesami, 1999).<br/> Some important group of insects includes grasshoppers, caterpillars, beetle, beetle grubs (such as meal worms), termites, bees, ant larvae and pulpae others include cicades and a variety of aquatic insects, crickets (Gordon et al, 1998). Evidence has been found analyzing coprolites from caves ion USA and Mexico. Coprolites in caves in the Ozark Mountains were found to contain ants, beetle larvae, lice, ticks, and mites (Way, et. al., 2004). This is not unexpected, and there are some deep evolutionary precursors.<br/> Insectory also features in various degrees amongst primates, such as marmosets and tamaims, and indeed there is some suggestion that the earliest primates were nocturnal, harbored insectivores (Weiss and Mann, 1985). To most extent Apes are to a greater or lesser extent, insectivorous (Tutin, Carolene, et al 1992; McGrew, 1992, and Coodell, 1986).<br/> Human insect-eating is known in cultures in different parts of the world, such as North, Central and South America, Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Australia and New Zealand. Over 100 insects are known to be eaten in 80% of the worlds nation (Domian, 2011).<br/> However, in some societies, insect eating is uncommon or even seen as a taboo (Weiss and Mann, 1985; Mcelroy and Townsend, 1989 and Gordon, George, 1998). Today, insect eating is rare in the developed world. But insects remain a popular food in many developing regions of Latin America, Africa, Asia and Oceania’s countries.<br/> Rhynochophorous phoenicis larva has been scientifically classified under the kingdom – animals, phylum-arthropoda, class-insecta, order-coleoptera, family-curculiondae, members of the class insect are important sources of food/protein to many.  Rhynochophorous phoenicis larva are major pest of oil palm, Raphia palm, coconut palms, ornamental palm and even sugar cane (Vidyasagar, et al, 2001). It is popularly called or known as edible worm or a large insect larva gotten from palms. It is fleshy, grub-like and usually measure over 3.5cm in length and width 2.0cm (Citialli and Sherley, 2004).     <br/> The insect cycle from egg to adult cover 60 days of which 26 days are spent as larva. They are found in wide geographical locations (Kaishoen and Lean, 1981). Rhynochophorous phoenicis larva are cherished as food among the people and communities in Nigeria where they are produced especially the southern area of Nigeria that are climatically friendly. It is usually seen hawked along major roads and markets in Edo, Delta, Ondo and even as far as Lagos (Ekrakene and Igeleke, 2007).<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>This study is primarily on the socio-economic study of the people involved in the production, processing and marketing of edible worm.<br/> In view of the wide production and consumption of this larva in Edo/Delta States, the study is limited to high production/processing areas of Ologbo town (Oredo Local Government Area) in Edo State and Mosogar  town (Ethiope West in Delta State).<br/> In areas of consumption, study is going to be in Benin City and Warri in Delta State.<br/>JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY <br/>Rhynochophorous phoenicis larva is fast assuming greater significance in the diet of most city dwellers as a delicacy with potential huge financial benefits to rural dwellers, therefore, there is the need to examine closely the various processes involved in the production, processing, preservation, storage and marketing. This will be of immense benefit to edible worm producers, marketers, consumers, as well as the national economy. <br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>The objective of this study is to determine;<br/>The socio-economic status of edible worm processor, marketers and consumers.<br/>The methods of production, processing and preservation of edible worm.<br/> The level of acceptance of edible worm as food in the study area.<br/>To determine the economic contribution of edible worm to the people.<br/>  <br/><br/>\n\nSOCIO-ECONOMIC STUDY OF RHYCHOPHORUS PHOENICS LARVA IN EDO/DELTA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SOCIO-ECONOMIC STUDY OF RHYCHOPHORUS PHOENICS LARVA IN EDO/DELTA", "id": 153}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EFFECT OF SHIFTING CULTIVATION IN OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE <br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>Shifting cultivation in general, is a system of farming in which fields are prepared by cutting down the natural vegetations. Letting it dry and burning it off. This technique serves to clear the field and enrich the soil with nutrients from the ash. Shining cultivation fields are generally used not more than two years at a lime, after which the fanners move to a new area and repeat the process. The practice of shifting cultivation is accepted as an early stage of the agricultural evolution. This form of cultivation is still widely practised in different parts of the world. As this practice dates back to the earliest times, it is thus regarded as primitive and archaic.<br/>and thereby it is said to have 'survived longest' (Rolwey-Conl, W. Y,  2004).<br/>The shifting field agriculture is characterized by ill rotation of' fields rather than of crops, with short period of cropping alternating and long fallow period, and clearing by means of slash-and-burI.1. The practice of shifting cultivation is also referred to as slash-md-burl1.<br/>In Nepal, the shifting cultivation' has various local names, such as Khoriya,  bhasme, Ihose', and, so on. In this study, t he researcher used the local term 'Khoriya' and the general term 'shifting cultivation' interchangeably. In this study, the researcher intend to review different approaches and perspectives to study the shifting cultivation. Finally, the researcher would present some arguments as the major findings of my own field study        (Dhakal 2009) in the Arun valley of eastern Nepal'. The study, as the researcher expect, will shed some light on how shifting cultivation has been approached and studied. It further intensify to enhance the way of understanding how possibly the practice of shifting cultivation might be approached in a particular context.<br/>Spencer (2006) observed that 'it is culture and cultural history, rather than physiography, which dictate the broad environmental location of shifting cultivation as a cropping system' (Spencer 2006). And many have argued and agreed upon that it is 'a special stage in the evolution from hunting and food gathering to sedentary fanning' (Geertz 2004), hence, it is an 'ancient', 'primitive system', therefore a 'remnant of the past...' (Spencer 2006, Found 2007: 2, Keesing &amp; Strathern 2008). Spencer further maintains that 'there are evidences to suggest that it spread progressively across almost the whole of southern and eastern Asia, Europe, and humid Africa in the early stage of settlement of these regions by agricultural folk' (2006).<br/>Although there is a long history of the practice of shifting cultivation, very little has been studied or explored in the anthropological context. Even up to the present, very little is known about the geographical range, characteristics, socio-cultural as well as ideological contexts, and diversity and dynamics of shining cultivation. This is because the studies of shifting cultivation have been limited to simple description of practices and its ecological consequences. There has been very little attempt to compare. Analyse, and classify them. Very few studies have been carried out with regard to the shifting cultivation (Shrestha 2009, Bajracharya el. al. 2003, Subedi 2004). These studies are basically concerned with the ecological and economic aspects of the shifting cultivation. These studies hardly look shifting cultivation as an integral part of social cultural practices with a cultural historical perspective. Therefore, efforts have yet to be made in order to understand shifting cultivation as a whole system of deriving a living from a particular environment Shifting Cultivation and Evolution of Agriculture:<br/>It is certainly not an easy task to trace its historical background. However, it is argued that this type of agriculture was the simplest form of agriculture and was practiced by the earliest farmers. Today, such a different type of agricultural system can be observed throughout the globe in the tropical areas. The practice, however, varies greatly from place to place and from one group of people to another. Terry B. Grandstaff (2001) argues that the people who have used this form of cultivation for a long time have developed a highly rational system. Generally, the practice of shifting cultivation is viewed as 'a technology that was practised in virtually every arable area of the earth during earlier historical periods but today survives as a major food producing method only in tropical region' (Padoch &amp; Vayda2003). Some even view that in terms of land use pattern shifting cultivation evolved to circumvent major problems of tropical agriculture like soil erosion, low nutrient status and pest pressure (Spencer 2006). In defence of this line of logic. Subash-Chandran maintains that the brief period of utilization. Small size of the plots and far-reaching preservation of the original surface roughness and soil texture due to residual tree stumps, absence of levelling prevent intensive erosion (Subash Chandran 2008).<br/>Geertz summarized the distinctive features of shifting cultivation as, (i.) it is practised on a very poor soils, (ii.) it represents an elementary agricultural technique which utilizes no tool except the axe and the hoe. (iii.) it is marked by a low density of population. and, (iv.) It involves a low level of consumption (Geertz 2004). This type of cultivation is thus associated with traditional societies of low population density in regions of low soil fertility, such as the Amazon rainforest. Though recent theories have suggested that the system of shifting agriculture combined with hunting and gathering strategies may. in fact, permit much greater population densities and a greater degree of sedentarism and varying degree of intensification of labour input than was previously believed (Found 2007, Keesing &amp; Slrathem 2008).<br/>However, shifting cultivators are considered to be one of the primary agents for transforming the forested landscape into cultivable and cultural one. Historically, therefore, shifting cultivation has been one of the processes transforming wild. forested landscape into cultural landscape. In a strict epistemological sense, we cannot understand the past except via our present knowledge of process and events operating in the present (Watson 2009). This does not mean that every trait that existed in the past must have an analogy in the present. Nevertheless, the study like this can provide a wider socio-cultural context to analyse and explain archaeological data from specific sites. In the similar manner, the study might be used as a case study to test the hypothetical explanation of processes and procedures thought to have occurred in specific prehistoric communities.<br/>Shifting cultivation is a very popular agricultural practice especially in the tropics. Christanty (2006) defined it as an agricultural system which is characterized by a rotation of field rather than of crops, short period of cropping (one to three years) alternated with long fallow period (up to twenty or more years, but often as short as six to eight years); and clearing by means of slash and burn. However, land used for agriculture and nonagricultural purposes have created land scarcity, leading to shorter fallow periods. In many cases, farmers have reduced their fallow periods below the sustainable level necessary to maintain an ecological balance under shifting cultivation (Harwood, 2006; Adesina et al., 2000; Brady,<br/>2006; Essama-Nssah et al., 2002), thereby making the traditional sustainable slash and burn agriculture unsustainable and environmentally degrading.<br/>The increase in human populations and urbanization particularly in the developing countries, have put tremendous pressure on land. As human populations continue to grow, land use intensity increases, and the negative effects of deforestation are likely to worsen (Chazdon, 2003). The extension of arable cropping for increased food production has been directly responsible for the reduction in forested areas. Reports have shown that 40% of the land surface of the earth was converted into cropland and permanent pasture by early 1990s (Rajiv and Upandhyay, 2009). Due to increase in human populations, fallow periods of shifting cultivation have drastically reduced, making the farmland to be infertile or<br/>less fertile. As a result, the hunger for fertile forested lands is on the increase just to meet the demand for food security in the rural areas and to improve the economic situation of the rural dwellers.<br/>Although, shifting cultivation is estimated to support the livelihoods of some 300-500 million people worldwide (Brady, 2006), the slash and burn tendency especially where fallow periods have drastically reduced due to increasing populations, has grave implications for trees and the majority of people that depend on them. The dependence of people on trees and forests is unlimited. More than 25 percent of the world’s population – an estimated 1.5 billion people - relies on forest resources for their livelihoods, and of these almost 1.2 billion live in extreme poverty (World Bank, 2001). Given the importance of trees to the environment<br/>and rural livelihoods, the need for empirical ecological knowledge that will aid a systematic understanding of the impact of land use intensification through shifting agriculture, on tree populations, cannot be overemphasized.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>Shifting cultivation is said to be one of the unsustainable land uses contributing significantly to environmental degradation in Nigeria (Luoga, 2000; Zahabu, 2008). Clearing forests for shifting cultivation can contribute to climate change, biodiversity loss, reduced timber supply, flooding, siltation, soil degradation and change of forest vegetation from primary to secondary and eventually to grassland (Holden, 2001).<br/>In the past, shifting cultivation was not considered to be amongst unsustainable agricultural practices due to long fallow period allowing enough time for regeneration (Luoga, 2000). Today due to increased population pressure, high demand of cereals and growth of urban markets for forest products shifting cultivation has been intensified with fallow period reduced from 25 years to less than 3 years (Luoga, 2000; Mwampamba, 2009; Nduwamungu et al., nd).<br/>Despite the fact that shifting cultivation was identified long time ago as a threat to tropical forests (FAO 1999) to date there is limited information to demonstrate its impact on forest cover change and nutrients dynamics in Nigeria. The few studies which have been conducted were based on assessment on the impacts of shifting cultivation on biodiversity and carbon in high forests (Mwampamba, 2009) and other researchers are based on general overview of the contribution of shifting cultivation to deforestation in Kitulangalo Forest Reserve (Luoga,2000; Nduwamungu et al.,nd) Either, shifting cultivation has always been linked to decline in soil fertility. However, there is limited information with regards to dynamics of essential nutrients in areas practicing shifting cultivation. The information on nutrients dynamics at different fallow ages and cultivation duration is even scarcer (Diekmann, 2004). Also other factors which can contribute to shifting cultivation, such lack of proper farming techniques, site and crop matching, weak land tenure in acquiring land remain largely untested.<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>The overall objective: To address the contribution of shifting cultivation on forest cover change and nutrients dynamics in Nigeria through comparison of forests with and without shifting cultivation and forests under different fallow age and cultivation history in selected parts of Nigeria<br/>Specific Objectives; <br/>1. To identify the socio- economic drivers of shifting cultivation<br/>2. To asses nutrients status of fields under different fallow age and cultivation history<br/>3. To asses forest cover change due to shifting cultivation since 1980s,<br/>4. To determine the role of institution for prevention and control of shifting cultivation<br/>5. To assess the perception of local people toward shifting cultivation<br/>6. To assess the effects of crops under shifting cultivation on nutrients dynamics<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>1. Why do farmers practice shifting cultivation?<br/>2. What is the role of formal and informal institutions on control and prevention of shifting cultivation?<br/>3. What is the effect of shifting cultivation on forest cover?<br/>4. How does nutrients and vegetation recovery vary on farms at different fallow periods?<br/>5. How does cultivation period and fallow age correlated to soil nutrient dynamics?<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>This study is expected to bridge this information gap. The findings will contribute towards understanding of the dynamics of forest cover and soil nutrition in areas practicing shifting cultivation.<br/>Given the importance of trees to the environment and rural livelihoods, the need for empirical knowledge that will aid a systematic understanding of the impact of land use intensification through shifting agriculture, on tree populations, cannot be overemphasized.<br/>The study was a step in that direction. The importance of the study is that it will help to find out the abundance of uncultivated forestland and arable farmlands of different ages.<br/>This study will also help to ascertain the agriculture on tree diversity; and to determine the extent of tree species compositional variation between the uncultivated forestland and different chronosequences of cultivated lands; and lastly, to ascertain the extent of change in individual tree populations due to varying degrees of shifting cultivation.<br/>This study will also find out how farmers relate their farming practices to various environmental consequences. And how different crops under shifting cultivation affect soil nutrient?<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is set out to find out the effect of shifting cultivation on agricultural land a case study of Ovia North East Local Government of Edo State.

The problems are accessioned by high rate of population growth which has arisen the failure of food production to cope with national demand. Agricultural sector has a unique role to play in the quest of putting the Nigeria economy on the production of balanced self reliant and non inflationary growth. The study of economic history provides us with sample evidence that an agricultural evolution is a fundament production for economic development. The agricultural sector has a potential to be the industrial and economic spring boards more often than not agricultural activities are usually concentrated in the less developed rural areas where there is a crucial need for transformation, re- distribution, poverty alleviation and social economic development.<br/>        Agricultural activities comprises of crop and animal production, there have been growing concerns in the recent years at the low level of protein intake, especially of animal origin in spite of various agricultural development strategies adopted in Nigeria, daily per-capita, animal protein intake estimated as less than log or remains as far cry from the food and agricultural organization (FAO) recommendation minimal requirement of 35g (Usman 2003) in order to bridge this gap, it has been suggested that there is the need to explore of or source animal protein in addition to the conventional source such as ruminants and poultry (Olayide and Heady 1981) one of the important alternative source of animal protein, which has received relatively scanty attention in Nigeria as the snail.<br/>        The problem of animal protein intake in Nigeria has encouraged researcher to look for source of protein from animal which are reared with little or no capital. Micro livestock such as snail, glasscutter and rabbit have been domesticated and a lot of work is going on aimed to increase their availability at a reduced price, Snail farm environmental friendly and can be done with little skills (Alkinusi 1988 NCR 1991).<br/>        In Africa countries snail production is also relevant and according to some researcher, snail in Africa is known as Achatina Fulica and other achatinal species, giant Africa snails. They can grow up to 326mm (1ft ¾ inch) in length. Their native range is south of the Sahara in East Africa. This snail was purposely introduced into India in 1847. There was an unsuccessful attempt to establish it in Japan in 1925. It has been purposely and accidentally transported to other pacific locations and was inadventenly released in California after World War II, in Hawaii, and later in North maimi Florida in the 1970s. In many places, it is a serious agricultural pest that causes considerable crop damage. Also, due to its large size, its slime and fecal material create a nuisance as does the odour that occurs when something like poison bait causes large numbers to die (Wikipedia, 19 may 2015).<br/>STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEMS<br/>Roasted snail shells have been found in Archaeological excavations and indication that snails have been eaten since prehistoric times. Roman snail, was an ancient method of snail farming or horticulture in the region about tanquinia. This snail farming method was described by folvius lippinus (49BC) and mentioned by marcuc Terentis varro in De Re Rustica III, 12.<br/>        There was an unsuccessful attempt to establish it in Japan in 1925. It has been purposely and accidentally transported to other pacific locations and was inadvently released in California after world war II, in Hawaii, and later in north maimi florida in the 1970s. also, due to its large size, its slime and fecal material create a nuisance as does the odour that occurs when something like poison bait causes large numbers to die. The U.S has made considerable effort to eradicate Achatina. The U.S. department of Agriculture (USDA) has banned the importation and possession of live giant Africa snails. However, they are still sought after as pets due to the vibrant “tiger stripes on their shells.<br/>        Many who are into snail farming in Nigeria are also unwilling to let others know about the farming methodology. The techniques are often shrouded in secrecy. Nigeria economic recovery and programmes have necessitated a radical shift from total dependent on government for jobs to self employment in snail rearing. It is a great money-spinning business that can provide a substantial source of protein to complement Nigerian carbohydrate meals.<br/>        Snail is an important source of protein, snail also plays an important role in folk medicine irrespective of snail considerable high potentials, local snails production has failed to meet the country demand is for higher than the supply (kehinde 2004).<br/>        Considering the high prospect in the industry the provision of protein through snails availability and creating employment for the producers and marketers, people are therefore advised and encourage to go into snail farming. Hence the question seemed to arise.<br/>        How profitable is the snail production as a snail and medium scale enterprise. What are the factors or constraints is removed so that snail farmers livelihood can be improved which will turn as an improvement on agricultural production of the nation.<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>Snail farming is not a new concept. From the pre-historic age, human has been consuming snail meat because of its high rate of protein, iron, low fat and including almost all the amino acid which is needed for human body. Snail farming has many kinds of benefits in the recent years. Snail farming increasing day to day and turns into a large scale small voltage industry because of its real economic value, for the purpose of this research work the following are the objectives of the study:<br/>Examine the socio-economic characteristic of snail producers in Uhunmwode L. G. A  in Edo state/Nigeria<br/>Identify the production system adopted by snail farmers in Uhunmwode L.G.A in Edo state, Nigeria.<br/>To develop a resilient programme that links agriculture with industry and commerce.<br/> Examine the determinant of revenue accruing to snail production in the area.<br/>Determine the cost and returns to snails production and determine it viability.<br/>To develop human capacities for the empowerment of individuals and groups.<br/>Identify the constraints of snail production in the study area. <br/>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>SCOPE<br/>        In an attempt to carry out this research work on the economic analysis of snail production in Uhunmwode local Government Area in Edo State, I have decided to know the extent at which snail production or snail farming will undertake or undergo in the economic aspect of Uhunmwode community.<br/>        Uhunmwode is a Local Government Area of Edo State, Nigeria. Its heads quarter is in the town of Ehor.<br/>        It has an area of 2,033;Km2 and a population of 120,813 at the 2006 census (NIPOST, 2009).<br/>        With her population the community can be said to account t for a significant quantity of farm produce that come out of Uhunmwode Local Government Area.<br/>        Snail farming in Uhunmwode community have not yet be taking edge in the production processes but with my research work carried out concerning snail production in Uhunmwode community can pick up the snail business and use it in developing their community internally,<br/>        Snail is hermaphrodite animal and snail is a good healthy proteinous food compare to other meats. Snail is very easy to rear compare to other animals, it does not bite, kick, sting or harm and they don’t mess up the environment.<br/>        The reproductive organ in snail are in both the male and female, although two snail have to mate in order to fertilize their eggs, so this has show that the Uhunmwode community need not much revenue to start up the business of snail farming in the community.<br/>As much, I the researcher hope to gather information that will be useful for this research topic and the above zone would represent the whole Edo State in Nigeria.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS/ TERMINOLOGY  <br/>ECONOMIC: Economics is the social science that seeks to describe the factors which determine the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services.<br/>ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: this measures the social and economic outcomes of an initiative.<br/>WHAT IS SNAIL: Snail is a hermaphrodites or a creeping animal.<br/>PRODUCTION: it is the transformation of raw materials into finished goods and the provision and distribution of goods and services in order to satisfy the final consumer.<br/>SNAIL PRODUCTION: This is the process of farming or raising snails. Snail production is also known as snail farming.<br/>SNAIL FEED: snail feeds on a wide variety of cultivated and wild plants.(food &amp; Agriculture Organization (FAD), 1989).         <br/><br/>\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF SNAIL PRODUCTION IN UHUNMWODE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF SNAIL PRODUCTION IN UHUNMWODE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE", "id": 155}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF POST HARVEST LOSS AMONG LEAFY VEGETABLE MARKETERS IN UTESE, OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This study examine the economic analysis of post harvest losses among leafy vegetable marketers in Utese, Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State in achieving this, specific objectives were spelt out to examine the socio-economic characteristics of green vegetable marketers in the study area.

There can also be losses in quality as measured both by the price obtained and the nutritional values as well as in quantity. Farmers are forced to sell their products at give away prices due to absence of adequate storage income goes to the waste bins.<br/>Estimate of production losses in developing countries are usually very hard to come by. Post harvest losses in vegetable in Africa countries have been estimated to about 50% of the total production food and agricultural organization implies that half of the total production are lost during storage handling and transportation of their produce. Therefore minimizing these losses to a large extent between harvest and consumption of already produced food is more sustainable than increasing production (Kader and Roll, 2004).<br/>Post harvest losses are caused by mechanical injuries, inadequate storage, unsuitable handling, faculty system of transport and delayed transportation in retail market. Green vegetable refer to all leafy vegetable predominantly green in colour which can be eaten boiled or in soups. They have achieved tremendous popularity over the last century among local trader. Besides being tasty the green vegetables as they are good source of vitamin A and C. they are low calories and fasts, high in protein per calories, dietary, fibre, iron and calcium. They have a very short life span. They have high economic value.          <br/>PROBLEMS STATEMENT <br/>A very little is known about the production and consumption pattern of Africa leafy vegetable. The FAO/WHO consultation on diet, nutrition and the prevention of chronic diseases (2003) recommended a minimum daily intake of fruit and vegetables of proper functioning. Emphasis should therefore be laid, not only on increased production of vegetables but also on ways to minimize these post harvest losses so as to bridge the gap existing in the recommended requirement.<br/>In order to ensure good quality vegetable with high economic and marketable potentials, certain question must be addressed;<br/>What are the factors responsible for post harvest losses in green vegetables?  <br/>What are the economic implication of these losses?<br/>Which varieties are more susceptible?<br/>What are the ways of reducing these losses?<br/>What are the record of these losses?<br/>How can the losses be reduced? <br/>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>The general objective of the study is to estimate the physical losses and corresponding financial value of post harvest losses in green vegetable in Utese town, Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>The specific objectives of the study are to;<br/>Examine the socio-economic characteristics of green vegetable marketers in the study area.<br/>Estimate the physical losses of green vegetable during marketing.<br/>Determine the financial value of these losses in green vegetables.<br/>Identify the causes of the losses during marketing.<br/>Determine the effect of post harvest losses.<br/>Identify constraints encountered by the seller.<br/>JUSTIFICATION FOR THE STUDY <br/>Since vegetable plays a great role in the body and in the society, and green vegetable “promote healthy nutritional balance as they are good sources of vitamin A and C”, therefore the method of producing them should be a relevant subject to the studied and also to the marketer and consumers. It is hoped that the information obtained from this study will help government and policy makers to address the problem of economic analysis of post harvest losses among leafy vegetable marketers and its uses for consumers. <br/>  <br/><br/>\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF POST HARVEST LOSS AMONG LEAFY VEGETABLE MARKETERS IN UTESE, OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF POST HARVEST LOSS AMONG LEAFY VEGETABLE MARKETERS IN UTESE, OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE", "id": 156}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE PROBLEM AND PROSPECT OF PEASANT FARMING IN EDO STATE: A CASE STUDY OF UHUNMWONDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This project work is designed to find out appraisal of problems and prospect of peasant farming in Uhunmwonde Local Government Area of Edo State.

The social relationship it builds around (in particular control over land). More than any other activity, agriculture fuels the imagination and forges peoples cultures, so care is needed when considering the evolution of agriculture. Peasant farming is a localized system of agricultural farming usually operated on a small piece of land. This type of farming is practice in poor communities, since the farmers do not have enough capital. It is concerned with the provision of t he basic needs of the family. Farming activities are carried out without the use of machine rather crude implements are used such as cutlass, hoe, spade etc., the farmer also relies on and operates with family labour, the total yield from the farm is usually low where there is little or no excess or surplus for sale or capital investment.<br/>        This type of agriculture is mostly practiced by peasant farmers and cost of production is very low. The practice provides direct employment for many people since machines are not used. It also makes the environment to be free from pollution and there is also less danger of environment degradation. In Uhunmwonde local government area vast majority of farmers are still peasants who farms small plot of land, usually in marginal environment utilizing traditional and subsistence methods for their consumption because it is associated with low capital for production use of crude implement. These farmers live in rural area and are poor in nature hence their standard of living is low. Despite of these characteristics, peasant farming system has vital role to play in agricultural sector. So solutions therefore must be found for empowering peasants to deal with such problems.<br/>        It is also associated with the problems of land ownership, soil type, availability of inputs and availability of manpower thereby discouraging the hope of large scale production among the farmers, and farm products among the farmers and mainly subsistence as a result of this, the farmers cannot meet up with their standards. The main purpose of this study was to identify solution to deal with challenges facing peasant farming system in Uhunmwonde local government, Edo State.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS<br/>        In this project work attempt was made to find out the appropriate measure to adopt to carefully identified the problems and prospect of peasant farming in the area of study. The researcher examined some of the following problems.<br/>        Why is productivity low in Uhunmwonde local government area?<br/>        What are the steps taken so far either by government or individuals to increase farm productivity in the area of study?<br/>        What is the type of farming system practice by these people in the locality?<br/>        What is the cause of low-standard of living of the people?<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The objective of the study includes the following:<br/>        To investigate the various problems of peasant farming in Uhunmwonde local government area.<br/>To look into how peasant farming affects the people in the locality.<br/>To find possible situation to the problems and give some possible recommendation of enhancing peasant farming in the area of study.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>        As a farmer what type of farming method would you employ?<br/>        Do farmers in your area have access to financial assistance to carry out large scale farming?<br/>        What is your occupation?<br/>        Are there problems of in accessible road in your area?<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>        This research work covers Uhunmwonde local government area. The village in the area of studies are:<br/>Azagba community<br/>Ehor<br/>Egba<br/>Eyean<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>        A lot of benefits are derived from this study. Firstly, the local farmers in the area of study will be aware of agricultural production.<br/>        Secondly, the general public who are interested in agricultural activities will also be aware of the farming in the area of study, this will help them to show positive attitude to farming.<br/>        Thirdly, this project work will help the agricultural policy making body to focus attention in their area of priority.<br/>        Finally, this project work will also help the agricultural policy making body to play an important roles in the need to improve subsistence farming to a large scale mechanized farming.  <br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Peasant farming: This means farming mainly made for consumption with little or no left for sales and usually done on a small scale of land. It is concerned with the provision of basic need of the family.<br/>Crude Implements: These are implement use to carry out work in a small piece of farm land, they are also known as simple farm tools e.g. cutlass, here, spade shovel etc. this type to tools are mostly use by peasant farmers because of the size of their land.<br/>Commercial farming: This is the type of farming that is done on a large scale. Most of its operations are usually mechanized and it has high yield. Few labourers are required on the farm hence it can lead to unemployment. This type of farming is very expensive in terms of money, skilled labour and management. It is mostly practice by rich farmers.<br/>Land tenure system: Land tenure is the relationship whether legally or customarily defined among people as individuals or groups with respect to land. Land tenure may also be described as a set of property relationship between two, it means the holding of land and the term tenant include owners, lessees and other occupiers of the land. It also means the right to hold property.<br/>  <br/><br/>\n\nTHE PROBLEM AND PROSPECT OF PEASANT FARMING IN EDO STATE: A CASE STUDY OF UHUNMWONDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROBLEM AND PROSPECT OF PEASANT FARMING IN EDO STATE: A CASE STUDY OF UHUNMWONDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA", "id": 157}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>APPRAISAL OF LAND DEPLETION THROUGH BUSH BURNING: A CASE STUDY OF EKIADOLOR IN OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE  <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The burning of natural vegetation no doubt removes the protective cover of the soil surface and depreciates the quality of the soil.

In general and in Ekiadolor in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State in particular bush burning generally is the method of  removing the natural vegetable from the surface of the soil by setting fire on debris. Bush burning causes serious damage to trees and crops, its effect of public concern which should not be for farmer alone and should be handled with seriousness, practice of burning of fire could also lead to accidental burning of his land and other properties at his disposal, this ideals of burning his farm came to him with the food that fire has left behind after roasting his food, fire spread and destroyed all that was left behind in the environment.  <br/>Burning the farmland for the cultivation of crops has a remarkable effect on the soil fertility. During burning process some nutrients that are highly needed by the plants are lost out in form of gasses such nutrient include phosphorous, nitrogen and sulphur. The ash which is the principle products of burnt material although rich in phosphorous, nitrogen and potassium can be easily washed away by rain. The heat produced during burning creates an unfavourable condition for activities of the soil organism such as earthworms, bacteria etc.       <br/>He also found out the seed of fruits he has eaten and thrown off has grown in his burnt land and as a result of this included burning in his farm system. The practice of burning can be traced back of about 2000 years ago, it was discovered that most of the vegetation debris after clearing, especially on a large scale farming and small scale farms. Apart from burning the land for cultivation purpose animals are also trapped.  <br/>1.2    PURPOSE OF STUDY <br/>Bush burning has become part and parcel of the activities of farmers in this area. The negative effects are not considered at all. Hence it is important to highlight these for the farmers to experience and observe the dangerous effects of bush burning as it affect the soil as a whole.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>Since bush burning is the major lands preparation practice, it is important to study the effect of bush burning on agricultural lands and also to carryout investigation on how far bush burning has affected agricultural land in Ekiadolor in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State and possibly find alternative measure to avoid bush burning.    <br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>The scope of this project is limited to Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State, some important towns and villages in Ovia North East Local Government Area such as Ekiadolor Town, Evboneka, Ughoton etc where farming operation is carried extensively and that burning issues form the scope of my study.

Letting it dry and burning it off. This technique serves to clear the field and enrich the soil with nutrients from the ash. Shining cultivation fields are generally used not more than two years at a lime, after which the fanners move to a new area and repeat the process. The practice of shifting cultivation is accepted as an early stage of the agricultural evolution. This form of cultivation is still widely practiced in different parts of the world. As this practice dates back to the earliest times, it is thus regarded as primitive and archaic.<br/>and thereby it is said to have 'survived longest' (Rolwey-Conl, W. Y,  2004).<br/>The shifting field agriculture is characterized by ill rotation of' fields rather than of crops, with short period of cropping alternating and long fallow period, and clearing by means of slash-and-burn. The practice of shifting cultivation is also referred to as slash-and-burn. Shifting cultivation' has various local names, such as Khoriya,  bhasme, Ihose', and, so on. In this study, t he researcher used the local term 'Khoriya' and the general term 'shifting cultivation' interchangeably. In this study, the researcher intend to review different approaches and perspectives to study the shifting cultivation. Finally, the researcher would present some arguments as the major findings of my own field study        (Dhakal 2009) in the Arun valley of eastern Nepal'. The study, as the researcher expect, will shed some light on how shifting cultivation has been approached and studied. It further intensify to enhance the way of understanding how possibly the practice of shifting cultivation might be approached in a particular context.<br/>Spencer (2006) observed that 'it is culture and cultural history, rather than physiography, which dictate the broad environmental location of shifting cultivation as a cropping system' (Spencer 2006). And many have argued and agreed upon that it is 'a special stage in the evolution from hunting and food gathering to sedentary fanning' (Geertz 2004), hence, it is an 'ancient', 'primitive system', therefore a 'remnant of the past...' (Spencer 2006, Found 2007: 2, Keesing &amp; Strathern 2008). Spencer further maintains that 'there are evidences to suggest that it spread progressively across almost the whole of southern and eastern Asia, Europe, and humid Africa in the early stage of settlement of these regions by agricultural folk' (2006).<br/>Although there is a long history of the practice of shifting cultivation, very little has been studied or explored in the anthropological context. Even up to the present, very little is known about the geographical range, characteristics, socio-cultural as well as ideological contexts, and diversity and dynamics of shining cultivation. This is because the studies of shifting cultivation have been limited to simple description of practices and its ecological consequences. There has been very little attempt to compare. Analyse, and classify them. Very few studies have been carried out with regard to the shifting cultivation (Shrestha 2009, Bajracharya el. al. 2003, Subedi 2004). These studies are basically concerned with the ecological and economic aspects of the shifting cultivation. These studies hardly look shifting cultivation as an integral part of social cultural practices with a cultural historical perspective. Therefore, efforts have yet to be made in order to understand shifting cultivation as a whole system of deriving a living from a particular environment Shifting Cultivation and Evolution of Agriculture:<br/>It is certainly not an easy task to trace its historical background. However, it is argued that this type of agriculture was the simplest form of agriculture and was practiced by the earliest farmers. Today, such a different type of agricultural system can be observed throughout the globe in the tropical areas. The practice, however, varies greatly from place to place and from one group of people to another. Terry B. Grandstaff (2001) argues that the people who have used this form of cultivation for a long time have developed a highly rational system. Generally, the practice of shifting cultivation is viewed as 'a technology that was practised in virtually every arable area of the earth during earlier historical periods but today survives as a major food producing method only in tropical region' (Padoch &amp; Vayda2003). Some even view that in terms of land use pattern shifting cultivation evolved to circumvent major problems of tropical agriculture like soil erosion, low nutrient status and pest pressure (Spencer 2006). In defence of this line of logic. Subash-Chandran maintains that the brief period of utilization. Small size of the plots and far-reaching preservation of the original surface roughness and soil texture due to residual tree stumps, absence of levelling prevent intensive erosion (Subash Chandran 2008).<br/>Geertz summarized the distinctive features of shifting cultivation as, (i.) it is practised on a very poor soils, (ii.) it represents an elementary agricultural technique which utilizes no tool except the axe and the hoe. (iii.) it is marked by a low density of population. and, (iv.) It involves a low level of consumption (Geertz 2004). This type of cultivation is thus associated with traditional societies of low population density in regions of low soil fertility, such as the Amazon rainforest. Though recent theories have suggested that the system of shifting agriculture combined with hunting and gathering strategies may. in fact, permit much greater population densities and a greater degree of sedentarism and varying degree of intensification of labour input than was previously believed (Found 2007, Keesing &amp; Slrathem 2008).<br/>However, shifting cultivators are considered to be one of the primary agents for transforming the forested landscape into cultivable and cultural one. Historically, therefore, shifting cultivation has been one of the processes transforming wild. forested landscape into cultural landscape. In a strict epistemological sense, we cannot understand the past except via our present knowledge of process and events operating in the present (Watson 2009). This does not mean that every trait that existed in the past must have an analogy in the present. Nevertheless, the study like this can provide a wider socio-cultural context to analyse and explain archaeological data from specific sites. In the similar manner, the study might be used as a case study to test the hypothetical explanation of processes and procedures thought to have occurred in specific prehistoric communities.<br/>Shifting cultivation is a very popular agricultural practice especially in the tropics. Christanty (2006) defined it as an agricultural system which is characterized by a rotation of field rather than of crops, short period of cropping (one to three years) alternated with long fallow period (up to twenty or more years, but often as short as six to eight years); and clearing by means of slash and burn. However, land used for agriculture and nonagricultural purposes have created land scarcity, leading to shorter fallow periods. In many cases, farmers have reduced their fallow periods below the sustainable level necessary to maintain an ecological balance under shifting cultivation (Harwood, 2006; Adesina et al., 2000; Brady,<br/>2006; Essama-Nssah et al., 2002), thereby making the traditional sustainable slash and burn agriculture unsustainable and environmentally degrading.<br/>The increase in human populations and urbanization particularly in the developing countries, have put tremendous pressure on land. As human populations continue to grow, land use intensity increases, and the negative effects of deforestation are likely to worsen (Chazdon, 2003). The extension of arable cropping for increased food production has been directly responsible for the reduction in forested areas. Reports have shown that 40% of the land surface of the earth was converted into cropland and permanent pasture by early 1990s (Rajiv and Upandhyay, 2009). Due to increase in human populations, fallow periods of shifting cultivation have drastically reduced, making the farmland to be infertile or<br/>less fertile. As a result, the hunger for fertile forested lands is on the increase just to meet the demand for food security in the rural areas and to improve the economic situation of the rural dwellers.<br/>Although, shifting cultivation is estimated to support the livelihoods of some 300-500 million people worldwide (Brady, 2006), the slash and burn tendency especially where fallow periods have drastically reduced due to increasing populations, has grave implications for trees and the majority of people that depend on them. The dependence of people on trees and forests is unlimited. More than 25 percent of the world’s population – an estimated 1.5 billion people - relies on forest resources for their livelihoods, and of these almost 1.2 billion live in extreme poverty (World Bank, 2001). Given the importance of trees to the environment<br/>and rural livelihoods, the need for empirical ecological knowledge that will aid a systematic understanding of the impact of land use intensification through shifting agriculture, on tree populations, cannot be overemphasized.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>Shifting cultivation is said to be one of the unsustainable land uses contributing significantly to environmental degradation in Nigeria (Luoga, 2000; Zahabu, 2008). Clearing forests for shifting cultivation can contribute to climate change, biodiversity loss, reduced timber supply, flooding, siltation, soil degradation and change of forest vegetation from primary to secondary and eventually to grassland (Holden, 2001).<br/>In the past, shifting cultivation was not considered to be amongst unsustainable agricultural practices due to long fallow period allowing enough time for regeneration (Luoga, 2000). Today due to increased population pressure, high demand of cereals and growth of urban markets for forest products shifting cultivation has been intensified with fallow period reduced from 25 years to less than 3 years (Luoga, 2000; Mwampamba, 2009; Nduwamungu et al., nd).<br/>Despite the fact that shifting cultivation was identified long time ago as a threat to tropical forests (FAO 1999) to date there is limited information to demonstrate its impact on forest cover change and nutrients dynamics in Nigeria. The few studies which have been conducted were based on assessment on the impacts of shifting cultivation on biodiversity and carbon in high forests (Mwampamba, 2009) and other researchers are based on general overview of the contribution of shifting cultivation to deforestation in Kitulangalo Forest Reserve (Luoga,2000; Nduwamungu et al.,nd) Either, shifting cultivation has always been linked to decline in soil fertility. However, there is limited information with regards to dynamics of essential nutrients in areas practicing shifting cultivation. The information on nutrients dynamics at different fallow ages and cultivation duration is even scarcer (Diekmann, 2004). Also other factors which can contribute to shifting cultivation, such lack of proper farming techniques, site and crop matching, weak land tenure in acquiring land remain largely untested.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>The overall objective: To address the contribution of shifting cultivation on forest cover change and nutrients dynamics in Nigeria through comparison of forests with and without shifting cultivation and forests under different fallow age and cultivation history in selected parts of Nigeria<br/>Specific Objectives; <br/>1. To identify the socio- economic drivers of shifting cultivation<br/>2. To asses nutrients status of fields under different fallow age and cultivation history<br/>3. To asses forest cover change due to shifting cultivation since 1980s,<br/>4. To determine the role of institution for prevention and control of shifting cultivation<br/>5. To assess the perception of local people toward shifting cultivation<br/>6. To assess the effects of crops under shifting cultivation on nutrients dynamics<br/>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>1. Why do farmers practice shifting cultivation?<br/>2. What is the effect of shifting cultivation on forest cover?<br/>3.What is the role of formal and informal institutions on control and prevention of shifting cultivation?<br/>4. How does nutrients and vegetation recovery vary on farms at different fallow periods?<br/>5. How does cultivation period and fallow age correlated to soil nutrient dynamics?<br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>This study is expected to bridge this information gap. The findings will contribute towards understanding of the dynamics of forest cover and soil nutrition in areas practicing shifting cultivation.<br/>Given the importance of trees to the environment and rural livelihoods, the need for empirical knowledge that will aid a systematic understanding of the impact of land use intensification through shifting agriculture, on tree populations, cannot be overemphasized.<br/>The study was a step in that direction. The importance of the study is that it will help to find out the abundance of uncultivated forestland and arable farmlands of different ages.<br/>This study will also help to ascertain the agriculture on tree diversity; and to determine the extent of tree species compositional variation between the uncultivated forestland and different chronosequences of cultivated lands; and lastly, to ascertain the extent of change in individual tree populations due to varying degrees of shifting cultivation.<br/>This study will also find out how farmers relate their farming practices to various environmental consequences. And how different crops under shifting cultivation affect soil nutrient?<br/>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is set out to find out the effect of shifting cultivation on agricultural land a case study of Ovia North East Local Government of Edo State.

It is situated in the western part of Nigeria, and it lies on the rain forest belt of the vegetation. Naturally, it is endowed with fertile land for the cultivation of crops. Agriculture is not only concerned with the cultivation of the soil for the production of crops. The main comprehensive definition is that agriculture is concerned basically with the husbandry of crops and animals for food and for commercial purposes. <br/>Mechanized farming plays a vital role in Edo State especially in the development of the secondary and tertiary sectors. During the pre-civil war in Nigeria, the predominant occupation in Edo State was agriculture and it was the main stay of the Nigerian economy. Besides other types of occupation existed, these are teaching, printing, trading etc but agriculture outplays them all. Farming can be traced to the earliest traditional societies although yet primitive they often gather wild fruits and roots for food and throw off the seeds in their surroundings. Though this process of trial and error, cultivation of crops started in the dwelling food and shelter are basic necessities for human existences and both originated from farming activities, workers in the secondary and tertiary relies on farming for their final output.<br/>Also, mechanized farming provides empowerment into agricultural opportunity to the labour force through direct employment into agricultural and its interrelated industries and manufacturing sectors. For this sector contribute efficiently, there is the implementation of good management, marketing, adequate returns to farmers and the better utilization of land available and provision of storage facilities. The failure of the country to adopt these innovative practices is accountable for the current food shortages, high prices, mass unemployment, under utilization of industrial result of this failure. Even though the nation progressed, the proportion of agricultural contribution to the gross domestic product becomes thinner because of the predominant peasant system of cultivation. The system is also characterized by the use of simple system is also characterized by the use of simple tools like fertilizers, chemicals and improved seeds are not widely used by most farmers.          <br/>The poor performances of the agricultural sector to provide adequate food for the growing population declining, productivity of most export crops which has contributed to substantial reduction in foreign exchange earnings and the declining condition of farming to gross domestic product in real terms. The report of the food strategy mission estimated that in 1982, the supply and demand for all food crops was about 2.5 million metric tones and the projected gap for 1985 was about 4.7 million metric tones. The study group on food production provided more detailed estimate of gaps between projected demand and supply for various commodities.

The country has become a large importer of palm oil for which she was well noted as one of the worlds exporter in previous years.   <br/>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>The major objective of this study is to;<br/>Examine the impact of mechanized farming in Oredo Local Government Area.<br/>Identify problems facing agriculture in the development of Oredo Local Government Area.<br/>Propose solutions to minimize such problem.    <br/>HYPOTHESIS OF THE STUDY <br/>Farming should be seen as the life were of economic development of any nation. Hence, our hypothesis for this study is stated as increased agricultural production influences economic development in Oredo Local Government and Nigeria at large. Also, we can state a null hypothesis as this increased agricultural production does not influence economic development in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.    <br/>NEED FOR THE STUDY <br/>We all know that the coming of oil has created structural distortions and disturbance in the economy and that on the run, the wheel of their progress can only smooth when the economy is based on mechanized farming. Apart from the shift of interest as a result of oil well, other problems that account for the decline are conservative attitude of farmer’s poor marketing facilities in rural area etc.  to the best of my knowledge this areas has not been exhaustively researched upon hence this study seeks to bridge the gap.  <br/>METHODOLOGY <br/>Primary and secondary data are used. These involve personal interview, observation and review of published materials in the form of journals, newspapers, handouts, reports and textbooks, for the purpose of gathering information for this work.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>The scope of this project cores the meaning, type of agriculture, impact of mechanized farming.<br/>STATEMENT OF  THE PROBLEM <br/>In this study, the investigator is being guided by the following research questions.<br/>Do you carryout mechanization farming?<br/>Government intervention is needed in agricultural production in Oredo.<br/>Farmers have the modern method of farming?<br/>Financial institution give loan without collateral<br/>Purchase modern implement for farming.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Mechanized: Of or pertaining to operation using machinery<br/>Agrarian: A person who advocated the political interests of working farmers.<br/>Plantation: Large farm, estate area of land designated for agricultural growth of ten includes housing for the owner and workers.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MECHANIZED FARMING IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT A CASE STUDY OF OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF MECHANIZED FARMING IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT A CASE STUDY OF OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE", "id": 160}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>FACTORS CHALLENGING PLANTATION AGRICULTURE IN EDO STATE: A CASE STUDY OF OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This study is about the factors challenging plantation agriculture in Edo state, A case study of Ovia North East Local Government Area. Several factors were identified that challenged plantation farm. example of such factors are lack of capital, use of old plantation, farm, unavailability of land, lack of adequate farm implements, lack of governmental support, access to market (transportation) lack of laborers, illiteracy, bad road, networks, poor cultural practices and land tenures system, climate condition e t c. A questionnaire approach was used to obtain data from farmer in Ovia North East Local Government Area. The result of this analysis shows that lack of capital was the main factor challenging plantation farming in Ovia North East Local Government Area. This project work focuses on the two major factors or types of plantation farming which are: Rubber plantation farming and Cocoa plantation farming. We will come to see the problems or the challenges that is affecting these two forms of plantation farming in Edo state, especially Ovia North East Local Government Area worthy of note, is that these factors are not only limited to cocoa and rubber plantation, but also affect other types of plantation farming in Edo State. Knowing these problems that affects cash-crop or plantation farming will expand our knowledge in putting solution to such challenges.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE   <br/>Introduction <br/>Background of the Study<br/>Statement of Problem<br/>Objectives of the Study<br/>Research Question<br/>Significance of the Study<br/>Scope of the Study<br/>Limitation of the Study<br/>Definition of Terms<br/>CHAPTER TWO <br/>Literature Review<br/>CHAPTER THREE         <br/>Research Methodology<br/>Design of Study<br/>Population of the Study<br/>Sampling and Sampling Techniques<br/>Research Instrument<br/>Administration of Research Instrument<br/>CHAPTER FOUR          <br/>Data Analysis<br/>CHAPTER FIVE           <br/>Summary Implication of Findings<br/>Recommendations<br/>REFERENCES     <br/>QUESTIONNAIRES     <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>Agriculture has always been the most important part of human history because we as individuals, family, industrial and the nation as a whole all depend on agriculture. Agriculture has played a long term activities in Nigeria in general, including Edo state in particular, in providing varieties of food and cash crops<br/>Cash-crop has actually played an important role in Edo state, in particular Ovia-north east local government area. Before the discovery of crude-oil, cash-crops such as, palm oil, rubber (latex), cocoa (cocoa beans) has always been boosting Nigeria from Brazil, it was an important cash-crop. Nigeria at then used to export large quantities of rubber, oil and cocoa. But in recent years, there has been a drastic reduction in rubber and cocoa production in Nigeria. A total 207,500, which represent 86% of the country’s land area under rubber cultivation on small holdings in 1966 declined to 147,200 hectares in 198. Recently, field survey showed that more than two thousand of the small holdings have been lost to other crops<br/>Presently rubber production in Nigeria has decreased and the rubber industries have continued to fold-up (Agra, 1986) the fact is that Nigeria as a nation is presently drifting from being the exporter of cash-crop (plantation produces) into a net importer in the nearest future. Something that is also missing is that Nigeria as a country and Edo State have chosen to forget the factors challenging plantation farming because of their newly found means of finance.<br/>For example, during 60’s (1960s) Nigeria used to have one of the best quantity and quality of cocoa but during year 2000 the quantity? The issue of fermentation was taken for granted cocoa was not permeated according to its normal process. Farmers in Ovia-North East Local Government Area no longer follow the processes of fermentation. Fermentation of cocoa is supposed to last for six (6) days, but the day of harvesting has turned into the day of drying pruning of cocoa trees is not views as important, removing of parasite –inspected pod is not followed regularly clearing around cocoa trees is no longer effective. All these vital principles have been left behind by farmers and also the government. That is why this project work is going to open our mind and broaden our knowledge on factors that is affecting plantation farming in Edo state under Ovia-north east local government of Nigeria<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/> There are a lot of factors affecting plantation farming in Edo state to be specific in Ovia-north east do not have the knowledge of plantation. Agriculture also the varieties of plantation farms within and around Ovia-north east shows that plantation farms are poorly managed due to lack of capital, orientation and literacy. The important question or issues is what is the reason for the drastic turn down or reduction in production of plantation produces, especially in Ovia-North East Local Government area of Nigeria<br/>1.3PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>The objectives of the studies are:<br/>The identify the problem of plantation farming in the study area<br/>To bring out the main challenges or factors so that farmers can easily identify it and put a solution to such problem<br/>To confirm the acclaimed decline in cocoa and rubber production in Ovia North East Local Government Area.<br/>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTION <br/>The study will be guide by the following<br/>What are the factors challenging plantation farming in ovia-north east local government area?<br/>What are the ways in which these factors can be improved?<br/>How can knowing the factors help in improving the present condition we find ourselves with regard to plantation farming?<br/>1.5 SIGNIFICANCEOF THE STUDY <br/>The purpose of the study lies in the fact that it will make the necessary suggestion and recommendation to government and plantation farmers (cocoa and rubber) about the problem of plantation farming.<br/>The importance of this study is based on the need to exploit other sources of earning foreign exchange for the country. Since the discovery of crude-oil plantation farming or agriculture has not been given serious attention by the government. This study will help to bring out the factor that is challenging plantation farming by analyzing every details affecting plantation farming so that any individual or farmer going into plantation agriculture will be able to succeed just by knowing the challenging he may encounter in the near future.<br/>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>The scope of the study will cover the problems or factors challenging plantation agriculture in Edo state, under Ovia-North East Local Government.<br/>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Plantation Agriculture: A large area of land, where crop such as coffee, cocoa rubber are grown<br/>Cocoa: this is a fruit tree that produces pod that are filled with beans<br/>Rubber: this is a tree that produces latex which is used in producing material such as cups, tyres, boots, electrical and gloves e t c.<br/><br/>\n\nFACTORS CHALLENGING PLANTATION AGRICULTURE IN EDO STATE: A CASE STUDY OF OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FACTORS CHALLENGING PLANTATION AGRICULTURE IN EDO STATE: A CASE STUDY OF OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA", "id": 161}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE PROBLEM AND PROSPECTS OF COCOYAM PRODUCTION IN OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/> It is a common practice in Nigeria and other West Africa Countries especially in area lying within the rainforest belt, with thick vegetation cover, the aim of management should be to avoid excessive and inadequate level of farming system and maintains sufficient for planting of cocoyam.

Cocoyam is vegetative propagated using the corms and to a lesser extent the cormels. As food for human consumption, the nutritional value parts of cocoyam is primarily caloric (Davis et al, 1992). The underground cormels provides easily digested starch; and the leaves are nutritious spinach like vegetable, which give a lot of minerals, vitamins and thiamine (Tambong et al, 1997).<br/>There are two major types commonly grown in Nigeria namely; colocasia spp and xanthosma spp. In Nigeria, it is regarded as a major crop especially in X2 female headed household. Nigeria is one of the largest producers of cocoyam in the world contributing about 40% of total annual production okinpshectares of land out of the total arable land of 27,900.00 hectares under cocoyam production.<br/>Cocoyam grows in association with other food and tree crops a system mostly practiced by subsistence farmers in Nigeria. The bulk of the production of cocoyam is in South East, Nigeria (Enyinnia, 2001). Cocoyam  is regarded as a major food crop in Nigeria especially in female headed households. Nwabuzor (2001) noted that cocoyam can be consumed in various forms when boiled, fried, pounded or roasted. It can also be processed into chips (“achicha”) which has a long shelf and provides food all year round especially during lean planting season (Asadu, 2006). Cocoyam leaves are also used as vegetable for preparing soup in various part of the world. There is a decline in the yields of cocoyam on the past few years. As population pressure on land continues to increases, the importance of cocoyam in ensuring household food security is given adequate recognition even through the present yield are still below expectation. This could be attributed to a lot of factors such as climate variation, drought, poor cultural practices among cocoyam growers, pest and diseases infestation (Ezenwu, 2010).<br/>Despite the usefulness of cocoyam corms and leaves in human nutrition, its production and processing in Nigeria is faced with a lot of challenges. Some of these challenges are the alarming rate of land degradation and lack of improved varieties for commercial cocoyam and leaf production. Decreasing rainfall and poor soil have also been identified as some of the challenges processing of cocoyam in Nigeria (Osagoe, 2006). Therefore, this study was carried out with the broad objective of ascertaining strategies for improving cocoyam production and processing among women farmers in Edo State, Nigeria.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>        In any human endeavour, there are bound to be some obstacle or hindrance in any of achieving exception to this general rule. Hence this research is designed to find out the problem and prospects of cocoyam production in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The main aim of the study is to examine and appraise the problem and prospects of cocoyam production in our society, a case study of Ovia North East Local Government Area.<br/>To know the number of farmer producing cocoyam in the local government area.<br/>To know the type of production system.<br/>Identifying problem of cocoyam production<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>        It is a common practice in Nigeria and other West Africa countries especially in area lying within the rainforest belt with thick vegetation cover, the aim of management should be avoid excessive and inadequate level of farming system and maintains enough stock raw materials in period of short supply and anticipate price changes.<br/>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>        This study is centred on planning of cocoyam in our local government council (Ovia North East) with more emphasis on cocoyam production.

They are rich in food stuff to man. The leaves are also used as vegetables in soups, while the peels are feeds to live stock and also the tuber are rich source of carbohydrate they are also found to contain some vitamins such as vitamin c and a well as some trace of phosphorous and iron.<br/>    The plant is woody and may grow up to the height of 1m to 4m depending on the variety. The main stems and the branches contain knoblike scar, which are the point of leaf attachment, many people both men and women have engage themselves in trading with cassava processed one way or the other.<br/>    And there are two types of cassava, differentiated by the prussic content (hydrocyanic acid contained in the tuber).<br/>i.             The sweet cassava:- this contain low level of poisonous prussic in the flesh of the tuber with high concentration in the peels<br/>ii.            The bitter cassava: - this contain high amount of prussic acid in the flesh of the tuber with lower concentration in peels.<br/>    But the farmers are able to cultivated or process them. Today (mamhot Escalante does not exist in the state spread plant important not exist in the mostly area)<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS <br/>    This study is to investigate various techniques of method of producing and processing cassava in Nigeria and also considers the various stages ranging from planting of stem cutting to the harvesting and finally processing of the products.<br/>    There are many problems encountered by both rural and urban farmers in relation to the production processing and storage of both the products and the implements.<br/> <br/>1.   Limited stem cutting i.e. Planting material<br/>2.   Inadequate land due to land tenure systems<br/>3.   Use of crude implements like cutlass, hoe etc<br/>4.   Pest and disease<br/>OBJECTIVES<br/>    Objectives of this project are:<br/>a.   To examine the problems<br/>b.   To find out the solution to some of the problems’<br/>c.   To investigate the production and utilization of cassava in south part of Nigeria and also identify the different forms in which cassava are processed into its various finished products like processing the cassava to garri or fufu e.t.c as a food for human consumption.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT <br/>1.   The research study will be useful to those  who are engaged directly or indirectly in the production and processing of cassava in south part of Nigeria in particular and the country as large<br/>2.   The study is designed to look into hoe the production of the farm in southern.

The shift in emphasis is informed by the fact that the local communities are inextricably tied to their cultural resources based whether used as a source of food, medicine, fuel or for maintaining ecological balance (Bisong, 2001) Thus, Sustainable management of natural resources requires a more comprehensive approach which include strengthening the organization and technical capabilities of rural communities, as well as engendering support for sustainable resources use from larger community group (Food and Agricultural Organization, 2005).<br/>The rapid loss of natural resources in developing countries has become a subject of increasing international and National Concern. This is reflected in the substantial increase in the interest accorded to environmental conservation by various governments, donors and conservation agencies. The level of interest in conservation as an environmental and   development problem requires practical action (Flint, 1990). the justification for community participation in natural resources conservation as viewed by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) 1990 provides that human culture must be based on a respect for nature and that the present generation have a social responsibility to conserved Nature for the welfare of future generation. The view recognizes that mankind is part of nature and that all species have an inherent right to exist regardless of their materials value to humans.<br/>In recent times, the development communities in African have moved from “top-down” approach towards more participatory “bottom up” approaches. The shift in paradigm has occurred in recognition of the fact that local cooperation, participation and management are crucial to achieving both short term development result and long-term sustainability. Along the same lines, the conservation community is beginning to appreciate the necessity of incorporating local participating in environmental conservation Efforts. (Bamberger 1986).<br/>The development, community participation may be viewed as a process that serves as instrument of empowerment, building beneficiary capacity, increase effectiveness desire to share cost, improve efficiency in relation to project (Paul, 1987).<br/>To maximize the chances of sustainable conservation initiatives, rural communities need to be involved in both the concept and approach. This means that participation in decision-making process and in the evaluation, monitoring and management of resources and the environment is crucial.<br/>This inclusiveness is more likely to build a conservation ethics where people understand that their livehood depends on healthy maintenance of the environment.<br/>Many studies have shown community participation to be one of the critical empowerment of success is irrigation, livestock, water, forestry and agriculture projects (Sharp, 1984) community participation has become therefore very important to scholars, organizations and Nations. For instance, Ajake (1998) remarked that participation has been used to justify the extension of state forest control as well as the building of local capacity and self-reliance. It has been used to justify decision imposed by external agencies as well as describe the process of developing real power and decision making.<br/>Experience has shown that participation grows more out of practical than normative considerations. One of the most expensive forestry programmes with community participation is that operated by village forestry associations in South Korea (AHN 1978; Eckholm, 1979) and the afforestation sub-project in Nepal (World Bank, 1975). Other experiences include community conservation in Tsavo West National park, Kenya where the local communities are involved and have benefited from conservation of protected areas. A reforestation project in Senegal gained impressive results as Senegal forest service works in rural community and councils providing them with inputs, while the village councils contribute labour to plant trees. Income generated from the sale of wood was used by the council according to its own priorities (Uphoft, 1986).<br/>The need for communities to invest in natural resources conservation and to reduce the effect of environmental degradation is indisputable in Nigeria and particularly in Akamkpa Local Government Area of Cross River State. The people in the study area are highly dependent on forest ecosystem for its diverse and abundant Natural wildlife, land, food and water resources. The importance of these resources has caused indigenous people to diverse way of managing them sustainably. But evidence has shown that the activities of the rural people are not given consideration. In research and government policies and decisions on the management of Natural resources neglects their activities in the study area. <br/> Theoretical Framework <br/>The following theories are considered relevant to this research.<br/>Socio-cultural theory<br/>Administrative Management theory<br/>Citizen participation theory<br/>Socio-mobilization theory<br/> Socio-Cultural Theory <br/>The socio-cultural theory of sustainability has some underlying assumptions such as “that any location of a group of people (village, hamlet, town or city etc) is a social system with interrelated subsets or social components (such as human beings, forest, water bodies, with all their faunal compositions. That ethnical values beliefs and institutions should develop with socio-cultural systems to meet human needs.<br/>Developing sustainable social and cultural practices to help manage natural resources is major challenge confronting socio-cultural systems. This is obvious as most socio-cultural systems over the world have come to realize the need to no longer neglect the issues of intra-generational and intergenerational equity.<br/>The socio-cultural theory of management recognizes the participation of the social actions and their institutions in sustainable use and management of natural resources National resources management practices must be “Socially constructed” to take cognizance of community participation that relies on the ethics, values, belief and traditional institutions insuring sustainability of the environment. The socio-cultural theory does not specifically offer a pathway to sustainability of natural resources rather, the theory encourages the formation of poise-modus operandi-which could point the ways to attaining the much desired sustainable use of natural resources.<br/>More so, since the theory emphasized the inter-relationship between human beings and the resources of their environment, it will enhance the understanding of the interaction of the main variables of the study such as community participation in land, water and forest resources conservation, as well as the people’s attitude towards the natural resources management practice.<br/> 1.2.2 Administrative Management Theory <br/>The theory was an offshoot of classical scientific management theories of Henri Fayol, et al. The theory describes efforts to define the universal functions of managers of resources and principles that contribute to good management practice. It concentrates on issues of formal structural principles, determination of objectives, group activities, delegation of authority responsibility and establishment of formal relations amongst works. According to the theory, all mangers perform five management function such as plan, organize, command, coordinate and control.<br/>The emphasis of this theory is the determination of objectives which is recognized as a primary role of any community, organization, institution and association. This is because such determination will facilitate the consideration of organizational and managerial priorities, which a community can adopt especially in key areas, roles and activities.<br/>Furthermore, the theory recognizes division of labour as the basis of efficiency. This means that emphasis should be placed on the most effective management grouping of specialist functions in natural resources management. The principles of division of labour imply that where necessary the whole set of job specifications, formulate blueprints, standing operation procedures including large number of statements that specify the conditions under which the activity will be performed, have to be issued by management.<br/>The administrative theory has been applied in several studies (Silas, 2007: Iheijiamaizu, 1996). It is relevant to this study of natural resources management, particularly in the use of hierarchy principles of grouping or division of labour, specification as well as delegation of responsibilities for effective implementation and management of the various resource considered by the study. This theory calls for holistic approach to natural resources management by ensuring that all stakeholders of a particular environment (such as traditional people, timber dealers, non-timber products extractors, women, children, government and all its agents, among others) are made to be conscientiously involved in the effective implementation of management strategies or programmes.<br/>This theory emphasized the principle of balance, stability and flexibility this suggest that the communities where the management activities are carried out would experience development in proportion to its contribution to the overall success of the objectives of resources management. The government, non governmental organizations (NGOs) and communities who are stakeholder of environmental resources should ensure that authority and responsibilities should be shared amongst them. This will enhance understanding of the interrelationship of the components on natural resources management options.<br/> 1.2.3 Citizen Participation theory <br/>        Citizen participation theory was propounded by Kreitlow in 1960. The theory stipulates that the local people should take part in the planning, execution, utilization and assessment of social amenities or facilities designed to improve their welfare. This theory is deeply rooted in the very concept of community which enjoins that whatever is done to improve the welfare of a people must Endeavour to elicit the enthusiasm and participation of such a people.<br/>        The theory of citizen’s participation emphasized on greater equity and democracy and ownership of and responsiveness towards community projects. It also describes the act of allowing individual citizens and groups within a community to take part in the issues that affect their community.<br/>        Citizen participation emphasizes the initiative of the people as a mean of stimulating the active participation of all citizens in the work of community development. This implies that the stimulus needed for the success of environmental conservation projects has to come both from the people themselves and from government authorities or donor agencies.<br/>        It is the development of democratic participation within the community that enables the people to appreciate the spirit of self-help in the execution of their programmes.<br/>        Citizen participation creates faith in common understanding it enhances the possibility of success in the execution of projects designed for better living in communities. This theory is most relevant since it gives the people greater opportunities to be included in decision making, planning and implementation of decisions on management of natural resources available in their communities.<br/> Social Mobilization Theory <br/>The theory of social mobilization was postulated by Oduaran in 1989. It involves the pooling of resources for an effective operation. Oduaran (1989) postulated that mobilization primarily consists of movement of drives or campaigns specifically designed to activate the people into accelerated process of change. According to Akin Pele (1988), mobilization is an essential Ingredient in the conception and implementation of any programmes tailored to development.<br/>        The theory of mobilization in its literal Usage has a military connotation. An army, for example, has to mobilize for a military campaign. This entails the mustering and coordinating of all the resources that can ensure success of the operations with a view to getting them combat ready.<br/>        The implication of the theory of mobilization for participation in environmental conservation development is that the involvement of the people themselves in the planning and execution of any enterprise affecting them, whatever size and scope, should be sought. This is necessary because in any such enterprise whether it involves a mass campaign or a small-scale programme. Opportunities must be provided for the people themselves to learn. Social mobilization cannot succeed with mere symbols or slogans. It must involve structural changes in the pattern of life of the people. It’s success cannot be measured by any amount of sentiments put into it, rather social mobilization has to be measured in terms of the actual activities it may have generated towards improving the welfare of citizens.<br/>1.3    Statement of the Problem <br/>Rapid degradation of natural resources globally, nationally and locally has continued to be a subject of concern and uncertainty among scholars. For instance, the rate of forest destruction has accelerated, significantly since the turn of the century. This is most critical in the tropics where over 2.5 billion people depend on forest resources for a variety of services (Park 1992; Sharma, 1992; Tyani, 2007).<br/>Cunningham and Cunningham (2004) report that an estimated 12.5 million Km of tropical forest lands were covered with closed canopy forest a century ago and 9.2million ha or 0.6 percent of the remaining forest is cleared each year. However the rate of forest lost at the global level is not significantly different from the current trend in Nigeria and Cross River State. Nwoboshi (1987) reported that forest clearance in Nigeria is put at an average of 400,000 ha per annum, while afforestation has only 32,000 ha annually.<br/>The cumulative effect of these is that the country has lost 50 million of forest in less than 100 years. Ajake (2008) observed in Cross River State that between 2000-2005, about 20,000ha of reserved areas were converted to agricultural plantation. Natural resources conservation may be facilitated by the application of the existing knowledge of rural communities on the sustainable use and management of forest, wildlife and water resources. This knowledge can be supplemented by research initiative to fill crucial gaps in understanding the system linkages.<br/>In recent decades it has been recognized that conservation regimes have failed to manage resources in a sustainable way because of their rigidity and have deprived local communities of the motivation to use and manage resources in a sustainable way. This may be attributed to the non-recognition and participation of indigenous communities whose livelihood depends on such resources and are the custodian of the natural landscapes.<br/> 1.4    Purpose of the Study <br/>The purpose of this study is to determine the extent of community participation in environmental conservation in Akamkpa local Government Area.

Several factors were identified as causes of this trend; such as lack of capital, use of old plantations, unavailability of land, price of latex etc. a questionnaires approach was used to obtain data from the farmers in Owan West LGA of Edo State. This was subjected to analysis based on stipulated hypothesis drawn from the questionnaires. The result of this analysis showed that lack of capital was not responsible for low production of rubber in Owan West LGA. Also, market prices of rubber products had no effect on low rubber production. However, government policies were identified as a cause of low production of rubber in Owan West LGA. Therefore, the government should promulgate policies that will encourage rubber production in Owan West LGA and Nigeria. <br/>  TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>Chapter One           <br/>1.1             Introduction <br/>1.2             Background of study <br/>1.3             Purpose of study <br/>1.4             Research questions <br/>1.5             Hypothesis <br/>1.6             Significance of the study <br/>Chapter Two <br/>Literature review <br/>2.1             Plant profile <br/>2.2             Natural rubber production <br/>2.3             Rubber production trend in Nigeria <br/>2.4             Nigeria natural rubber industry <br/>2.5             Why Nigeria should rehabilitate <br/>2.6             Rubber plantation <br/>Chapter Three        <br/>3.1             Method of study <br/>3.2             Research design <br/>3.3             Population of study <br/>3.4             Sample and sampling procedure <br/>3.5             Instrumentation <br/>3.6             Hypothesis <br/>3.7             Validity and reliability of instruments <br/>3.8             Administration of instruments <br/>3.9             Method of data analysis<br/>Chapter Four          <br/>4.1             Presentation of data analysis and discussion of results <br/>4.2             Test of hypothesis <br/>Chapter Five           <br/>5.1             Summary of Findings, Conclusion and Recommendation   <br/>5.2             Conclusion <br/>5.3             Recommendation <br/>References<br/>Questionnaires     <br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1             INTRODUCTION <br/>Rubber plant (Hevea Brasiliensis) was introduced from Brazil to Nigeria around 1895. It is a variety of plant of the genus Hevea (euphorbiaceae) family, native to Brazil. It commonly known as the rubber tree rubber is an important cash crop which contributed sustainably to the Nigerian economy prior to the oil boom. (Aghimien, 1997). <br/>            In recent years, there has been a drastic reduction in rubber production in Nigeria. A total of 207,500 which represented 86.0% of the country’s land area under rubber cultivation on small holdings in 1966, declined to 147,200 hectares in 1980. Recent field surveys showed that more than two thousand of the small holding has been lost to other crop. <br/>            Presently, rubber production in Nigeria has decreased and the rubber industries have continued to fold-up (Agra, 1986).      <br/>1.2             BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>Natural rubber performed three main functions in the Nigerian economy; firstly it provided some of the foreign exchange and placed Nigeria in the world map as an exporter of rubber products. Lastly it provided employment for a sizeable segment of the rural populace. The situation in Nigeria presently pretends a drift from beings a major exporter of rubber products into becoming a net importer in the nearest future. The important question or issue is what are the reasons for the observed down turn or reduction in productivity of rubber, especially I Owan West LGA of Edo State. <br/>1.3             PURPOSE OF STUDY <br/>This research was undertaken for the following reasons. <br/>a.                  To confirm the acclaimed decline in rubber production in Owan-West LGA. <br/>b.                  To ascertain the level of decline in rubber production in Owan West LGA. <br/>c.                  To determine the causes of decline in rubber production solution to the problems resulting in these decline.  <br/>1.4             RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>Considering the aforementioned purpose of this research, the following research questions are proposed as a guide in this study. <br/>a.                  What are the major reasons for decline in rubber production in Owan West LGA? <br/>b.                  How much of rubber plantations have been substituted with food crops or other cash crops. <br/>c.                  What is the level of market forces impact on rubber production<br/>d.                 Are farmers still interested in cultivating rubber in Owan West LGA? <br/>e.                  How willing are farmers to rehabilitate their rubber plantation. <br/>f.                   What steps could be taken by farmers to facilitate rubber production. <br/>g.                  What role could the government and non-government agencies play in encouraging rubber production.   <br/>1.5             HYPOTHESIS <br/>This study was considered on the basis of the following assumptions; <br/>Ho: Capital has no effect on the low production of rubber in Owan West LGA. <br/>H1: capital has effect on the low production of rubber in Owan-West LGA. <br/>Ho: Government policies has effect on the productivity of rubber in Owan West LGA. <br/>H1: Government policies has no effect o the productivity of rubber in Owan West LGA. <br/>Ho: Poor market prices of rubber products has no effect on the production of rubber in Owan West LGA. <br/>H1: Poor market prices of rubber products ahs effect on the production of rubber in Owan West LGA. <br/>1.6             SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>This research which is basically investigating will help to achieve the following: <br/>a.                  Give details of factors responsible for low production of rubber in Owan West LGA. <br/>b.                  It will reveal the perception of farmers on the decline of rubber production. <br/>c.                  It will help proffer solutions to these factors. <br/>d.                 It will be a working tool for both government and non-governmental agencies on how to tackle the decline in rubber production. <br/>   <br/>\n\nTHE REASONS FOR LOW PRODUCTION OF RUBBER IN EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE REASONS FOR LOW PRODUCTION OF RUBBER IN EDO STATE", "id": 166}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF REARING POULTRY IN IKPOBA OKHA L. G. A. EDO STATE <br/>  ABSTRACT</b><br/>          Poultry production has in no small way helped to develop- the community and people of Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area, mostly in Idogbo the local government headquarters. This study however, examined the prospects and equally analysed the problems and finally came to a conclusion that with the various findings which include the outbreak of various diseases, inadequate capital and finance, and the increasing nature of the cost of poultry feed jointly hinder the progress of poultry production in Idogbo the headquarters of Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area.     <br/>          Also discovered was the attitude of youths towards farming in the area. However, in this project useful recommendations and solutions have been proffered from the result of the study. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>Chapter One      <br/>Introduction <br/>1.1       Background of information <br/>1.2       Statement of problem <br/>1.3       Purpose of the study <br/>1.4       Limitation of the study <br/>1.5       Statement of hypothesis <br/>1.6       Scope of the study <br/>1.7       Significance of the study <br/>1.8       Definition of terms <br/>Chapter Two     <br/>Literature Review <br/>Prospect of poultry production <br/>Problem of poultry production<br/>Chapter Three <br/>Methodology <br/>3.1       Research Design <br/>3.2       Population <br/>3.3       Sample of t he study <br/>3.4       Instrument <br/>3.5       Validation of the instrument<br/>3.6       Administration of questionnaires <br/>3.7       Method of data analysis   <br/>Chapter Four     <br/>Data presentation/Analysis <br/>Chapter Five      <br/>Summary, Conclusion and Recommendation<br/>Bibliography     <br/>Questionnaire             <br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1         BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>Poultry generally is referred to all domestic birds raised by man for the production of eggs, meat and other benefits for human consumption. The domestic birds include fowl ducks, turkey, guinea fowl and geese., poultry products have been found to have the highest protein concentrate of about 20.5% relative to others success of protein (animals) and has the shortest production cycle of all animals. <br/>Production cycle involves all the activities in the rearing of livestock from day old to maturity. For example, to achieve a ten-fold increase in the body weight in relation to weight at bird, Williamson and Payne (1978) outlined that it takes 25 days in broiler, 48 days in piglets, 250 days in caves and 170 days in sheep. <br/>The rearing of pigs, cattle’s and goats however requires extensive kind more than poultry where more units of production can be achieved from a given space compared to the farmer. These advantages are perhaps the cause of a higher turnover in poultry production at reasonably short period of time in this work more emphasis shall be made specifically to the domestic fowl, which are the major birds for commercial and nutritional importance in Ikpoba Okha Local Government of Edo State.  Poultry rearing have been in practice in Ikpoba Okha for a long time. The traditional motive varies from hobby to the use of fowl and eggs as food. Apart from the important roles that the fowl play in the traditional workshop of duties in many parts of the states, some communities use it as gift to their neighbours in appreciation of a good deed and as a mark of solidarity.<br/>The traditional poultry keeping is generally subsistence in outlook without the use of modern scientific methods. Hence the birds under this system are poorly cared for and they are characterized by slow growth rate, poor feed utilization and low productivity. The birds are also exposed to high mortality rate as a result of diseases, pest and bad weather conditions.<br/>However, inspite of the popularity of commercial poultry keeping, the subsistence and the small-scale units are still prevalent all over the place especially in the villages. Although the commercially oriented poultry units are abundant all over the state with varying modern scientific approach to production poultry output continues to be inadequate with prices above the reach of the common man.<br/>This paper will therefore focus attention on the problems and prospect of poultry production in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of Edo state.<br/>1.2         STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>In Nigeria, the business of poultry farming is concentrated in the hands of few individual partly because of the complex problems such as finance and climatic condition while others are problem of poultry processing and storage facility.<br/>In Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area, there had been retrogression in poultry production due to illiteracy in the maintenance of records. Hence maintenance of record helps the farmer to determine the process of retrogressing nature of the farm. Besides, it helps in making future project, planning and programming in poultry industry. Most farmers either as a result of illiteracy, training or otherwise are unable to keep records. The result is that most extension officers are unable to help them out of their problems due to lack of information.<br/>1.3         PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>The purpose of this study is to investigate the problems encountered by poultry farmers in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area and suggest solutions to them. <br/>1.4         STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS <br/>The ultimate goal of the government or individuals engaged in poultry production today is to achieve a high standard of production with a view of increasing animal products for the ever-increasing populace.<br/>In an attempt to producer enough poultry products {meat and eggs} several problems and constrains have been identified. Some of these problems include finance, quality feeds, disease problems and poor housing condition.<br/>1.5         SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This research work will focus attention to cover Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of Edo state. The information obtained here will only strictly apply to Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area but may be generalized to other parts of the state with similar problems and prospects of rearing poultry. Also efforts would be made to cover as much of the local government area as possible.<br/>1.6         SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>It is hoped that the recommendation based on the findings of the study would be of tremendous benefit to the poultry producers, the consumers of poultry products alike and the student’s researchers.<br/>It is anticipated that inexperienced poultry farmers can from this study identify as well as provide them with the basic information needed to raise and manage poultry successfully. Top the consumers, an increase in poultry products means meeting their eggs and poultry meat needs.<br/>It is believed that the research findings would help students who intend to research in a similar topic to have ideas on what the topic is all about and also aid students in the area of further studies.<br/>1.7         DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>1.            Poultry: This is the term used for all domesticated birds such as chicks, ducks, turkey, guinea fowl etc.<br/>2.            Broiler: These are chickens raised for meat production.<br/>3.            Layers: layers refer to hens that are kept for egg production.<br/>4.            Battery cage system: This is a system of poultry keeping where the birds are confined in a specially designed house.<br/>5.            Deep litter system: This is a system where the birds are kept in a permanent house.<br/>6.            Free-range system: This is where birds are allowed to move freely on the range and feed themselves.<br/>7.            Hatchery: This is an aspect of poultry where day old chicks are produced mainly by artificial incubation.<br/>8.            Veterinary: A surgeon concerned with diseases of animals and domestic animals.<br/>  <br/>\n\nproduction problem and prospect of rearing poultry<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " production problem and prospect of rearing poultry", "id": 167}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE IN THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF EDO STATE<br/>A CASE STUDY OF OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA<br/>  ABSTRACT</b><br/>The purpose of this research is to identify the role of agriculture in the economic development of Edo State: a case study of Oredo Local Government Area.

Large number of people engages themselves in agriculture for food and income in other to increase their standard of living. Agricultural sector is the earliest occupation of the economy in the history of mankind. Therefore following the trace of the history of agriculture it is obvious that agriculture started from when man stung from place to place gathering ruffle and animals to satisfy his immediate needs. As at that time man had three (3) basic necessities in life, these are matter, air and food has to be provided by man himself. Man at first feed himself on edible roots, small animals which he caught later on, due to the advent of urbanization, man gradually learnt a primitive way of planting, cultivating and harvesting crops and rearing of animal for food as well as for hunger, for clothing and shelter.<br/>          Agriculture later developed to such on extent that the role cannot be over stressed from the rural way of farming, it move a step further to involve the use of agricultural mechanism. But it is natural that the people of Oredo Local government Area of Edo State still use primitive and crude implements for farming because of the protection of lack of capital, low level of education, lack of infrastructure and so on. Agricultural development in Oredo Local Government Area gives provides food for the over growing labour force, raw materials also provide income for people, it could noted that 75% of the population are engaged in agriculture and derives its income directly or indirectly from farm. Agriculture later developed to growing of food crop and cash crops such as cocoa, rubber, oil palm and food crops such as yam, corn, cassava, etc. this different types of occupation exist in Oredo Local Government Area these include trading, teaching, sports builders, but agriculture suppress them all. Before the discovery of crude oil agriculture contributed the lions share to Nigeria foreign exchange in 1960 the highest foreign exchange earning came from agriculture sector.<br/>          During oil boom in 1974 the sector contribution depreciated to 27% and 18% respectively. Despite the billion of naira spent on operation feed the nation and the area revolution programme. Yet we still import food in spite of the amount invested on agriculture for the two periods. These happened due to the poor attitude towards farming.    <br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM  <br/>          So far, it is difficult to find a sector that is problem free. Hence, the agriculture sector cannot be expected from the economic role of Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State. Some of the problems include:<br/>i.                   Poor transportation, which affects the economic development in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>ii.                 The use crude implement in Oredo Local Government Area.<br/>iii.              To analyze the economic role of agriculture in the economy of Oredo Local Government Area.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY   <br/>          It is obvious that the significance of the study is to identify the role of agriculture in the economic development of Oredo Local Government Area and to find possible ways in increasing output and infrastructure that will facilitate the economic development of Oredo Local Government Area through agriculture.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY     <br/>          The study is only to some selected areas in Oredo Local Government Area, Edo State.<br/>i.                   Okhuesan<br/>ii.                 Udukpa<br/>iii.              Ikeken<br/>iv.              Ahia<br/>v.                 Eko<br/>This is to examine the meaning, type of agriculture, problems and solution of agriculture in the economic development of Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>  <br/>\n\nROLE OF AGRICULTURE IN THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ROLE OF AGRICULTURE IN THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ", "id": 168}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA<br/> (A CASE STUDY OF UNION BANK)<br/> ABSTRACT</b><br/>The research on the financial institutions in agricultural development in Nigeria” A case study of Union Bank Plc was necessitated by the fact that the agriculture development has been on issue of great concern in Nigeria. The financial institutions particularly Union Bank Plc has played to the development of this sector are critically examined in the study. The study is also aware of the pass role of agriculture in the development process when cocoa and rubber products were our major source of revenue. The purpose of the study includes ways in which the Nigeria agriculture and financial institutions particularly Union Bank Plc have been trying to revamp the agricultural sectors, highlighting some of the problems which prevent the full realization of objectives of Union Bank Plc and finding solution to some of its problems. The research also includes the procedure methods used in collecting data and other important information. The primary data method is the first method used to collect data. All the information gathered in this method were mainly through personal interview. The other method termed participant observation affords the one opportunity to watch the social settings and attitudes of the people under references. Finally, the work has tried to examine the problems militating against small scale farmers and the full realization of Union Bank Plc objectives is agricultural development. Some policy recommendations that will help improve agricultural sector were made, these include the best policy formulation aimed at revitalizing the agricultural loans, increased rural banking (new branches and mobile banking scheme) favourable agricultural produce marketing policies, adequate infrastructural development and agriculture research and extension services.  Also for policies to succeed, state government and their agencies are required to pay their loan in time so as to make the bank program work. Debts to Union Bank should be promptly paid without their liquidity will be adversely affected and of course limits the recycling of loanable funds. All these when needed in policy making will enhance sound agricultural development through the role of financial institution.<br/>  TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION      <br/>Background of the study<br/>Objectives of the study<br/>Statement of the problem<br/>Scope of the study<br/>CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW   <br/>Agricultural credit in Nigeria<br/>Problem of financing the rural sector<br/>Agriculture by banking<br/>Agricultural credit development<br/>Objectives of the bank<br/>Function of the bank<br/>CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY         <br/>Population size<br/>Method of data collection<br/>Research instrument<br/>Method of data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR:       <br/>PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF DATA<br/>Presentation of data and Analysis of data<br/>CHAPTER FIVE:        <br/>SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION  <br/>Summary of findings<br/>Conclusion<br/>Recommendation<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY        <br/>QUESTIONNAIRES             <br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>          Agricultural developments in Nigeria were established during the third National Development Plan (1975-1980) to enhance agriculture and food production. These are World Bank assisted projects consisting of an input delivery and credit supply system.<br/>          However the role of financial institution in agricultural development involves ways and means by which a farmer obtains the entire necessary fund required in order to carry out agricultural production. And it also deals with the supply of demand for funds in agricultural sector of the economy. Where a farmer has a sufficient capital of his own to carry out farm production he can then obtain credit from the best available sources.<br/>Agricultural finance is playing significant role in the development of the agricultural sector because adequate fiancé is required by farmers to establish economic size farms or large scale farms, and to expand existing farms. Adequate finance also brings significant changes in the structure of agriculture. This is because finance enables the acquisition of machinery and farm equipment to substitute labour use and the purchase of other farm inputs.<br/>          The use of finance in farming leads to rapid increase in farm land value which necessitates the farmers to look outward for fund.<br/>          Agricultural finance from co-operative societies is very important in communities where credit institutions such as commercial banks are lacking; farmers who belong to a co0operative society can often get inputs against liens over produce for sale through the societies. Credit it normally limited to goods and services, but cash loans are sometimes made.<br/>          Therefore, agricultural fiancé is development are has been made mandatory in Nigeria through government directives on rural banking and the lending of a certain percentage of the banks loanable fund or deposit to agricultural sector of the economy.<br/>          As a result of the Nigeria enterprises 1972, the federal government of Nigeria acquired banks shares.<br/>However, agriculture is very important in most developing countries.<br/>          The purpose of agricultural or land Banks is to help in the development of agriculture with the supply of credit. It requires to provide short and long term loans to farmers to carry our agricultural production.<br/>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY         <br/>          The objectives of this study are<br/>1.     To examine the impact role of financial institutions in agricultural development<br/>2.     To examine why there is decline in agricultural production<br/>3.     To examine the ways and means by which a farmer obtains all the necessary fund required in order to carry out agricultural production<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>          The following are some of the statement of problem<br/>1.     The low educational background of some of he farmers makes it difficult for majority of the farmers to get information about the existing credit facilities and the procedure involved in getting such loans<br/>2.     Farmers in some cases do not get their disbursement from the ministries loan units in good time for finely operation<br/>3.     Inadequate supervision of individual farmers bring about difficulty in recovery loans that has been given to farmers<br/>4.     State agencies do not reach the number of farmers originally targeted<br/>5.     Funds to other project that is not originally included in the programme without due consultation bring about difficult in loan recovery<br/>6.     Most, farmers do not have the required collateral to obtain loan<br/>7.     There are many loan defaulters and this prevents other farmers from benefiting<br/>8.     Too many risks in farming.

There is basically no aspect of economic development in Ondo State that one cannot find women. A review of feminist literature, indicate that there is now a demand for re-orientation of research and change in methodological procedures used for complication of national statistics so as to reflect accurately the position of women and their labour in the national economy in general and Ondo State in particular. On the realization of the role women play in our daily life, it is therefore necessary to identify the role as a point of reference. It is on this basic aim prompted as a research to go into the findings. The objective of this project work therefore is to highlight the role of rural women farmers in Ese Odo Local Government Area of Ondo State with a view to identifying attendant problem and indicating necessary recommendation. Attention is focused on the rural women farmers in the economic activities through agricultural, strategies are indicated for using women as a catalyst for employment generation and for solving Ese-Odo Local Government Area food agriculture and economic development problem.

A review of feminist literature indicate that there is now a demand for re-orientation of research and changes in methodological procedures used for complication of national income. There are at least three stands to this firstly; there is the issue that a considerable portion of women’s labour is not reflection in Ese-Odo Local Government statistics. This is a phenomenon due to the fact that the labour of the house wife is not traded and valued at market prices.<br/>          Secondly, there is the formal versus informal sector issue. On a world wide basis, but more so in the developing countries of the world women constitute the greater percentage of the informal sector labour forces. Thirdly, there is the rural-urban dichotomy more of ten than not, women are left behind when there is male migration from rural to urban areas. These three issues are mutually self explanatory as women get left behind in the rural areas. They have limited opportunities for self improvement. They are therefore suitable mainly informal sector employment. Their labour as house wives, house maids etc is not accurately affected in nation statistics. Another relevant issue is that where women are in selection for religions or social reasons, enumerators who are more often men cannot meet the women to accurately appraise their labour input.<br/>PURPOSE OF STUDY <br/>          The objective of this paper is therefore to highlight the role of women in economic development of Ese-Odo Local Government Area in Ondo State with view to identifying attendant problem and suggesting possible solution.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS    <br/>          The basic premise of this essay is that the non involvement or marginalization of women in development programmes is wasteful and impedes effective economic development. Its effect is similar to inadequate use of factor of production in agriculture which means that the production possibilities curve is lower than it should be on the basis of this premise, the problem associated with the involvement of women in the economic development of Ondo State and strategies of solving these problems are discussed.<br/>HYPOTHESIS <br/>H1: Rural women farmers have significant economic contribution to the economic development of Ese Odo Local Government Area of Ondo State. <br/>ORGANIZATION OF WORK <br/>          The entire work I this project is divided into five chapters, chapter one is introduction, while chapter two review the literature of economic development, chapter three contain the methodological approach of the role of women in economic development in Ese Odo Local Government Area of Ondo State and the finding of what role women played which are not identified as economic development chapter four is discussion, while the last chapter of this project gives the summary of findings, conclusion and policy recommendations.<br/> <br/>\n\nTHE ROLE OF RURAL WOMEN FARMERS ON THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF ONDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF RURAL WOMEN FARMERS ON THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF ONDO STATE", "id": 170}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY IN FOOD CROP PRODUCTION IN UHUNMWODE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE, NIGERIA<br/> ABSTRACT</b><br/>This project is based on the technical efficiency in food crops production in Uhunmwode Local Government Area of Edo State. Data were collected from fifty food crops production farmers to ascertain the effectiveness and enhancement of technical efficiency in food crops production. The result showed that family labour, hired labour and material input were the prime factors responsible for the change in output of food crops production. A range of technical efficiency was observed across the sampled farms. The best farm has technical efficiency of 40%while the worse farm has a technical efficiency of 10%. This was attributed to the improper usefulness of available resources. At this juncture, the researcher recommended that government should implement policies and programmes that are favourable to farmers or enhanced technical efficiency of food crops production.<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUTION<br/>BACKGROUND OF STUDY <br/>          Food consumption accounts for a larger percentage of household expenditure in Nigeria. It was estimated that about 50% of the total expenditure of house hold in Nigeria in 1994 was on food consumption but this figure increased to about 72% in 1995.<br/>          An increased in population figure especially in the urban centres exert more pressure on demand for food consumption by the populace. In other words, an increase in population will eventually lead to an increased in demand for food consumption.<br/>          In view of this assertion, farmers will need to improve more or exploit more of their potentials in food production so that output could be maximized to meet the ever growing demand for food by the increasing population in Nigeria. The federal ministry of agriculture (200) estimated that the annual food supply would have to increase at an average annual rate of 59 percent to meet food demand and reduce food importation.<br/>          Studies conducted have shown that aggregate food production has been growing at about 2.5% per annum in recent years in Nigeria, but the annual rate of population has been on the high side up to the tune of 2.9%(Olayemi, 2002). The implication is that Nigeria as a country has not been able to be independent relation to food production despite the increasing resource being shifted into food production annually.<br/>          It is anticipated that demand for food will continue to grow in developing countries (e.g Nigeria). Because global demand for food per person is below the expected and has lead to food shortage or food insufficient in these countries (Fergie et al 2008).<br/>          Nigeria farmers have tried to increase food production to meet the ever growing population in two ways:<br/>1. The area under cultivation is increased<br/>2. Production on existing farm land<br/>These two ways or methods are mutually exclusive and both have been employed to increased the food production and reduce food shortages in Nigeria. Although it have been noted that productivity on existing on existing farmland have been preferable in area where land is scarce to unavailability of it. It avoids green house emission associated with bringing new land into production and large scale of disruption of existing ecosystems. But the method have failed to yield the maximum results due to inabilities of the farmers to technically efficient.<br/>          In this study, efforts is being put at informing the public on the technical efficiently (i.e combination agricultural sector) of the production in their bid to increase food supply in response to population.<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>          The militating factors to the growth of food production have been attributed mainly to low yield of crop resources management. An upward movement in the efficiency of farmers in food crops production could definitely lead to improvement in the standard of living and drastic production in the poverty level of farmers and food insecurity.<br/>The problem therefore is why has farmers technical efficiency not enough not enough factor in solving the problem of food security in the country? It is therefore in line with this question that this project investigate the technical efficiency in food crops production in Uhunmwode Local Government Area of Edo State to find out the factor that is negating the technical efficiency of farmer in food crop production in the study area.<br/>          (Adeyemi 2001) observed in his past studies that decline in food crops production can never be attributed to lack of finance on the part on government but to knowledge gap that exist among  the factors in the country.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>          The objective of the study is to basically assess the farmer in Uhunmwode Local Government Area of Edo State in the following areas: <br/>1.To assess the effectiveness of the efficiency used by farmer in food crops production in Uhunmwode Local Government Area so as to maximize output to meet the ever growing for food.<br/>2.  To determine the extent to which efficient food crops production can lead to an improvement in the standard of living of the farmers.<br/>3.    To ascertain the level of steady increased in food crops production such as beans, rice, yam, etc.<br/>4.   To generate information on ways to achieve a steady but regular increment in food crops among the farmers.<br/>5.  To determine strategy to be employed in reducing the poverty level of the farmers and also a reduction in food insecurity in Uhunmwode Local Government Area.<br/>6.  To         identify some of the challenge and problems faced by the farmers in food crops production  in Uhunmwonde Local Government Area<br/>1.4    RESEACH QUESTIONS<br/>          The study tends to engage the farmers with the following questions. How effective has your efficiency been in food crops production? Can an increase in the efficiency used lead to an improvement in your standard of living? What is your level of steady increament in food crops? If the level of increament in food crops  is irregular increament in food crops  is irregular, how can we achieve a steady but regular increament? What is the strategy to employed in reducing the poverty level of farmers and food insecurity? What is the problem and/or challenge faced in food crops production?<br/>1.5    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>          The study is expected to cover Uhunmwode Local Government Area of Edo State, Nigeria. It cover some randomly  selected farmer in the study area. These farmers are fifty in the sample size.<br/>1.6    SIGNICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>          The study will have beneficially effect on the Government, farmers and the people (individual) of Uhunmwode Local Government Area of Edo State in  particular and Nigeria at large. Government will be able to implement policies and programmes that will alleviate the problems of food crops farmers which tend to increase the efficiency of these farmers, with that food production will increase making food to be surplus and affordable by the people and this will bring about increase in the standard of living of food crop farmers.  Government will  also be able to generate revenue and earn foreign exchange through export of the excess.<br/>1.8    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>          Technical efficiency is define as the ration of product output to the factor input.<br/>          Food crop production is growing, raising, cultivation, picking, harvesting, collection of crop that are edible to man.<br/>          Therefore technical efficiency in food crops production is the radio of product output to the factor input in the growing, raising, cultivating, picking, harvesting, and collection of crop that are edible to man.<br/><br/>\n\nTECHNICAL EFFICIENCY IN FOOD CROP PRODUCTION <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY IN FOOD CROP PRODUCTION ", "id": 171}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>TRANSPORTATION COST VARIATION AND ITS EFFECT ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT<br/>A CASE STUDY OF EDO STATE <br/> ABSTRACT</b><br/>This research is focused on the effect of transportation cost variation on agricultural produce in Benin city of Edo State. It has been discovered that transportation and socio-economic development are closely related. This is also to introduce students and indigenes of Edo State to the problem and reason for the low standard of socio-economic development in Edo State. The various sectors such as agriculture, industry, trade and marketing, education and health services, forestry and other social infrastructures are aggregated to constitute what is so called socio-economy. It therefore, means that an improvement in this sector will elevate the socio-economic standard of living. Transportation is one of the factor that has a higher degree of relationship to the level of socio-economy development. In other to make clear the fundamental importance and effects of education in the development of socio-economy the study has been limited to agriculture as an agent of development. Furthermore, this study identifies the relationship between agricultural goods or products and transport cost variation. That is the higher the price of petrol that leads to increase in transport cost the higher the prices of agricultural products.      <br/>  TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE          <br/>Introduction<br/>Background of the study<br/>Objective of the study<br/>Significance of the study<br/>Limitation of the study<br/>Scope of the study<br/>Research questions<br/>Definition of terms<br/>CHAPTER TWO         <br/>Review of related literature<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>Research design and methodology<br/>Research design<br/>Population of the study<br/>Instrument for data collection<br/>Validation of data collection<br/>Method of data collection<br/>Method of data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR        <br/>Presentation and discussion of result<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>Summary of findings, conclusion and recommendation<br/>Conclusion<br/>Recommendation<br/>QUESTIONNAIRE      <br/>REFERENCES   <br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>BACKGROUNG TO THE STUDY<br/>        Agricultural have been a source of help to economy development especially the trend of agricultural product.

It is also one of the fastest growing segments of animae agriculture. Aquaculture output has grown at a rate of more than 10% for captured fishers and 3% for livestock meat production (FAO, 2000) while only 13 million tons of fish were produced in North American in 1990, there were over 31 million tons produced in 1998. Concurrently, the value of this production doubled from 490 million to nearly 81 billion (USAA, 1998).<br/>          Human consumption of fish and related foods is increasing each year. Demand for fish products is greater than the ability of the oceans to supply them. A reduction in wild –caught fish coupled with increased consumption by American consumers has led to increased profitability, improvement in technology required for captive production, and a rapid expansion of farmed aquatic specie. As a result aquaculture is becoming a major alternatives crop globally and in many areas of the United States illustrates the increasing percentage of the total world fish production supplied by aquaculture in relation to the oceanic catch. Because the oceanic fish is no longer increasing significantly, additional production depends on growing more fish through aquaculture. Approximately 75 percent of the earths surface is covered by water yet humans harvest only 1 percent of their total food supply from this source.<br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>          Over 4000 years ago the Chinese through trial and error developed a system approach to harvesting the nutritional riches of water. They found that different species feed in different natural niches. The animals of particular use to in the ancient Chinese were complementary varieties or crop. The common crop (Cyprinus Earpio) is abenethic that consumer invertebrates in the bottom of the ponds. For thousand of years carp species provided the Chinese with a sustainable harvest. The Chinese discovered that the use of manure as fertilizer could enhance the productivity of a pond. In the 1880s aquaculturist in Eastern Europe countries also cultured the common carp (Silver carp, black carp, grass carp), in the United States aquacultures was launched when the federal government began hatching and stocking program to restock salmon lost spawning rivers in the North West. In an attempt to increase Salmon numbers in the wild, the federal government began hatching program that were basically “put and take” system. Eggs were collected, hatched in captivity and fingerlings released. This program, although successful in increasing wild-caught number, was actually more successful in providing initial information and research for the science of aquaculture. Hatching and restocking into the wild required development of the same technology as that needed by commercial hatching. This made salmon the major marine fish industry of the United state with more than half the production coming from public because over 600 million commercial salmon landing accounting annually.<br/>          In the 1950s the US government supported programs of farm pond construction and stocking. Although more than 2 million ponds were constructed they have demonstrated little importance for food production. In 1960s ponds were constructed specifically for catfish in the Southern United States where production fastest growing agricultural enterprises from 1970s till today. Catch moved to the Mississippi delta Region. The federal research laboratory in sluttgart, Arkansas, helped promote catfish by providing information and support. Regional government aquaculture research centers have helped bolster growth and profitability of the industry. Aquaculture production in North America involves diverse farming systems in diverse areas. It is most concentrated in the southern region of the United States. Today the US catfish industry of the largest aquaculture industry in the world employing more than 25, 000 people and generating over $ 1 billion annually. More than 178, 000 acres of catfish ponds on 1300 farms produced approximately 100 million metric tones per year. Currently 80% of the catfish production occurs in the state of Mississippi with 105, 000 acres concentrated on 400 farms. Many other commercial species are also centred in the south East Louisiana is the leading producer of craw fish and arkangas leads in baitfish production. Florida is the leading in ornamental fish, increasingly there are niches being found for hybrid stripped bass, fresh water prawns, red fish and tilapias throughout the country. Other species that have potential include allegation, bullfrogs and turtles. Production of the American cupped oyster is predominately from the united state e.g. clams, crayfish, catfish, mussels, cyprinids etc. <br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM             <br/>          The statement of the problem are;<br/>1.            Do we have fishing ponds in Delta State of Nigeria?<br/>2.            Do we have enough facilities to engage in fishing production?<br/>3.             What can the federal government do about the fishing industry<br/>4.            What are the roles of the public concerning fish production?<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>          The purpose of this study is to examine the importance of fish production and it marketing value of fish production in Nigeria, which is the usefulness of rearing of fish and it nutritional value to human.<br/>-                     To identify the marketing value of fish production in our means.<br/>-                     To understand aquatic animals much better now than that in the past.<br/>-                     To bridge the gap resulting from our having invested minimally in salt and fresh water food production research to compare with research investment made in food production from the land.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>          The study of the importance of fish production and it marketing value of fish production in Nigeria is significance not only to agriculturist but to everybody. If the contribution of US aquaculture project growth is achieved, the federal government, state government, general public at large established a good and adequate fishpond the need of today would be meet.

To the farmers it is edible root tuber crop, which generate his income for the up-keep of his family and himself. It has helped raised the standard of living over the years. The oxford dictionary describe yam as a starch tuberous root largely replacing potato as a staple food in many tropical and sub-tropical countries of the world. Yam belongs to the botanical genes discovered, but there are very many species of great importance in West Africa.<br/>The white yam (Discoreal rotonlata) <br/>The water yam (Discoreal alata)<br/>The yellow yam (discoreal caganesis)<br/>Lesser yam (D. bulbfery)<br/>Trifoliate or three leave yam (D. dumetorum)<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>          The edible yams are root crop groom on a field scale for the tubers. They provide staple carbohydrate food in the yam zone of west Africa, where daily consumption is 0.5, 1.0kg yam need a great deal of labour for their cultivation and to prepare them for food and they are usually expensive to buy for normal human consumption, the field or peal, sometimes after partial boiling in west Africa, they are usually eaten as pounded yam which is prepared by pealing cut up yam and boil before pounding them in a wooden mortal to produce a glutinous dough (pounded yam). <br/>          The chemical composition of yam tuber is as follows:<br/> Water                   70%<br/>Starch                   25%<br/>Sugar                    1%<br/>Protein                 1.2%<br/>RESEARCH QUESTION   <br/>          Yams have high starch content and low amount of protein yam has an important role the social religion life in the yam eating areas of West Africa. In Nigeria this was associated with religious count, which has a priest hold. Annual festival was helded at planting and harvesting and was later known, as the new yam festival was the most important celebration of the year. Discorea species are widely used in traditional medicine in Africa and Asia. The tuber of some wild Spp contain steroidal sapogenias related to the sex hormones and conticosteriod. These now provide a source of diosgenin, which is use to the manufacture of oral contraceptive bere hormones and conbsone.<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY  <br/>          Yam production in Edo State have hither to received security attention from research workers and students, the main reason for this is that people are ignorant at the importance of yam production in the state.<br/>          One of the present day problems of yam production in Edo state has not been encouraging, the people regard the production of yam in the state as fit for only poor and the illiterate.

Candle is a round stick of wax with a wig through it, which is lit to give light as it burn. Oxford Advanced learner’s dictionary Fourth Edition (1989). There are many types of candles based on the production and the composition formulation from which the candle is made (or the materials you use). <br/>Candles can be manufactured in a small scale or larger scale. The small-scale process can be done either at home or laboratory, following while the large-scale process is produced in industrial and companies the scientific and technical process. The method of making a candle product can be quite interesting if done with the knowledge and adequate skills which a students I a higher institution of learning should be able to accomplish.<br/>Candles have accomplished mankind for more than 2000 years. Besides their liturgical relevance, candles were predominantly used as a source of light and in the early history of the candle are the effects to improve its quality. Beeswax candles had been developed by the Romans to such an extent that by approximately the middle of the second century A. D. they could be burnt in a closed room without sooting annoyingly or excessively beeswax candles showed significant advantages when compared to tallow candles. The latter had a rancid odour and smoked and sooted whilst burning. <br/>It was only as late as the mid nineteenth century that steering and paraffin wax offered further high quality raw materials available for the manufacture of candles alongside beeswax. During the same period decisive improvements were made to wicks, in particular the braiding techniques and chemical treatments. So further prerequisites for candles that burnt well were fulfilled and Geothe’s dream, “I know not what you could invent better than candles that burn without smoking”. <br/>The myth surrounding the candle remains even today, although numerous and various types of light are available to us since the invention of electric light and its introduction into our daily lives. Candlelight is still associated with a festival laid table, a pleasant coffee morning or idyllic romantic hours spent together. Obviously a candle that burns well and does not soot is a must for enjoying such occasions. Sooting and dripping are the decisive quality criteria of the consumer when judging candles. <br/>Further, the environmental awareness of today the candle as a product with an open flame is naturally drawn into discussions concerning the possible negative effects on humans and nature by potentially harmful substances. Traditional crafmanship, training and the passing down of experience all go together to guarantee the production of high quality candles by specialized candle companies. <br/>The Egyptians formed candles that were made out of beeswax as early as 3000 BC. The day candle holders found in Egypt date back to 400 BC. The Chinese created candles from wahle fat during the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC). <br/>In early china and Japan, tapers were made with wax from insect and seeds, wrapped in paper the word Zhu in Chinese originally meant torch and could have the warring states period (403-221BC), some excavated Bronx wares from that era feature a picket though to hold a candle. <br/>Candles were manufacture in AD-1500 AD, here there is a fish called the evlachonor “candle fish”, a type of smelt which is found from Oregon to Alaska. During the first century AD, indigenous people from this region used oil from this fish for illumination. By the 18th century, the Chinese designed weights into the sides of candles, as such a candle melted, the weights fell off and made a noise as they fell into a bowl.  <br/>In 1750, spermaceti, oil that comes from sperm whale, was used to provide very expensive candles. By 1800, a much cheaper attentive was discovered. Colza oil, derived from Brassica campestris, and similar oil derived from rapeseed, yielded candles that produce clear smokeless flames. The French chemist Michel Eugene Chevrev (1786-1889) and Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac (1778-1850) patented stearin, in 1811, like tallow, this was derived from animals, but had no glycerin content. The second patent ever granted by the US (United States) in 1790 for a new method of candle making was Joseph Sampson.  <br/>In 1834, Joseph Morgan began to industrialize the production of candles. He invented a machine to manufacture 1,500 per hour from a mould.  A chemist called Laurent distile paraffin from schist in 1830. another chemist, Dumes obtained paraffin from coal-tar in 1935. not until 1850 did paraffin became commercially viable when James young filed a patent to produce it from coal. Paraffin could be used to make inexpensive candles of high quality. <br/>The oldest candle manufactures still in existence are Rathbornes Candles, founded in Dulblin in 1488. Excavations at pimply, Italy, discovered several candelabra. Yak butter was used for candles in Tibet in Europe, the earliest surviving candle was discovered near Avigon infrance, from the first century AD. Tallow, fat from cows or sheep became the standard materials used in candles in Europe. <br/>Dating from about 1330, the wax chandlers company acquired its charter in 1484. by 1415, tallow candles were used in street lighting. The unpleasant smell of tallow candles is due to the glycerin they contain. For churches and royal events, candles from beeswax were used as the smell was usually less unpleasant. The smell of the manufacturing process was so unpleasant that it was banned by ordinance in several cities. <br/>In Rome, they used tallow, derived from suet, a crumbly animal fat to make the candles. Although the tallow was extremely smoky, the smoke was forgiven for light and used for prayer.  The first candle mould was believed to come from 15th century in Paris. The first American Colonist discovered that bayberries could be used to make candles, but the yield was very poor. Fiufteen pounds of wax. A simple, candle could be made by putting the dried fish on a forked stick and then lighting it. Candles were made for timekeeping. Anglo-saxon king Alfred the Great (C. 849-899) used a candle clock which burned for 4 hours. There were lines around the side to show the passing of each hour. Later, 24hours candles were invented based on the same concept. <br/>The sung dynasty in china (960-1279) also used candle-clocks. A form of candle-clock was used in coal mining until the twentieth century. Despite advances in candle making, the candle industry was devastated soon after by the distillation of kerosene (an excellent fuel for amps). In Britain, kerosene is known as paraffin oil or paraffin despite having little to do with paraffin wax.<br/>In 1829, William Wilson of prices candles invested in 1000 ores (4km2) of coconut plantation in srilanka. His aim was to make candles from coconut oil. Later he tried palm oil from palm trees. An accidental discovery swept all his ambitions aside when his brother George Wilson distilled the first petroleum oil in 1854. <br/>In 1919, Lever Brothers purchased prices candles and in 1922, a joint owned company called “candle Ltd” was created. By 1991, the last remaining owner of “candle Ltd” was shell oil company, who sold off the candle making part of business from this point, candles became more of a decorative item.        <br/>1.2         PURPOSE OF STUDY <br/>The main aim of this research work is to produce high quality candles that can be used at home by family members and to be sold to the public for sales and use purpose. The candle produce should have no unpleasant smell and smoke when used, instead it should have a pleasant odour and scent, clear and smokeless flames when lit, with suiting fragrance effect easily noticed in the surrounding air by inhaling with health benefits. <br/>          Candles are produced under laboratory condition and independently in large scale with the masses of the materials adequately ascertained.   <br/>1.3         STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS <br/>The following statements of problems are hereby formulated to assist in this research work of candle production. <br/>1.            What raw materials require to produce high quality, very highly quality candles. <br/>2.            What are the procedures to follow in producing the candle? <br/>3.            How can the candle produced be tested? <br/>4.            How duration is the candle<br/>5.            What are the general requirement for candle making.  <br/>1.4         HYPOTHESIS <br/>1.            Inappropriate requirements for the production of candle is problems <br/>2.            Lack of adequate raw materials is a major problem in the process of manufacturing of candles. <br/>3.            Lack of students interest by not following the manufacturers instruction, knowledge and adequate skills, which is a problem in the production of candle. <br/>4.            Inappropriate measures and chemical needed is a problems for candle making. <br/>5.            The presence of unpleasant smell and sooting flames in the manufacturing process and when list which has an effect on the surrounding air by inhaling affects the health of people is the biggest problems. <br/>1.5         SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY <br/>This research work is significant for the following reasons because it will provide useful source of information to the teachers, students, parents, community and education officers on how to improve on the procedures of the production of candles. <br/>Despite that, this study is also significant because it will help to throw some light on the accurate measurement involved in order to avoid little or major problems in the production of candles and findings solution to them.   <br/>1.6         SCOPE OF STUDY <br/>The process of candle production from the composition of candle is indeed a universal article. As a matter of fact, I intended to deal extensively with this study for its under the importance in development of the process of candle production and the composition of candle involve however, the study covered few secondary schools in Ikpoa Okha Local Government Area of Edo State. <br/>1.7         DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Paraffin wax: A wax-like substance obtained form petroleum, use especially for making candles. <br/>Beewax: A yellowish wax made by bees for building honecombs, also used for making wood polish and candles. <br/>Laboratory: A room or building in which scientific experiments are carried out. <br/>Experiment: Is to work with instruments and apparatus in a practical investigation, on the behaviour and nature of substances. <br/>Wick: Length of thread in the centre of a candle, the top end of which is lit and burns as the wax melts. <br/><br/>\n\nTHE PROCESS OF CANDLE PRODUCTION FROM THE COMPOSITION OF CANDLE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROCESS OF CANDLE PRODUCTION FROM THE COMPOSITION OF CANDLE", "id": 175}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>A STUDY OF THE PROBLEMS FACING THE MARKETING OF POULTRY PRODUCT IN EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA IN EDO STATE<br/> ABSTRACT</b><br/>The purpose of this study was to investigate problem problems facing the marketing of poultry product in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State four research questions formulated and analyzed.

They produce meat and eggs used as food. The common types of poultry are fowl or chicken, duck, guinea fowl, turkey, and geese. Fowl chicken is the most common type of poultry in Nigeria. It is eaten by people that practice traditional religion, Christians and Muslims. Poultry birds are suitable for scientific studies because of their rapid growth the egg are important in industries for the manufacturing of cosmetic soap and shampoo etc. as well as for producing vaccines. Egg may also be used in baking industries to prepare snacks as egg roll, sausage roll, cake etc. different types of fowl are kept by farmer. They include the: <br/>1.     Native fowl<br/>2.     Rhade Island Red (RIR)<br/>3.     Plymouth Rock<br/>4.     Harco<br/>5.     White and Brown Leghorn<br/>6.     light Sussex<br/>The native fowl is mainly kept by farmers in the rural areas. The other types are foreign fowl and are reared by modern and big poultry farmers. The chicken kept for the production of meat is called boilers while the one kept for egg production is called layers. The dual purpose chicken produces both meat and egg. The adult male fowl is known as cocks and the adult female fowl as hen. The young one of fowl is called chicks the cock that had been castrated or has its testes remove is known as capon. Those fowls (both hen and cock) reared for the production of hatched egg is called parents stocks.<br/>Poultry dropping are useful as manure to enrich the soil by adding the poultry dropping to the soil allow it to decay in that process it will increase the nutrient if the soils by adding minerals like nitrogen and phosphate. Egg shells are suitable in making fertilizers and livestock feeds. In the earlier time, the keeping of poultry where not being considered or seen as a major occupation, that the birds were kept to obtain some areas of communities, fowl (poultry birds) in the past were use as means of knowing what the time of the day is especially the cock (male fowl) poultry farming stated those days when our local farmers were using the old method to rear the fowls, sheep, goats, pig and other domestic animals the old system was extensive system, proved that the poultry sector was a profitable venture too gradually poultry keeping developed into a commercial enterprise involving thousands of birds large poultry units were used to replace small ones because of the development, while more efficient stains of birds were used to replace small one because of the development, balance feed intensive housing and better poultry equipment came into use, because of all this development employment of people came about. All these industrialized system of keeping poultry birds help to promote the business of poultry birds in Edo State. In order to investigate the problems are of economic importance in poultry farms in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State. Information on production activities, management and problems were collected from 22 poultry farmers in the study area. The data were analyzed using table and frequency distribution from the analysis, the farmers light lighted the problems of low capital, diseases as the most rampant, Newcastle and Gumboro diseases are the most rampant. They also identified the lack of good quality water, and proper marketing outlets. High cost at times security of feed are major problems in the study areas. All these problems can be tackled by provision of cheap credits to the poultry farmers themselves into co-operative by so doing their resources can be pooled together for meaningful development of their farms and poultry industry in general. In order for poultry birds to produce efficiently and effectively there are need to rear them under a good and conducive environment that will be good for the health. We have various system or ways of rearing birds like the extensive, intensive, and semi intensive system whereby can keep birds in the keep liter and the battering cage so that they can be controlled by the farmers.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>          Poultry products are good source of protein to every individual and a viable avenue to revenue to both the nation, citizen of that country. But unfortunately the marketing of these products. If situation is net rectified, more serious problem might develop in spite of substantial qualitative and qualitative advancements in different sectors of the poultry industry, the industry will continue to face numerous challenges on a global basis some of these challenges are presented here.<br/>1.     Feed cost and continuous efforts to get a better understanding of available alternative feed ingredients. As of right now, feed cost is probably one of the most serious challenges for the industry.<br/>2.     Disease outbreak and implementation of biosecurity programs, although the extent and also type of disease outbreaks can vary in different parts of the world. In addition, disease of metabolic origin including as cities and skeletal disorder are of importance as well.<br/>3.     Issues surrounding inclusion of antibiotics in poultry feed and also the use of alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters.<br/>4.     Safety of poultry products for human consumption.<br/>5.     Poultry welfare related issues such as banning the use of conventional cages at layer farms.<br/>6.     Issues related to water in term of both quality and quantity.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.     Does an inadequate material affect the marketing of poultry production?<br/>2.     Does bad road affect the marketing of poultry products?<br/>3.     Does storage problem act negatively on the marketing of poultry products?<br/>4.     Does bad road affect the marketing of poultry product?<br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>          To promote and protect all poultry interests related to production, distribution, merchandizing support research in production and marketing of poultry.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>          In this study, poultry the need for this investigation is to know the problem facing the marketing of poultry product in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State. it is said that at the end of the investigation both the farmers and the consumers will thin the area in which the investigation was carried out will benefit from the findings of the study. Therefore the study will help farmers within Edo State to know the various systems of rearing birds in order to keep them to know best marketing channel to sell the product.<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>          The study is designed to achieve the following.<br/>1.     The general objective of this study is to analyze the poultry marketing.<br/>2.     This study set out to describe the main poultry rearing systems on farms in and chicks, lack of transport, poor sitting of enterprises and unorganized marketing.<br/>3.     To analyzed the determinants of poultry marketing supply in the study area.<br/>4.     Some marketing strategies are proposed.<br/>5.     Covering poultry marketing, health and hygiene welfare, killing and poultry product marketing.<br/>6.     To identify the types of poultry product sold in Edo State.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>          In this study, poultry farm in Egor Local Government Area will be carefully examined. The study will pay particular attention to factors affecting the marketing of poultry products in Edo State. it will also investigate some selected types of poultry products and causes of their low marketing and make recommendation that will enhance more distribution in Edo State.     <br/>DEFINITION OF TERM <br/>Cock: This is a male fowl<br/>Fowl: This is referring to as poultry birds.<br/><br/>\n\nA STUDY OF THE PROBLEMS FACING THE MARKETING OF POULTRY PRODUCT <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A STUDY OF THE PROBLEMS FACING THE MARKETING OF POULTRY PRODUCT ", "id": 176}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PROBLEMS AND SOLUTION ON PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING OF CASSAVA IN OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE <br/> ABSTRACT</b><br/>This study deals with the production and processing with special reference to Ovia North East Local Government Area of Benin City Centres for the purpose of this investigation two (2) study centres were randomly selected a questionnaire made up of eighteen (18) items was constructed with assistance of my supervisor and administrated.

Eggs and poultry meat are produced primarily for food consumption. Eggs are also used in various food industries like the manufacturing of confectionary (i.e. sweet chocolate cakes etc.). They are also used for the manufacturing of cosmetics of infection diseases while the feathers may be used for making pillows and mattresses. Some species of poultry are suitable for genetic nutritional and physiological studies because of their relatively low cost of maintenance, proliferation (a rapid growth or increase in numbers) and short generation intervals. In the earlier time, the keeping of poultry were not being considered as a major occupation; that is birds were kept to obtain some money and in most cases for pleasure and pastime cock fighting. In some areas or communities, fowls are still used in the past as a means of knowing what times of day, most especially the cock (i.e. male fowl).<br/>Poultry farming started those days when our local farmers used the old and extensive method in keeping fowls, goats, sheep, pig and other related domestic animals proved that the poultry section was a profitable venture too. Gradually, poultry keeping developed into a commercial enterprise involving thousands of birds, large poultry units, replace small ones while more efficient strains of birds, balanced feeds, intensive housing and better poultry equipment come into use. All these industrialized system of keeping poultry birds in a recent development in Edo state as in most humid tropical countries. The effect of some environmental factors like the industries are less capitalized, consists of smaller units and depend more on manual labour. These lead to less production of the birds or the birds perform at a lower level. Due to this account, the cost of poultry production is higher. All these factors contribute to the lower consumption of poultry production in the tropical areas like Edo state. For example, the recent estimate of eggs consumption in Nigeria was far low when compared with the European countries and the United States. Moreover, the industries in the tropical areas are not as diversified as in the temperate. In the tropics, the emphasis is on egg production and only one species of poultry (the domestic fowl) is used. Whereas economic and nutritional benefits can be derived from keeping other species, for example some strains of ducks are fast growing, resistance to many diseases of the domestic fowl and can produce as many as 300 eggs per annum. These can be used to increase the consumption of poultry products in the tropics.<br/>However, throughout the world, the domestic birds are unique for its popularity in producing both poultry meat and eggs while the other species are kept primarily for meat. In order for poultry birds to produce efficiently, there is need to raise them under a conducive environment. We have various ways of rearing birds like the industrialized system of rearing birds.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>Poultry, which is of economic importance to the entire members of the society because it provides meat and eggs for consumption. The bones are being used as bone meals to farm animals. It is therefore important that these products get to the final consumer at the place and time they are needed. This is only possible when the marketing system is efficient. This study is therefore concerned with the appraisal of the problems of marketing poultry products in Orhionmwon Local Government Area.<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is designed to achieve the following objectives:<br/>1.     To identify the type of poultry products sold in Orhionmwon Local Government area.<br/>2.     To identify the problems affecting the marketing of poultry products.<br/>3.     To find out how best the problems of marketing poultry products can be solved.<br/>4.     To make recommendations based on  finding of the study.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>To assist in carrying out appraisal into the problems of marketing poultry products in Orhionmwon Local Government area, some research questions will be useful and these include:<br/>i)                   How does extension system of rearing poultry affects its product?<br/>ii)                What is the importance of transportation in the marketing of poultry products?<br/>iii)              Which part of poultry products do you sell most daily?<br/>iv)              Why are poultry products difficult in market?<br/>v)                What way so you think will help in the marketing of poultry products?<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>The need for appraisal of this type is to know the problems facing the marketing of poultry products in Orhionmwon Local Government area in Edo state. it is assumed that at the end farmers and the consumers within the territory in which the appraisal was carried out will benefit from the findings of the study. During the appraisal, some farmers were questioned and they responded actively and also ask various question s, which help them to rear their livestock very well. Therefore, this study will help the farmer within Orhionmwon local government area to known the various system of rearing birds in other to keep them away from infection diseases. It will also help them to known the best the best marketing channel to sell their products. Also this study will help the consumers in that same area to known the most hygienic place to purchase their meat and other domestic products from.<br/>SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>In this scope, poultry products in Orhionmwon local government area will be carefully examined. This study will pay particular attention to factors affecting the marketing of poultry products in Orhionmwon. It will also appraise some selected types of poultry products and causes of their low marketing and make recommendation that will enhance more distribution in Orhionmwon local government area.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Production: The processes and methods employed to transform tangible input into goods.<br/>Marketing: The action or business of promoting and selling products.<br/>Prospect: The like hood of success.<br/>Problem: A matter or situation regarded as unwelcome or harmful and needing to be death with and overcome.<br/> <br/>  <br/>\n\nTHE PROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF POULTRY MARKETING AND PRODUCTION: <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF POULTRY MARKETING AND PRODUCTION: ", "id": 178}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF OIL PALM PRODUCTION<br/>A CASE STUDY OF NIFOR EDO STATE<br/> ABSTRACT</b><br/>This study examined the problems and prospects of oil palm cultivation using Nifor as a case study. In the process of the research questionnaires were administered to farmers and workers, so as to enable the researcher collect the required data which were selected and analyzed using simple percentage. The findings of the study revealed that problems facing oil palm production include lack of adequate land space, inadequate storage facilities which result in low production of oil palm, inadequate finance etc while those of its prospect include that the cultivation of oil palm is an inevitable means of shifting the nation’s dependence on oil sectors as the main stay of the nations economy, a means of encouraging rural agriculture since southern Nigeria with particular reference to Nifor is fertile for oil palm production and as a means of discouraging urban drift. Recommendations were given thereby encouraging the setting up of  small scale industries in the rural areas were oil palm is produced as a means of reducing unemployment and encouraging rural development.<br/>  TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>Introduction<br/>Background to the Study<br/>Statement of problem<br/>Objective of the study<br/>Significant of the study<br/>Scope of the study<br/>Basic assumption<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Literature Review<br/>CHAPTER THREE     <br/>Research methodology<br/>Design of study<br/>Area of study<br/>Population of the study<br/>Sample and samplings techniques<br/>Research instrument<br/>Administration of research instrument<br/>Method of data Analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR        <br/>Data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FIVE          <br/>Summary<br/>Implication of findings<br/>Recommendations<br/>REFERENCES   <br/>QUESTIONNAIRES   <br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>The oil palm originated in tropical West Africa where it is found growing in any areas the centres of production of oil palms stretches from Senegal, through Dahondy and Nigeria to Congo and Angola. Nigeria is one of the worlds loading producer of palm oil and palm kernels palm produce was the main commodity which attracted the early European traders to west African those traders save the oil rivers to the Nigeria delta area where they traded the use of oil palm and it products are many the leaves are used for making brooms and for roofing materials the back and the front is paled and weaving into baskets, the main trunk can be split and used as supporting frames in buildings a sap tapped from the female flower is drunk as palm wine a rich source of year red palm oil can be extra from the fibrous layers of the nuts of the fruit bunch this is locally used in the manufacture of candles, margarine, and soap a clear oil from the kernels is used for making pomades palm kernel meats is used as a menial food the empty fruit bunch, the shell and fortress which remain after oil extraction are used as fondle many plantation of oil palm have been establish in west African, but most palm produced is obtained from palms growing wild.<br/>1.2  STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Edo state is one of the major oil producing area in Nigeria recently some other ones have sprang up and Edo state is noted as the largest producers of palm oil and kernels in Nigeria yet there is storage of palm oil and kernels in Nigeria not to talk of export the yield of palm kernels for export which used to add to the nations revenue as falling. It is therefore they concerned of these study to identify the reasons of problems responsible for the falling level of oil palm producing in the area of study and also to render useful subjections.<br/>1.3  OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The objectives of the study are<br/>1.     To identify and examine the problems of oil palm production in Edo state.<br/>2.     To find out solutions to some of those problem.<br/>3.     To make recommendation for improve or better oil palm production in Edo state.<br/>1.4  SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study is focused on the oil palm production problems and prospects in Edo state specifically Nigeria institute for oil palm research in Benin city for the purpose of the research, oil palm production will be among small scale farms will be used as a case study in the light of the above information gathering will be limited to communities in NIFOR.<br/>1.5  THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>The importance of oil production to the society cannot be over emphasized therefore this research work is designed to find out the problem facing the improvement of oil palm production, problem and prospect in NIFOR (Edo state).<br/>1.     It is hoped that the results of the research will be of use in the improvement of oil palm production.<br/>2.     Besides, the study will help agricultural policy planners in the under standing of the problems of oil palm production and how to solve them.<br/>1.6  HYPOTHESIS<br/>The hypothesis of this study are formulated are<br/>1.     Inadequate storage facilities result in low cultivation of oil palm in Nigeria<br/>2.     Attack by pest and disease lead to decline in oil production.<br/>3.     Inadequate land space affect the production of oil palm farmers who produce oil palm are called with the problems of advise from the extension workers.<br/>   <br/>\n\nTHE PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF OIL PALM PRODUCTION: <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF OIL PALM PRODUCTION: ", "id": 179}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AGRICULTURE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: PROBLEM AND PROSPECT <br/> ABSTRACT </b><br/>The study is to research on the problems and prospect of agriculture in Edo State. The study is to look at the attitude of Edo State people towards the improvement of agriculture, which tend to be a weak attitude and problems to the state at large. These problems are summarized as low level of literacy, poor agricultural implements, inadequate number of skilled /trained and qualified labourers or workers, little or on finding etc. However, the research deems it fit to profound solution to the low level of agriculture in Edo State. these solution are as follows; lists of skilled workers should compiled and updated always receipt or certificates should be advocated, personal income and support should be  appropriate appreciated and use well. However, the above solutions to the problems of agriculture in Edo State, will tend to change to a positive one, whereby the people of Edo State will now tend to improve agriculture effectively if only the government of Edo State will employ these prospect of agriculture.<br/>  TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>Introduction <br/>Background information<br/>Statement of the problems<br/>Purpose of the study<br/>Scope and limitation of the study<br/>Research methodology<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Literature review <br/>CHAPTER THREE     <br/>Methodology<br/>Research design<br/>Population of the study<br/>Sample of the study<br/>Sampling techniques<br/>Research instrument<br/>Data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR        <br/> Presentation and analysis of data <br/>Presentation and analysis of data<br/>Presentation of analysis<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/> Summary, Recommendation and Conclusion  <br/>Summary of findings<br/>Recommendations<br/>Conclusion<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY        <br/>QUESTIONNAIRE      <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br/>Agricultural sector is the earliest sector of the economy in the history of mankind. The history of agriculture started when man wandered from places to place gathering fruits and animals to satisfy his immediate need. As at that time, man had three basic necessities in life, these are air water and food air and water is provided naturally while food has to be provided by man himself with much and little hindrance from nature.<br/>     Agriculture as the backbone of West Africa economy is further revealed by the fact that it contributes an average of about 75 percent of various counties exports. Agriculture supplies about 80 percent of Nigeria’s exports.<br/>       The importance of agriculture in the economy of west Africa is borne out by many factors, for instance, it employs between 60-90 percent of west Africa occupied population in Liberia, 80 percent of the working population is engaged in agriculture forestry, fishing and breeding more than 60 percent of the employed labour force is engaged in agriculture in Ghana in the Ivory coast, 85 percent of the population are farmers, and the percentage rises to go if we include the immigrant population of that country in Senegal 80 percent of the active population is engaged in agriculture. All these point to the facts that agriculture is the main source of livelihood of West Africa<br/>    Agriculture as an economic development has provided a dominant position within the economy of each country gives at a crucial role in the economy development of West Africa. It provides raw materials for the textile, tyre, soap, cocoa, fruit canning and cigarette factories.<br/>          In 1968, agricultural exports formed 72 percent of the total exports of Ghana. The 408.000 tons of agricultural products, valued at about 24,000 million CFA Francis, which the Cameroon republic exported in 1964. Constituted about 80 percent of their total exports.<br/>          At about 20 percent of the total agricultural output of West Africa is exported while the remaining is consumed directly or used by the local industries. The rates of economic development and growth of Nigeria and West Africa countries of the under developed and developed ones has increase efficiently under production of the existing exports crops as permitted by the world markets, and the developing of new ones in orders to increase foreign exchange earning which turn permits the import of the goods and services needed for development.<br/>          This goes to say that one of the most significant impetus for economic development lies in the size and stability of a flow of maximum prop[ortion of investment in agricultural output which will have to be rapidly expanded. Also, with an increase in the incomes obtained from the sale of food stuffs and agricultural raw materials by the farmers more funds will be available for further investment in agriculture and the new industries.<br/>          According to Areoye (1944), some states have low agricultural potentials, it has also been observed that a West Africa small scale farmers applies a lot of general labour, the supply of which is plenty, and a little capital to a wider extent of land than his counterpart in the economically advanced area of the world.<br/>          Simple implement likes hoes and cutlasses are used on the frames while fertilizers and manures are not widely used. Almost all the traditional farmers are uneducated thus activities not properly organized and production cost are not carefully related to their yearly output. However, bulk of agricultural production in West Africa come from millions of small scale farmers in Nigeria, peasant farmer’s cultivate a averages of two to three areas and in some part of the Northern states, each extended family has been found to hold about 17 areas, about one quarter of which is usually under permanent cultivation. It is significant that apart from food products the bulk of exports like rubbers, cocoa, cotton and palm kernels are produced on the small holding of millions of West Africa peasant farmers. And in spite of the significance of large scale plantations farming in Liberia and Ivory coast yet now here does the proportion of plantations exceed 10 percent of the total cultivated land.<br/>          Lastly, the small scale farmers use traditional methods of farming one of these is shifting cultivation and bush fallowing by which they allow land to go back to bush after a few crops.<br/>          Thus, new land is cleared for cultivation which may be for two or five years, depending on the pressures of populations of land after which it is abandoned for a number of years, the percentage of the total land area that is under fallow at any period of time has been estimated to be at least 40 in Nigeria which however engages it to problems in food production in Nigeria.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS <br/>          This study is designed to answer the following questions.<br/>1.     Are citizens of Edo State including the salary earners really involved in agriculture?<br/>2.     Is agriculture a reasonable development or economics development in Edo State?<br/>3.     What categories of people are engaged in agriculture?<br/>4.     Are governments exercising their roles in agricultural development?<br/>5.     What contributions has agriculture brought to economic development in West Africa (Nigeria)<br/>PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>1.     To analyze the economics roles of agriculture in the Nigeria economy towards economics development<br/>2.     To identify problems facing the agricultural sector in Edo State.<br/>3.     To offer possible solutions to the problems facing agricultural sector in Edo State.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>a.     In the light of the foregoing, this study will enlighten those with the significance of agriculture as a source of economic development in Edo State.<br/>b.     Examine the positions of administrating agricultural economic development to be best informed about the effect of it.<br/>c.      As certain empirically the problems of agricultures and it’s importance of economic development.<br/>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY <br/>          Primary and secondary data will be used for study. Which will be analyzed by the descriptive techniques while appropriate measure of instability index will be applied in the determination of relative stability of government roles to agricultural development?

They are easier and cheaper to keep than chickens. This makes duck keeping for the production of eggs and meat an attractive enterprise about 700 million ducks are kept around the world, the majority of these more than 500million are found in Asia. Despite this uneven distribution, it is certainly also possible to raise ducks in parts of the worlds, including Africa and Latin America. Ducks can be reared for eggs and meat, for own use or for sale. Other products from ducks which can also be sold include down feathers and fattened livers. There are many similarities between chicken and duck rearing. The most obvious similarities are found in the type of the products for which these forms of poultry we kept duck, like chicken are good producers of eggs and meat.<br/>1.1             BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>Ducks however have several advantages over other poultry species, in particular their disease tolerance. They are hardly, excellent foragers and easy to hard, particularly in wetlands where they naturally tend to flock together. Ducks are relatively easy to raise and generally need less care than chickens.<br/>            This study seeks to determine the problems and prospects of duck rearing in Ovia North East Local Government Area. <br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>The study will deal with queries as enumerated below:<br/>a.      Is duck rearing popular in this locality?<br/>b.      Is duck meat popular among people?<br/>c.      Why is duck meat not acceptable to some people <br/>d.     What percentage of the people do not want duck meat?<br/>e.        Hoe can duck meat rearing be improved in this locality?<br/>f.       What is the contribution of duck meat to the poultry industry in Nigeria? <br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>This research was proposed on the background of the following desires;<br/>a.      To ascertain the level of acceptability <br/>b.      To determine the proficiency of duck meat rearing/farming<br/>c.      To unveil the reasons for level of acceptability of duck meat <br/>d.     To propose ways to enhance duck meat production <br/>e.      To encourage more production of duck meat.<br/>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>This study will focus on the following queries relating to problems and prospects of duck farming in Ovia North West local Government area of Edo state<br/>a.      What are the problems of duck farming in Ovia North West Local Government Area? <br/>b.      How much as these problems hampered the level of duck productivity?<br/>c.      What are the efforts made by the non government agencies in tackling these problems <br/>d.     What is the contribution of duck farming to the poultry industry?<br/>e.      What are the prospects in duck farming?<br/>f.       How can duck farming be improved? <br/>1.5       HYPOTHESIS <br/>            This research study was undertaken with the following assumptions regarding the problems and prospects of duck farming in Ovia North West Local Government area of Edo State. <br/>HO: the dirty nature of ducks has no effect on their acceptability <br/>H1: the dirty nature of duck has effect on their acceptability<br/>HO: high cost of feed, ingredient has no effect on duck production<br/>H1: high cost of feed ingredient has effect on duck production <br/>H0: the popular extensive system of duck rearing has no effect on productivity <br/>H1: the popular extensive system duck rearing has effect on productivity <br/>1.6       SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>This research was based on questionnaire approach involving farmers and rural dwellers in Ovia North West Local Government Area of Edo state.

Animal protein food contributes between 1-15 grams daily total food. However in Colben school farm Ekiadolor, poultry keeping of domestic fowl) generally follows sustenance or small scale. Poultry farm with the innovation of scientist endeavors have introduced that large number of people still depend upon small scale poultry production for their supply of eggs and poultry meal and rear mostly few numbers of foreign breeds of fowl.<br/>          Although foreign breeds are prolific, they have good meat parts and are used for scientific investigation they have three (3) main disadvantages.<br/>A.   High initial capital of intentions.<br/>B.   Laying of still egg shell could be easily damage.  <br/>C.   Low resistance to disease attack.<br/>The major reason is that the government and the school offices, building is more essential to them and financed by the government mainly benefiting students involves in the theoretical fields than the students involved in theories and practical work the school head take side of the education part without taking consideration of the side of the practical work of the students under vocational study and malnutrition of the animals.<br/>          Some other problems known to small scale poultry production operation in Nigeria include scarcity and cost of feeds disease and parasite lack of training and experience of the people (farmers) in animals his boundary the absence of infrastructure and necessities supply the need input for their production, processing and distributing lack of water, poor feeding and other management problems.<br/>          Among the management problem is he delicate nature of chicks breeding, the amount of profit made in poultry production depends primarily on good management critical in chicks rearing because poor handling during the brooding stage affects the subsequently performance of birds.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>          The frequent folding up of poultry farms, low production and small numbers of birds kept in various farms has necessitated the writing of this work.<br/>          The question often asked includes:<br/>A.   Why are most of the small scale poultry farm stagnant?<br/>B.   Is it as a result of poor management skill?<br/>C.   Is there no money for the farmers to operate within?<br/>D.   Is there no money for the farmers to operate with?<br/>E.   Are there no Vetinary officers to help the farmer?      <br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>A.   To highlight the problem associated with small scale poultry in colben school farm.<br/>B.   Make some recommendation on how these problems could be solved so that poultry production could be more profitable.<br/>C.   To provide a basic for future research on this topic and will also be useful to students who have interest in small scale poultry business.<br/>SOGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>1.    On completion of this study.

Recent trends all over the world, point to a decline in landing from capture fisheries, an indicator that fish stocks have approached or even exceeded the point of maximum sustainable yield. Aquaculture therefore remains the only viable alternative for increasing fish production in order to meet the protein need of the people. Catfishes of the family Claridae comprise the most commonly cultivated fishes in Nigeria. The growth of aquaculture in Nigeria now is largely being boosted by a steady rise in catfish culture. Inadequate availability of seed for stocking and feed used to be major problems. Tremendous progress is now being made. The total value of the industry today is US$800 from the value of fingerlings, feed and farmed fish. Since the culture of Clarias gariepinus through hypophysation was initiated in Western Nigeria in 1973, the procedure has been widely practiced throughout Nigeria thus leading to increase of farm-raised catfishes from the 80’s to date. The favoured  catfish species in Nigeria aquaculture include:  gariepinus, Heterobranchus bidorsalis, Clarias,  Heterobranchus hybrid (Heteroclarias) and Clarias, nigrodigitatus. Heterobranchus sp. is the more commonly cultured fish in the south eastern parts of Nigeria. African catfish is popular in the market and has great potentials to boost the rapidly growing Nigerian aquaculture.<br/> STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>Fish farming has not been fully explored as a strategy to reduce poverty levels despite its potential to improve livelihoods in rural communities. Low productivity, prohibitive establishment costs, high farm-level losses and inefficient marketing often pose a problem.<br/>The low level of productivity results from lack of appropriate production knowledge and skills, suboptimal stocking and/or overstocking, poor fish  population control methods and inadequate feeding due to costly feeds. <br/>Complications arise from high capital requirements for establishing a fish  farm, especially for excavation, stocking of fingerlings and installation of protective chain link. The losses at farm-level arise from predators such as snakes, monitor lizards and birds, and from improper harvesting and post-harvest techniques. Inefficient marketing results from a lack of farmers  ability to integrate production and marketing activities.<br/>It is therefore imperative that youth and farmers are supported to initiate fish farming using the fish farm approach through provision of startup fingerlings and other technical inputs for developing business plans.<br/>Objectives<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>A.    To promote fish-farming in Nigeria and contribute to increased household incomes<br/>B.     To facilitate the development of fish farm project into a modern  fish farm project in Edo State.<br/>C.  To highlight the problem associated with small scale fish farm in Oredo.<br/>D.  Make some recommendation on how these problems could be solved so that fish production could be more profitable.<br/>E.  To provide a basic for future research on this topic and will also be useful to students who have interest in small scale poultry business.<br/>SOGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>1.   On completion of this study. It is contemplated that the research finding would help in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>2.   The justification of the study would be seen from the point of view of the fact that the research finding would help in advising and counseling of people hoping to take poultry farm farming either as a small scale or full scale business venture.<br/>3.   It will also serve as reference materials for further finding it will also be useful to government in identifying areas where fish farmers in the local government area or the school fish farm can be assisted in order to increase production.<br/>SCOPE <br/>          The scope of this research work only covers farmers in Oredo Local Government Area. <br/> <br/>\n\nPROBLEM AND PROSPETS OF SMALL SCALE FISH FARMERS IN EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEM AND PROSPETS OF SMALL SCALE FISH FARMERS IN EDO STATE", "id": 183}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTS OF ANTHROPOENIC ACTIVITIES AND DOMESTIC WASTE ON SURFACE WATER QUALITY <br/>  (A CASE STUDY OF EKULU RIVER, ENUGU)<br/> Abstract </b><br/>The microbiological and organic pollutants characteristics of umuosoko stream in ikwuano local government area, Enugu state, Nigeria were carried out.

Man needs water for various other purposes apart from drinking and body functions. <br/>The other purposes includes it’s use in transportation, waste disposal and hydro electric system. About 80% of the earth’s surface is covered by water. This may be grouped into natural and artificial water. Natural water includes atmospheric water (rainfall, hail and snow), surface water includes (stream, lakes, rivers, ocean) and ground water (spring well, under ground stream). Artificial water on the other hand includes ponds. Surface water can be contaminated by some impurities like dust, smoke or gases etc from the atmosphere. <br/>Anthropogenic activities ad dumping of waste on the river bank also results to the contamination of surface water quality, water may of these micro-organisms when present in large quantities and for prolonged period of time can cause health problem (Onyeagba and Isu, 2003, Shelton, 2003: WHO, 2004). There is a strong relationship existing between water, health and diseases causation (Ajewole, 2005). Water is a very essential element of human nature, yet a very dangerous element in the spread of diseases. <br/>A recent study of water related and water borne diseases are in one way or the other caused by surface water (Medema et al 2003). Water that is free of disease producing micro-organism and chemical substance that is dangerous to health is referred to as potable water. The two categories of the sources of surface water pollution based on their origin are point and non-point sources. The contaminants that enter a water way through discrete conveyance, such as pipe or ditch are called point source pollution. The non point pollution is the diffused contamination that does not originate from a single discrete source. The cumulative effect of small amount of contaminants gathered from a large area is as a result of non point source pollution (USGS, 1998: EPA 2005) <br/>The contamination of water has been associated with sewage and sewage effluent. It has been generally accepted that surface water contains more harmful micro-organisms compared to other source, of water including ground water and rainfall water (Oyebode: 2005). Consequently, high degree of sewage dumps, practices with domestic waste water may be sources of bacteria and other organisms capable of producing diseases in man and animals including livestock. Other source includes livestock manure and waste water from municipals, schools, feedlots and swamps.<br/>Consequently, the number of cases of water borne diseases has been seen to be the cause of many health hazards. The demand and pollution of level of water requires the basic monitoring on the quality (WHO, 2004: EPA 2002) Hence there is need to ascertain the physical, chemical and biological quality of this river to ascertain whether it is safe for human consumption. <br/> 1.2  Objectives of the Study  <br/>The aim of this project is to determine the effect of anthropogenic activities and domestic waste on Ekulu river water quality.<br/>Specifically the objectives of this project are:-<br/>i.         To collect water samples from different parts of Ekulu River and take to the lab for analysis.<br/>ii.       To analysis the lab results with a view to ascertaining the physical, chemical and biological properties of the water.<br/>iii.     To recommend amendments for the water considering the various potential uses of Ekulu River in Enugu North of Enugu State.<br/>iv.     To subjectively evaluate the extent of domestic waste deposits in the river. <br/> 1.3  Justification of the study<br/>Not minding the anthropogenic activities and domestic waste dumping at Ekulu River, it is still a good source of water for agricultural and domestic activities <br/>Ekulu River is a neat source of water but water may not be adjudged potable by appearance or taste and that is why the analysis of this water is essential. <br/><br/>\n\nEVALUATION OF THE EFFECTS OF ANTHROPOENIC ACTIVITIES AND DOMESTIC WASTE ON SURFACE WATER QUALITY <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTS OF ANTHROPOENIC ACTIVITIES AND DOMESTIC WASTE ON SURFACE WATER QUALITY ", "id": 184}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div align=\"center\">THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF AGRICULTURE TO RURAL DEVELOPMENT: <br/></div><div align=\"center\"><br/></div><div align=\"center\">ABSTRACT<br/></div>For the purpose of this research work, an opinion survey was made using oral interview and author  - constructed questionnaire to examine “the contributions of agriculture to rural development” using Udi Local Government Area of Enugu as a case study.<br/><div>   The researchers relied on data collected from seventy-five (75) respondents who were agricultural concerned persons.</div><div>    To guide the research, the above opinions were gathered and analysed/interpreted, analysis of data revealed agriculture is the main stay of the rural dwellers, that proper awareness has not been created about agriculture by those concerned and that these rural dwellers are aware of the contributions of agriculture to rural development.</div>However further analysis of data received courtesy opinions of respondents revealed that the government has not done so much as it supposed for agricultural development in rural areas, more to this that most of the factors hindering the effective advancement of agriculture are not natural but man-made, hence could be solved.<br/>However, it is suggested that further and more indepth research on this study should be done as to as to ascertain factors impending or militating against the contributions of agriculture to rural development, also on ways these contributions could be fully utilized to effectively develop rural areas.<br/><br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE:<br/>1.0        Introduction<br/>1.1  Background of the study<br/>1.2  Statement of problems<br/>1.3  Objectives of the study<br/>1.4  Delimitation of the study<br/>1.5  Significance of the study<br/>1.6  Research Questions<br/>1.7  Definition of terms<br/><br/>CHAPTER TWO:<br/>2.1      Literature Review<br/>2.2      The contributions of agriculture<br/>2.3      References<br/><div><br/></div><div>CHAPTER THREE:</div>3.0  Research Methodology  <br/>3.1  Research Design<br/>3.2  Area of study<br/>3.3  Population of study<br/>3.4  Sample and Sampling procedure<br/>3.5  Instrument validity and reliability<br/>3.6  Method of data collection<br/>3.7  Method of data analysis<br/><div><br/></div><div>CHAPTER FOUR:</div>4.0      Presentation, analysis and interpretation of data<br/>4.1  Preliminary question<br/><div><br/></div><div>CHAPTER FIVE:</div>5.0      Findings, Conclusion and Recommendation, Summary of findings<br/>5.1  Conclusion<br/>5.2  Recommendation<br/>5.3  Limitations<br/>5.4  Areas for further study<br/>       Bibliography<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY:<br/>Agriculture according to Anyanwu, A. C. (1975) can be defined as “a cultivation of the land for the purpose of producing food for man and animals and also fibre or raw materials for our industries”.  It also includes the processing and marketing of crops.<br/><br/>Another definition from V. O. Akinyosoye O. (1976) states that agriculture is concerned basically with the husbandry of crops and animals for food and other purpose.<br/><br/>Agriculture has been the main stay of man right from the earliest times.  It is the oldest occupation and the entire world depends mostly on it for food requirements.  In the olden days, man practiced crude method of farming which involved local tool such as stones, sticks and other related equipment.<br/><br/>Today, agriculture is being looked upon as a basic necessity of life.  Food is an essential thing among the human needs. It is believed that without food, nobody can survive.  This is as a result of the benefits of agriculture.  Today also, private individuals, communities, states and federal government have geared every effort towards bringing agriculture to the door step of their citizens.<br/><br/>The development of agriculture started when the ancient hunters who depended on fruits and vegetables as well as animals as their food found out that some of the seeds.  From the fruits they dropped, as they moved along germinated and grew on their own.  They started nursing some of these economics fruit crops as their own.  In his quest for food and shelter, man has adopted many agricultural practices through the ages and his technical skills and material resources grew.  The four major types are hunting and gathering, pure subsistence agriculture, mixed subsistence with some cash crops production and pure commercial agriculture.<br/><br/>Agriculture sector is the leading non-oil sector in Nigeria economy.  About 70 of the total population engaged in agriculture while about 30 of the total working population are taking part in white colar jobs and others in commercial activities.  This is the reason why demand is greater than supply in Nigeria market, today concerning food production.<br/><br/>Since 1960, most people in the rural areas have been migrating to the urban areas in search of employment which offers a good living condition and because of this, agriculture is neglected.<br/><br/>There are also other problems that face agriculture already.  These problems lies in the traditional and subsistence system of agriculture.  Production techniques are poor and there are few applications of fertilizers and insecticides.<br/><br/>Many efforts and contributions have been made to improve agriculture and the production of agricultural products in this country particularly in Udi Local Government Area.  As part of its contribution in finding solutions to the problems of Nigeria Agriculture, the Societe General Bank of Nigeria Limited organized three symposia in October 1984.  The symposia served as forums for bringing together participants from the public and private sectors including farmers, industrialists, government officials and researcher.<br/><br/>This was held at the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture Ibadan on 16th and 17th October, 1984, while the second symposium took place at Durabar Hotel Kaduna on 22nd and 23rd October 1984.  The third symposium was held in Lagos at the Nigeria Institute of International Affairs on 25th and 26th October 1984.<br/><br/>The Ministry of Agriculture also arranged for effecting the collecting of agrometerological data to ensure successful timing of agricultural activities.  The ministry established Young Farmers Club (YFC) to encourage youths under twenty five years to farm in their localities.<br/><br/>Other programmes had been mapped out towards achieving self sufficiency in food production, such programmes included the Operation Feed Nation (OFN), Green Revolution, Agricultural Development Project (ADP), MOSA etc.  Again, the introduction of Better Life for rural women from rural to urban centres in search of white collar jobs.  Again in the introduction of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1960, agriculture was responsible for 63% of it.  The major components of GDP being agriculture, mining, electricity, manufacturing etc.<br/><br/>All these efforts by the Ministry has made agriculture to be very important for the provision of most human needs.<br/><br/>For clarity purpose, it will be important to give a vivid description of the geographical background of the study area Udi.<br/><br/>Udi is a Local Government Area in Enugu States.  It is bounded by some local government areas such as Ezeagu, Oji River, Nkanu, Enugu North and Awgu.  It is a very populous local government area made up of about 19 towns.<br/><br/>1.2      STATEMENT OF PROBLEM:<br/>One of the major problems facing rural areas, both in Nigeria and other underdeveloped countries of the world, is the rural to urban migration.  As young and energetic men and women migrate to the urban areas, the rural areas instead of developing tend to slide more and more into underdevelopment.  Various government and agencies have been endeavouring in one way or the other to develop the rural areas of Nigeria, especially Udi Local Government Area which is the focus of this research.  These include the provision of electricity, pipe borne water supply, access roads, etc.  However, these measures have not fully stemmed the rural urban migration and the continuing decline of rural areas.<br/><br/>One of the major areas which I feel the government has not fully explored is the function which agriculture can play in enhancing rural development.<br/><div><br/></div><div>1.3      OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY:</div>The objective of this research is to assess or weigh the contribution which agriculture has provided to the development of Udi Local Government Area of Enugu State.  Again to assess that the greatest problem facing many nations and developing states is hunger and poverty especially in the rural areas.<br/><br/>Furthermore, to change many negative attitude towards the introduction of some scientific equipment and method of farming.<br/>A:    To enable the country to achieve self sufficiency in the supply of foods by local production of adequate quantities of  high quality foods to keep pace with the food demand of the production.<br/>B:    To provide raw material for local and foreign ago-based industries.<br/>C:    To provide employment opportunities for able bodied people and to satisfy the market demand for locally manufactured products.<br/><br/>1.4      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:<br/>The study of the contributions of agriculture to the rural development of Udi Local Government Area is considered vital because it is believed that the result will help us to know the contributions which agriculture has provided to the local government area.<br/><br/>The findings will also alert government of Enugu State on some problems that hinder the contributions so that appropriate measures will be taken for improvement.<br/><br/>It is hoped that the findings will serve as a guide to the agricultural planners when adopting any programme.<br/><br/>The findings will further influence the habits and attitudes of the people who think that agriculture is meant for the illiterate and poor people.  And by knowing the contributions and agriculture in the state, it will increase peoples incentives and will therefore, make way for more increase in the capacity of food production in Udi Local Government Area.<br/><br/>1.5      RESEARCH QUESTIONS:<br/>1.          What are the contributions of agriculture to rural development?<br/>2.          Does the contributions change the attitude of farmers towards agriculture?<br/>3.          Does it make life better to dwellers of Udi Local Government Area or worst for them.<br/>\n\nTHE CONTRIBUTIONS OF AGRICULTURE TO RURAL DEVELOPMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\"

commercial banks by CBN. It was the aim of this research work to find out if CBN has helped in developing cooperative activities in agricultural aspect through their giving of loan, grant, and other farm inputs. Chapter one contained great discussion of the origin and existence of this scheme (ACGSF), it also went further to state the problems to be studied, research question scope and definition of terms.     A number of past and present literature review was examined by the researcher and all these highlighted in chapter two, chapter three dealt with the methodology for the study population and so on.    In chapter four data gotten from the research surveyed was analyzed and interpreted. Also similar questions on both questionnaire were compared.  Finally the summary of these findings was that farmers need to be encouraged to get loan though the measurement of CBN in the reduction of collateral and surety for guaranteeing loans, if banks and farmers/artisans would put the recommendation made in the study into use there would be increase and improvement in activities of agriculture and also continues growth and development in the agricultural sector.<br/><br/>TABLE OF CONTENT <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0      Introduction <br/>1.1  Background of the study<br/>1.2  Statement of the Problem    <br/>1.3  Objective of the study<br/>1.4  Research Hypothesis<br/>1.5  Significance  of the study     <br/>1.6  scope and Limitation of the study <br/>1.7  Definition of Terms       <br/>References<br/><br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0  Literature Review   <br/>2.1  Agricultural/credit, purpose and establishment of ACGSF.               <br/>2.2  Purpose of the scheme (ACGSF)   <br/>2.3  Objectives of the study <br/>2.4  Importance of the Credit to Nigerian Agriculture<br/>2.4.1 Agricultural Financing in Nigeria<br/><div>2.4.2 Overview of agricultural credit purveyance</div><div>2.5.

The export of the state major cash crops which has in the past supported the economy has verbally stopped.<br/>       While a lot of observers dwelt on the urgent need to reinitialize this sector, Omuma (1998) implied that the adverse effect of non-initialization of the agriculture sector will only bring such condition like famine and Kwashiorkor to the village but emphasizing on the importance of improving agricultural production through loans from government Igbo (1986) said it is now on the government for the independence on the external sources of food because it has tried their state independence to the uncertainties of ridicule.’<br/>       Then in the early seventies, the central bank of Nigeria and the federal government carried out a study to find out reasons for the declining agricultural production. The study revealed that credit was one of the major factors then the commercial and merchant banks (now deposit money bank) were reluctant to lend to agriculture because of the high default risk and the inability of the borrower offer tangible collateral.<br/>       The agricultural credit guarantee scheme was established in 1977 to share in the risk of the banks in agricultural lending and hence encourage them to continue to extend credit to it. As at 31st December 2004 the total investment under the scheme were N4.4billion.<br/><br/>1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>       In our country today, sources of statements have been made in the newspapers and other news media, scholars advocating the use of agriculture for the development and improvement of living standard of the rural people.   Agricultural activities have brought about solutions to our national problem of massive food shortage. Many agricultural cooperative societies plays vital role and function in massive food production they include the following:<br/>1.  Agriculture has embrace all the cooperative activities with the aim of helping farmers in their professional capacities and producers. The inherent weakness of farming Calo of this type of cooperative society.<br/>2.  Agriculture has contributed immensely to the improvement of the viability of the small holders by bringing their economies of scale.<br/>3.  Agricultural activities are a type of producers cooperatives which aim at improving food production and well being of the citizens.<br/><div><br/></div><div>1.2  STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</div>Much of the increase in Nigerians agricultural output in recent years has resulted from expansion of the area under cultivation rather from increased productivity. Some of the many problems militating against the agricultural sector have been listed and discussed.<br/>Infrastructure Problem<br/>Which include the following             <br/>- Poor feeder road and inadequate road network between the rural areas where agriculture production mainly takes place and the urban area<br/>- Lack of appropriate on-farm and off-farm storage facilities.<br/>       Irrigation facilities are still very poor despite the existence of River Basin  and rural Development Authorities (RBRDA) for instance in Ogun state only 15 hectares of land were irrigated between 1997 and 1999 by Ogun-Osun RBRDA.<br/><br/>Manpower/Skill Underdeveloped Problems<br/>       The extension services delivery system still suffers from inadequate number of extension men/women. The few areas that are in place lack mobility to improve on extension farmers while women extensionist are few to handle gender issues.<br/>Inadequate capital is a major problem hindering agricultural production.<br/><br/>Default in repayment of loan by peasant farmers who could not meet up with loan    collateral   requirement       <br/><br/>Low income and poor provision of collateral ,security to qualify for credit worthiness <br/><br/>Government /Regulatory Policy Problems      <br/><br/>       There are numerous policies that are not supportive enough to agriculture transformation E.G landAct ,importation tariff and unproductive policies.<br/><br/>1.3  OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>       The general purpose of this project report is to undertake a study of the existing farmers of agricultural activities and the effort of the government in enhancing the development of agriculture through the agricultural credit guarantee scheme, also the study has the following objectives.<br/>(a)       To examine the organizational structure and the operation of agricultural activities in Enugu state with particular reference to Nkanu East local government area.<br/>(b)      To examine the impact of the farmer’s cooperative societies.       <br/>(c)       Investigate the problems facing the farmers co-operative societies.<br/>(d)      To suggest ways and means for enhancing and proffering for loans from banks for the effectiveness of the societies and assist in further research into contemporary issue on this manner.<br/>(e)       To increase production of livestock and fish to meet the domestic needs and increase surplus for export.<br/>(f)        To know whether there are benefits members derive from the agricultural cooperative societies in the area.<br/><br/>1.4  RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS   <br/>1.  What are the main objectives for establishing of agricultural cooperative societies in Nkanu East local government area?<br/>2.  To what extent have these objectives been realized?<br/>3.  What are the problem militating against agricultural activities?<br/>4.  Do agricultural cooperative societies receive support from the government?<br/>5.  What are their sources of finance?<br/><br/>1.5  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>       Any study that has positive outcome must have negative aspect moreover the significance of the particular studies are central banks of Nigeria has taken up greater responsibilities particularly with respect to information of agricultural policy and various means which enhances agricultural productivity.<br/>       Areas of central banks of Nigeria involvement in improving agricultural activity  includes:<br/>(a)       Agricultural research<br/>(b)      Training of middle level agricultural workers<br/>(c)       Creation of loans and large scale mechanization food agriculture farmers.        <br/>\n\nTHE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE CREDIT GUARANTEE SCHEME FUND IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE CREDIT GUARANTEE SCHEME FUND IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE ", "id": 186}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div align=\"center\">THE IMPORTANCE OF FISH PRODUCTION AND ITS MARKETING VALUE<br/></div><div align=\"center\"><br/></div><div align=\"center\">ABSTRACT<br/></div>The importance of fish production and marketing value of fish production in Ughilli North East Local Government Area of Delta State.

It is also one of the fastest growing segments of animae agriculture. Aquaculture output has grown at a rate of more than 10% for captured fishers and 3% for livestock meat production (FAO, 2000) while only 13 million tons of fish were produced in North American in 1990, there were over 31 million tons produced in 1998. Concurrently, the value of this production doubled from 490 million to nearly 81 billion (USAA, 1998).<br/>       Human consumption of fish and related foods is increasing each year. Demand for fish products is greater than the ability of the oceans to supply them. A reduction in wild –caught fish coupled with increased consumption by American consumers has led to increased profitability, improvement in technology required for captive production, and a rapid expansion of farmed aquatic specie. As a result aquaculture is becoming a major alternatives crop globally and in many areas of the United States illustrates the increasing percentage of the total world fish production supplied by aquaculture in relation to the oceanic catch. Because the oceanic fish is no longer increasing significantly, additional production depends on growing more fish through aquaculture. Approximately 75 percent of the earths surface is covered by water yet humans harvest only 1 percent of their total food supply from this source.<br/><div><br/></div><div>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</div>       Over 4000 years ago the Chinese through trial and error developed a system approach to harvesting the nutritional riches of water. They found that different species feed in different natural niches. The animals of particular use to in the ancient Chinese were complementary varieties or crop. The common crop (Cyprinus Earpio) is abenethic that consumer invertebrates in the bottom of the ponds. For thousand of years carp species provided the Chinese with a sustainable harvest. The Chinese discovered that the use of manure as fertilizer could enhance the productivity of a pond. In the 1880s aquaculturist in Eastern Europe countries also cultured the common carp (Silver carp, black carp, grass carp), in the United States aquacultures was launched when the federal government began hatching and stocking program to restock salmon lost spawning rivers in the North West. In an attempt to increase Salmon numbers in the wild, the federal government began hatching program that were basically “put and take” system. Eggs were collected, hatched in captivity and fingerlings released. This program, although successful in increasing wild-caught number, was actually more successful in providing initial information and research for the science of aquaculture. Hatching and restocking into the wild required development of the same technology as that needed by commercial hatching. This made salmon the major marine fish industry of the United state with more than half the production coming from public because over 600 million commercial salmon landing accounting annually.<br/>       In the 1950s the US government supported programs of farm pond construction and stocking. Although more than 2 million ponds were constructed they have demonstrated little importance for food production. In 1960s ponds were constructed specifically for catfish in the Southern United States where production fastest growing agricultural enterprises from 1970s till today. Catch moved to the Mississippi delta Region. The federal research laboratory in sluttgart, Arkansas, helped promote catfish by providing information and support. Regional government aquaculture research centers have helped bolster growth and profitability of the industry. Aquaculture production in North America involves diverse farming systems in diverse areas. It is most concentrated in the southern region of the United States. Today the US catfish industry of the largest aquaculture industry in the world employing more than 25, 000 people and generating over $ 1 billion annually. More than 178, 000 acres of catfish ponds on 1300 farms produced approximately 100 million metric tones per year. Currently 80% of the catfish production occurs in the state of Mississippi with 105, 000 acres concentrated on 400 farms. Many other commercial species are also centred in the south East Louisiana is the leading producer of craw fish and arkangas leads in baitfish production. Florida is the leading in ornamental fish, increasingly there are niches being found for hybrid stripped bass, fresh water prawns, red fish and tilapias throughout the country. Other species that have potential include allegation, bullfrogs and turtles. Production of the American cupped oyster is predominately from the united state e.g. clams, crayfish, catfish, mussels, cyprinids etc. <br/><div><br/></div><div>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM              </div>       The statement of the problem are;<br/>1.          Do we have fishing ponds in Delta State of Nigeria?<br/>2.          Do we have enough facilities to engage in fishing production?<br/>3.           What can the federal government do about the fishing industry<br/>4.          What are the roles of the public concerning fish production?<br/><div><br/></div><div>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</div>       The purpose of this study is to examine the importance of fish production and it marketing value of fish production in Nigeria, which is the usefulness of rearing of fish and it nutritional value to human.<br/>-                     To identify the marketing value of fish production in our means.<br/>-                     To understand aquatic animals much better now than that in the past.<br/>-                     To bridge the gap resulting from our having invested minimally in salt and fresh water food production research to compare with research investment made in food production from the land.<br/><div><br/></div><div>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </div>       The study of the importance of fish production and it marketing value of fish production in Nigeria is significance not only to agriculturist but to everybody.

For instance during 1980’s about 40% of the total fish supplied in Nigeria were produced form these region.  But as time goes on   there become a drastic decline in fish production from these region.<br/><br/>This became a matter of specially concern to the people of these region. However it is on record that recently specifically in March 2005 that president Obasanjo in his official visit to Delta State was asked why the present government is hesitating in signing into law a bill that would pave way for the draining of River Niger in the region in order to allow for confluence of Rivers so as to increased fish spawning.  His answer was” there are more it takes to attaining  full production in fisheries production than only to draining Rivers”<br/><br/>Meanwhile, combinations of factors were though to be responsible. Firstly environmental changes caused by drought and dam construction has resulted on lower fish production.  Secondly an intensification of fishing effort has been brought about increased  communalization the introduction of modern  gears restriction (such as gears net mesh net etc) which are used in capturing  fish. Furthermore welcome and  Barthey discovered that catches  from in-land fisheries are Indic line state due to deteriorating quality of aquatic environment and  poor management. Similarly  Nigeria  and Biosphere (an association responsible for  the studying of intercalation ship between man and living organism) in 1990 organized an educative seminar on Nigerian water bodies which in broad sense includes flood plain lake reservoir and swamp<br/>   Despite all these protective effort capture fisheries remains highly vulnerable to over exploitation and degradation.  It follows therefore that if fisheries enhancement are to be successful the problems of overexploitations and  degradation must be address in parallel from  the out-set. In response to the need for better understanding of in-land fisheries management and to investigate the possibilities for designing a more effective approach to fisheries management the researcher takes Osimiri Dudu flood pond in Anambra State as a case study.  A particular focus of the project is to investigate whether traditional management system which were perceive to be successful and well adopted to local condition could   be use as a basis for community based approach to fisheries management in the  future in in-land fisheries management.<br/><br/>1.2                  STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>There have been a concerted effort by Anambra State River basin authority (ASEBA) and some organized private sector individuals to improve productivity of fish in here various water bodies recently for instance federal government and state government recently conducted a research work which was assisted by food and agriculture organizaiton (FAO) to find out the rate at which fishes propagate in in-land water bodies in Nigeria  Similarly there  have been also series of seminars and work-shop geared towards educating fishermen for the need for the conservation of Nigerian water bodies.<br/><br/>Inspite of all these effort most water bodies in Nigeria are still in declining trend.   This left the researcher with no other option than only to ponder: what really are the cause of the low productivity? Is it possible that an accurate assessment of the status of these in in-land  fisheries have not been  conducted? Or could it be a lack of detailed information to the stake- holders? Or is the management techniques in use are not suitable? These are what the researcher want to find out in this research work and suggest a possible solutions to the problems.<br/><br/>The challenge to this research work is to therefore to find some management system that would best support fisheries management in the  state in finding and implanting its approach by specifying  institutional arrangement that would prevent degradation and over exploitation occurring in the first place rather than trying to find way to repair the damages ones it has occurred. Such strategy make clear economic sense.  It is also ecologically desirable in line with precautionary principle in that there is no guarantee that renewable natural resources   degradation is reversible. <br/><br/>1.3                  OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>From all that has been written it is the objective of this study:<br/>1.                 To find out why productivity in most in-land water bodies in Nigeria especially that of Osimiri Dude is very low<br/>2.                 To find a means of minimizing over- exploitation in Nigeria water  bodies<br/>3.                 To determine the  cause of the  deteriorating quality of aquatic environment in Nigeria.<br/>4.                 To degraded status of our water bodies.<br/><div><br/></div><div>1.4                  RESEARCH QUESTIONS</div>As a guide to finding solution to the research problem the research posed the following research questions.<br/>1.                 What are the effect of using toxic substance in fishing activities?<br/>2.                 Does environment changes have any impact on in-land  fisheries management?<br/>3.                 What type of management system does local fishermen proffered most?<br/>4.                 How does drought and dam construction effect  fish stocking?<br/>5.                 What time of the year does over concentration of fishermen occurs in water bodies?<br/>6.                 Is there any policy or programme regulating fishing activities?<br/>7.                 Why does over-exploitation occur in Nigerian fishery industries?<br/><br/>1.5                  HYPOTHESIS FORMULATION<br/>The following hypothesis forms the frame work for carrying out the study.<br/>H0:    Using toxic substance during fishing does not effect fish propagation<br/>H1:    Using toxic substance during fishing  effect fish propagation<br/>H0:    Traditional management of system is not the best and general acceptable management system in local community in fisheries management <br/>H1:    Traditional management of system is  the best and general acceptable management system in local community in fisheries management <br/><br/>1.6                  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>It should be recognized that the fundamental issue as regards to fisheries management in  most cases is the allocation of scarce (natural) resource to alternate ends. For example in the case of water bodies which contains major in-land fisheries as population pressure and other stress increase the natural resources become increasingly scare and become valuable.  However because in many cases invitational management do not exist (or inadequate ) for the allocation of resource free and open access to increasingly valuable resources result inevitably in the degradation.<br/><br/>As a result of this, this study become very important especially today that all hands are on deck to develop Nigerian economy. this study will be of immense benefit to both public sector organization and organized private sector in the fishery industries in addition the study will determine the factor limiting fish production in this sector of economy (fishing industries).  It is expected that the findings will help to rediscover the past abundant fish production in in-land water bodies in Nigeria.    <br/><br/>1.7                  SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The scope of this study is very wide if  it has to be carried out in all inland fisheries resource of Nigeria.  The study is limited based on the fact that there is no tome and material resources to see to the whole nation<br/>\n\nMANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION OF IN-LAND FISHERIES RESOURCES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION OF IN-LAND FISHERIES RESOURCES IN NIGERIA", "id": 188}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div align=\"center\">PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF YAM PRODUCTION<br/></div><div align=\"center\"><br/></div><div align=\"center\">ABSTRACT<br/></div>Nigeria is by far the world’s largest producer of yams, accounting for over 70–76 percent of the world production.

To the farmers it is edible root tuber crop, which generate his income for the up-keep of his family and himself. It has helped raised the standard of living over the years. The oxford dictionary describe yam as a starch tuberous root largely replacing potato as a staple food in many tropical and sub-tropical countries of the world.

It is a variety of plant of the genus Hevea (euphorbiaceae) family, native to Brazil. It commonly known as the rubber tree rubber is an important cash crop which contributed sustainably to the Nigerian economy prior to the oil boom. (Aghimien, 1997).<br/>            In recent years, there has been a drastic reduction in rubber production in Nigeria. A total of 207,500 which represented 86.0% of the country’s land area under rubber cultivation on small holdings in 1966, declined to 147,200 hectares in 1980. Recent field surveys showed that more than two thousand of the small holding has been lost to other crop.<br/>            Presently, rubber production in Nigeria has decreased and the rubber industries have continued to fold-up (Agra, 1986).      <br/><br/>1.2             BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>Natural rubber performed three main functions in the Nigerian economy; firstly it provided some of the foreign exchange and placed Nigeria in the world map as an exporter of rubber products. Lastly it provided employment for a sizeable segment of the rural populace. The situation in Nigeria presently pretends a drift from beings a major exporter of rubber products into becoming a net importer in the nearest future.

They are easier and cheaper to keep than chickens. This makes duck keeping for the production of eggs and meat an attractive enterprise about 700 million ducks are kept around the world, the majority of these more than 500million are found in Asia. Despite this uneven distribution, it is certainly also possible to raise ducks in parts of the worlds, including Africa and Latin America. Ducks can be reared for eggs and meat, for own use or for sale. Other products from ducks which can also be sold include down feathers and fattened livers. There are many similarities between chicken and duck rearing. The most obvious similarities are found in the type of the products for which these forms of poultry we kept duck, like chicken are good producers of eggs and meat.<br/><br/>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>Ducks however have several advantages over other poultry species, in particular their disease tolerance. They are hardly, excellent foragers and easy to hard, particularly in wetlands where they naturally tend to flock together. Ducks are relatively easy to raise and generally need less care than chickens.<br/>       This study seeks to determine the problems and prospects of duck rearing in Ovia North East Local Government Area.<br/><br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The study will deal with queries as enumerated below:<br/>a.  Is duck rearing popular in this locality?<br/>b.  Is duck meat popular among people?<br/>c.   Why is duck meat not acceptable to some people<br/>d.  What percentage of the people do not want duck meat?<br/>e.    Hoe can duck meat rearing be improved in this locality?<br/>f.    What is the contribution of duck meat to the poultry industry in Nigeria?<br/><div><br/></div><div>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</div>This research was proposed on the background of the following desires;<br/>a.  To ascertain the level of acceptability<br/>b.  To determine the proficiency of duck meat rearing/farming<br/>c.   To unveil the reasons for level of acceptability of duck meat<br/>d.  To propose ways to enhance duck meat production<br/>e.  To encourage more production of duck meat.<br/><div><br/></div><div>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTION</div>This study will focus on the following queries relating to problems and prospects of duck farming in Ovia North West local Government area of Edo state<br/>a.  What are the problems of duck farming in Ovia North West Local Government Area?<br/>b.  How much as these problems hampered the level of duck productivity?<br/>c.   What are the efforts made by the non government agencies in tackling these problems<br/>d.  What is the contribution of duck farming to the poultry industry?<br/>e.  What are the prospects in duck farming?<br/>f.    How can duck farming be improved?<br/><div><br/></div><div>1.5 HYPOTHESIS</div>       This research study was undertaken with the following assumptions regarding the problems and prospects of duck farming in Ovia North West Local Government area of Edo State.<br/>HO: the dirty nature of ducks has no effect on their acceptability<br/>H1: the dirty nature of duck has effect on their acceptability<br/>HO: high cost of feed, ingredient has no effect on duck production<br/>H1: high cost of feed ingredient has effect on duck production<br/>H0: the popular extensive system of duck rearing has no effect on productivity<br/>H1: the popular extensive system duck rearing has effect on productivity<br/><div><br/></div><div>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</div>This research was based on questionnaire approach involving farmers and rural dwellers in Ovia North West Local Government Area of Edo state.

The domestic birds include fowl ducks, turkey, guinea fowl and geese., poultry products have been found to have the highest protein concentrate of about 20.5% relative to others success of protein (animals) and has the shortest production cycle of all animals.<br/><br/>Production cycle involves all the activities in the rearing of livestock from day old to maturity. For example, to achieve a ten-fold increase in the body weight in relation to weight at bird, Williamson and Payne (1978) outlined that it takes 25 days in broiler, 48 days in piglets, 250 days in caves and 170 days in sheep.<br/><br/>The rearing of pigs, cattle’s and goats however requires extensive kind more than poultry where more units of production can be achieved from a given space compared to the farmer. These advantages are perhaps the cause of a higher turnover in poultry production at reasonably short period of time in this work more emphasis shall be made specifically to the domestic fowl, which are the major birds for commercial and nutritional importance in Ikpoba Okha Local Government of Edo State.  Poultry rearing have been in practice in Ikpoba Okha for a long time. The traditional motive varies from hobby to the use of fowl and eggs as food. Apart from the important roles that the fowl play in the traditional workshop of duties in many parts of the states, some communities use it as gift to their neighbours in appreciation of a good deed and as a mark of solidarity.<br/><br/>The traditional poultry keeping is generally subsistence in outlook without the use of modern scientific methods. Hence the birds under this system are poorly cared for and they are characterized by slow growth rate, poor feed utilization and low productivity. The birds are also exposed to high mortality rate as a result of diseases, pest and bad weather conditions.<br/><br/>However, inspite of the popularity of commercial poultry keeping, the subsistence and the small-scale units are still prevalent all over the place especially in the villages. Although the commercially oriented poultry units are abundant all over the state with varying modern scientific approach to production poultry output continues to be inadequate with prices above the reach of the common man.<br/><br/>This paper will therefore focus attention on the problems and prospect of poultry production in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of Edo state.<br/><br/>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>In Nigeria, the business of poultry farming is concentrated in the hands of few individual partly because of the complex problems such as finance and climatic condition while others are problem of poultry processing and storage facility.<br/><br/>In Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area, there had been retrogression in poultry production due to illiteracy in the maintenance of records. Hence maintenance of record helps the farmer to determine the process of retrogressing nature of the farm. Besides, it helps in making future project, planning and programming in poultry industry. Most farmers either as a result of illiteracy, training or otherwise are unable to keep records. The result is that most extension officers are unable to help them out of their problems due to lack of information.<br/><br/>1.3     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of this study is to investigate the problems encountered by poultry farmers in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area and suggest solutions to them.<br/><br/>1.4     STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS<br/>The ultimate goal of the government or individuals engaged in poultry production today is to achieve a high standard of production with a view of increasing animal products for the ever-increasing populace.<br/><br/>In an attempt to producer enough poultry products {meat and eggs} several problems and constrains have been identified. Some of these problems include finance, quality feeds, disease problems and poor housing condition.<br/><br/>1.5     SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This research work will focus attention to cover Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of Edo state. The information obtained here will only strictly apply to Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area but may be generalized to other parts of the state with similar problems and prospects of rearing poultry. Also efforts would be made to cover as much of the local government area as possible.<br/><br/>1.6     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>It is hoped that the recommendation based on the findings of the study would be of tremendous benefit to the poultry producers, the consumers of poultry products alike and the student’s researchers.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that inexperienced poultry farmers can from this study identify as well as provide them with the basic information needed to raise and manage poultry successfully. Top the consumers, an increase in poultry products means meeting their eggs and poultry meat needs.<br/><br/>It is believed that the research findings would help students who intend to research in a similar topic to have ideas on what the topic is all about and also aid students in the area of further studies.<br/><br/>1.7     DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.          Poultry: This is the term used for all domesticated birds such as chicks, ducks, turkey, guinea fowl etc.<br/>2.          Broiler: These are chickens raised for meat production.<br/>3.          Layers: layers refer to hens that are kept for egg production.<br/>4.          Battery cage system: This is a system of poultry keeping where the birds are confined in a specially designed house.<br/>5.          Deep litter system: This is a system where the birds are kept in a permanent house.<br/>6.          Free-range system: This is where birds are allowed to move freely on the range and feed themselves.<br/>7.          Hatchery: This is an aspect of poultry where day old chicks are produced mainly by artificial incubation.<br/>8.          Veterinary: A surgeon concerned with diseases of animals and domestic animals.<br/>\n\nPROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF REARING POULTRY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF REARING POULTRY", "id": 192}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div align=\"center\">PROBLEMS AND SOLUTION ON PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING OF CASSAVA<br/></div><div align=\"center\"><br/></div><div align=\"center\">ABSTRACT<br/></div>This study deals with the production and processing with special reference to Ovia North East Local Government Area of Benin City Centres for the purpose of this investigation two (2) study centres were randomly selected a questionnaire made up of eighteen (18) items was constructed with assistance of my supervisor and administrated.

They are rich in food stuff to man. The leaves are also used as vegetables in soups, while the peels are feeds to live stock and also the tuber are rich source of carbohydrate they are also found to contain some vitamins such as vitamin c and a well as some trace of phosphorous and iron.<br/>   The plant is woody and may grow up to the height of 1m to 4m depending on the variety. The main stems and the branches contain knoblike scar, which are the point of leaf attachment, many people both men and women have engage themselves in trading with cassava processed one way or the other.<br/>   And there are two types of cassava, differentiated by the prussic content (hydrocyanic acid contained in the tuber).<br/>i.            The sweet cassava:- this contain low level of poisonous prussic in the flesh of the tuber with high concentration in the peels<br/>ii.           The bitter cassava: - this contain high amount of prussic acid in the flesh of the tuber with lower concentration in peels.<br/>   But the farmers are able to cultivated or process them. Today (mamhot Escalante does not exist in the state spread plant important not exist in the mostly area)<br/><br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>   This study is to investigate various techniques of method of producing and processing cassava in Nigeria and also considers the various stages ranging from planting of stem cutting to the harvesting and finally processing of the products.<br/>   There are many problems encountered by both rural and urban farmers in relation to the production processing and storage of both the products and the implements.<br/>1.  Limited stem cutting i.e. Planting material<br/>2.  Inadequate land due to land tenure systems<br/>3.  Use of crude implements like cutlass, hoe etc<br/>4.  Pest and disease<br/><br/>OBJECTIVES<br/>   Objectives of this project are:<br/>a.  To examine the problems<br/>b.  To find out the solution to some of the problems’<br/>c.   To investigate the production and utilization of cassava in south part of Nigeria and also identify the different forms in which cassava are processed into its various finished products like processing the cassava to garri or fufu e.t.c as a food for human consumption.<br/><br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT<br/>1.  The research study will be useful to those  who are engaged directly or indirectly in the production and processing of cassava in south part of Nigeria in particular and the country as large<br/>2.  The study is designed to look into hoe the production of the farm in southern. Cassava can enhance the well being of the people in this local government area and also mankind<br/>3.  It will serve to encourage the farmers in the study area who take cassava production and processing as their last hope in life.<br/>4.  The study is hoped to motivate the farmers to go into fulltime cassava production in the area.<br/>5.  It is hoped that at the end of this project, the work will be able to expose and brings to the best, production and processing cassava in south part in Ovia Local Government Area.   <br/><br/>SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>   The study is armed at providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the operations, function and performance involved in the production and processing of cassava in southern part of Nigeria with the view of providing useful suggestion to ease the problems of this aspects of agricultural development in Nigeria.<br/>   It is directly geared towards the application of production and processing concept.<br/><br/>HYPOTHESIS<br/>   Some question to be tackled in the course of study has been raised as follows?<br/>A.  Is any decline in the production and processing in different area of the local government area?<br/>B.  What are the problems facing cassava production and processing in the area.<br/>C.  What are the effect of cassava production in the local government area<br/><br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Production: the process of growing or making food, goods or materials, especially large quantities<br/>Processing: means the used to making the production in order to serve as food for human consumption<br/>Cassava: a type of flour made from the thick parts of tropical plant.<br/>\n\n PROBLEMS AND SOLUTION ON PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING OF CASSAVA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  PROBLEMS AND SOLUTION ON PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING OF CASSAVA", "id": 193}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div align=\"center\">THE ROLE OF RURAL WOMEN FARMERS ON THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF EDO STATE<br/></div><div align=\"center\"><br/></div><div align=\"center\">ABSTRACT<br/></div>The role of rural women farmers in the economic development of Egor Local Government Area in Edo State cannot be over emphasized. There is basically no aspect of economic development in Edo State that one cannot find women. A review of feminist literature, indicate that there is now a demand for re-orientation of research and change in methodological procedures used for complication of national statistics so as to reflect accurately the position of women and their labour in the national economy in general and Edo State in particular. On the realization of the role women play in our daily life, it is therefore necessary to identify the role as a point of reference. It is on this basic aim prompted as a research to go into the findings. The objective of this project work therefore is to highlight the role of rural women farmers in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State with a view to identifying attendant problem and indicating necessary recommendation. Attention is focused on the rural women farmers in the economic activities through agricultural, strategies are indicated for using women as a catalyst for employment generation and for solving Egor Local Government Area food agriculture and economic development problem. Women need to be encouraged to broaden their base and increase their scale of operation particularly in agro industries and through self employment.

A review of feminist literature indicates that there is now a demand for re-orientation of research and changes in methodological procedures used for complication of national income. There are at least three stands to this firstly; there is the issue that a considerable portion of women’s labour is not reflection in Egor Local Government statistics. This is a phenomenon due to the fact that the labour of the house wife is not traded and valued at market prices.<br/>       Secondly, there is the formal versus informal sector issue. On a worldwide basis, but more so in the developing countries of the world women constitute the greater percentage of the informal sector labour forces. Thirdly, there is the rural-urban dichotomy more than not; women are left behind when there is male migration from rural to urban areas. These three issues are mutually self explanatory as women get left behind in the rural areas. They have limited opportunities for self improvement. They are therefore suitable mainly informal sector employment. Their labour as house wives, house maids etc is not accurately affected in nation statistics. Another relevant issue is that where women are in selection for religions or social reasons, enumerators who are more often men cannot meet the women to accurately appraise their labour input.<br/><br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS   <br/>       The basic premise of this essay is that the non involvement or marginalization of women in development programmes is wasteful and impedes effective economic development. Its effect is similar to inadequate use of factor of production in agriculture which means that the production possibilities curve is lower than it should be on the basis of this premise, the problem associated with the involvement of women in the economic development of Edo State and strategies of solving these problems are discussed.<br/><br/>PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>       The objective of this paper is therefore to highlight the role of women in economic development of Egor Local Government Area in Edo State with view to identifying attendant problem and suggesting possible solution.<br/><br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>       It is hoped that this study will be useful in selecting appropriate rural women in Egor Local Government Area. it is also hoped that it will help the rural women in producing and advertising their products.<br/>       Finally, it is my hope that the project work will justify the economic investment in rural women in Egor Local Government Area.<br/><br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.  Does transportation problem put a serious problem in the rural women farmers?<br/>2.  Is inadequate finance a problem to rural women farmers?<br/>3.  Does diseases outbreak affects their products?<br/>4.  Does bad road affect rural women farmers?  <br/>5.  Does an inadequate material affect their product?<br/><br/>SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>       The study focuses on economic development of rural women farmers in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State.

Eggs and poultry meat are produced primarily for food consumption. Eggs are also used in various food industries like the manufacturing of confectionary (i.e. sweet chocolate cakes etc.). They are also used for the manufacturing of cosmetics of infection diseases while the feathers may be used for making pillows and mattresses. Some species of poultry are suitable for genetic nutritional and physiological studies because of their relatively low cost of maintenance, proliferation (a rapid growth or increase in numbers) and short generation intervals. In the earlier time, the keeping of poultry were not being considered as a major occupation; that is birds were kept to obtain some money and in most cases for pleasure and pastime cock fighting. In some areas or communities, fowls are still used in the past as a means of knowing what times of day, most especially the cock (i.e. male fowl).<br/><br/>Poultry farming started those days when our local farmers used the old and extensive method in keeping fowls, goats, sheep, pig and other related domestic animals proved that the poultry section was a profitable venture too. Gradually, poultry keeping developed into a commercial enterprise involving thousands of birds, large poultry units, replace small ones while more efficient strains of birds, balanced feeds, intensive housing and better poultry equipment come into use. All these industrialized system of keeping poultry birds in a recent development in Edo state as in most humid tropical countries. The effect of some environmental factors like the industries are less capitalized, consists of smaller units and depend more on manual labour. These lead to less production of the birds or the birds perform at a lower level. Due to this account, the cost of poultry production is higher. All these factors contribute to the lower consumption of poultry production in the tropical areas like Edo state. For example, the recent estimate of eggs consumption in Nigeria was far low when compared with the European countries and the United States. Moreover, the industries in the tropical areas are not as diversified as in the temperate. In the tropics, the emphasis is on egg production and only one species of poultry (the domestic fowl) is used. Whereas economic and nutritional benefits can be derived from keeping other species, for example some strains of ducks are fast growing, resistance to many diseases of the domestic fowl and can produce as many as 300 eggs per annum. These can be used to increase the consumption of poultry products in the tropics.<br/><br/>However, throughout the world, the domestic birds are unique for its popularity in producing both poultry meat and eggs while the other species are kept primarily for meat. In order for poultry birds to produce efficiently, there is need to raise them under a conducive environment. We have various ways of rearing birds like the industrialized system of rearing birds.<br/><br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>Poultry, which is of economic importance to the entire members of the society because it provides meat and eggs for consumption. The bones are being used as bone meals to farm animals. It is therefore important that these products get to the final consumer at the place and time they are needed. This is only possible when the marketing system is efficient. This study is therefore concerned with the appraisal of the problems of marketing poultry products in Orhionmwon Local Government Area.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is designed to achieve the following objectives:<br/>1.  To identify the type of poultry products sold in Orhionmwon Local Government area.<br/>2. To identify the problems affecting the marketing of poultry products.<br/>3. To find out how best the problems of marketing poultry products can be solved.<br/>4. To make recommendations based on  finding of the study.<br/><br/>RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>To assist in carrying out appraisal into the problems of marketing poultry products in Orhionmwon Local Government area, some research questions will be useful and these include:<br/>i)            How does extension system of rearing poultry affects its product?<br/>ii)          What is the importance of transportation in the marketing of poultry products?<br/>iii)        Which part of poultry products do you sell most daily?<br/>iv)        Why are poultry products difficult in market?<br/>v)          What way so you think will help in the marketing of poultry products?<br/><br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>The need for appraisal of this type is to know the problems facing the marketing of poultry products in Orhionmwon Local Government area in Edo state. it is assumed that at the end farmers and the consumers within the territory in which the appraisal was carried out will benefit from the findings of the study. During the appraisal, some farmers were questioned and they responded actively and also ask various question s, which help them to rear their livestock very well. Therefore, this study will help the farmer within Orhionmwon local government area to known the various system of rearing birds in other to keep them away from infection diseases. It will also help them to known the best the best marketing channel to sell their products. Also this study will help the consumers in that same area to known the most hygienic place to purchase their meat and other domestic products from.<br/><br/>SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>In this scope, poultry products in Orhionmwon local government area will be carefully examined.

Agriculture is the cultivation of soil growing of crops and rearing of animals for man use. Agriculture has always been the major activity in Nigeria in general and also Edo State particularly producing a variety of food and cash crops. Agriculture is divided or categorized into three; they are subsistence agriculture, commercial agriculture and plantation agriculture.<br/>          The subsistence agriculture is practices with only crude implements, a few crops that are the cultivation. Here, the farmer grows crops for himself and his immediate family. This is done by clearing a small portion or area of land and cultivate it. The commercial agriculture is when food crops are grown for the purpose of making profit. The commercial agriculture is the combination of arable farming and animal husbandry; the people in this area produce for export market that is on commercial basis.  Plantation agriculture practice in Nigeria and in Edo State in particular plantation agriculture is the growing of cash crops on a large hectare of land o a large scales. In plantation agriculture crops like cocoa rubber oil palm and shrub like cotton and coffee are grown.<br/>          Rubber is grown in Edo State and in the western states of the Nigeria. Large quantities are grown in small area like Iguorhiaki, Ehor, Irrua in Esan central Local Government Area and Ologbo in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area. Rubber (Heuea Brasiliensis) is originated from south America, belongs to the family of euphorbiaceous. It grows well on most soils that are well drained with annual rainfall of 2700-5000mm and the tree grows from 45cm at a height of 150cm from the ground. The seeds are planted at a spacing of 30cm to 30cm and later thinned to 30x60cm or 60x60cm depending on competition for nutrient. It has a smooth light grey trunk; the palmate leaves of rubber tree are alternate, each with three leaflets. The flower are monoecious and the three flower in the dry seasons, when the leaves are shaded the fruits have three seeds.<br/>          Harvesting is done when it has attained the age of 6-7 years when then tree are considered matured and have attained a girth circumference of 45cm at a height of 150cm from the ground. To open the plantation for tapping, the following materials are required.<br/>          Temperature for initial marking, collecting cups, cup hangers, spouts, tapping knife, and Sharping stone.<br/>          Rubber finds a wide spectrum of uses in almost every aspect of human endeavour. It is mainly used in automobiles tyres and other accessories, manufacturing of pillows balloons, gloves, boot wears, batts etc and also plastic industry in the production of articles, production of both hand wares among other things.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS   <br/>          The major factors hindering agricultural development in Nigeria and in Edo State specifically are as follows:<br/>-                     Manpower problem<br/>-                     Marketing and storage facilities<br/>-                     Land tenure system<br/>-                     Disease and pest problem<br/>-                     Climatic factors such as inadequate rainfall<br/>-                     Poor banking etiquette, laurck of capital and also inadequate collateral security<br/>HYPOTHESIS<br/>          The hypothesis is formulated to guide the researcher in this study.<br/>1.            The conservation attitude of rubber farmers hampers the growth of rubber production.<br/>2.            Inadequate finance lead to low productivity of rubber production in Edo State.<br/>3.            The system of land tenure also hamper the cultivation of plantation crops in Nigeria specifically Edo State  <br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>          The objective of this study is:<br/>1.            To identify the problem of plantation agriculture in Edo State with special emphasis on rubber production<br/>2.            To examiner the importance of rubber production in Edo State.<br/>3.            To draw a conclusion and recommendations based on fining for improving extension practices.<br/>4.            To analyze the harvest, processing and sales methods of rubber in area.<br/>5.            And also to find solution to the identified problem stated.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY  <br/>          There are many plantation crops grown in Nigeria. In this study, an attempt will be made to ascertain the problems and prospect of rubber production. The area of interest is Ovia South West Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY  <br/>          The significance of this study is that at the end of research work:<br/>1.            People will be able to know those problems that are associated with rubber production and also how to handle such problem when they arise.<br/>2.            It will help the rubber producers to improve their method of farming.<br/>3.            It will also bring to the people awareness about the new variety of rubber.<br/>4.            At the end of this research work the farmers will be able to know the new challenges arising from rubber production and also how to adapt to such challenges.<br/>5.            It will also bring to the people awareness about the importance and contribution of rubber production in the economy of the state.<br/>METHODOLOGY<br/>          This research work is organized as follows chapter one is made up of the introduction while chapter two is the review of related or relevant literature on the subject matter.

In the process of the research questionnaires were administered to farmers and workers, so as to enable the researcher collect the required data which were selected and analyzed using simple percentage. The findings of the study revealed that problems facing oil palm production include lack of adequate land space, inadequate storage facilities which result in low production of oil palm, inadequate finance etc while those of its prospect include that the cultivation of oil palm is an inevitable means of shifting the nation’s dependence on oil sectors as the main stay of the nations economy, a means of encouraging rural agriculture since southern Nigeria with particular reference to Nifor is fertile for oil palm production and as a means of discouraging urban drift. Recommendations were given thereby encouraging the setting up of  small scale industries in the rural areas were oil palm is produced as a means of reducing unemployment and encouraging rural development.<br/><br/> TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE     <br/>Introduction<br/>Background to the Study<br/>Statement of problem<br/>Objective of the study<br/>Significant of the study<br/>Scope of the study<br/>Basic assumption<br/><br/>CHAPTER TWO    <br/>Literature Review<br/><br/>CHAPTER THREE <br/>Research methodology<br/>Design of study<br/>Area of study<br/>Population of the study<br/>Sample and samplings techniques<br/>Research instrument<br/>Administration of research instrument<br/>Method of data Analysis<br/><br/>CHAPTER FOUR   <br/>Data analysis<br/><div><br/></div><div>CHAPTER FIVE    </div>Summary<br/>Implication of findings<br/>Recommendations<br/>REFERENCES       <br/>QUESTIONNAIRES     <br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>The oil palm originated in tropical West Africa where it is found growing in any areas the centres of production of oil palms stretches from Senegal, through Dahondy and Nigeria to Congo and Angola. Nigeria is one of the worlds loading producer of palm oil and palm kernels palm produce was the main commodity which attracted the early European traders to west African those traders save the oil rivers to the Nigeria delta area where they traded the use of oil palm and it products are many the leaves are used for making brooms and for roofing materials the back and the front is paled and weaving into baskets, the main trunk can be split and used as supporting frames in buildings a sap tapped from the female flower is drunk as palm wine a rich source of year red palm oil can be extra from the fibrous layers of the nuts of the fruit bunch this is locally used in the manufacture of candles, margarine, and soap a clear oil from the kernels is used for making pomades palm kernel meats is used as a menial food the empty fruit bunch, the shell and fortress which remain after oil extraction are used as fondle many plantation of oil palm have been establish in west African, but most palm produced is obtained from palms growing wild.<br/><br/>1.2     STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Edo state is one of the major oil producing area in Nigeria recently some other ones have sprang up and Edo state is noted as the largest producers of palm oil and kernels in Nigeria yet there is storage of palm oil and kernels in Nigeria not to talk of export the yield of palm kernels for export which used to add to the nations revenue as falling. It is therefore they concerned of these study to identify the reasons of problems responsible for the falling level of oil palm producing in the area of study and also to render useful suggestions.<br/><br/>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The objectives of the study are<br/>1.  To identify and examine the problems of oil palm production in Edo state.<br/>2.  To find out solutions to some of those problem.<br/>3.  To make recommendation for improve or better oil palm production in Edo state.<br/><br/>1.4     SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study is focused on the oil palm production problems and prospects in Edo state specifically Nigeria institute for oil palm research in Benin city for the purpose of the research, oil palm production will be among small scale farms will be used as a case study in the light of the above information gathering will be limited to communities in NIFOR.<br/><br/>1.5     THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>The importance of oil production to the society cannot be over emphasized therefore this research work is designed to find out the problem facing the improvement of oil palm production, problem and prospect in NIFOR (Edo state).<br/>1.  It is hoped that the results of the research will be of use in the improvement of oil palm production.<br/>2. Besides, the study will help agricultural policy planners in the under standing of the problems of oil palm production and how to solve them.<br/><div><br/></div><div>1.6     HYPOTHESIS</div>The hypothesis of this study are formulated are<br/>1.  Inadequate storage facilities result in low cultivation of oil palm in Nigeria<br/>2. Attack by pest and disease lead to decline in oil production.<br/>3. Inadequate land space affect the production of oil palm farmers who produce oil palm are called with the problems of advise from the extension workers.<br/>\n\nPROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF PALM OIL PRODUCTION.

He has depended on the natural burning of the forest and water body. It is only recently as perhaps ten thousand year ago that man began to adopt and attempt to domesticate animals and plants. He began the transition from primitive hunting and gathering and the practices of animal’s husbandry and tilling of the land.<br/><br/>At first, he did this unconsciously but as time passed he consciously selected the better forms of animals and pants for breeding purposes. This process has to continue to accelerate to modern times and has gone so far that the common agricultural crops and animals of today are very unlike the wide forms.<br/><br/>In modern times men consciously selected both plants and animals according to the well-established principles of genetic inheritance and breeds form more closely adapted to his requirement.<br/><br/>Agriculture is a sinequanon to any economy for an economy to develop well the agricultural sector must be given a dynamic role to play. Inspite of the important role of agriculture in Edo state, the people or citizen have vague ideal that agriculture is concerned only with soil cultivation. But a more comprehensive definition according to Olyyemi (1975) defined agriculture as the cultivation of soil and the feeding and management of crops and livestock for the use of man, the disposal of those products for marketing.<br/><br/>In some nation, agriculture sector is give priority because it provide raw material for the industrial sector, food and meat for the development of man, food and shelter are basic necessities for human consumption are both originated from farming activities. Whether one work in secondary or territory sector, without agriculture, the final output which we rely upon cannot be achieved.<br/><br/>As regard to the important, agriculture provides employment opportunities to the labour for through direct employment into agricultural and interrelated industrial and manufacturing sectors. For this, sector contribute efficiently, there is need for better decision making and implementation, good management and adoption of cost production techniques distributive channels, marketing, research for better pricing system, recognition of the availability of land including soil preservation and provision of storage facilities.<br/><br/>Farm out become low because the system of farming still involves the use of simpler farm tools like cutlass and hoe on proper knowledge on how to apply chemicals to those crops. Capital investment is small and modern input like fertilizer and improved seeds are still not widely use by most of the farmers.<br/><br/>As developed and industrialized countries like United State of America, Germany, Canada, etc agriculture still ranks high in their government privities. This is so because it provides them on alternative sources of foreign reserve, as well as internal, direct and indirect economic benefits derived from balanced terms of trades with other countries.<br/><br/>Be that at it may, poor performance of the agriculture sector to provide adequate food for the growing population declining productivity of most exported crops which has contributed to substantial reduction in foreign exchange earning and declining condition of agricultural products to gross domestic products in the real terms.<br/><br/>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS<br/>Due to the fact that agriculture play an important role in the development of the economy of Edo state, some problem are still associated with the production of agriculture. The attitude of the farmer towards production of crops, little did they know about new technology of modern farming. Most farmers are still stick to their old ways as a result of the use of crude equipment in farming such as cutlass, thereby reducing the yield in production.<br/><br/>Cultural consciousness had made some farmers to willing object to the use of farming technique because of some cultural belief that if the modern system is applied, the crops will not do well or the gods of the land will not be happy with them as such they restrict the production to a particular location, no need for expansion, this will lead to low productivity.<br/><br/>The fact that most our farmers are low level income earners, they cannot invest on the purchase of machine that could have boost their production. Also most people are of the mind that agriculture is simply farming as a matte of fact, its meant for the low level people, this has made many of them deviate from the farming practice.<br/><br/>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The major objectives of the study are:<br/>1.          To identify the problems facing agriculture production in Edo state.<br/>2.          To examine the role of agriculture in economic development of Edo state.<br/>3.          To suggest possible solution to the problems that have emanated.<br/>4.          To make appropriate recommendations to the farmers or modern use of farming techniques<br/><div><br/></div><div>1.4     HYPOTHESIS</div>In the light of the objective of the study, the following significances are formulated.<br/>1.          Inadequate funding leads to low productivity of agriculture in Edo state.<br/>2.          Conservative attitude of the farmers to adapt to modern techniques of agricultural practices lead to low agricultural productivity.<br/>3.          Lack of proper usage of agriculture facilities such as fertilizer, chemical, etc leads to low production of agricultural development of the economy.<br/>4.          High level of illiteracy affect the role of agriculture in the economic development of the state<br/>5.          Government inability to provide incentive to farmer lead to low productivity of agriculture.<br/><br/>1.5     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The role of agriculture is a sinequanon in the economic development of Edo state, as a matter of fact; the importance of agriculture will be enumerated.<br/>Agriculture provides the basic for requirement of the population. Man needs some essential nutrient for nourishment of the body growth. It also supplies many of the raw materials for industry for the manufacture of goods for the use of man.<br/><br/>Agriculture provides income and employment for the majority of the population. Around ninety percent (90%) of the population of West African employed in agriculture in Nigeria, seventy (70) percent of the figure are slightly below the average for the whole west Africa but even in the country, the great majority of the population depend on agriculture for income and employment.<br/><br/>Agriculture exports are of great importance in earning foreign exchange of the country that buy these product pay for them in their own currency.<br/><br/>These money got as a result of exchange of agricultural goods can be use to purchase some vital goods like capital goods which help in the economic development of the nation or state.<br/><br/>1.6     SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study covers the problems of agriculture in the economic development of Edo state and emphasis will be laid on some specific area of production, such as crops.

Recent trends all over the world, point to a decline in landing from capture fisheries, an indicator that fish stocks have approached or even exceeded the point of maximum sustainable yield. Aquaculture therefore remains the only viable alternative for increasing fish production in order to meet the protein need of the people. Catfishes of the family Claridae comprise the most commonly cultivated fishes in Nigeria. The growth of aquaculture in Nigeria now is largely being boosted by a steady rise in catfish culture. Inadequate availability of seed for stocking and feed used to be major problems. Tremendous progress is now being made. The total value of the industry today is US$800 from the value of fingerlings, feed and farmed fish. Since the culture of Clarias gariepinus through hypophysation was initiated in Western Nigeria in 1973, the procedure has been widely practiced throughout Nigeria thus leading to increase of farm-raised catfishes from the 80’s to date. The favoured  catfish species in Nigeria aquaculture include:  gariepinus, Heterobranchus bidorsalis, Clarias,  Heterobranchus hybrid (Heteroclarias) and Clarias, nigrodigitatus. Heterobranchus sp. is the more commonly cultured fish in the south eastern parts of Nigeria. African catfish is popular in the market and has great potentials to boost the rapidly growing Nigerian aquaculture.<br/><br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Fish farming has not been fully explored as a strategy to reduce poverty levels despite its potential to improve livelihoods in rural communities. Low productivity, prohibitive establishment costs, high farm-level losses and inefficient marketing often pose a problem.<br/><br/>The low level of productivity results from lack of appropriate production knowledge and skills, suboptimal stocking and/or overstocking, poor fish  population control methods and inadequate feeding due to costly feeds.<br/><br/>Complications arise from high capital requirements for establishing a fish  farm, especially for excavation, stocking of fingerlings and installation of protective chain link. The losses at farm-level arise from predators such as snakes, monitor lizards and birds, and from improper harvesting and post-harvest techniques. Inefficient marketing results from a lack of farmers  ability to integrate production and marketing activities.<br/><br/>It is therefore imperative that youth and farmers are supported to initiate fish farming using the fish farm approach through provision of startup fingerlings and other technical inputs for developing business plans.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>A.  To promote fish-farming in Nigeria and contribute to increased household incomes<br/>B.  To facilitate the development of fish farm project into a modern  fish farm project in Edo State.<br/>C.  To highlight the problem associated with small scale fish farm in Oredo.<br/>D.

The type of poultry that are commonly reared in Nigeria are chickens, ducks, guinea fowls, turkeys, pigeons and more recently ostriches.<br/><br/>The importance of protein in our diet cannot be over emphasized poultry production is also profitable through capital intensive. The importance of protein in diet and lack of good management and low maintenance of the pre existing poultry farms in Enugu has necessitated the formation of Phinomar (Nig) Ltd is suited at Ngwo Agi in Udi Local government Area of Enugu state. The farm is owned by Igwe I.O.U Ayalogu of Enugu Village in Ngwo who provided the entire capital and material requirement for the take off of the farm at interception. His oldest son by name prince Uche Ayalogu was the managing director of the farm.<br/><br/>The firm started in 1963 with few birds about 12 birds, which later in premier position of the farm. Over a period of time the stock of birds and the type of birds, which later in premier position of the farm. Over a period of time the stock of birds and the type of birds in the farm include broilers, layers and cockerels, the farm is also in fishers. Presently the capital structure of the farm is made up of personal saving and loan from financial institutions (banks) the staff strength of the farm presently is two hundred and forty-eight employees (248) while at interception, it involves only the nuclear family member.<br/><br/>1.2     STATEMENT  OF THE PROBLEM<br/>It has said earlier that poultry husbandry has become the most intensive sector in livestock farming as an example of agricultural products among Nigerians at large and precisely Enugu state. Within any geographical set up, one may observe many houses and huts put up by poultry farmers. Most of these farmers have it as a mere hubby. It provides the keeper with eggs for domestic use and possibly meat after the fowl might have dropped in laying eggs, with in a space of time according to the type of fowls kept. Con sequent upon the aforementioned facts, the poultry farmer will be a great draw back to him.<br/><br/>Some of the key problems hindering the progress of the phinomar Nigeria Ltd. Ngwo .<br/>a.  Poor management and lack of expertise in the farm.<br/>b.  Shortage of manpower or lack of adequate manpower.<br/>       The study however centered especially on the above identified problem and such other problems that were discover in the course of investigation into the operation of the farm.<br/><br/>1.3     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of this research work is to critically review the extent the marketing concept, which is the basis of effective business, is applied in marketing concept, (Agricultural product) as it relates to phinomar Nigeria. Ltd Ngwo Enugu state. It is sometimes misconstrue that there is no body regulating the activities of poultry farmers in the area of sanitation, price setting and entire management of such venture. For this course, it is the purpose of this research among the aforementioned facts to :<br/>-     Find out the extent of standardization in the poultry business.<br/>-     Examine how the commercialization of this poultry agricultural products is line with the marketing concept of phinomar Nigeria Ltd is a part.<br/>-     Make a total review of the extent phinomar Nigeria. Ltd have been farming in up holding the prescribed practices in comparison with the poultry industries and other agricultural industries in Enugu state.<br/>-     Make useful suggestions and recommendations necessary to up lift the importance of the application of marketing principles in the marketing of agricultural products in Enugu state.<br/>-     Enrich the research student with the knowledge of poultry keeping as a viable business venture.<br/>The general purpose of this research is to develop a system of managing poultry farming in Enugu state with a view to enhance poultry development in the area. The successful producer today must utilize  combination of the most efficient bird and sound management practices.<br/><br/>1.4     SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The focus of this study is on the problem and prospect on poultry management. The scope covers poultry management, poultry husbandry, poultry business and poultry production.<br/><br/>1.5     RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>-     What promotional strategies do you adopt in the marketing

poultry.  The unitial success of the introduction and adaptation as evidence from improved production record, several fold higher than what could be drained for local breeds stimulate the expansion of the industry first by government firm and lat by entrepreneur who quickly understood the profit or gain of the men industry.<br/>       Consequently, the production marketing and consumption of the poultry production followed purely traditional method and channel.  Although cash income was the motivation there was rarely any good planning I this system of the poultry keeping.  No special provision or programme was made for breeding housing, recording or costing.<br/>       Prior, to the introduction of commercial poultry business in Nigeria a few commercial poultry business in Nigeria few commercial houses were importing eggs and broiler with the successful adaptation of exotil poultry in Nigeria around the middle and late fifties and in the main agricultural station like Umudike and summary the foundation for modern commercial poultry was first laid government programme were developed based on acceleration poultry production through the importation of laying flock and distribution of day old chick at subsidized price to farmers.<br/><br/>1.1  BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/>       The background of the study, poultry family in Enugu stage: as I have explained the

As a development finance institution it is government owned (CBN 40% and federal ministry of finance 60%) and supervised by federal ministry of agriculture. The bank was incorporated as Nigerian Agricultural Bank (NAB) in the year 1973 and in the year 1978 was renamed Nigeria Agricultural and Co-operative bank (NACB).<br/><br/>Subsequently in the year 2000, it was merged with the people’s bank of Nigeria (PBN) and took over the risk assets of Family Economic Advancement Programme (FEAP) to become Nigeria agricultural Co-operative and Rural Development Bank. A plan to reposition the bank into an effective and sustainable national agricultural and rural development finance institution in 2010 led to a further name change to Bank of Agriculture (BOA). Bank of agriculture limited is dedicated primarily to agricultural financing at both the micro and macro levels as well as micro financing of small and medium scale enterprises.<br/><br/>The bank has a 3-tier administrative structure.  The Head Office is in Kaduna and there are six zonal offices located at Abuja, Kano, Bauchi, Enugu, Port Harcourt and Ibadan.  Under the Zonal Offices, there is a network of over 200 branches.  Enugu zonal office is responsible for monitoring and supervision of the activities of the 26 branches in the South-East zone which are distributed as follows:<br/><br/>26 BRANCHES IN THE SOUTH – EAST ZONE UNDER ENUGU ZONAL OFFICE SUPERVISION<br/>ABIA<br/>ANAMBRA<br/>EBONYI<br/>ENUGU<br/><div>IMO</div><div>Umuahia</div>Awka<br/>Abakaliki<br/>Enugu<br/><div>Owerri</div><div>Akoli Imenyi</div>Ihiala<br/>Afikpo<br/>Nsukka<br/><div>Aboh Mbaise</div><div>Isuochi</div>Nteje<br/>Akaeze<br/>Oji

decline in agricultural production necessitated the establishment of the bank.  The BOA is not the only financial institution which provides agricultural credit.  Prior to the establishment of BOA, agricultural credit schemes was operated by some agencies such as the Ministry of Agriculture, supervising credit scheme, agricultural credit co-operative thrift and loan scheme, farmers multi-purpose co-operative societies.  Most of these institutions were not effective sources for strictly agricultural credit.  There were a lot of evidence that creditors borrowed money for agriculture but diverted it to other ventures.  Again, credit was often extended to only favourites and scarcely to genuine small scale farmers.  Besides, they could not meet the collateral and equity contribution requirements, a situation that compelled a significant proportion of the farmers to seek for other sources of credit.<br/><br/>According to Idachaba quoted from Cardoso, (1987:18) or research carried out showed that 58% of farming related borrowing was from family and friends, 224% from private money tenders, 15% from merchants and only 3% from institutional sources.<br/><br/>It is against this background that the researcher is to investigate how credit will effectively administered in co-operative enterprises.  They will enable us to identify the major problems associated with credit administration in co-operative agricultural banks and seek solution to these problem to ensure continued existence of developing co-operatives.<br/><br/>1.2     STATEMENT OF PROBLEM:<br/>In this sector, co-operative banks mobilizes credit for their members through the savings of members.  It has been observed that they are inefficient in mobilizing and utilization of credits.  Many problems led to this ineffective mobilization of credit.  They are:<br/>-                     Illiteracy and lack of awareness.<br/>-                     High cost of credit delivery due to the fact that farmers are many and are scattered.<br/>-                     Default in loan repayment.<br/>-                     Inadequate funds to lend to the numerous customers.<br/>-                     Diversion of loans<br/>-                     Inefficient management of loan<br/>-                     Faulty loan policy which may sometimes emphasize credit worthiness of borrowers and not viability of projects.<br/>-                     Credit operations of meek money activities without proper organization procedure and planned systematic arrangement.<br/>-                     Absence of regular monitoring and supervision of loans.<br/>The above problems need to be solved for effective performance of co-operatives.<br/><br/>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY:<br/>The situation of co-operatives is nothing to write home about, if co-operatives should continue at this rate, they will wind up.  In view of the above, solution have to be designed for these problems.<br/>Therefore, the objective of the study is to find out the various societies existing in the area under review.  To find out various problems being encountered by these co-operatives which tend to hinder their effective and efficient performance as agent of credit.  Finally, to make recommendations and suggest probably solutions that will enable these societies overcome the problems so as to function effectively.<br/><br/>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTION:<br/>For the fact that credit is very important in every business activities, therefore, the study is focused on finding relevant solutions to the following research questions:<br/>1.    How do you manage your agricultural credit techniques?<br/>2.    What is the purpose of credit management in agricultural co-operative bank in Enugu South?<br/>3.    What problems are encountered in the administration of credit in agricultural co-operative bank and what are the solutions to these problems?<br/><div><br/></div><div>1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:</div>The study will assist the loan committed managers in their decision making, as it concerns credit policy and management of credit in form of proper assessment of loan applications, proper supervision of credit and evaluation of project proposals.  It will help the management to see the need to employ professional staff.<br/><br/>Lastly, the study or findings will be of educational importance to the various universities, polytechnics and students of co-operative departments in the various schools.<br/><br/>1.5     DEFINITION OF TERMS:<br/>For clarity of purpose, limitation of confusion and any kind and the proper understanding of this study, the following definition of terms is necessary:<br/>Credit:  David W. Pearly defined credit as financing directly<br/>or indirectly, the expenditure of other against future repayment.  Such lending or financing is direct when say, a bank extend an overdraft facility to a customer who then uses it.  It is indirect when a trader or producer supplies goods on credit.  Traditional savings and credit groups are one of the most common variants of informal financial intermediaries in rural areas (Ijere 1991:23).<br/>Management:  administration or management is the art of<br/>attempting to achieve stated objectives by directing human activities in the production of goods and services.  Management utilizes the land, factory, officers, machinery and other facilities at the disposal of the enterprises in the most effective, efficient and profitable manner.  Bob Igwe (1993:39).<br/>TECHNIQUE:  Method of performing something.<br/>ENTERPRISE:  Enterprise is an economic system in which individuals are free, singly, collectively.   To own capital and undertake economic activity within a frame work of social legislation designed to protect the interest of the members (Hamson 1974:218).<br/>\n\nCREDIT MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES IN AGRICULTURAL CO-OPERATIVE BANK IN

Problems of inadequate qualified personnel, diseases, lack of good road and transportation, high cost of feeds, lack of finance to start commercial poultry business, lack of good education such which leads to modern system of poultry production were identified as the major obstacles to the growth of marketing poultry products in the area. Consequently, intensification of extension service, provision of subsidies for good breeds of birds establishment of a ventinary clinic provision of transportation etc. are strongly recommended to save the poultry markets from imminent collapse in the area of study.<br/><br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>Title page      <br/>Abstract<br/>Table of content    <br/>Chapter One<br/>Introduction<br/>Background of the study<br/>Statement of problem<br/>Purpose of the study<br/>Research question<br/>The significance of study<br/>Scope of study<br/>Objective of the study<br/>Limitation of the study<br/>Definition of terms<br/><div><br/></div><div>Chapter Two</div>Literature review<br/>Storage and transportation<br/>Illiteracy<br/>Characteristics of the product<br/>Disease outbreak<br/>Shortage in feeding ingredients<br/>Unorganized farm of marketing<br/>Storage of feed<br/>Problem of finance<br/>Inadequate research on marketing<br/>Perishability of most poultry products<br/><br/>Chapter Three    <br/>Methodology<br/>Population of study  <br/>Sample procedure/techniques<br/>Research instrument<br/>Validation of research instrument<br/>Method of data collection<br/>Method of data analysis<br/><div><br/></div><div>Chapter Four      </div>Data analysis<br/><div><br/></div><div>Chapter Five       </div>Summary, conclusion and recommendation<br/>Principal findings<br/>Summary<br/>Recommendations<br/>References  <br/>Questionnaires   <br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>Poultry refers to all domesticated birds kept for meat and eggs production. Eggs and poultry meat are produced primarily for food consumption. Eggs are also used in various food industries like the manufacturing of confectionary (i.e. sweet chocolate cakes etc.). They are also used for the manufacturing of cosmetics of infection diseases while the feathers may be used for making pillows and mattresses. Some species of poultry are suitable for genetic nutritional and physiological studies because of their relatively low cost of maintenance, proliferation (a rapid growth or increase in numbers) and short generation intervals. In the earlier time, the keeping of poultry were not being considered as a major occupation; that is birds were kept to obtain some money and in most cases for pleasure and pastime cock figliting. In some areas or communities, fowls are still used in the past as a means of knowing what times of day, most especially the cock (i.e. male fowl). Poultry farming started those days when our local farmers used the old and extensive method in keeping fowls, goats, sheep, pig and other related domestic animals proved that the poultry section was a profitable venture too. Gradually, poultry keeping developed into a commercial enterprise involving thousands of birds, large poultry units, replace small ones while more efficient strains of birds, balanced feeds, intensive housing and better poultry equipment come into use. All these industrialized system of keeping poultry birds in a recent development in Edo state as in most humid tropical countries. The effect of some environmental factors like the industries are less capitalized, consists of smaller units and depend more on manual labour. These lead to less production of the birds or the birds perform at a lower level. Due to this account, the cost of poultry production is higher. All these factors contribute to the lower consumption of poultry production in the tropical areas like Edo state. For example, the recent estimate of eggs consumption in Nigeria was far low when compared with the European countries and the United States. Moreover, the industries in the tropical areas are not as diversified as in the temperate. In the tropics, the emphasis is on egg production and only one species of poultry (the domestic fowl) is used. Whereas economic and nutritional benefits can be derived from keeping other species, for example some strains of ducks are fast growing, resistance to many diseases of the domestic fowl and can produce as many as 300 eggs per annum. These can be used to increase the consumption of poultry products in the tropics. However, throughout the world, the domestic birds are unique for its popularity in producing both poultry meat and eggs while the other species are kept primarily for meat. In order for poultry birds to produce efficiently, there is need to raise them under a conducive environment. We have various ways of rearing birds like the industrialized system of rearing birds.<br/><br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>Poultry, which is of economic importance to the entire members of the society because it provides meat and eggs for consumption. The bones are being used as bone meals to farm animals. It is therefore important that these products get to the final consumer at the place and time they are needed. This is only possible when the marketing system is efficient. This study is therefore concerned with the appraisal of the problems of marketing poultry products in Oredo Local Government Area.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is designed to achieve the following objectives:<br/><br/>1.  To identify the type of poultry products sold in Oredo Local Government area.<br/>2. To identify the problems affecting the marketing of poultry products.<br/>3. To find out how best the problems of marketing poultry products can be solved.<br/>4. To make recommendations based on finding of the study.<br/><br/>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>The need for appraisal of this type is to know the problems facing the marketing of poultry products in Oredo Local Government area in Edo state. it is assumed that at the end farmers and the consumers within the territory in which the appraisal was carried out will benefit from the findings of the study. During the appraisal, some farmers were questioned and they responded actively and also ask various question s, which help them to rear their livestock very well. Therefore, this study will help the farmer within Oredo local government area to known the various system of rearing birds in other to keep them away from infection diseases. It will also help them to known the best the best marketing channel to sell their products. Also this study will help the consumers in that same area to known the most hygienic place to purchase their meat and other domestic products.<br/><br/>HYPOTHESIS/RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>To assist in carrying out appraisal into the problems of marketing poultry products in Oredo Local Government area, some research questions will be useful and these include:<br/>i)            How does extension system of rearing poultry affects its product?<br/>ii)          What is the importance of transportation in the marketing of poultry products?<br/>iii)        Which part of poultry products do you sell most daily?<br/>iv)        Why are poultry products difficult in market?<br/>v)          What way so you think will help in the marketing of poultry products?<br/><br/>SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>Poultry products in Oredo local government area will be carefully examined. This study will pay particular attention to factors affecting the marketing of poultry products in Oredo. It will also appraise some selected types of poultry products and causes of their low marketing and make recommendation that will enhance more distribution in Oredo Local Government Area.<br/>\n\nINVESTIGATION INTO THE PROBLEM FACING THE MARKETING OF POULTRY EGG PRODUCTION <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INVESTIGATION INTO THE PROBLEM FACING THE MARKETING OF POULTRY EGG PRODUCTION ", "id": 205}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div align=\"center\">IMPROVING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION THROUGH CO-OPERATIVE <br/></div><div align=\"center\">(A CASE STUDY OF NDOKWA WEST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF DELTA STATE)<br/></div><div align=\"center\"><br/></div><div align=\"center\">ABSTRACT<br/></div>The research work on the topic “improving Agricultural production through co-operative (A case study of  Ndokwa West L.

STUDY<br/>Every student requires a particular institutional framework.  One of such framework of the student is the co-operative.  The word co-operative can have different interpretation.  In a layman’s language, it means working together on working mutually.  The second interpretation , which is where the emphasis means a special type of co-operative.  The co-operative has been defined by different schools of thought but the various in the degree of emphasis on one aspect or the other.<br/><br/>The school of thought describes co-operative as business undertaking owned and operated by voluntary associations in order to provide themselves with work and wages or with goods and services.<br/><br/>But the International Co-operative Alliance (I C A) defined co-operative as an autonomous association of persons, limited voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprises.  The role of co-operative in agricultural is an important topic of study but already much has been done by co-operators to justify its prime role of score securing economic and political development particularly in developed countries like England known for consumer co-operatives.  France known for industrial co-operative and Germany known for credit co-operative.  Co-operative movement is world wide phenomenon.  It has developed from simple traditional form(s) of mutual institution  of modern formally organized institution.  This institution gained world wide acceptance because of the grate role.  It has been playing in the economic development of various countries particularly in the developing countries.  The improvement of agricultural production through co-operative inevitable has social effects.  Co-operative management bring better yield which in turn yields better living standard, better housing, better  education for members and their families.  This economic success of co-operative society has been witnessed invaluably in co-operative studies.<br/><br/>In Delta State, most inhabitants survive through and the main occupation is substantial farming, which attracted interest many co-operative societies, both existing ones and new initiated ones.  Improving the agricultural production was their main target and interest and at the same time lifting the level of its individuals.  Improvement target was both in size and qualities were poor and could not be marketed most of the crops having pest scales and most couldn’t grow well in other to produce as expected.  The product that were severely affected were yam tubers, cassava stems and tubers, cocoa yams, vegetables.<br/><br/>1.2   STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Nigeria had embarked on various programmes and  policies  costing hundreds of millions of naira aimed at reviving the depressed agricultural sector.<br/><br/>In view of this, agricultural co-operative was instituted so as to organize the small scale farmers who are still involved in manual labour type of farming in co-operative and had failed to produce enough food for our teeming population thereby the country to be involved in importation of large quantity of food with a huge percentage decline in agricultural exports.<br/><br/>All those governmental effort have not actually had much significant improvement in this sector as much emphasis now being placed on agriculture.  The call for urgent re-examination of the role of these agricultural production sure it’s aim of facilitating the attainment of self-sufficiency in agriculture and making agriculture to take its prime position in the national economy of this country in danger.<br/><br/>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The general purpose of this project report is undertaken as a study of the existing farmers co-operative societies and their effects in improving the development of agriculture specify.<br/>Finally, the study has the following objective:<br/>(a)   To examine the organizational set and the operations of co-operative movement in Delta State with particular reference to Ndokwa west local government are co-operative societies, Delta.<br/>(b)  To examine the impact of the farmer co-operative and societies.<br/>(c)   To investigate the problems facing the farmers co-operative.<br/>(d)  To suggest pragmatic ways and means for enhancing the effectiveness of these societies main attempt to be as food production and assist in further research into contemporary issue on the matter.<br/><br/>1.4   IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>Agriculture is so importance in order to sustain any economy.  Moreover, co-operative using the agricultural sector, thus any effort geared towards carrying out research aimed at improving the agricultural production should be considered work while any suggestion on  the improvement of agricultural co-operatives should have bearing on the sector.  This is therefore the most appropriate time to study the agricultural sector concerning the prevailing economic condition of Delta state.<br/><br/>Presently, our farmers are not adequately remunerated despite the fact they bend over double trying to make the state sufficient and self-reliant in food production.  They cannot compete with their counterparts in Nigeria not to talk of the part of the world.<br/><br/>If they are organized in co-operative, increased productivity enhanced the profit maximized to them and then farming will once more look attractive.<br/><br/>Based on the findings of this study and suggestions proffered it is strongly believed that the policy makers government would encourage our peasant farmers to voluntarily join the co-operative societies.  Moreover, healthy progrant and policies on co-operative and development would be mounted in addition, it would enable the manager of co-operative and organization to adequately organize the co-operative farmer for increased food production.  Furthermore, colleges of co-operatives, schools and researcher who wish to carry  out research in this field have been provided a springboard from where they can take off.<br/><br/>1.5   RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.     Does co-operative helps to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of agricultural production?<br/>2.     Does agricultural product helps to improve peoples standard of living?<br/>3.     To what extent has agriculture contributed tremendously to the overall development of economic of Nigeria?<br/>4.     How can you as a member of co-operative help to remedy some of the problems facing the development of co-operative society?<br/>5.     Does government show much concern to appreciate the work of co-operative in increasing productivity?<br/><br/>1.6   DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Most of their term (words or phrase that are used in this projects report may be unfamiliar or may have peculiar meaning and connotation.)<br/>These terms includes:-<br/>1.  Agricultural Productivity:  The index of the ratio of the value of the total form output to the value of the total input used in farm production.<br/>2.  Farm Management: The application of farming science and technology as the solution of the day to day problems facing the farms.<br/>3. Bye –Laws:  We  mean the registered bye-laws made by a co-operative society which governs the activities of such society and which is made by a society in the exercise of any power conferred by the co-operative laws.<br/>4. Small-scale Individual farmers:  This implies that a farmer whose total cultivable farm land is not more than hectares and whose farm labour requirement are largely supplied by his family, his sells are good in a localized market.  He requires low initial capital investment farms on small holdings with simple technology and at least 60% of his annual income from agriculture.<br/>5. Enofed:  This means Ndokwa west local government area co-operative federal limited.  It is the highest co-operative body in this state that gives supervisory to other co-operative bodies in the state.<br/>6. Co-operative Society:   It is a form of organization whereby people voluntarily associate together as human beings on the basis of equality for the promotion of the economic interests of themselves.<br/>7. Auxiliary Co-operatives:  This type provides individual service to members.  The co-operatives main function are to provide credit supply and market and storage the co-operative has no hand in the supervision and management affairs of member farm.<br/>8. Productive Type:  Here there is a full integration.  The co-operation absorbs all the member business enterprise that is members’ economic responsibilities are borne be the co-operatives is found in Delta, Ndokwa West Local Government Area.<br/>9. Production Promotion Co-operative:  This is co-operative by integration, the farmer depends on society for his production activities.  This is a strong link between the co-operative and members in areas of management marketing credit and decision making.<br/>\n\n IMPROVING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION THROUGH CO-OPERATIVE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  IMPROVING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION THROUGH CO-OPERATIVE", "id": 206}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div align=\"center\">THE IMPACT OF COOPERATIVE FARMING SOCIETIES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE IN EDO STATE</div><div align=\"center\">A CASE STUDY OF OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA<br/></div><div align=\"center\"><br/></div><div align=\"center\">ABSTRACT<br/></div>The study focuses on the impact of cooperative societies on agricultural production in the rural setting of Edo state. Results obtained from the interview shows that credit disburse to the farmers constitute serious administrative problem which is hindering the effectiveness of the scheme. The loans applied for and the amount approved and disbursed to the farmers are not enough to move, so there are no through supervision on the part of the official of the co-operative and the ministry of agriculture. Recommendation we made on how to solve these problems in the existing farmer’s co-operative societies.  It was revealed that most of the respondents (80%) have made use of loan from one co-operative society or the other and also the access to loan and farming equipments has not been encouraging. To this effects some of the recommendation made was;<br/>I.           There should be a roaster or writing policy on the acquisition of loan and farming equipment so as the foster the accessibility to loan by the members.<br/>II.         There should be no bias in giving out of loans to members.<br/><br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>Title page<br/>Abstract <br/>Table of Contents<br/>CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 Background of Study<br/>1.2 Statement of the Problem<br/>1.3 Objective of the Study<br/>1.4 Significance of the Study<br/>1.5 Scope of the Study<br/>1.6 limitation of the Study<br/>1.7 Definition of terms <br/><br/>CHAPTER TWO    <br/>Literature Review<br/><div><br/></div><div>CHAPTER THREE       </div>Methodology<br/>Design of the study<br/>Population Sampling<br/>Sampling Techniques<br/>Method of Data Collection    <br/>Method of Data Analysis<br/><br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>Presentation and Analysis of Data<br/>Data Presentation<br/>Data analysis<br/><div><br/></div><div>CHAPTER FIVE    </div>Summary<br/>Conclusion<br/>Recommendation<br/>REFERENCE    <br/>QUESTIONNAIRES     <br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>       In developing countries as in the case of Nigeria, Agriculture dominates the nation’s economy. It has been established that about to percent of Nigeria population is engaged in agriculture (Obasi and Aug, 2000) while 90 percent of Nigeria total food production comes from small farms and to percent of the country population earn their living from these small farms (Oluwatayo et al, 2008). The recent importation of food items into the country to make up for the short falls in food supply Is a dangerous indication of warning farm productivity and warning sign that if the nation continue with the business as usual, the prospect of food security will be black for millions of people (Nwede 2003)<br/>       It terms employment agriculture is by far the most importance sector of Nigeria’s economy engaging about 70% of the labour force. Agricultural holding are generally small and scattered, family is often of the subsistence variety characterized by simple tools and shifting cultivation. These small farms produce about 80% of the total foods. About 30.7 million hectares (76 million acres) or 33% of Nigeria land area are under cultivation. Nigeria’s diverse climate from the tropical area of the coast the arid zone of the North, make it possible to produce virtually all agricultural products that can grown in the tropical and semitropical area of the world the economic benefit of large scale agriculture are recognized, and the government favors the formation of cooperative societies and settlements to encourage industrial agricultural. Large scale agriculture, however, is not common.<br/>       Despite an abundant water supply a favorable climate and wide area or arable land, productivity is restricted owing to low soil fertility in many areas and inefficient method of cultivation agriculture. Contributed 32% to GPD in 2001<br/>It’s widely recognized that co-operative form an indispensable component. Through community organization co-operative serves the basis and plant form for bring together the economically weak member of the society with a view of enhancing their individual capacities (Akali, 1991). The contributions of cooperative to the economy especially in the developing countries are enormous, ranging from provision of credit to its members and sourcing of inputs at reasonable price to scale of member produce (Okonkwuo, 1991). Cooperative are defined as “an autonomous association of persons who unite voluntarily to meet their common economic and social needs and aspiration through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. (ICA, 1995) cooperative are established by like-minded persons to pursue mutually beneficial economic interest. Researcher are of the opinion that under normal circumstance, cooperative play significant role in the provision of service that enhance agricultural development.<br/>Patrick, (1995) described cooperative as a medium, through which services like provision of farm input, farm implements, farm mechanization agricultural. Loans agricultural extension member education, marketing of member farm produce and other economic activities and services rendered to members regular and optimal performance of these roles will accelerate the transformation of agriculture and rural economic development. Ijere (1981) further explained that. It is the cooperative that embraces all types of farmers and a well organized and supportive cooperative is a pillar of strength for agriculture in Nigeria. <br/>Ogunbameru (1986) also estimated that 52% of Nigerians population is women and that 70% of such women live in rural area. It is also on record (Adebayo and Amao, 2003) that 53% of the poor in Nigeria are women. In the rural areas a large number of women are illiterate, very poor, have high rate of infection and are economically oppressed (Essien, 2000) observed that only small fraction of woman in Nigeria had the benefit of higher education and that the majority is engaged in petty trading and peasantry farming. Despite the low educational and poor economic background of Nigeria women they are still responsible for more than half of the nations food basket and contribute more than two third of the working hours on the farm (Barret et al, 2001). They also reported that AFRICAN Women are responsible for 66% of micro processing activities, especially the processing of agricultural produce.<br/>In Nigeria, agricultural production is dominated by small-scale farmers most whom live in rural areas. Crops and animals are produced on scattered farm holding. Most of the farmers operate without modern production input. Their marketing system is unorganized with each farmer acting individually to produce farm inputs and to sell farm produce. Cooperative societies enable people to achieve through joint efforts what they are unable to achieve while working as individuals. They are legally established organization on the basis of specific set of principles cooperatives activities is one of the best method by which peasant farmer can take part in their own economic advancement and gain valuable experience of democratic produce and business management. Akinwumi (1978). They are association of persons who have voluntarily come together to achieve common objective through the formation of a democratically controlled organization, making equitable contributions to the capital required and accepting fair share of the risk and benefit of the undertaking (World Bank, 1999, Ebonyi and Jimo, 2002).<br/><br/>1.2      STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS <br/>       Cooperative has been regarded as one of the main institutional machineries for empowering the economically weak member of the society. With this official recognition and the determination of government (at all levels) to transform agricultural production and raise the standard of living in the rural areas many agricultural cooperative societies have been formed all over the country. Despite the efforts or contribution made by the cooperative societies towards agricultural development in Nigeria, this effort has not been evenly known and it was in an attempt to address such problem that this study was designed.<br/><br/>1.3  OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>1.    Determine farmer’s extent of participation in cooperative societies.<br/>2.    Determine the benefits derived by respondents by being member of various cooperative societies.<br/>3.    Determine major problems militating against the participation of farmer in cooperative activities.<br/>4.    Make policy recommendation based on the funding<br/><div><br/></div><div>1.4  STATEMENT OF RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</div>       Based on the nature of the problems aforementioned, hypothesis testing as a measure will assist immensely in carrying out the research to a logical conclusion because of the statistical testability of the problems formulated.<br/>Hypothesis is an assumption or statement which may or may not be true concerning the population. Walpole (1974). Hence, the hypothesis of this research is considered as tentative statement, which would be considered positive or negative at the end of the research presentation.<br/>i.     f0:   Agricultural organization operate in ignorant of the existence of cooperative socie5ties.<br/>ii.    f0: The objectives, Programme, and agricultural strategies of cooperative societies are not recognized and accepted by agricultural organizations.  <br/>       F1: the objectives, programme and agricultural strategies of cooperative societies are recognized and accepted by agricultural organizations.  <br/>iii.    f0: Cooperative societies have not contributed positively to agricultural activities.<br/>       f1: Cooperative societies have contributed positively to agricultural activities.<br/><br/>1.5  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>       This study is embarking upon to determine the impact of cooperative societies on agricultural production in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State knowing the contribution of the impact of cooperative societies will encourage farmers and enlightened on the important of this society. This study will also revealed the solutions to the problem militating against the participation of farm in cooperative activities in the study area.<br/><br/>1.6  SCOPE OF THE STUDY    <br/>The studies will emphasis the importance of cooperative societies in financing farmers in rural setting of Edo State.<br/><br/>1.8     DEFINITION OF TERMS  <br/>Agriculture:  This is the process of producing food, feed, and fiber by cultivation of certain plant and the raising of domesticated animal. It is a general term per productive activities like growing as crops raising of animal (including poultry) fishing and forestry<br/>Cooperative: This can be defined as an autonomous association of person who write voluntarily to meet their common economic and social needs and aspiration through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise.<br/>Society: People in general living together in communities or a particular community of people who shared the same customs, laws etc.<br/>Community: This is the people who live in a particular country etc when talked about a group or a group of people who share the same religion.<br/>Development: This is complete term that in many different ideas. But most simply development, when taking about countries means reaching an acceptable standard of living for all the people developed countries are not necessarily rich countries and all rich countries are not necessarily developed.<br/>Economic: This is the realized social system of production, exchange, distribution and consumption of goods and services of a country or the areas.<br/>Organization: This is a group of people who is form a business, club etc or together in order to achieve a particular aim or the act of making arrangement or preparations for something.<br/>Gross Domestic Product (GDP): This is a measure of all of the services and goods produced in a country over a specific period, classically a year.<br/>GDP: Consumption gross investment + government + export – import or GDP = C+I+G+(X=-M).<br/>Peasant: This is an agricultural workers with roots in the country side in which they dwell, either working for other or more specifically owing or renting and working by his or her own labour a small plot of ground.<br/>Arable: This is a land suitable for growing crops.<br/>\n\nIMPACT OF COOPERATIVE FARMING SOCIETIES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF COOPERATIVE FARMING SOCIETIES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE", "id": 207}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div align=\"center\">IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION AGENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE<br/></div><div align=\"center\"><br/></div><div align=\"center\">ABSTRACT<br/></div>This project work is brought up to investigate the impact played by agricultural extension agent in the development of agriculture in the nation using Egor Local Government Area  of Edo State as a case study. Four research questions were raise to capture the impacts played by agricultural extension agents and questionnaires is used to elicit information from the respondents which are farmers in the study area. the questionnaire is divided into two part, part  A and B. the part A was set up to ask questions on the personal information of the respondents while section B was to ask questions that will answer the research questions asked in chapter one of this project. Multistage random sampling is used to select the respondents. Hundred (100) respondents are randomly selected and used for the study. The questionnaire was given to the project supervisor to proof read before administering it. The questionnaire was collated and simple percentage method was used to analyze the collated questionnaires and the results were presented in chapter four of the project. The recommendation made are, the agricultural extension agents to farmers ratio should be work upon. There should be considerable number of assigned farmer to agricultural extension agents so as to foster, learning or there should be more employment of specialist to carryout agricultural extension service, more time should be allocated to training or teaching of farmers as some of the farmers are late adopters, time of visitation should be more frequent so as to instigate encouragement from the agricultural extension agents to the farmers. If this is worked upon, it will be very hard for the farmer to forget what they have been taught.      <br/><br/> TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>Title       <br/>Table of contents   <br/>Abstract<br/>CHAPTER ONE     <br/>Introduction<br/>Background to the Study<br/>Statement of problem<br/>Objective of the study<br/>Significant of the study<br/>Scope of the study<br/>Basic assumption<br/>CHAPTER TWO    <br/>Literature Review<br/>CHAPTER THREE <br/>Research methodology<br/>Design of study<br/>Area of study<br/>Population of the study<br/>Sample and samplings techniques<br/>Research instrument<br/>Administration of research instrument<br/>Method of data Analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR   <br/>Data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FIVE    <br/>Summary<br/>Implication of findings<br/>Recommendations<br/>REFERENCES       <br/>QUESTIONNAIRES     <br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/><br/>Agricultural extension has often been conceptualized as an education process, which promotes learning it uses the combined findings of biological sciences and the principles of social science to bring about changes in knowledge, skill attitude and practices in and out of school setting (Ileubaoje 2004). Eremie (2005) postulated that an agricultural extension services has a lot play in ensuring that Nigeria achieves the million development goals.<br/><br/>It was these perceived important roles of agricultural extension that informed the establishment of the agricultural development programme (ADPs). With the re-organization and strengthening of the extension agent of the ADPS, along training and visits line in 2006, a number of activities were initiated so as to ensure that the seven features of the trainings and visits are implemented. These have led to a change in the roles performed by the extension workers thereby resulting in some level of satisfaction among both extension workers and their clients (Ajuwon 2006). It is also worth noting that despite the tremendous achievements of the agricultural sector in Nigeria, the ADPs have been besotted by a myriad of problems, especially with the terminal end of the counterpart funding by the World Bank. These problems range from the Nona rail ability of facilities necessary for effective implementation and functioning of extension workers to poorly motivated staff resulting in low morale, low level of role perception and poor performance of extension workers (Banmeke and Ajayi 2005) Chikwendu et al, (2007) noted that in recent years, there have been indications of ineffectiveness in the extension agent of the ADPs.<br/><br/>The goal of every manager is to increase production and efficiency to obtain maximum result for the organization motivation for better performance depends on job satisfaction, achievement, recognition and professional growth (Adeniyi, 2001). The rural area is the predominant food and fibre producing sector of the Nigeria society and all natural resources which constitute the wealth of a nation are obtained of the rural areas. The importance of the rural in Nigeria also his in the mere fact that over 70% of the people live and derive their livelihood from there. The state of the rural areas in Nigeria’s is determined by a combination of methods which include available social, physical and institutional infrastructures as well as the people’s level of living including their levels of perceived deprivation and satisfaction with current level of living.<br/><br/>The rural areas in Nigeria is characterized by lack of public infrastructure, sub-standard education, poor health services and low agricultural productivity leading to poor standard of living for the majority. The agricultural extension agent in recent years has however played a significant role in improving agricultural production in Nigeria through advisory agent and adequate access to information on improved techniques of production agricultural extension plays a pivotal role in ensuring the awareness and subsequent adoption of the contemporary methods of agricultural management various extension teaching methods have been employed to make sure that the technologies get to the end users prominent among there is the training and visit system of the agricultural development programme. The central principle or idea of the extension strategy is to produce competent and well- informed extension agents who will frequently and regularly visit farmers with relevant technical messages and bring farmers problems to research. The system of extension entails that each extension agent is required to regularly visit the farmers/farmer’s group with relevant messages that are specific to the farm practices taking place in the field at that point in time.<br/><br/>Feed back is also taken by the extension agents from farmers to the research station. The extension agent operates from the back drop belief that increased agricultural productivity depends primarily upon acceptance of improved cultural and technological change at the rural farm level and that peasant farmers can achieve improved production only if they adopt recommended to agricultural practices in place of traditional over. Successful adoption of improved agricultural practices is predicated upon rural farmer’s acquiring the required knowledge and understanding of these technologies. This will improve productivity and rais4e the living standards of the farmers who are the beneficences of the agent (Lawal, Bodo Toriminobia Makanjuola (2006) the efficiency of technologies generated and disseminated however, depends on effective adoption of the technologies by the end-users.<br/><br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>     The failure of the various extension delivery approaches in developing counties to effectively engineer significant and sustainable agricultural growth has become a major concern to all stakeholders, including the donor community.<br/><br/>The concerns have been fueled lately by the wave of pluralism, market liberalization and globalization sweeping across the world and giving rise to initiatives that will enhance efficiency and effectiveness of not only the sub-components of extension delivery but the entire system of technology generation, dissemination and use. With a rapidly expending population, environmental degradation, political instability, economies failure and the declining budget, re-thinking the way agricultural technology is delivered to farmers has become necessary. This re-thinking engineered the way we have to investigate the impact of agricultural extension agent in the development of agricultural in Egor local government of Edo-state.<br/><div><br/></div><div>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</div>This study is set up to investigate the impact played by agricultural extension in the development of agriculture in the nation using Egor Local Government Area of Edo State as a case study.<br/><br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>Knowing the impact played by agriculture it will go a long way to encourage both the individual, government and NGO’s to see reason why they have to give more attention to agricultural extension in the country.  Also, in an attempt to evaluate the impact of agricultural extension, problems faced by agricultural extension will be look into and possible solution will be suggested which if duly followed will heap in educating and alerting existing agricultural extension agents as a result new agents on what to expect as an extension agent.<br/><br/>RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>1.  What is people’s Understanding about agricultural extension?<br/>2.  Have you been visited by extension agent?<br/>3.  What impact does this visit plays in your agricultural life style?<br/>4.  What are the problems militating the best usage of agricultural extension?<br/><div><br/></div><div>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</div>This study will look into the impact of agricultural extension on the development of agricultural in the country and the case is Egor Local Government Area of Edo-state.

Much of the early interested in co-operative structure seemed from deep regards to the social consequence of industrial capitalism, critics of the new order not simply a framework for business organisation but also as a vehicle for the reutilization of radical social and political goals. However, much concepts of c-operative have been erased the claims of earlier social prophets, a residual belief remains that co-operators are motivated by group interest as well as self interest, and that non-economic as well as economic objectives may be pursued.  Other of these propositions present difficulties through not inseparable one’s in terms of applying economic analysis to the study of applying economic analysis to the study of Co-operatives, it is pertinently imperative and a restrictive device of immense capacity that co-operative organisations have paid the way for the new economic and social order not only for those, ‘depressed’ in the economy who (mostly of less privileged) are at the receiving end, the logical and social justice, which they embody, but in our ability to translate them concretely and realistically from social theory into social fact and to make them effective in our daily live. We must always remember that co-operative are organizations of by and for members therefore they are designed to respond to the needs of members. Agricultural Co-operative has created for the economic charge, for increasing in food produce, for building a better or a more just and equitable society.  They serve to give individuals through voluntary co-operation and mutual assistance, control or bit of their destiny to make people in some way asters of their own fate, subjects and not objects of their history.  Co-operatives are of course pragmatic institution noted in reality of concerts goals.<br/><div><br/></div><div>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/></div><div>Abstract<br/></div>Table of Contents                                                  <br/>CHAPTER   ONE<br/>1.0  Introduction<br/>1.1  Background of the Study<br/>1.2  Statement of the Problems  <br/>1.3  Objectives of the Study                             <br/>1.4  Research Questions<br/>1.5  Significance of the Study                                        <br/>1.6  Scope of Study                                                     <br/>1.7  Definition of Terms                                         <br/><div><br/></div><div>CHAPTER   TWO</div>2.1  Brief History of Peace Broiler/Hatchery and Agricultural Engineers (Enugu) FMCS       <br/>2.2  The role of Agricultural Co-operative Organization<br/>2.3  Farming Systems/Agricultural System                <br/>2.4  The Importance of Agricultural Co-operative       <br/>2.5  Problems of Agricultural Co-operative                <br/>2.6  Market of Produce                                           <br/><div><br/></div><div>CHAPTER   THREE</div>3.0  Research Design and Methodology                    <br/>3.1  Area of Study                                                 <br/>3.2  Population and Sample                                    <br/>3.3  Source of Data                                                      <br/>3.4  Instrument for Data Collection                                <br/>3.5  Data Collection Procedure                                <br/>3.6  Method of Data Analysis                                  <br/><div><br/></div><div>CHAPTER   FOUR</div>4.0  Presentation, Analysis and Interpretation of Data<br/>4.1  Presentations of Data                                      <br/><div><br/></div><div>CHAPTER   FIVE</div>5.0  Summary of Findings , Recommendation and Conclusion                                                   <br/>5.1  Summary of Findings                                      <br/>5.2  Recommendations                                          <br/>5.2  Conclusions                                                   <br/>Bibliography<br/>Questionnaire<br/>Appendix<br/><div><br/></div><div>CHAPTER   ONE</div>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1  BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/>Agriculture, from the beginning of time, the first concern of man has been food clothing and shelter in that order.  Agriculture being one of the oldest industries, its origin can be traced to the earliest human societies.  the existence of man fro  the prehistoric era up to the era ancient civilization depended on the ability of the individual to hunt and gather food for consumption.  Food was, however the basic source of life which provided him energy in his wondering and constant struggle for survival.  However, with the realization that food was basic need for survival, efforts were made by early man to cultivate crops.<br/><br/>In spite of the limitations which agriculture is facing, it still remained the most important sector of the world economy.  Agriculture is a basic industry that supports all industries and all aspects of needs can justify from its role and contributions to nation building.   Between 75 – 80% of working population in rural areas engage in agriculture production (farming).  Some are provide jobs in the industries e.g. textile industry, Breweries and shoe industry.<br/><br/>Agriculture aids in rural development, with the location of industries that utilize agricultural produce in an area other investors go to rural areas to set up factories trade and operate business centers people are employed and paid to earn their living. Agricultural provides industrial raw material, textile mills required cotton, and plastic industries use rubber/latex.<br/><br/>Agricultural involves operational clearing of the land and the breaking-up of surface soil, the sowing for seeds, the removal of the weeds from the farm, the harvesting and storage of crops which are disposed of by marketing and the breeding and rearing of animals.  All these Co-operatives can do in a number of different, which involve amounts of labour, time, expense and productivity.  Agricultural education is an area in agriculture that a concern with helping people to develop a desire to learn and teach agriculture.  This is a change of behaviour towards agricultural practices.<br/><br/>1.2  STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Agricultural co-operatives are greatly involved in food production so as to improve the social and economic life of the members and the country as a whole.<br/>In spite of these, agricultural co-operative are still experience low food production owning to some distributing factors, as it associated being studied.<br/>1.    High financial commitment in the formation of the agricultural co-operative of different size and types.<br/>2.    Members neglecting their obligations, participating in-group farm work in the farmland weeding, planting, harvesting and marketing of farm produce.<br/>3.    Procurement of farm inputs like high yielding seeds, stem and seeding, agro-chemical disinfectants and fertilizer.<br/>4.    Problems of marketing of produce and efficiently distribution and returns to inputs utilized.<br/><br/>1.3  OBJECTIVE OF STUDY<br/>In food production the study is aimed all examining the role of Agriculture Co-operative food production so as to benefit members and the society as a whole.  The purposes of this study are:<br/>i.     To identify the factor that can cause low food production in agriculture co-operative in (Enugu) North.<br/>ii.    To investigate whether problem identified are associated with the agriculture co-operative society.<br/>iii.    To investigate the farms of supports and incentives provided by the government to the agriculture co-operatives if there are any.<br/>iv.    To find out the ways and methods that can be used in solving the problems of low food productivity.<br/><br/>1.4  RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>To achieve the purpose or objectives of this study the following research questions were formulated.<br/>i.     What are the causes of the low food production among agriculture co-operative in Enugu North Local Government Area?<br/>ii.    To what extent are the problem identified applied or associated with the agriculture co-operative societies being studied?<br/>iii.    Do agricultural co-operative receive incentives from the government?<br/>iv.    What form does the incentives from government take?<br/>v.    What are the ways/methods that can afford possible solutions to the problems of low food production?<br/><div><br/></div><div>1.5  SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</div>The findings of this research work will enable the society to know what to do in order to improve or enhance the economic activities of the society.  This research work will equally help the Federal government whose set objective is to use co-operative in rural development and increasing the production capacity of the country.<br/>The producer of agricultural products will also benefit because their effective production will be assured through the effective and efficient management of the agricultural co-operatives in food production and there will be an increase in food supply and production in the country thereby leading to a fall in price of goods.  When this is achieved, the consumers and the general public will benefit.<br/><br/>When there is an efficient and effective management of agricultural produce in food production, the co-operative societies especially the rural based ones, it will help in development recommendations of this research work will also be of great benefit to other co-operative societies in the country as it well served as reference material from them.<br/><br/>1.7

However, the dilapidating state of Nigeria’s agricultural sector and its consequences on the socio-economic development of the nation’s economy had given rise to this research work. Thinking along this path, the need to look into the sector and address the issue of poor performance gave rise to the establishment of agricultural cooperative societies to increase agricultural cooperatives societies to increase agricultural output. This isbecause agricultural cooperative have a large number of labour force in the rural area, who have contributed in the production of food crops, raw materials for industries and as a means of foreign exchange.<br/>       In the 60s, Anambra state economy had mono-sectorial dependency on agriculture as the main source of earning and employment for the ever teeming population. In the 70s, there was s shift from agricultural produce to non-agricultural sector.     The state is still peasantised with a larger number of people involved in smalls-scale production and there had been no significant agrarian modernization and revolution. Subsistence agricultural is still been practiced which its output is not enough to feed the population, let alone provide raw materials for our agro based industries.<br/>       Exportation of the state’s cash crops which in the past has supported the economy has virtually reduced. This has been blamed on negligence and poor performance of the farmer’s agricultural cooperative societies. And at such there was urgent need to revitalize the sector, owing to its importance in improving agricultural output in the country.<br/><br/>1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>       The government had been making efforts to improve agriculture in Nigeria both at the state and federal levels. However, there still goods scarcity in the country. Population is more rapid than agricultural growth and this has seriously reduced the benefits of increased food production and the associated increase in income.<br/>       As a result of this, many people in the country still without food, irrespective of the strategic position of agriculture in the state economy and the huge allocate made out to importation of food items. Thus a need to come up with a solution through proper diagnosis of the problems confronting the sector. This resulted in the bringing together these peasant farmers under cooperative societies with a view of improving agricultural production, increase income earning and self-sufficient in good items.<br/>       Prior to the discovering of crude oil in Nigeria, there were cash crops like groundnut, cocoa and rubber, cultivated in large quantities which were exported to Europe and America in the pre 60s. The incursion of military government in Nigeria politics had equally contributed to the poor state of the sector and even with transition to democracy, the country is yet t regain her position in the agricultural market. The administration of president Olusegun Obasanjo has watered the ground to empower Nigerian farmers and agro-allied investors to harness the country’s rich resources in producing food and raw materials for industries and export by ensuring banks and other extension services like making available fertilizers, pesticides, planting technologies etc at subsidies rate.<br/>       Working in hand with the farmers is the Nigerian export promotion council which assists in finding buyers of cash crops produced. Land was equally provided at reasonable term for large scale farming. Government equally encouraged foreign agriculture investors which has yielded a remarkable result for instance the southern African countries have found Nigeria at home to start off operations to produce.     The agricultural initiative of the Obasanjo administration saw to the restriction of some food importation thereby encouraging our local farmers to compete in the international market.<br/><br/>1.2  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM             <br/>       Nigerian government had embarked on various programmes and policies involving hundreds of millions of naira, aimed at reviving the ailing agricultural sector. This gave rise to the organization of small scale farmers into agricultural cooperatives societies in order to meet the demand of the growing population. However, these efforts and the cooperative societies have failed in achieving this objective which has made the nation rely heavily on importation and deterioration of the agricultural sector and the industries. Thus, this research aims at examining the need to improve the activities of the cooperative societies with a view to increasing agricultural output to enhance the socio-economic development of the nation.<br/><br/>1.3  OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY     <br/>       The main purpose/objective of this project is to undertake a study of the existing farmers cooperative development of agriculture.<br/>       The study has the following specific objectives<br/>(a)       To examine the organizational set up and operations of the farmers’ cooperative movement in Anambra state with a particular reference to selected cooperative societies I the state.<br/>(b)      To examine the impact of farmers cooperative societies to agricultural output. <br/>(c)       To investigate the problems confronting farmers cooperative societies.<br/>(d)      To suggest pragmatic ways and means of enhancing the effectiveness of these societies.<br/><br/>1.4     RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>    i.        What is the organizational set up and operations of farmer’s cooperative movement in Anambra state? <br/>   ii.        What is the impact of farmer’s cooperative societies on agricultural output in Nigeria?<br/> iii.        What are the problems confronting agricultural cooperative societies in Nigeria? <br/> iv.        How can these problems facing agricultural cooperative societies be tackled in other to enhance the effectiveness of these cooperative societies in Nigeria?<br/><br/>1.5  RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS<br/>       For agricultural cooperative societies to attain high service and huge surplus, there must be an adequate assistance from the government, educated cooperators and committee members and adherence to cooperatives principles, law and rules in their activities.      The full success of agricultural cooperative societies will depend on the extend of assistance received from the government and the level of commitment the members show to the society and their activities as well. Hence, collectivity will go along way rather than individualism in the achievement of self sufficiency in food production.<br/><br/>1.6  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY   <br/>       Agriculture is so important in order to sustain any economy. This is because the benefits of agriculture especially to most developing nations cannot be over emphasized. However, the system of agriculture in Nigeria society is more of subsistence than commercial. This role of organizing individual farmer’s into a larger umbrella to increase their output, if they must attain economic and social goals and freedom the nation’s economy. Equally, through this research study, the government will be better informed of the challenges confronting the agricultural cooperative societies in a bid to proper solution that would enhance efficiency.<br/>       Through this research work, farmers cooperative societies would be educated as well as enlightened on the benefits they stand to gain from their activities in terms of profits maximization, increased income and the assistance the government is willing to offer them such as extending credit facilities to them, education on farming techniques, provision of farm items, such as fertilizers, at a cheaper price than they would have obtained outside of the societies.<br/>       Finally it would also be of benefit to students who wish to go into agricultural business in the near future to take advantage of cooperative societies in order to excel and compete in the international markets across the globe.<br/><br/>1.8  DEFINITION OF TERMS        <br/>       Most of the terms used in this research work are register of cooperative societies which may be unfamiliar to the readers. At such there was need to define them for clearly understanding of the study.<br/>Agricultural productivity:  This is the index of the ratio of the value of the total farm output to the value of total inputs used in production.<br/>Farm Management:    the application of farming with science and technology to the solution of the day to day problems facing farmers.<br/>Agriculture: can be broadly defined as the art and science of production of plants and animals that are of benefits to man.<br/>Cooperative Society:  this is a form of organization where people voluntarily associate together as human beings on the basis of equality for the promotion of their economic and social interests.<br/>Production Promotion Cooperative: This is cooperative by integration. The farmers depend on the society for their production activities. There is a strong link between the cooperative and its members in the area of management, credit and decision making.<br/>\n\nSOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF INCREASING AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT THROUGH THE ACTIVITIES OF COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF INCREASING AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT THROUGH THE ACTIVITIES OF COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES", "id": 210}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div align=\"center\">PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF DUCK FARMING<br/></div><div align=\"center\"><br/></div><div align=\"center\">ABSTRACT<br/></div>          This project work was carried out in Ovia North West Local Government Area of edo state to examine the problems of duck farming within the area. 5o questionnaires were distributed among farmers in the local government but there response where only analyzed using simple frequency and percentages.

They are easier and cheaper to keep than chickens. This makes duck keeping for the production of eggs and meat an attractive enterprise about 700 million ducks are kept around the world, the majority of these more than 500million are found in Asia. Despite this uneven distribution, it is certainly also possible to raise ducks in parts of the worlds, including Africa and Latin America. Ducks can be reared for eggs and meat, for own use or for sale. Other products from ducks which can also be sold include down feathers and fattened livers. There are many similarities between chicken and duck rearing. The most obvious similarities are found in the type of the products for which these forms of poultry we kept duck, like chicken are good producers of eggs and meat.<br/><br/>1.1             BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>Ducks however have several advantages over other poultry species, in particular their disease tolerance. They are hardly, excellent foragers and easy to hard, particularly in wetlands where they naturally tend to flock together.

It includes the cultivation of crops as well as rearing of animals for human uses. Today in Nigeria, about 70% of its population is engaged in this activity. Despite the large number of people engaged in this activity in the country and the whole world in general, the activity is not 100% successful. Norman (1981) grouped the development of agriculture in the world into four. Thus: physical, social, economical and political constraints. In the developed countries the physical and economic constraints are taken care of: now left with the problem of the land scarcity.<br/>       In the developing countries especially in the savannas (Sudan and Sahel) where there is series of aridity condition, the most dominant problem in every country or nation, at least must have one or two of these problems which militate against the development of agriculture in the region.    <br/><br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>       Despite the large number of people engaged in agricultural activity in the study area, yet agriculture is still at the primary level. The study is therefore set out to find out the solution to the following questions:<br/>1.          What are the factors militating against agricultural development in the study area?<br/>2.          To what extent does the factors militating against agricultural development affects agricultural development in the study area?<br/>3.          What are then possible solutions to the problem caused by these factors in the study area?<br/><br/>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>       The research will therefore attempt:<br/>1.          To find out the factors militating against the agricultural development in Oredo Local Government Area.<br/>2.          To find out the extent to which the problem affects the development of agriculture in the study area.<br/>3.          To offer suggestions for the solution to the problem.<br/>\n\n THE CONSTRAINTS OF AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  THE CONSTRAINTS OF AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT", "id": 212}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div align=\"center\">APPRAISAL OF OBTAINING AGRICULTURAL CREDITS/LOANS<br/></div><div align=\"center\"><br/></div><div align=\"center\">ABSTRACT<br/></div>The ever determining food production in Nigeria has prompted development or administration (military and civilian) both present and past to formulate programmed to ameliorate or arrest this situation.
