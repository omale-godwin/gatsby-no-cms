This is done using firewood and a frying pan using spoon to stir the corn. Due to the advancement in technology the used of pot with stirrer using gas cylinders as it sources of energy was introduce to lake care of the problem of the old method. But these methods have of the old method. But these methods have some constraints, which necessitate the introduction of the project (Electric popcorn machines) some of the problem are: The united nature of the system, the cost of buying a cylinder. The machine use electricity as it source and reduces the cost of popcorn production for commercial purpose.</p> <p>Nigeria being one of the countries in the continent of Africa is faced with some military factors. As a developing nation, There was been cases of bribery and corruption, drug abuse and trafficking, unlawful tempering of our pipe-line most especially in the Niger Delta prostitution, armed robbery and falsification of account. Because of this evident her inability to provide her youth with meaningful employment even after graduation. This social malady if not corb could lead to economic depression and stagnation. Based on this realization, we deem it necessary to embark on a project of this kind which would not only remedy our economy but would also give our youth a source of direction and above all make them to be self-reliant.</p> <p>The importance of this project cannot be over emphasize since our present economy does not call for our depending on foreign aid but on what we can produce either collectively as a nation or as an individual. Since government can no longer carter for the needs and wants of the longing populace. This project server as a foreign exchange earning for Nigeria thereby making pride we as an advance, Nation technology. Practically, the project could also serves as a means of enriching our knowledge and skills on how to make use of available resources in designing, fabricating, constructing and operating various machines and devices with efficiency of 65.98%,</p> <p>The benefit to be derived from this project are numerous, the most important is that it create employment opportunity for young graduate, i.e. self- employment.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0              SPECIFICATION OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>1.1       REQUIREMENTS OF THE DESIGN</p> <p>            The design is expected to achieve the following objective</p> <p>1)                  Production of popcorn in long scale.</p> <p>2)                  Increase the efficiency of producing popcorn</p> <p>3)                  Moderate the rotation of the stirrer by using the right motor.</p> <p>4)                  To reduce the heat that will be lost by lagging the output.</p> <p>5)                  To regulate the voltage used to produce popcorn.</p> <p>6)                  Achieve proper utilization of the heat by using a good conduction as the pot e.g. Aluminum.</p> <p>7)                  The use of wood as handle to effect easy conveying of the popcorn from the pot.</p> <p>8)                  The presence of bulb to enhance production at night.</p> <p>1.2              CONDITION FOR USE</p> <p>The machine might be used under elevated temperature.</p> <p>The machine should be stored after used in a clean and dry place.</p> <p>Routines cleans would be necessary to avoid rusting of the pot.</p> <p>The motor should service from time to time to maintain it efficiency.</p> <p>1.3              CHARACTERISTIC</p> <p>The machine should not be too heavy. The machine should not be too big to enhance effecting stirring. The distance between the pots should not be too large to reduce heat loss. Aluminum should be used for both the frame profile and the construction of the stirrer. Glass should be used to due the case because of the transparency.</p> <p>1.4       APPERANCE</p> <p>The product should have a glistening appearance, which can attract the prospective consumers of the popcorn.</p> <p>Reliability and Life  </p> <p>The expected useful life in normal circumstance should not be less than 10 years.</p> <p>Limitation</p> <p>(1)               There was no conveyor that should remove the popcorn from the hot pot.</p> <p>(2)               There was no time to indicate when the corn is fully popped.</p> <p>(3)               There was no thermostat to regulate the temperature of the system.</p> <p>(4)               There was noting like lagging to trap some of the heat.</p> <p>1.5       PRECAUTION</p> <p>Accident can be defined as an unexpected unplanned and unpredicted event, which could course loss of life, damage of properties and stoppage of work.</p> <p>Safety can also be defined as freedom from accident.</p> <p>The following precautions are put in place when operating the machine.</p> <p>1.                  Touching of hot pot during processing is no advisable.</p> <p>2.                  Line wire most not be touched with unprotected hands.</p> <p>3.                  Broken glasses and frame should be properly disposed.</p> <p>1.6       THEORY OF DESIGN AND ANALYSIS</p> <p>            The diameters of the machine are as follows:</p> <p>Length of Frame                                 510mm</p> <p>Base                                                    510mm</p> <p>Diameter of Bigger Pot           50mm</p> <p>Diameter of Smaller Pot         45mm</p> <p>Height of Frame                                  710mm</p> <p>Volume                                   L x B x H</p> <p>V                                             184671000</p> <p>HEAT TRANFER</p> <p>CONSTRUCTION</p> <p>This is the method of heat transfer by which heat energy moves from a region of higher concentration of heat to that to lower concentration while the material or body in question remain at fixed point. Most metals allow heat energy to pass through them and are said to be good conductors of heat. Non-metals such as woods, cotton paper and cork do not allow heat to pass through them.  This one called bad conductors or insulators. Though all metals are classified as good conditions, they differ in their ability to conduct heat. In order word, they need material medium for their propagation.</p> </div>\n\nAN ELECTRIC POP-CORN MACHINE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ELECTRIC POP-CORN MACHINE", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This project has been fabricated with special economical needs for the small scale baking industries, wholesalers and distributors who import this type of baking oven from outside the country to supply the customers.</p> <p>Who wish to use it or those that cannot after gas oven can be used in baking any type of available within the tropics.</p> <p>It I am also be used in are where there are no source of electricity or gas.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENT</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>Literature Review</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>Specification of Problem</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>Synthesis of Solutions/Material Solution</p> <p>Design and Analysis Theory</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p>Sequence of Operation</p> <p>Operation of Apparatus</p> <p>Maintenance</p> <p>CHAPTER SIX</p> <p>Testing and Evaluation</p> <p>Capacity/ Fuel Shortage Detection</p> <p>Efficiency Performance</p> <p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p> <p>Material Cost Analysis</p> <p>Machine Cost Analysis</p> <p>Labour Cost Analysis</p> <p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Recommendation</p> <p>Reference</p> <p>Appendix  </p> <p>   CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>The fabrication of this project kerosene oven is a borrowed idea, which was modified to improve the system.</p> <p>It is a manually operated type of oven which has the capability of supplying heat energy at high and low temperatures.

It is usually powered by electric motor which is connected to the machine and to the power supply source vise-vise.</p> <p>It is base on this type of Design that we embark on the design of a corn shelling machine.  However, this design is a modification of other existing design.   In other words we considered the feasibility of the design from every engineering details to economics and aesthetics.   The machine is therefore design to be quite reliable, durable and cheap to build and run.</p> <p>Towards this objective, an depth analysis of the existing similar machines was carried out and necessary modifications base on finding were made, such modifications include using pulleys and bolt, shape of tiny and the inclination of the discharge outlet and also spacing of the perforation and the teeth of the barrels portability, ergonometric heights and aesthetic impact.</p> <p>For the suitable selection of materials, calculations were made with their physical, chemical and mechanical properties or characteristics properly considered.</p> <p>The design (Corn Sheller) is capable of shelling ten (10) tons of maize per an hour.  It is operated with a one phase electric motor of 11/2 horse power at a speed of 145 rpm.  Its shaft rotates at a speed of 400rpm.</p> <p>The component features of the design are as follows.</p> <p>Barrel: This is subdivided into two, the outer and the inner Barrel. First, we treated the outer barrel and then the inner barrel.</p> <p>Outer Barrel,   This barrel rotates with shaft rote stands on itself inside the shelling chambers.  It is a half of a cylindrical shape perforated below to enable shelled corn to rush out to the conveyor or to the outlet or basin.  It is welded and tight at the endwise of the structure, they are flanges at the end for the location of the bearing for the shaft. At the lower end of one open segments serving as outlet for the cobs and a hood is built covering it</p> <p>DIAGRAM OF  OUTER BARREL</p> <p>INNER BARREL:  This is a Cylindercial barrel which rotates with the shaft supported by end to end to bearing.  The diameter of the shaft is 20mm and for the inner barrel diameter is 190mm having 20 numbers of spikes measuring 30mm from the barrel surface and also wounded vanes that does the operation. Diameter of inner barrel is 120mm and its length is 740 and consequently the diameter of the shaft is 20mm.   Below is the diagram of the inner barrel.</p> <p>DIAGRAM OF INNER BARREL.</p> <p>TRAY:  This is just similar to a pot but the different is that it is bigger and not covered and have a rectangular shape.   There is a provision of an entry through which the corn enters the shelling chamber and the inner engulfing the shaft. It is obtained after cutting a mild steel and welded with guage 12 Electrode and it has its dimension as 740mm x 100mm.</p> <p>The diagram of the tray is as shown below in the fig.</p> <p>DIAGRAM OF THE TRAY</p>              <p>RECEPTACLE:  This is the outer funnel that collects the shelled corn from the conveyor to the outside. It is welded to the below of the outer barrel</p> <p>SPIKES : This is the rod attached to the surface of the inner barrel which does the shelling action with the Ina barrel and the spring vanes.  It is up to 20 in number and measures 20mm vertically up from the inner barrel surface each.</p> <p>COB OUTLET:  This is an exit through which cobs goes out of the barrel after shelling process to the external environment.</p> <p>CONVEYOR:  This is a carrier that carries the cobs out of the barrel after selling process. It is run on the body of the inner barrel and is about 20mm in height but runs in a snake like movement from end to end of the inner barrel.</p> <p>Fig.</p> <p>DISCHARGED CHAMBER:</p> <p>            The are holes perforatedf below the outer barrel through the shelled grain falls out to the conveyor.</p> <p>COLLECTOR/OUTLET BASIN:</p> <p>            This is curved mild steel welded below the perforated outer barrel inclined to an angle to enable the falling out of the shelled corn to the receptacle.</p> <p>INLET:</p> <p>This is the particular place in the tray through which the corn enters the shelling unit chamber for shelling process.  It is about 180mm in length and 80mm in width.</p> <p>SPRING VANES:</p> <p>This is made up of flat tiny metals welded round the barrel together with the spikes.  It is the part of the machine where corn are shelled.  It is always capable of withstanding impact from the corn and posses good chemical resistance, high working temperature (100%) and tensile strength.  Dimensionally.  It is measured from the surface of the inner wounded horizontally.</p> <p>            Finally, after much analysis and synthesis, the design is of minimum cost, simple to operate easy to construct, durable and easy to maintain.</p> <p>We hop our work will certainly provoke great interest in the reader as it house a lot of useful information for furtherance of engineering education and productivity.</p> </div>\n\nDESIGN AND FABRICATION A CORN SHELLING MACHINE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND FABRICATION A CORN SHELLING MACHINE", "id": 3}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div> ABSTRACT</div> <p>In this project, three alternative design solutions were considered for the foldable cam – bed.

All the existing foldable camp bed, have almost the same dimension but differ in design. Some use rope and ailets while the modern design make use of wood and spring. Some other are constructed using straight bars, pipes of angle iron.</p> <p>1.10          LIMITATION OF ALREADY EXISTING FOLDABLE CAMP – BED</p> <p>Some foldable camp beds are made of Iron bars which are too heavy and cannot be carried with ease. Most existing foldable camp – bed are cumbersome to carry because their lengths which are normally six feet or 183 meters or 1830mm.</p> <p>Some of the materials used for fabrication of the foldable camp bed may not be locally got and this affects its prince, making its availability to become more rare.</p> <p>            In the market, design that make use of springs to hold the improvised materials or even wood are found. But when the spring fill off, its efficiency is reduced and this make it more profitable to make use of wood than spring to hold improvised mattress.</p> <p>DESIGN SPECIFICATION OF THE FOLDABLE CAMP BED</p> <p>It is high in weight</p> <p>It can be produced locally</p> <p>It is portable</p> <p>It has an in built head rest which is adjustable. The tarpaulin material used in folding the foam to the wood can be easily removed along with the wood for cleaning.</p> <p>It is could carry a person up to 75kg in weight. Pipes (square) used are made of galvanized steel and also the angle Iron used is made if galvanized steel both painted with aluminum oil paint to avoid corrosion.</p> <p>It is easy to manipulate.</p> <p>All these specification put together make this project a viable one that can compete favorably with any existing foldable camp bed and also eliminate the limitations posses by earlier

perspective.</p> <p>            The oxford advance learners dictionary definition of refurbishing is the widely and a generally accepted definition of refurbishing.</p> <p>            It defines refurbishing as the work embark or undertaken in order to clean and decorate a room, building or in order to make it more attractive and more useful.  This simply means a programme transformation of a particular place or thing at a point in time.</p> <p>            The drawing studio requires special consideration to preserve the original studio nature after it has deteriorated, and repair work at different period must be considered when the new defects are first discovered, when this is being considered recently, it can serve as a remedy towards breakage of tables and the deterioration of the studio.</p> <p>            These may be wrongly diagnosed, consequently, the remedies for refurbishing prescribed the drawing studio may fall and further experience and investigation leads to effective remedies or maintenance strategies.</p> <p>            Refurbishing is sub divided into three types and these are</p> <p>1.         Life style refurbishing:         This involves improving a home and a way of life.  It might involve building a sunroom for pleasure or converting unused attic space into living quarters to meet ones changing needs.</p> <p>2.         Retroit Projects Refurbishing:         This usually focuses on home shells or mechanical systems such as</p> <p>i.                    Upgrading an insulation system</p> <p>ii.                  Putting on new siding</p> <p>iii.                Replacing a furnace</p> <p>3.         Maintenance and Repair Refurbishing:     This project the investment found in a house, workshop, or a room through activities such as:</p> <p>i.                    Repair of furniture</p> <p>ii.                  Caulking windows</p> <p>iii.                Reshingling roofs</p> <p>iv.                Replacing equestronughs</p> <p>AIM OF THE PROJECT</p> <p>            The basic aim of this project is to identify the importance of refurbishing in our institutions of higher learning, and also to know the correct types to be used at any point in time.</p> <p>OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT</p> <p>            The objectives of the project are as follow</p> <p>1.                  To know the importance or refurbishing</p> <p>2.                  To improve the understanding rate of the users of the project, by making them feel comfortable whenever there are in the drawing studio.</p> <p>3.                  To help bring back to the departmental acceptance of the standard of the drawing studio.</p> SCOPE OF THE STUDY <p>            This project “Refurbishing of the Mechanical Engineering Drawing Studio.</p> <p>            This project is further limited to the Mechanical Engineering Drawing Studio, which might equally serve as a case study.  And because of this, we will

MECHANICAL ENGINEERING DRAWING STUDIO", "id": 5}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The design and fabrication of a reciprocating nail gasket is a new innovation in technology. The one in existence is manually operated. In which a punch that is adjacent to a die is mounted to the handle  which  is attached to the shaft. A helical spring that is incorporated to the shaft of the punch, helps the handle return to its initial position, which makes the machines tedious and stressful to operate. When the handle is pulled down from its initial position, the punch passes through the die that is placed  vertically adjacent to the punch thereby blanking out the felt materials. The number of the gasket produced is proportional to the strength of the operator. But in our design, we incorporated  a geared motor which does the cutting in a reciprocating form, while the operator  just drags the felt material to the die where it is cut. The efficiency  of the machine is well above 75%, it can produce 216 felts per minutes . sprockets and chains are used to transfer power  instead of belts in other to effect good phases relationship. The material used for the punch is stainless steel rod. The machine is statically and dynamically balanced to curb noise and vibration. One and half (11/2) inch angle iron was used in fabricating the skeletal frame.</p> <p>Appropriate materials were subsequently selected and fabricated to required size.

The environmental degration is, in turn contributing to health threat in this part of the globe.  Unfortunately most factories, workshops which suppose to posses these machines for dust extractions a re not having them thereby making dust a very dangerous threat to man.  Due to this ugly development it, is obvious that these factories and workshops can do little or nothing to protect our environment from this poor state.  It is therefore necessary that all and sundry should join the crusade of eradicating dust from our environment thereby making it clean.  Although before now people have tried to contribute their own quota in seeing to the end of the menace, get lack of interest, finance has posed a hindrance to the realization of this achievement. <p>In view of the above, we deemed it necessary that such a machine should be constructed to the Mechanical Engineering workshop to eradicate dust and thereby make the workshop environment clean and fit for students practical activities.</p> <p>  The realization of this work started from our supervisor who conceived the idea which we saw as a need, then we defined the need and synthesized it, evaluate and came to a conclusion.</p> <p>The synthesis led us to drawing board by sketching and drawing to scale after which the design required was chosen.  Fabricated and parts put together to form what we called a dust extractor.</p> TABLE OF CONTENTS  CHAPTER ONE <p>1.0       Introduction</p> <p>1.1              Aims and objectives</p> <p>1.2              Economic importance of a dust extractor</p>

Performance evaluation</p> <p>5.1              Recommendation and conclusion</p> <p>References</p> CHAPTER ONE  <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Dust is a serious health hazard especially to the respiratory system.  It can have a cumulative effect eventually resulting in permanent damage to the health.</p> <p>Fine dust is the most dangerous and the most difficult to get rid off.  The sharing and the large particles of dust are not much of a problem as most of it falls to the floor quickly and lungs have a built in mechanism which can eject relatively large particles.</p> <p>The dust particles that causes damage are normally in the range of 0.2 to 5 micron in size (a micron is one thousand of a millimeter) and so small as t o be invisible to the naked eye.  They can remain suspended in the air for hours.  Even if one cannot see any dust, the atmosphere may still be harming ones lungs.  One is likely to breath 8 to 10 cubic meters of air during and 8 hour working day most especially those working in the engineering workshops that has to do with metal drilling (drilling, shaping etc) drugs manufacturing industry, paint industry and food processing industry.</p> <p>If the dust in the air average out of 5 mg per cubic meter during that period, then you will suck in 50gm (2 ounces0 of dust.  Most of this w ill be dealt with by the body’s own dust defence mechanism the nasal hair and mucus lined walls of the air ways leading to the lungs will swallow most of it.  Only a very tiny percentage of the dust is permanently trapped in the lungs but it is this which causes the damage.</p> <p>Dust from some wood can cause skin complaints such as dermatitis.</p> <p>Dust Extractors:          With a small dust extractor couple with the respirator to give a primary protection.  You must not need a huge powerful machine it w ill help to keep the workshop clean and you can use it with it’s flexible hose to cover up the sharing and remove dust which has settled on surfaces.  Because you have a wood turning lathe you can quickly turn up a wooden adaptor to accept the hose form your domestic vacuum cleaner to give you a handy extension hose.  If you have other wood working machines such as a table saw you can hookup the extractor to them when you need to use them.</p> <p>EXTRACTING DUST:          The fan sucks the air into an oil drum shaped container and then through an internal filter.  These machines usually also make use of the cyclone effect to reduce the load on the filter.  This type of machine is cheaper, takes less space, has superior filtration and has a stronger suction for hovering.  The motor however is very noisy and the airflow is much less than the external bag machine.</p> <p>The small filter clog quickly reducing he air flow dramatically.  The wood turner really need is a machine which moves a larger volume of air at a lower speed breeze which wafts the fine suspended dust away from the lathe into an efficient filter.</p> <p>Those extractors setups for paint spraying welding which consist of a large three sided box built around the work area.  Built into the rear of the box in an array of huge powerful fans which sucks all fine dust and fumes through suitably design filters at the rear and recalculate the air.  They work well because they move a very large volume of air.</p> <p>Another dust extractor BB100, this is a low cost fine dust extractor (performance rating 3) for the hobby workshop.  It is equipped with a 1000 watt vacuum cleaner motor which generates 195 cubic metres per hour of air flow and provides enough suction to cater for even the smallest of power tool inlets.  The two stage filtration system consist of a pleated paper filter, rather like a car filter, surrounding the in let to the vacuum motor and a sub micron paper bag filter which totally encloses the pleated filter.</p> <p>Largest sized waste, such as planer chippings, fall straight to the bottom of the drum whilst the smaller dust particles are captured by the paper filters.  The paper filters can be easily replaced as necessary whilst the pleated filter can be a vacuum cleaned periodically.  Typical uses for this extractor are small band saws, bench mounted sanding machines and portable power tools such as routers, planners and sanders.  It also serves as a very effective vacuum cleaner for keeping the workshop clean and tidy.</p> <p>1.1       AIMS AND OBJECTIVE</p> <p>This project is aimed not only at providing a dust extraction machine in factories and workshops but:-</p> <p>To provide a life equipment in the workshop which can be used for exhibition by students.</p> <p>To provide a machine (dust extractor0 which could be further modified and improved on, for the extraction of dust from the atmosphere, which can favourably compete with the best in the market.</p> <p>1.1       ECONOMICS IMPORTANCE OF A DUST EXTRACTOR</p> <p>1.                  For extraction of dust fro the air</p> <p>2.                  Locally made dust extractors can be sourced in the market</p> <p>3.                  Effective dust extraction can only be achieved if handled by an experienced person</p> <p>4.                  Durability if proper maintenance culture is adopted.</p> <p>1.3       USES OF A DUST EXTRACTOR</p> <p>1.                  Can be used in extracting dust from the workshops</p> <p>2.                  Can be produced and soled to factories thereby serving as a source of income to the producer.</p> <p>3.                  Reduces disease that could have been contacted from the air through dust.</p> <p>1.4       DESIGN CONSIDERATION</p> <p>The design and selection of materials is governed by many factors, first, considering the physical characteristics of the extractor i.e the shape, size and weight.</p> <p>Design also to protect man against his negligence and for the safety of the motor.</p> <p>Design to work effectively in any place of application.</p> <p>The weather condition of any place of its application was also considered, therefore it can be used any where without being affected by the weather condition of the environment.</p> <p>WORKING METHOD</p> <p>Metal cutting process consist in removing a layer of metal from blank to obtain a machine part of the required shape and dimensions and with a specified quality of surface finish.</p> <p>A metal cutting tool is the part of a metal cutting machine tool that, in the cutting process, acts directly on the blank from which the finished part is to made.  The metal cutting process accompanied by deformation in compression, tension and shear by a great deal friction and heat generation, tension and shear by a great deal friction and heat generation governed by definite laws.  In order to cut the material from blank, the cutting tool should be harder than the material to be cut, the tool should penetrate the blank and the tool should be strong enough to withstand the forces developed in cutting.</p> <p>In this construction of these dust extraction machine, a lot of welding activities was done and moreso forging in general.  Welding is defined as a group of processes in which metals are joined by bringing abutting surfaces to a molten state.  It facilitate light weight construction.</p> </div>\n\nDESIGN A ND FABRICATION OF A DUST EXTRACTOR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn

ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>            We have participated indeed in mass shelling of corn using the most primitive, cumbersome, and difficult method of hand shelling which encourages rime consuming and human stressfulness.  Corn otherwise known as “Oka” in Igbo tribe is mostly sued seed across all the tribe in this country today.  It is widely used in homes, hotels, and schools for eating and seedling process (when dried).  It is therefore very rare to see any Nigerian who has not tested it in one way or the other.</p> <p>            Now, since it is very imperative for dieting inclusively, it can be refined to form varieties of food supplementary diet such as making of Akamu (pap), Semovita corn pounded, corn mill etc. Today, in our industrial sectors such as ceramics and biscuit industry, it is widely used for making of biscuit, flouring for bakery of the bread, and corn mill.  Infact to summarize all this, junked food that are baked in supermarket today are mostly involves corn in making them.</p> <p>            In the light of this as technology advance forward, an introduction of this machine (sheller) made manifest and come into existence which is more stressless, easy to operate, low costing, and time reduction with high degree of production volume and efficiency.  Modifications have also made it possible to be manually and electro-mechanical operated type depending on the choice of design and the speed of shaft required.</p> <p>            Today, with the aid of this, it has created availability of corn sheller (shelling machine) even in the market which indeed removes our difficulties and impossibilities when using and engaging with modern method of design.</p> <p>1.1       PURPOSE OF CONSTRUCTION</p> <p>            This project is meant to achieve the following purposes.</p> <p>(1)               To design and construct a corn sheller which is easy to operate with high degree of efficiency.</p> <p>(2)               To design and construct a machine (corn sheller) that would save time and cost, with high degree of production volume.</p> <p>(3)               To design and construct a corn sheller that would not have much breaking effect of grains, leaving the cobs intact during the process.</p> <p>(4)               To design and construct a corn sheller that is economic and have little or no complication in maintenance</p> <p>(5)               To design and construct a corn sheller with high percentage of local technology.</p> <p>(6)               To design and construct a machine that is cost effective manual stress reduction.</p> <p>1.2              IMPORTANCE AND SPECIFICATION OF THE PERFECT</p> <p>The importance attached to this design is the facilitation and the production of voluminous corn shelling without much time and without encountering much breakage of the grains of the corn in shortest possible time.</p> <p>The specification was obtained considering the items or component used and the hopper and barrel dimensions put into consideration as well.  The design parameter for corn sheller machine are:</p> <p>1.2.1        BARREL</p> <p>(a)        Outer barrel:-            This barrel do not rotates with the shaft rather stands on itself inside the shelling chambers.  It is a half of glindrical shaped perforated below to enable shelled corn to rush out to the conveyor to the outlet basin.  It is weld and tight at ges at the end for the location of the bearings for the shaft.  At the lower end of one is an open segments serving as outlet for the cobs and a hood is built covering it.</p> <p>            Below is a complete drawing of the outer barrel shown.</p> DRAWING <p>(B)       Inner barrel:- This cylindrical barrel rotates with the shaft support by  end to end bearings.  The diameter of the shaft is and for the inner barrel’s diameter is, having number of spikes measuring from the barrel surface and also wounded vanes that does the shelling process.</p> <p>            Diameter of inner barrel is and its length is and consequently the diameter of the shaft and having a length of.</p> <p>            Below is the diagram of the inner barrel</p>            <p>1.2.2        HOPPER</p> <p>This is similar to a port but the difference is that it is bigger and not covered like the port.  It is eight rapezoid or rectangular in shape, each shape chose have its advantage and disadvantages.  It has an entry through which the corn enters the shelling chamber and the inner engulfing the shaft.  It is obtained after cutting a mild steel and welding it with gauge 12 electrode and it’s dimension is.</p> <p>The diagram is shown below.</p>            <p>1.2.3        RECEPTACLE</p> <p>This is the outer funnel that collects the shelled corn from the conveyor to the outside.</p> <p>1.2.4        SPIKES</p> <p>This is the rod attached to the surface of inner barrel which does the shelling process with the inner barrel and the spring vanes.  It is to 27 in number and measured vertically up from the barrels surface each.</p> <p>1.2.5        COB OUTLET</p> <p>This is an exit through which the cobs goes out of the barrel after shelling process.</p> <p>1.2.6        CONVEYOR</p> <p>This is the carriers that conveys/carry's the cobs out of the barrel after shelling process.</p> <p>1.2.7        DISCHARGED CHAMBER</p> <p>These are the holes perforated below the outer barrel through which the shelled grain corn falls out to the conveyor.</p> <p>1.2.8        COLLECTOR/OUTLET BASIN</p> <p>This is curved mild steel welded below the perforated outer barrel inclined to enable the falling out of the shelled corn to the receptacle.</p> <p>1.2.9        INLET</p> <p>This is the particular place in the hopper through which the corn enters the shelling unit/chamber for shelling process it is measured as.</p> <p>1.2.9.1 SPINNING VANES</p> <p>            This is made up of flat tiny metal welded round the inner barrel together it the spikes.  It is the part of the machine where the corn is being shelled.  It is also placed horizontally wounded around the inner barrel and should be capable of withstanding impact from corn and posses good chemical resistance, high working temperature (100%) and tensile strength.  Dimensionally, it is measured 30mm from the surface of the inner barrel wounded horizontally.</p>

digester machine is used for the removal of mescals from the palm fruit. The processes used in the digestion vary according to fundamental technological developments, which affect the system of operation.</p> <p>The digestion of palm fruit is as old as mankind. The various level of social development change the phase of the digestion action.</p> <p>The relative humidity content of the palm fruit and other associated, physical sand chemical composition of the palm fruit affect the choice of processes for the digestion of palm fruit.</p> <p>The digester system within the African countries is usually done in pastel and mortar. The palm fruit is fed in a hermitical cross-sectional mortar and pounded with many reciprocatory up and down blows. This action tends to remove the monocarp from the palm fruit in marshy oil dropping from. This mashy – oil – dropping form now give why for pressing operation which will lead to the bringing out the palm oil. The digester system within the African countries can also bed done in a horizontal sump of about 6ft x 3ft with 8 3ft depth where the palm fruit will be poured when that is done a person will stand on the palm fruit right in the hole and be matching on it for a short period after which the monocarp will be removed from the Nut when it is pressed the oil will come out.</p> <p>In the fundamental technological development, engineering designs encouraged the construction of different – proto type of digester which aids in the production of more digestible mashy fruit. There are different types of digesters. They are classified into:</p> <p>1.         Manual digester</p> <p>2.         Motorized digester.</p> <p>1.2              MANUAL DIGESTER</p> <p>Manual digesters are built with different shapes and patterns. These is a ways a handle which is used to turn the palm fruit in the barrel the shaft of the digester is designed and welded onto with flanges of barrel depending on the size of the barrel used the operation is efficient but very slow and involve a lot of human effort for high production. This method of operation can not go on for industrial use because of its low production rate. Above all human effort tends to dominate the whole operation manual digesters are mostly common in industrial African villages and communities where there is no rural electrification.</p> <p>1.3              MOTORIZED DIGESTER</p> <p>Motorized digesters consist of a machine with a power driver pulley from the electric motor. The source of power transmission is belt from the driver (i.e) elector motor pulley to the driven digester pulley. The pulley is keyed to the shaft which is supported on two ball bearings located on each end of the shaft. The type of shaft used is the step shaft with the flanges welded unto the bigger correctional part of the shaft. The shaft assembly and flanges are enclosed in a barrel which is usually cylindrical, and the barrel internal surface is about 2cm – 5cm depending on the verities of palm fruit intended for digestion.</p> <p>1.4              TYPES OF MOTORIZED DIGESTER</p> <p>Horizontal types of the motorized digester are classified depending on the axis of mounting of the barrel and shaft. The horizontal digester are designed with shaft and barrel parirel to the horizontal axis and will incorporate an electric motor that will generate power to the system that will enable the system to function accordingly the vertical digester are this type which the axis are built at right angle to the horizontal axis, the shaft and barrel are positioned in a vertical direction to work effectively. Most designers prefers this type of vertically mounted system because of it high efficiency and easy construction and even good out put in terms of digestion.    </p> </div>\n\nDESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A PALM FRUIT DIGESTER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A PALM FRUIT DIGESTER", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> ABSTRACT <p>            This project is constructed based on careful theoretical analysis of materials of chance and reasons for the selection of the materials.</p> <p>            The theoretical analysis of heat principles and temperatures of the different fervid which in solid stage should set in the mould were analyzed.</p> <p>The basic principles of cooling of the mould to avoid physical problems of cracks and distortions involved when high temperature are were studied.  The cup mould design started with the choice of the optimal dimensions and then production of the wooden pattern.</p> <p>With the completion of the wooden pattern of dimensions 26cm x 12cm x 5cm, the pattern was filled with chemical treated sand and fired over the oven for complete drying exercise.  With the drying operation over, the patterns were filled with the sand and rammed well.  The risers and provision for the core were all provided.  The upper and lower parts of the pattern were tightly fixed together.  The instance of the complete filling and ramming, molten aluminum from the furnace was poured into the pattern.  After about one day, the pattern was opened and then the formed cup mould of aluminum produced.

the increase.  With it comes the choice of various designs and models.  This has led to the design of a good number of machines that can be used by the craftsmen to create different wood designs amongst which is the wood lathe machine.</p>   1.1       OBJECTIVES <p>            The main objectives of this project are to:</p> <p>(a)        Use available local materials in fabrication</p> <p>(b)        Achieve a reduction in the cost of production of the machine</p> <p>(c)        Reduce the labour cost and time spent on using hand tools for wood dressing</p> <p>(d)       Create awareness for, and encouragement of indigenous technology</p> <p>(e)        Increase Productivity and creativity</p> <p>            The vital need for the fabrication of wood lathe is significant in the much delay and time as well as energy wasted in using simple hand tools to carry out jobs moreover, the cost of importation of a lathe machine is tool high for an average war.  Similar to the use of other machine tools, the wood lathe machine will help to reduce the cost and consequently increase the rate of production and craftsmen skill.  It is also important to explore the design of machines to improve on the ones already in existence.</p> <p>1.2       LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>            This covers a brief but concise history of the lathe machine, and other works relevant to this project, which had been done earlier.</p> <p>1.3       TREAD IN LATHE MACHINE FABRICATION</p> <p>            The emergence of the lathe machine date back to an unknown period, but it gained popularity between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.  Then opticians used it for cutting lenses used in the construction of astronomical telescope.  They modified the relatively rough technique for special purposes.  Artisans and furniture makers used the larger lathes in turning frame works though the frames were made of wood and had one or two headstocks depending on the work being done.  The wooden frame made it inaccurate.</p> <p>Discussed below are some related lathe machines:</p> <p>A.        CENTER LATHE MACHINE</p> <p>            A center lathe is used to machine metals, by

Man cooks his food and if not warmed at least every ten hours will get spoilt. Food items like boiled beans, yam, rice, beef etc spoilt. Some days due to lack of adequate preservation facility. Most also after some day work, man needs to take chilled drink in order to maintain or normalize his body temperature. For him to achieve this he uses clay pot to store drinking water. The clay pot does cooling but to an extent.</p> <p>Man can preserve his food by constant warming, drying under the sun, salting etc but that is not enough for total or adequate preservation. Nowadays, these methods of food preservation are not practiced again.</p> <p>            For more than decades this problem of food preservation has been a stumbling block in our homes. No sooner than latter did men star looking for a way to solve the problem hence the construction of cooling system (refrigerator)</p> <p>            The purpose and objectives of embarking on this project is to construct a cooling system that does cooling and preserves food items for future use. For this to be achieved. We need a machine that can transfer heat from a cold chamber which is at a temperature lower than that of its surroundings. This is because, bacteria that would have acted on the food items cannot survive in a very low temperature.</p> <p>            For a complete refrigeration process, we need to have the following parts of refrigeration system.</p> <p>1.   Compressor  -                  This  pumps the refrigerant or the gas through the entire system.</p> <p>2.    Condenser -                    This is the cooling coil for the hot refrigerant gas.</p> <p>3.    Drier Strainer -               It removes any moisture or impurities associated with hot refrigerant gas.</p> <p>4.   Metering Device -            The tube is usually soldered along the exterior of the discharge line, forming a heat exchange which helps to cool the hot liquid refrigerant.</p> <p>5.  Evaporator – At the evaporator, the refrigerant absorbs heat from the strange area and is gradually changed from a liquid and a gas mixture to a gas.</p> <p>6.  Accumulator -                   It prevents any liquid from returning or un-boil liquid from going into the compressor.</p> <p>It is very necessary to embark on this project to reduce the problem of lack of preservation facility our country is experiencing. The project is needed to boost our country’s modern technology. The benefits to be derived from this exploration are:</p> <p>(i)         To help us apply theoretical knowledge to solve industrials related problems.</p> <p>(ii)        To help us design and conducts a mobile refrigerator (cooling system) without any complication in maintenance.</p> <p>Age hardening, the stimulation of stratosphere conditions in the laboratory for the testing of all types of air craft equipment, including the engine themselves requires refrigeration at 670f.  In the process industries refrigeration is  used to carryout such operations as the separation used to carryout such operations as the separation of crystals from solutions.</p> <p>            Application of refrigeration in the medical profession is increasing daily, not only in the preservation of certain products, but also in the actual treatment of some physical ailments. The use of cold anesthesia” has shown great promise in the field of surgery. The manufacture of periling requires refrigeration and removal of moisture under high vacuum. The same process is required in the drying of blood plasma, and the preservation of blood, required refrigeration before the drying is accomplished.  </p> <p>            In the refrigeration food industry, development are occurring so rapidly that it is difficult to keep abreast of them increase application of domestic refrigeration’ have been supplemented by the entirely new field of domestic low-temperature cabinets for the preparation and storage of frozen foods, both uncooked and precooked.</p> <p>            In serving some of the function and considering the area and situation of need such as resort centers, picnic, school, etc. hence the need arise more than even prior to design of mobile cooling system of acceptable standard that will met certain essential requirement such as put ability and cost effectiveness.</p> </div>\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF A MOBILE REFRIGERATOR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONSTRUCTION OF A MOBILE REFRIGERATOR", "id": 14}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This machine is meant for sealing and cutting of nylon bag of different sizes.

Most of food packaging for hygienic. The technology of cellophane permits raw materials of textile industries to be carried with sealed polyethylene the finished products are either marketed or exported with polyethylene packaging. Most utensils are packaged with polyethylene. Special polyethylene materials have been invented of recent that have shock absorber which gives protection to the breakable material. Since this packaging came up, there had been a safer conveyance of glass and ceramics materials, especially for transportation and exportation of finished goods.</p> <p>Also, it is in packaging most of electronic gadgets which includes; computers, amplifiers, calculators,  radio and T.V sets etc. for safety purposes. It will be needless talking about polyethylene. Without talking about the machines used in sealing generally.

industries hotels, pubic center, etc was done by cutlass this method of manual cutting is time consuming a s it is human effort that is needed for cutting, there was also inaccuracy in cutting level using the manual cutting system.</p> <p>            Apart from all these old method of cutting there is also risk of accident.</p> <p>            The problems of the manual was meant to be overcome with the aid of this project (the construction of a mechanical lawn mower) which is used for cutting of grasses to equal height or level for speedy cutting.</p> <p>            This project lawn mower, is also the accident free as well, it reduced labour and also reduced number personnel that is needed in a particular operation, it also reduced man power as it an internal combustion engineer that dose the actual cutting while the operator provides the efforts, great portion of land can easily be cut with lawn mower.</p> <p>            Again to encourage beauty in our environment this project was embarked on to help in keeping our environment clean because most labourers are finding it difficult in handily tool for gasses cutting.  It is also used for cutting sports field, (like foot ball pitch as well as crowns in hotel and business premises so this project reduces human effort and should be encouraged in school, hotel, business area, etc although mowers can be of electric type too, but we decided to fabricate a mechanical type to overcome the problem of electricity and as such this our lawn mower can be used every where even were there is no electricity.</p> <p>IDENTIFICATION OF NEED</p> <p>            Early before now, West Africa as a whole, the peasant farmer depends on the hoe and cutlass for practically all farm operation.  There tools vary in shape and size from place to place in the high forest zone of Nigeria the small farmer must clear thick bush every three or four years.  All this job is being done either hoe or cutlass for weeding of farm land.  These farm operation depend entirely on the energy of the farmer using the tools which he has at this disposal.   This inability that facing the farmer, has triggered these project group to research into the lasting solution to the problem.</p> <p>            Also, with meant development in the country, daily labour in farm operation is highly exorbitant for the farmer to afford but with these project (mechanical lawn mower) this problem of high payment of local labour can lead to reduction importation cost from Germany USA of this machine Nigerian with high profitability to the farmers.</p> <p>1.2              LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.3              HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT (SCOPE)</p> <p>Based on the developing countries, technology in farm operation is highly increased.  It is clear that developments in farm machinery in West Africa started far back 1960.  This project must related to the social and ecological condition prevailing in different parts of this great region at the present time two trends a re apparent.</p> <p>i.                    Increase in the use of tractors and large agricultural machinery of farms of large extent both in the high forest and savanna zones, but particularly in the latter.</p> <p>ii.                  The increased use of animal power and small machines on peasant farms operation in West Africa will become increasingly mechanized, and that stage of mechanization mechanized, and that stage of mechanization which lies between the hoe and cutlass on one hand and the tractor combine harvester on the other is referred to as intermediate technology.</p> <p>1.4       IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT TO SOCEITY  </p> <p>            Generally this project (mechanical lawn mower) has a great effect towards development and maintenance of any community in the societies which one nominated below.</p> <p>1.                  Cutting grass of secondary primary and tertiary field thereby reducing human effort needed.</p> <p>2.                  Great portion of farmland can easily cut or brushed with lawn mower in one day.</p> <p>3.                  This project reduced number of personnel that needed in a particular farm operation.</p> <p>4.                  To reduce manpower</p> <p>5.                  To improve the economy of the country</p> <p>6.                  Provisions of foreign exchange in the country</p> <p>7.                  t reduce importation cost t o our country (Nigeria)</p> <p>8.                  It encourage pupils, and student to be regular and the school because no more cutting of grass with cutlass by pupils or students.</p> <p>1.5       AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT</p> <p>            In the past, several investigation w ere made in the lawn mower industry at USA, Germany etc. Nigerian market, from which this production is a development of already existing ones.  It was localized to smite our environments condition aim and objectives of the investigation on the project are nominated below.</p> <p>1.5.1    REDUCTION OF LABOUR COST</p> <p>            In application of lawn mower machine in any government field and farm land causes seriously reduction in number of labour needed in the maintenance of the yard, brushing and clearing of the grass but with aid of lawn mower machine, the job is easily performed without much wasting of time.  This project IMT can get the yard well cutted and cleared.</p> <p>1.5.2    IMPROVEMENT OF FOOD PRODUCTION</p> <p>            Local farmer can embark on maintenance of 100 hectares of farm land with aid of lawn mower machine.  This project will extract some lazy farmer to embark on farming operation, also many people will developed interest and rendering agricultural engineering or course related to farm.</p> <p>1.5.3    TIME FACTOR</p> <p>            The production of this project (lawn mower machine) brings reduction in man hour consumed in cutting of grass which is being improved using lawn  mower

MECHANCIAL LAWN MOWER", "id": 16}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The journal bearing demonstration rig is an apparatus which is used to study how pressure would vary around the section of a journal bearing at various speed of the shaft and loading conditions. The design of the journal bearing was done by the use of standard design procedures carefully stated within this work. The frame, the journal bearing, the journal shaft, the base plate and all relevant components of the apparatus were designed. Other parts not constructed were procured. The fabrication and construction processes were carried out in the workshop. The shaft to be used was machined on the lathe machine to the design specification. So also was the bearing to be used. This was all explicitly discussed in this report. Frame construction was carried out by welding process also stated in the work. The spring damper support was another constructed part. The assembly was done in such a way that the eccentricity between the bearing and the shaft would exist so as to get results. Relevant formulas, derivation and equation models were used in carrying out calculations used to get mathematical results that can be used to compare the experimental results. It is observed in the graph plotted from the experimental results, that the speed is proportionally or linear to the pressure build up in the journal bearing. The pressure tapping (h5), shows the highest reading on the manometer board, ranging from 76cm for 1144rpm to 25cm for 572rpm due to eccentricity of the two centers (shaft and journal bearing).</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>1.1 INTRODUCTION</strong></em><br/>Hydrodynamic journal bearings are typical critical power transmission components that carry high loads in different machines. In machine design, therefore, it is essential to know the true or expected operating conditions of the bearings. These operating conditions can be studied both by experimental and mathematical means, for example in test rig experiments, in field or laboratory tests with engines and by calculation or simulation.<br/>Numerous studies of the operating conditions of hydrodynamic journal bearings have been made during the last decades. Still, the case is far from closed. For example, there are a limited number of studies that carry out an in-depth examination of the true operating conditions of bearings in true-scale experiments. There is also a need for experimental studies to verify the theoretical ones.<br/>Fluid friction i.e. viscosity which exists in the lubricant being used is studied alongside the pressure effect which is being generated in the bearing, thus the effect of lubricants with different viscosities are considered.<br/>A simple journal bearing consists of two rigid cylinders. The outer cylinder (bearing) wraps the inner rotating journal (shaft). A lubricant fills the small annular gap or clearance between the journal and the bearing. The amount of eccentricity of the journal is related to the pressure that will be generated in<br/>the bearing to balance the radial load. The lubricant is supplied through a hole or a groove and may or may not extend all around the journal. The pressure around the journal is measured on various manometers by means of pressure pipe/tubes. This is done at various speeds to get the relationship between speed and the pressure.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</em></strong><br/>In the late 1880s, experiments were being conducted on the lubrication of bearing surfaces. The idea of “floating” a load on a film of oil grew from the experiments of Beauchamp Tower and the theoretical work of Osborne Reynolds.<br/>Prior to the development of the pivoted shoe thrust bearing, marine propulsion relied on a “horseshoe” bearing which consisted of several equally spaced collars to share the load, each on a sector of a thrust plate. The parallel surfaces rubbed, wore, and produced considerable friction. Design unit loads were on the order of 40 psi. Comparison tests against a pivoted shoe thrust bearing of equal capacity showed that the pivoted shoe thrust bearing, at only 1/4 the size, had 1/7 the area but operated successfully with only 1/10 the frictional drag of the horseshoe bearing.<br/>In 1896, inspired by the work of Osborne Reynolds, Albert Kingsbury conceived and tested a pivoted shoe thrust bearing. According to Dr. Kingsbury, the test bearings ran well. Small loads were applied first, on the order of 50 psi (which was typical of ship propeller shaft unit loads at the time). The loads were gradually increased, finally reaching 4000 psi, the speed being about 285 rpm.<br/>In 1912, Albert Kingsbury was contracted by the Pennsylvania Water and Power Company to apply his design in their hydroelectric plant at Holtwood, PA. The existing roller bearings were causing extensive down times (several<br/>outages a year) for inspections, repair and replacement. The first hydrodynamic pivoted shoe thrust bearing was installed in Unit 5 on June 22, 1912. At start-up of the 12,000 kW units, the bearing wiped. In resolving the reason for failure, much was learned about tolerances and finishes required for the hydrodynamic bearings to operate. After properly finishing the runner and fitting the bearing, the unit ran with continued good operation. This bearing, owing to its merit of running 75 years with negligible wear under a load of 220 tons, was designated by ASME as the 23rd International Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark on June 27, 1987.<br/>Since then, there has been series of progressive research carried out on bearings bringing to the advent of journal bearings which are not so different from the bearings designed by Osborne Reynolds and Albert Kingsbury which work on the same hydrodynamic lubrication system.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 RESEARCH PROBLEM</em></strong><br/>The operating conditions of hydrodynamic journal bearings can be described by a set of tribological variables called key operating parameters. For example, the load level of a hydrodynamic journal bearing is described by two parameters: the specific load and the sliding speed. The key operating parameters most directly related to the bearing lubricant-shaft contact are the oil film temperature, oil film thickness and oil film pressure. These three key parameters can be determined by experimental or mathematical means with varying levels of complexity.<br/>Until now, oil film pressure in hydrodynamic journal bearings has been studied mainly by mathematical means, because the experimental determination of oil film pressure has been a demanding or even an unfeasible task. Under real operating conditions, there are typically many practicalities that complicate the experimental determination of true oil film pressure in a certain point or at a certain moment. The oil film may be extremely thin and therefore sensitive to different disturbing factors, for example defects in geometry. In addition, the level of the oil film pressure may be extremely high or have a high level of dynamic variability.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 AIM AND OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT</em></strong><br/>The research into the construction and design of the journal bearing apparatus has several reasons and purposes which need to be achieved and justified.<br/>The main aim of the study was to determine the oil film pressure in hydrodynamic journal bearings carrying realistic loads. In addition, the relationship between the oil film pressure and other key operating parameters of journal bearings such as eccentricity and shaft speed was studied.<br/>The study also included the determination of the relationship between the speed of rotation of the shaft, the pressure around the journal bearing and the oil thickness.</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 SCOPE OF THE PROJECT</em></strong><br/>The design and construction of journal bearing demonstration rig covers a very broad area. This area encompasses the design, design considerations, construction, assembly, working conditions and governing mathematical equations and laws. The design gives in depth details of the construction and fabrication of the apparatus. The working conditions consist of the loading, acting pressures and the variable operating speed which the journal bearing apparatus undergoes. Relevant design calculations and equations to include the Pressure head calculation, Sommerfeld’s equation and number, Petroff’s equation and Reynold’s equation to mention a few, are contained in this work.</p>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF JOURNAL BEARING DEMONSTRATION RIG<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF JOURNAL BEARING DEMONSTRATION RIG", "id": 17}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Man’s imp act on global environment system especially in the area of dust extraction is now at a scale where it is disrupting. These dust extractors varies in major ways.<br/>The environmental degration is, in turn contributing to health threat in this part of the globe. Unfortunately most factories, workshops which suppose to posses these machines for dust extractions a re not having them thereby making dust a very dangerous threat to man. <br/>Due to this ugly development it, is obvious that these factories and workshops can do little or nothing to protect our environment from this poor state. It is therefore necessary that all and sundry should join the crusade of eradicating dust from our environment thereby making it clean. Although before now people have tried to contribute their own quota in seeing to the end of the menace, get lack of interest, finance has posed a hindrance to the realization of this achievement.<br/>In view of the above, we deemed it necessary that such a machine should be constructed to the Mechanical Engineering workshop to eradicate dust and thereby make the workshop environment clean and fit for students practical activities. <br/>The realization of this work started from our supervisor who conceived the idea which we saw as a need, then we defined the need and synthesized it, evaluate and came to a conclusion.<br/>The synthesis led us to drawing board by sketching and drawing to scale after which the design required was chosen. Fabricated and parts put together to form what we called a dust extractor.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>Dust is a serious health hazard especially to the respiratory system. It can have a cumulative effect eventually resulting in permanent damage to the health.<br/>Fine dust is the most dangerous and the most difficult to get rid off. The sharing and the large particles of dust are not much of a problem as most of it falls to the floor quickly and lungs have a built in mechanism which can eject relatively large particles.<br/>The dust particles that causes damage are normally in the range of 0.2 to 5 micron in size (a micron is one thousand of a millimeter) and so small as t o be invisible to the naked eye. They can remain suspended in the air for hours. Even if one cannot see any dust, the atmosphere may still be harming ones lungs. One is likely to breath 8 to 10 cubic meters of air during and 8 hour working day most especially those working in the engineering workshops that has to do with metal drilling (drilling, shaping etc) drugs manufacturing industry, paint industry and food processing industry.<br/>If the dust in the air average out of 5 mg per cubic meter during that period, then you will suck in 50gm (2 ounces0 of dust. Most of this w ill be dealt with by the body’s own dust defence mechanism the nasal hair and mucus lined walls of the air ways leading to the lungs will swallow most of it. Only a very tiny percentage of the dust is permanently trapped in the lungs but it is this which causes the damage.<br/>Dust from some wood can cause skin complaints such as dermatitis.<br/>Dust Extractors: With a small dust extractor couple with the respirator to give a primary protection. You must not need a huge powerful machine it w ill help to keep the workshop clean and you can use it with it’s flexible hose to cover up the sharing and remove dust which has settled on surfaces. Because you have a wood turning lathe you can quickly turn up a wooden adaptor to accept the hose form your domestic vacuum cleaner to give you a handy extension hose. If you have other wood working machines such as a table saw you can hookup the extractor to them when you need to use them.<br/>EXTRACTING DUST: The fan sucks the air into an oil drum shaped container and then through an internal filter. These machines usually also make use of the cyclone effect to reduce the load on the filter. This type of machine is cheaper, takes less space, has superior filtration and has a stronger suction for hovering. The motor however is very noisy and the airflow is much less than the external bag machine.<br/>The small filter clog quickly reducing he air flow dramatically. The wood turner really need is a machine which moves a larger volume of air at a lower speed breeze which wafts the fine suspended dust away from the lathe into an efficient filter.<br/>Those extractors setups for paint spraying welding which consist of a large three sided box built around the work area. Built into the rear of the box in an array of huge powerful fans which sucks all fine dust and fumes through suitably design filters at the rear and recalculate the air. They work well because they move a very large volume of air.<br/>Another dust extractor BB100, this is a low cost fine dust extractor (performance rating 3) for the hobby workshop. It is equipped with a 1000 watt vacuum cleaner motor which generates 195 cubic metres per hour of air flow and provides enough suction to cater for even the smallest of power tool inlets. The two stage filtration system consist of a pleated paper filter, rather like a car filter, surrounding the in let to the vacuum motor and a sub micron paper bag filter which totally encloses the pleated filter.<br/>Largest sized waste, such as planer chippings, fall straight to the bottom of the drum whilst the smaller dust particles are captured by the paper filters. The paper filters can be easily replaced as necessary whilst the pleated filter can be a vacuum cleaned periodically. Typical uses for this extractor are small band saws, bench mounted sanding machines and portable power tools such as routers, planners and sanders. It also serves as a very effective vacuum cleaner for keeping the workshop clean and tidy.</p> <p><strong>1.1 AIMS AND OBJECTIVE</strong><br/>This project is aimed not only at providing a dust extraction machine in factories and workshops but:-<br/>To provide a life equipment in the workshop which can be used for exhibition by students.<br/>To provide a machine (dust extractor0 which could be further modified and improved on, for the extraction of dust from the atmosphere, which can favourably compete with the best in the market.<br/><strong>1.2 ECONOMICS IMPORTANCE OF A DUST EXTRACTOR</strong><br/>1. For extraction of dust fro the air <br/>2. Locally made dust extractors can be sourced in the market<br/>3. Effective dust extraction can only be achieved if handled by an experienced person <br/>4. Durability if proper maintenance culture is adopted.</p> <p><strong>1.3 USES OF A DUST EXTRACTOR</strong><br/>1. Can be used in extracting dust from the workshops<br/>2. Can be produced and soled to factories thereby serving as a source of income to the producer.<br/>3. Reduces disease that could have been contacted from the air through dust.</p> <p><strong>1.4 DESIGN CONSIDERATION</strong><br/>The design and selection of materials is governed by many factors, first, considering the physical characteristics of the extractor i.e the shape, size and weight.<br/>Design also to protect man against his negligence and for the safety of the motor.<br/>Design to work effectively in any place of application.<br/>The weather condition of any place of its application was also considered, therefore it can be used any where without being affected by the weather condition of the environment.</p> <p><strong>WORKING METHOD</strong><br/>Metal cutting process consist in removing a layer of metal from blank to obtain a machine part of the required shape and dimensions and with a specified quality of surface finish.<br/>A metal cutting tool is the part of a metal cutting machine tool that, in the cutting process, acts directly on the blank from which the finished part is to made. The metal cutting process accompanied by deformation in compression, tension and shear by a great deal friction and heat generation, tension and shear by a great deal friction and heat generation governed by definite laws. In order to cut the material from blank, the cutting tool should be harder than the material to be cut, the tool should penetrate the blank and the tool should be strong enough to withstand the forces developed in cutting.<br/>In this construction of these dust extraction machine, a lot of welding activities was done and moreso forging in general. Welding is defined as a group of processes in which metals are joined by bringing abutting surfaces to a molten state. It facilitate light weight construction. </p>\n\nDESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A DUST EXTRACTOR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A DUST EXTRACTOR", "id": 18}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>            The concept of this project is to actualize a practical way of paint production using a locally design mixing machine which is design to meet a low cost and high standard paint.</p> <p>            The project cut across all forms of engineering, such as mechanical machine design of a simple industrial mixer, which is driven by an electrically made device, a 3 HP electric motor, chemically reacting reagents such as water, calcium carbonate, etc to produce the desired product which is aim to be used as coat for Mechanical Agricultural and Civil structures.</p> <p>            The project research exposes to students and entrepreneur to total knowledge necessary for the production of emulsion and texcoat using a single mixer irrespective of the volume of production.  Self help project is the only sustainable solution to the problem of unemployment.  Many unemployed youth can lay their hiring.

yet paints are a class of products that serves important aesthetic, protection and functional values.  The few available paints makers are so specialized or professional in presentation that the seem scaring to interested students and industrialist.  The objective of the project pilot  production plant for pant simplified paint making; thereby motivating entrepreneur aspiring in pant making given them adequate viable market as a result of low cost of production.</p> </div>\n\nDESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A PILOT PRODUCTION PLANT FOR PAINTS (EMULSION AND TEXCOAT)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A PILOT PRODUCTION PLANT FOR PAINTS (EMULSION AND TEXCOAT)", "id": 19}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>           This project is concern about the construction of an electrical stove with three oven apartment is described in his project.  It was carried out in order to solve the problem often encounter in cooking and drying and at the same time finding an alternat6ive means to replace the use of  kerosine and gas for cooking and drying which are often not available due to scarcity of these products, however, the project students have employed the use of electricity which is rending available.</p> <p>           The analysis of each stage of development of this equipment is cleearly described.  Having compared the results of this construction with those exsisting or parallel ones, it was found out that it stands the test of time.</p> <p>           However, the operation of this electrical equipment in not without limitation.  For precisely nine years now Nigeria has been facing power instability, and a seizure of electrical power does disrupt the operation of this equipment, for without which no source of its energy.</p> <p>           The cost analysis also prove to a large extent to be relatively cheaper than most modern cookers and ovens for domestic application.</p> TABLE OF CONTENT CHAPTER ONE <p>1.0              Introduction/literature Review</p> <p>1.1   Introduction</p> <p>1.2              Problem statement</p> <p>1.3              Purpose of objective of this study</p> <p>1.4              Literature review</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO    </p> <p>2.0              Constructional specification of the oven</p> <p>2.1   Determination of the insulted portion</p> <p>2.2              Materials used and their importance</p> <p>2.3              Mill steel</p> <p>2.4              Copper element</p> <p>2.5              Insulting materials</p> <p>2.6              Silicon</p> CHAPTER THREE <p>3.1              Mechanical construction</p> <p>3.2              The main frame</p> <p>3.3              The top and sides covers</p> <p>3.4              Back cover</p> <p>3.5              The top/heating chamber</p> <p>3.6              Stand/handle</p> <p>3.7              The framing of the door</p> <p>3.8              Mode of operation</p> CHAPTER FOUR <p>4.0              Conclusion</p> <p>4.1       How to operate</p> <p>4.2       Inspection and testing</p> <p>4.3              The visual inspection</p> <p>4.4              Cold test</p> <p>4.5              Insulation Resistance test</p> <p>4.6              The hot test</p> <p>4.7              Problems encountered</p> <p>4.8              Recommendations</p> <p>4.9              Cost analysis</p> <p>5.0              References</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0           INTRODUCTION/LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.1   INTRODUCTION</p> <p>           This project is as a result of increasing interest.</p> <p>Essentially, the idea, as demonstrated in an existing design, arises in the project students a feeling of motivation, and hence the search for a way to bring it to reality in a simple, yet intelligent design, like this.</p> <p>1.2           PROBLEM STATEMENT</p> <p>           Specifically, this design seeks for a source of energy that is relatively cheap and available, and therefore has an edge over other stoves and ovens using kerosine and gas as sources of energy.  It also aims at making domestic cookers and ovens safe enough as against highly flammable liquid or gas fuel.</p> <p>           Many Nigerians today are faced with the problem of petroleum fuel scarcity and as per cooking and drying which is not often easy to get fire wood from forests that are often far away especially from the big cities.  Equally too, the few available fuels are of substandard quality with the attendant danger of fire outbreak.</p> <p>           In addition above, fuel consuming cookers and ovens have two outstanding deficiencies, namely; sooty pre-heating and problem of dogged nozzles which lead to offensive discouraging and dirty burning.</p> <p>           Above all, deforestation as a result of fire wood consumption is causing great deal of environmental problems in most regions of Africa.  In this modern world and its various invented means of cooking, it largely seems as if non has quite addressed this area by providing an alternative means of cooking and drying.</p> <p>           In a close observation, large scale cooking and drying as an drying of meat and fish sellers, commercial corn roasters, food sellers and “suya” sellers, etc, need efficient heating system.  The absence of short drying period and hygienic process of preserving our loide and sea foods is another issue, which has led to fast spoiling and give an electrical stove with an oven apartment to sufficiently address these problems.</p> <p>1.3           PURPOSE OR OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY</p> <p>           This study is to devise a means of producing an electrical stove with three apartment to address the following:</p> <p>(1)            The problem of sooty pare-heating as observed in vaporizing cookers.</p> <p>(2)             Economically, this equipment is designed for cost reduction and easy to maintain.</p> <p>(2)        To reduce the effect of kerosine scarcity prevailing in our present days.</p> <p>(3)            To meet up with inadequate availability of fire wood through deforestat6ion.</p> <p>1.4           LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>           In an extremely large span of time ago, people generally roasted by placing food substances on hot wood coal or on heated rocks, and smoking (drying) ,of meat and fish was done by means of brick oven.  This brick oven was locally made in a dome shape having an opening through which the firewood and other food substances were put.  In use, the firewood was burnt to a sufficient time to provide enough hot coal before the meat or the fish already laid on a perforated sheet or wire was regulated by either gathering the fire wood together for more heat or withdrawing them from the oven so as to reduce the heat.  This event can be dated back at least to the third century AD</p> <p>Equally too, primitive Africans set fire on a carefully arranged fire wood and used the fire so generated for cooking.  That was when civilization was still in the womb of time.  As a result of science and technology electricity came into during such trend that electrical element was made to generate heat when electric current is passed through it.  About 1914 electricity was adopted for cooking, and become popular in late 1920s.  along side those periods, oil exploration and its various refined products like kerosine, gas, etc for both industrial and domestic consumption were made possible.  Hence, kerosine stores and gas cookers, over the years, began to replace the primitive way of using firewood for cooking and drying, particularly in most civilized regions of Africa.</p> <p>           Then came a time, late part of the last century and the new millennium, when petroleum fuel scarcity overwhelmed the entire nation, making lives of many Nigerians difficult.  Consequently, kerosine stoves and gas cookers became n o more alternative as before.  Many Nigerians began  using fire wood for cooking and drying.  This period was crucial during the PENGASAM strike, 1994. When a certain container inside which coal is burnt to provide heat for cooking and roasting was named</p> <p>ABACHA STGOVE:  In the course of the above periods, foreign electrical stoves and ovens flooded our local market, and their maintenance culture were by no means easy.  Thus, economically their uses were not feasible enough domestically.</p> <p>           Thus threw a challenge to our local engineers to produce electrical stoves and ovens that can stand the test of time within our locality, and to avoid the danger of kerosine and gas explosion which have terminated a lot of lives in our present days.  Such a challenge also paved way for the project students came up with such a dual-purpose domestic electrical heating equipment to sufficiently address the problems being imposed by petroleum fuel consuming stoves and ovens, incessant as stated preciously in 1.2. above.</p> </div>\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF AN ELECTRICAL STOVE WITH THREE-OVEN APARTMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONSTRUCTION OF AN ELECTRICAL STOVE WITH THREE-OVEN APARTMENT", "id": 20}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This work is an attempt evolve a quicker and easier method of achieving Transportation.

This motor vehicle designed to operate using internal construction engine, which is the most convenient source of power so far developed for driving road vehicles, which drives its power from the burning of fuel and air inside the engine cylinder. <br/>The internal combustion engine (I.C.E) converts the chemical energy in fuel into heat energy and heat energy into mechanical energy. The heat energy is produced by a chemical reaction between the different elements of fuel and air in other ward burning. This burning of fuel and air takes place inside sealed to expand in all directions.

The popcorn-making machine in constructed with locally made materials at a reduced cost. The design, construction and fabrication of the machine i.e. not in any known text at the moment, the project group therefore faced design, construction and fabrication problem.</p> <p><br/><strong>1.2 DESIGN CONSTRUCTION AND FABRICATION PROBLEM </strong><br/>The problems associated with the design of the machine are discussed below. <br/>1. Selection of Electric Motor: In the market, there are various types of motor with varying speed of rotation per minute. The automated popcorn machine has a striver which turns the corn inside the cast opts as heating on. The striver, which rotates due to the rod connected to it from the motor, should rotate with a low speed to produce the desired effect. In our research, we were able to discover that only a low speed motor could give the desired turning effect. <br/>2. Heating Element: Another problem in the choice of heating element. There are various kinds of heating elements available in the market ranging from 850- 1500watts. The elements come in different shapes, sizes, and makes e.g. spring type, ring type and plate type.<br/>3. Third Design Problem is Control and Safety: In the system we discovered that there is the need for the finance circuit to control the operation of the electrical popcorn machine. <br/>4. Construction and Fabrication of the Housing for the Machine: This is fourth problem, which involves the use of per pex holler rectangular aluminum bars in profile glasses and metal handle. With respect to safety. The machine was made to be safer for the users by incorporating the user of insulator in the design.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE DESIGN </strong><br/>1. To eliminate the use of manual popcorn machine. <br/>2. To save time and manpower as most of the work in now done by using electricity. <br/>3. To achieve mass production. <br/>4. To use electrical energy in the production of popcorn.<br/>5. To produce popcorn at a reduced cost.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SCOPE AND LIMITATION </strong><br/>This project covers design, construction fabrication and operation of the electrical operated popcorn producing machine. <br/><br/><strong>1.5 IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT</strong><br/>The project will serve as a means of employment to mechanical engineering graduates when properly carried out. some government can longer guarantee her citizens already made employment. The present economic situation in this country calls for self-reliance. The young technological engineer can embark on the production of the electrical operated popcorn-producing machine on low scale and when buoyant enough can embark on large-scale production. This project serves as a medium of enriching our knowledge of designs and constructions techniques, since it embraces practical and research operation. Thirdly, it will provide employment for the fulltime unemployment house covers. Young men and women who have attended the age of gainful employment from the government. Thus included graduates, young school leavers etc . This will provide means of revenue and livelihood, thereby helping to correct societal ills that is prevail our society. <br/>Finally, this project is also relevant to the technology advancement of the nation. It could be exported to the neighbouring countries thereby serving as a source of foreign exchange earning for the nation.</p> <p><strong>1.6 DEFINITION OF TERMS </strong><br/>1.

A new or better machine is one which is more economical in the overall cost of production, operation and maintenance.</p> <p>It is on these background that we came out with a design of a machine, which shall help in solving problems of drying spent grains in our breweries.</p> <p>The major problem facing breweries in the country in how to utilize the spent grains after brewing. Though some breweries use these spent grains as aids by drying and burning them. We hence see this method of recognition as not being economical but wasteful.</p> <p>There  propelled us to designing a new method of  drying these spent grains to the required moisture content through the use of a SPIN DRYER. When these spent grains are properly dried, it could be a major constituent in the production of  poultry feeds.</p> <p>With this spin dryer, the unemployed masses could gain jobs by fabricating or buying  this machine for drying of spent grains, and recycling it to a useful feed for poultry.</p> <p>It  is worthy  to note that the production of a spin dryer is designed in a way that even the unskilled workers could operate it, in fact, we are designing this project as our quota towards the  eradication of unemployment and poverty, which this present government is wedging war against.</p> <p>Moreover, technology could be bought, borrowed or stolen. Our project is a borrowed technology from the western world, which was primarily used for drying of clothes, but we have expanded this scope to deal favourably with drying of spent grains to the desired moisture content.</p> <p>1.2              THE PURPOSE OF CONSTRUCTION</p> <p>This project is designed and constructed to achieve the following goals:</p> <p>1.                  To design and construct a spin dryer that will recycle brewery waste (spent grains).</p> <p>2.                  To design and construct a machine that can dry rapidly trough spinning.</p> <p>3.                  To design and construct a machine that will have high degree of automatization.</p> <p>4.                  To  design and construct a machine  that will take less drying time.</p> <p>5.                  To design a machine that will be easy in construction but have high efficiency.</p> <p>6.                  To design and construct a machine that will be cheap to operate and maintain.</p> <p>7.                  To design and construct a machine that will require less energy.</p> <p>8.                  To design and construct a machine that could impress on existing design taking into cognisance, areas of need.</p> <p>1.3              IMPORTANCE AND SPECIFICATION OF THE PROJECT</p> <p>The importance attached to the design of the spin dryers is to achieve a fast spinning and drying system for drying of spent grains.</p> <p>The machine is design in such a way that it does not require squeezing presses to demoisture the spent grains in the perforated spin tub/basket rather works on the theory  of centrifugal motion where the spent grains are spin in the machine away from the centres of rotation at high  velocity rate, squeezing the water out.</p> <p>This machine is design to remove excess water from spent grains in minutes (it spin almost at a rate of 145orpm) by spinning twice the capacity of a normal dryer. It is designed to have a longer life span and efficient in its operation. It is  driven by a 4kw (5h.p) motor, as the motor is spinning the basket, the moisture content is drain to the drum. The drum encloses the basket which is covered to prevent the moisture content from splashing. Also a mesh is also provided in the spinning tub to prevent escape of spent grains during spinning.</p> </div>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A SPIN DRYER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button

other.  Ranging from not being contented with the moisture, the relative humidity of the air and its cleanliness.</p> <p>These air problems can cause a lot of discomfort especially in the places of work, which consequently reduces the working efficiency of an individual.</p> <p>Thee problems of air led the engineers and scientist to look into methods of bringing comfort to people, which gave birth to the invention of air condition.  Air condition suck in air in the room and purify it, and then heat and cool and supply them back to the room by the process of heating, cooling, humidifying, dehumidifying, filtering, cleaning, distribution through the help of a blower in the air condition.</p> <p>It has been in operation for a long time but most users prefer new modern air conditioner due to the modern technology introduced in it. Today pure air purification can be made possibly by the use of air conditioner.</p> <p><strong>1.2     HISTORY OF REFRIGERATING MACHINE</strong></p> <p>Air conditioning can about as a result of water soaked mat that were hung across window and doors to produce cooling system by evaporation during hot dry weather.</p> <p><strong>WILLIAM THOMPSOM, </strong>who later became <strong>LORD KELVIN, </strong>contributed immensely to the development of refrigeration, some of his other works included the absolute temperature scale, the law of conservation of energy etc.  However, it w as <strong>WILLIS CARRIER </strong>who conducted the research which when published in 1911, gave the foundation on which to days air conditioner was built.</p> <p>In the early stage of its invention, air conditioner was a hazard because of the explosive or poisonous nature of the refrigerants in use then.  It was in 1928 that suitable refrigerants were discovered and used for more effective air conditioning.  This led to a high increase in demand and expansion in air conditioning equipments.</p> <p><strong>1.3     SIGNIFICANCE OF

<p>          Propeller agitator is a specialized of various types of substances.  It consists of three basic components which are the shaft, blade and the vessel.</p> <p>          In the construction,

produced industrially.  The estimated rate of rotation is 1720 rpm.</p> <p>          The cost of construction of the agitator is however minimized due to the preferred choice of the raw material and method of fabrication.</p> <div> CHAPTER ONE  <p><strong>1.0     INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>          Propeller agitator mixing is one of the most common operations carried out in chemical, processing and allied industries.  The terms “mixing” is applied to the processes used to reduce the degree of non uniformity or gradual of a property in a system such as concentration, viscosity, temperature and so on.</p> <p>          Mixing is achieved by moving material from one region to  another. It may be of interests simply as a means of achieving a desired degree of homogeneity or it may be used two proote heat undergoing a chemical reaction.</p> <p>          At the outset I t is useful to consider some common examples of problems encountered in industrial mixing operations, since this will nto only reveal the ubiquitous nature of the process but will also provide an appreciation of some of the associated.  Difficulties.  Several attempts have been made to classify mixing problems, and for example “REAVELL” used as a criterion for mixing of powders, the flowability of the final products, HARNEY et al based their classification on the phases present, that is liquid – liquid, solid – liquid and so on.  This is probably the most useful description of mixing as it allows the adoption of a unified approach to the problems encountered in a range of industries.</p> <p>          The term agitation is applied to a variety of operations differing in the degree of homogeneity of the mixed material.  In chemical engineering, it is conventional to treat agitation and multi purpose operations for which the principles of equipment design and operation can be stated generally, such operations in agitation like crystallization, Ion exchange and colliding are advanced of this study and construction.</p> <p>          In most homes, industries and chemical operations, two or more substances are required to be mixed for users demand, in mixing as a unit operation, the substance is fed into the vessel or mixing tank containing the agitator in either one form, liquid, solid or gas.  The product obtained should either be homogenous or heterogeneous depending on demand or desired product.</p> <p>          The selection of a particular agitator for a particular purpose requirement, the flow properties of the process fluid, equipment cost and the construction material required must be considered.  Ideally, the equipment chosen should be that which has the lowest cost but meets all process requirement.  In a given problem, the agitator given must handle the material when it is in it’s worst condition and may not be so effective as other design during other parts of mixing cycle.  As with other equipments, the choice of an agitator for heavy material is always a compromise and arbitrary.</p> <p>          Liquids are agitated for a number of purpose, depending on the objective of the processing step, soe of the purpose includes</p> <p>1.                 Promoting heat transfer between the liquid and a coil or jacket</p> <p>2.                 Blending immiscible liquids, for example, methyl alcohol and water.</p> <p>3.                 Dispensing a second liquid, immiscible wt h the first to form an emulsion or suspension of fine drops</p> <p>4.                 Suspending solid particles</p> <p>5.                 Dispersing a gas through the liquid in the form of small bubbles.</p> <p>A typical application of propeller agitator is in mixing of high viscosity liquids or solid in solids.  Most factories produce and products using blended liquids like in the confectionery industries, liquids food drinks like canned juices as well as canned and bottled drinks.</p> <p>Many a times, one agitator serves several purposes at the same time, as in the catalytic hydrogenation of a liquid, in a hydrogenation vessel, the hydrogen gas is dispersed through the liquid in which solid particles of catalyst are suspended, with the heat of reaction simultaneously removed by a cooling coil or jacket.</p> <p><strong>1.1     OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>          The objective of the project is to construct a portable propeller agitator with high efficiency and durability, which will be used for good mixing operation in smalls scale industries or in the laboratories and other applications such as domestic and pharmaceutical industries.</p> <p>          The preferred choice of raw material of the construction is mild steel because of it’s excellent properties which included high resistance to corrosion, machineability, ductility, malleability, it resistance to react with the material or reactant when agitating as any reaction between the vessel and the material to be mixed will affect the product.  Moreover, it is cheap and available.</p> <p>          The dimensions of the propeller agitator are length of handle = 320mm, diameter of gear teeth = 100mm, thickness of shaft = 20mm, thickness of gear = 12mm, size of blade = 50mm x 100mm, blade diameter = 63mm, inside diameter of pump = 12mm outside diameter of pump = 20mm, shaft height = 470mm, vessel diameter = 340mm and vessel height = 560mm.</p> </div>\n\nA PROJECT ON CONSTRUCTION OF PROPELLER AGITATOR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\"

hotel, public centers, Agriculture lands etc. was done by machete or cutlass. This method of manual cutting not only was laborious but also time consuming as it is human effort that is entirely needed both for cutting and motion. There was also inaccuracy in cutting level of the each inaccuracy in cutting level of the each individual as many factors will influence the late, speed h, height of cut of each individual.</p> <p>          Apart from all these cumbersional old method of cutting there is also risk of accident. As one can easily get cut with his or her machete/cutlass. Also there is need for mechanization since the world is going modernization bearing all these problems in mined trying to fine a solution to it, we decided to embark on this project. This project can be used for cutting of grass. And all the problems of the manual cutting was meant to be overcome.</p> <p>          Therefore  this lawn mower is used for cutting grass to equal length ( though you can adjust to level of cut) for speed cutting, it is also lies accident fine as well, it has a reduced labour as it is an on</p> <p>1 –c engine that does the accurate cutting, While the pusher provides the effort/motion.</p> <p>          Again to encourage farming among the farmers and those that are finding it difficult in handling the cutlass, this project was embarked to help. As it can be used clearing bush. Beside it is also used for cutting sports field (like football pitch) as well as cowns in hotels and business premises. So this project reduces human effort and should be encouraged in schools, hotels business area etc. although mower can be of electric type too. But we decided to fabricate a mechanical. type to overcome the problems of electricity. And as such, this our lawn mower can be used every where even where there is no electricity.</p> <p><strong>1.1            </strong><strong>      IDENTIFICATION OF NEEED</strong></p> <p>          Early before now, West Africa as a whole, the present farmer depends on the hoe and cutlass for practically all farm operation. There tools vary in shape and size from place to place. In the high forest zone of Nigeria the small farmers must clear thick bush done either hoe or cutlass for weeding the farmland</p> <p>These farm operate depends entirely on the energy using the tools which he has at this disposal. This inability that facing the farmer, has triggered these project group to research into the lasting solution to this problems.</p> <p>Also (mechanical lawn mower) these problems of high payment of local labour can be brought to minimum. The production of their machines in Nigeria and lead to reduction of importation cost from Germany USA of this machine to Nigeria with high profitable to the farmers.</p> <p><strong>1.2     LITRATURE REVIEW</strong>. </p> <p><strong>1.3     HISDTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT (SCOP)</strong></p> <p> Based on the development countries, Technology in farm operate is highly increased. It is clear that developments in farm machinery in West Africa started for back 1960. This project must related to the social and ecological conditions prevailing in different parts of this grate region. At the present time two trends are apparent</p><p> (i)                Increase in use of tractors and large agricultural machinery on farms of large extent both in the high forest and savanna zones, but particularly in the later. </p> <p>(ii)             The increase of annual power and small machine on peasant farms, farm operates in west Africa will become increasingly machinated, and that stage of mechanization which lies on the tractor and combine harvester on the other is refereed to as intermediate technology.</p> <p><strong>1.4         </strong><strong>IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT TO SOCEITY</strong></p> <p>Generally, this project (mechanical low mower) has a great effect towards development and maintenance of any community in the societies, which one mounted below.</p> <p>1.              Cutting grass of secondary, primary and tertiary field thereby reducing human effort made.</p> <p>2.              Great portion of farmland can cut or brushed with and of lawn mower in one day.</p> <p>3.              This project reduced number of personal that need in a particular farm operate.</p> <p>4.              Improved food production in the society</p> <p>5.              To reduce manpower</p> <p>6.              To improve economy of any country</p> <p>7.              Provision of foreign Exchange in the countries</p> <p>8.              To reduce exportation cost to our country</p> <p>9.              To encourage pupils, and students to be regular and the school, because no ore cutting of grass with cutlass by pupils or student.</p> <p><strong>1.5         </strong><strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p><strong>1.5.1    </strong><strong>REDUCTION OF LABOUR COST</strong></p> <p>In application of lawn mower machines is any government field and farm land causes seriously reduction in number of labour needed in the maintenance of the, brushing and clearing of the grass, but with aid of  </p> <p><strong>1.6         </strong><strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>In the past several investigation were made in lawn industry At USA, Germany etc exported to Nigerian market, from which this production is a development of already existing ones, it was localized to smite our environment conditions.

And have something to do with the <strong>ALTERNATOR</strong>.</p> <p>            Here, we make use of a D.C .Motor (direct current motor), and it has two terminals. This D.C.Motor, have the capacity to generate 12volts and be use for practical alternating current. Alternating current is a voltage of like said 220volts - 240volts.  All this simple generator generally known as “I better pass my neighbor” can be use for this practical engineering experiment.</p> <p>            What we have here is what we refer as a stator winding (i.e the generator coil). The stator winding have a three various outputs, it have the A.C. output, which the red wire gives us the positive, and the black wire gives us the negative. The capacitor wire, which can be any color, usually yellow in most generator and the diode wire, also can be any color but usually green in most generator.</p> <p>            If you don’t connect this winding to our capacitor, we wouldn’t be able to have our 220V- 240V. the green wire serve as the charging system and  is going to be connected to our 12V battery. The voltage of the battery(12V) must tally with the capacity of the D.C.Motor (12V, for tiger generator) you are using. The green wire can be connected to our Diode. Then from the diode, you supply current directly back to the battery. The car battery can be 12Volts 45AMPERE, 60 AMPERE, 75AMP or 100 AMP or 120 AMP. Just note that the ampere is the strength of the battery and the amount of current it can produce and regulate. Make sure that the battery capacity tallies with that of the D.C.Motor.</p> <p>            We have what we know as ARMATURE, some people call it rotor and a lot of road side electricians call it AMURTURE. This armature from the supply of the D.C. Motor to the stator winding, immediately you pass current to the armature, there will be an interaction between the field (magnetic field) that have been created in the stator winding and the armature. The armature will be rotating inside the stator winding, a magnetic field will be created between the stator winding coil and the coil of the armature, thereby bring out energy. The energy can come in form of Direct Current, or can come in form of Alternating current, it all depends on the capacity of the alternator.</p> <p>            Now, what we usually use in Nigeria, is a system of Alternating current, which is from 220V to 240V and if we are able to produce a D.C with the combination of the alternator, it gives us an alternator and it gives us a result of 220V to 240V, that means the area of using fuel, will be off completely, because the battery will serve as our fuel.</p> <p>           We also have a crank shaft cut off. We decided to cut off one side of the shaft of crank shaft of pestle and rings, so that we can drill a hole in it, which goes directly to the D.C. motor and it connects the alternator. So, that gives us the combination of D.C. Motor and alternator.</p> <p><strong> 1.2. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>In this country, Nigeria, just like most developing countries in the world, we are faced with the challenges of light disruption. Continuous spending on fuelling and maintenance of our fuel generator, but now lets look at another alternative. Converting a fuelled generator into a fuel less generator and it has a low maintenance cost.</p> <p><strong>1.3. OBJECTIVE OF THE SEMINAR</strong></p> <p>The aim of this project is to design and manufacture a fuel less generator, capable of producing 2 – 3 KW of electrical energy/ power. The objectives are:</p> <p>a)     To design and manufacture of 3KVA fuel less generator.</p> <p>b)    To evaluate the generator for performance.</p> <p>c)     To explore an alternative which is affordable, convenient and efficient, just like our normal electricity. Here we will learn how to convert a fuel generator to a fuel less generator.</p> <p><strong>1.4. SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Why is this study necessary?</p> <p>          This study, on how to convert a fuel generator to fuel less generator, Is becoming more necessary because, as long as the price of fuel is high and the Power Holdings Company of Nigeria (P.H.C.N) keep disappointing, it is recommended that one should fall back on this technology of Personal Electricity Generator (P.E.G).</p> <p>          One can use this fuel less generator to be charging car batteries and as well as using it to generate electricity for his shops, flats or rooms, thereby making money in the process.</p> <p>          The need to use in the school environment, like office, labs or even in the classrooms, as case maybe. Also, in tertiary institutions is also included.</p> <p>          This fuel less generator can be used to power  and sustain a constant or stable electricity /current in a clinic, hospitals or even a maternity. Knowing full well that it can power and supply a stady current for more than 24 hours without a stop.</p> <p>          Shops / stalls owners can have this fuel less generator to attract more customers, by having steady power to make the customer feel comfortable.</p> <p>Who will benefit?</p> <p>           This fuel less generator is beneficial to everyone both for the young or for the old. A family, travelling to the village or to a camp or even a vacation, can decide to carry one of this fuel less generator along to avoid disappointment by PHCN, or better still, get one of this fuel less generator  for their parents or grand parents. This generator is easy to operate and cheap to maintain.</p> <p>          An average Nigerian doing one business or the other can get one this generator, even if it the small tiger one and he or she can be sure of constant and stable light throughout the day and night.</p> <p>          Bar owners will have no cause to frawn their faces on the high cost of petrol and the constant disappointment from PHCN, because with a medium or big fuel less generator, he/she will have a noiseless and smokeless generator and constant supply of electricity to boost his business.</p> <p>          Finally, the posed danger of a fuel generator as smoke (as air pollution) can cause lung disease, then Noise, which irritate both the owner and their neighbors and finally the High Price of fuel can all be avoided if one get one of these fuel less generator.</p>\n\nDESIGN AND MANUFACTURE A FUEL LESS GENERATOR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE A FUEL LESS GENERATOR", "id": 28}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This project is focused on experimental analysis of impact of water jet on vanes. This work intends to predict the output of a pelton wheel, and to determine its optimum rotational speed. Hence this work explains how the deflection of the jet generates a force on the buckets, and how the force is related to the rate of momentum flow in the jet. In this experiment, we measure the force generated by a jet of water striking a flat plate or a hemispherical cup, and compare the results with the computed momentum flow rate in the jet.  The experiment is shown in the arrangement, in which water supplied from the Hydraulic Bench is fed to a vertical pipe terminating in a tapered nozzle. This produces a jet of water which impinges on a vane, in the form of a flat plate or a hemispherical cup</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1  </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>Over the years, engineers have found many ways to utilize the impact force of fluids. For example, the Pelton wheel has been used to make flour. Further, the impulse turbine. Firemen make use of the kinetic energy stored in a jet to extinguish fires in high-rise buildings. Many other applications of fluid jets can be cited which reveals their technological importance. This experiment is designed to study the force that can be impacted by a jet of fluid on a surface diverting the flow (Khurmi, 2010).</p> <p>The history of the equipment “impact of jet apparatus” is traced back to the 19thcentury. The apparatus is used to demonstrate the way a certain type of water turbine, the pelton wheel can extract water from a fast jet of water, which is similar to the way in which a space craft increases or decreases its kinetic energy by swinging around a moving plant.  Nevertheless, water turbines are used to generate power like in pelton wheel produced by an American engineer Lester A Pelton. Engineer Lester Pelton was born in the year 1892 in Vermilion Ohio on the shores of Lake Erie. The invention came about when water was an under used resource and before electricity was economically practical as a motive power. The first turbine built by pelton was in Campton Ville. In Campton Ville, by the time search for gold progressed, which required power to drive stamp mills that crush the ore and pump air into mine turnnels and later to provide electricity and compressed air. Some mines used steam engines but these required a large and constant supply of fire wood. Therefore, instead of the slow water wheel traditionally used by flour mills which needed only a moderate height but used a large quantity of water, even mine owners installed turbine wheels with cups around their circumference with a fast jet of water coming from a reservoir high up (Moth, 2009).</p> <p>Pelton invention started from an accidental observation when he was watching a spinning water turbine when the key holding its wheel onto its shaft slipped causing it to be misaligned. Instead of the jet hitting the wheel at the middle, the slip made it hit near the edge thus causing the wheel to spin faster. It is known that the Pelton wheel is suitable for conditions which require a 100m head of water and a flow rate which could be used to develop about 900kW of power. Over 40 years ago, the concept of performing simple experiments in hydraulics on hydraulic bench was first introduced in the University of Notingham, since then, hydraulic bench has been in use to conduct experiments with the impact of jet apparatus.</p> <p>Moreover, there is need to understand how the deflection of a jet generates a force on the buckets and also to know how the force is related to the rate of change of momentum in the jet before a prediction could be made on the use of Pelton wheel (Orga and Ujam, 2005).</p> <p><strong>1.2  </strong><strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The aim of this project is to investigate the impact of jet apparatus. Hence, the objectives are as follows;</p> <p>1. To experiment, demonstrate and verify the integral momentum equation. The force generated by a jet of water deflected by an impact surface is measured.</p> <p>2. To study the relation between the force produced and the change of momentum when a jet strikes a vane and compare between force exerted by a jet on a flat plate and hemispherical surface.</p> <p>3. To examine the momentum transfer (<em>ergo,</em> force transmitted) from a fluid to object of various forms. In particular, the study looks at the momentum transfer as a function of the angle through which the fluid stream was deflected. By varying a fluid stream’s deflection angle, up to twice the original momentum of the stream can be transferred to the object.</p> <p>4. To demonstrate the applicability of Newton’s law of motion to a fluid, to investigative the effect of a jet flow on different shaped targets, comparing the theoretical predictions with actual measurements.</p> <p><strong>1.3 IMPORTANCE OF IMPACT OF JET APPARATUS</strong></p> <p>Impact of jet apparatus is used in the laboratory to demonstrate the way in which fluid force is being used to generate a force that can turn a turbine; that is converting the kinetic energy in a flowing fluid from  a nozzle to a rotary motion of the turbine with the help of vanes fitted o shaft of the turbine.</p> <p>The jet is directed to vane of turbine wheel that is rotated by the force generates due to change of momentum of the fluid according to Newton’s second law of motion.</p> <p>The principle is used in designing impulse turbine; part of the fluid energy is transformed to kinetic energy in a nozzle that issues a jet of fluid at high speed. Impulse turbine have been constructed to generate power up to 100-mega watt or more with efficiencies greater than 85%.</p> <p>In the impact of jet apparatus, a jet of water issuing from a nozzle strikes a target. The force generated equals the rate of change of the linear momentum particulars from the jet.</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF JET APPARATUS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF JET APPARATUS", "id": 29}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Metal Matrix Composites (MMC’s) have evoked a keen interest in recent times for potential applications. Composite materials like Particle-reinforced Aluminium Silicon carbide (Al/SiC) Metal-Matrix Composite is gradually becoming very important materials in manufacturing industries e.g. aerospace, automotive and automobile industries due to their superior properties such as light weight, low density, high strength to weight ratio, high hardness, high temperature and thermal shock resistance, superior wear and corrosive resistance, high specific modulus, high fatigue strength etc. In this study, Connecting rods made from commercial pure aluminum alloy (about 99.1% purity) / Silicon carbide (SiC) reinforced particles metal-matrix composites (MMCs) are fabricated by green sand casting. The MMCs connecting rods (Big end ø 68 mm, pin end ø 32 mm, 136 mm Center to Center height) are prepared by varying the reinforced particles by weight fraction ranging from 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%  and 20 %. The average reinforced particles size of SiC are 75 microns (µm), 125 microns (µm) and 300 microns (µm) respectively. The microstructure and mechanical properties like Ultimate tensile strength (MPa), Breaking strength (MPa), Elastic Modulus (Mpa), % Elongation, Hardness (HRB), are investigated on prepared specimens of MMCs. It was observed that the hardness of the composite is increased with increasing of reinforced particle weight fraction. The tensile strength is increased with rising of reinforced weight fraction. Different mechanical tests were conducted and presented by varying the particle size and weight fractions of the Silicon carbide (SiC) particulates.</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>A composite is considered to be any multiphase material that exhibits a significant proportion of the properties of both constituent phases such that a better combination of properties is realized. This is termed as the ‘principle of combined action’ (2). According to this principle, better combinations are fashioned by the judicious combination of two or more distinct materials. All composites generally have one thing in common: a matrix or binder combined with a reinforcing material, within which is a dispersion of one or more phases of another material.</p> <p>Metal matrix composites, as we know today have evolved significantly during the past few years. The primary support of the composites has come from the aerospace industry for airframe and spacecraft structures. More recently the automotive, electronics and recreation industries have been working diligently with these composites. The driving force behind the development of most of the existing composites has been their capability to be designed to provide needed types of material behaviour.</p> <p>The focus of research and development in the metal matrix composites (MMCs) area has recently shifted toward low-cost discontinuously reinforced composites which are targeted for automotive and aerospace applications. The optimum properties of MMCs and the enhanced performance from these materials however depend on the judicious selection of the metallic matrix material, reinforcing phase and the processing technique. The composite fabrication technique is an important consideration. For a given set of constituents, the fundamental link between properties and cost is determined by the fabrication method. Processing in general, is concerned with the introduction of reinforcement into the matrix with a uniform distribution. The major hurdle is the achievement of proper bonding between the matrix and the reinforcement in order to attain good load transfer between phases.</p> <p>A wide variety of fabrication techniques have been explored for metal matrix composites. These include liquid phase methods, deposition of matrix from a semi solid or vapour phase, and solid state consolidation. Liquid phase processing has attractive economic aspects. Chopped fibres, porous ceramics compacts and particulates have been incorporated into matrix alloys. In some cases, pressure assistance has been used to infiltrate the reinforcement with the molten matrix. These methods result in microstructures dictated by the solidification of the molten metal. The green sand casting technique has been among the simplest and the most economical processes of fabricating the particulate metal matrix composites. However due to poor wetting of the ceramic particles by molten alloy, the introduction and uniform dispersion of the reinforcement into the liquid matrix is difficult.</p>\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF AN ALUMINIUM OR SILICON CARBIDE COMPOSITE CONNECTING ROD CONTAINING VARYING VOLUME FRACTIONS OF SIC<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF AN ALUMINIUM OR SILICON CARBIDE COMPOSITE CONNECTING ROD CONTAINING VARYING VOLUME FRACTIONS OF SIC", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Steel is arguably the world’s most ‘advanced” material. It is a very versatile material with a wide range of attractive properties which can be produced at a very competitive cost. It has a diverse range of applications, and is second only to concrete in its annual production tonnage. Steel is not a new invention which leads to a common misperception that “everything is known about steel” amongst those outside its field. Steel is generally defined as a ferrous alloy containing less than 2.0wt%C. The complexity of steel arises with the introduction of further alloying elements into the iron-carbon alloy system. The optimization of alloying content in the iron-carbon system, combined with different mechanical and heat treatment leads to immense opportunities for parameter variations and these are continuously been developed.</p> <p>Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon and it is initially cast into a malleable form, and it can be changed in shape by forging, rolling or other mechanical processes. The difference between steel and cast iron is that steel do not contain graphite or free carbon. Carbon exists in small quantity in ferrite and majority in cementite. There are different types of steel but we are to deal majorly on mild steel.</p>\n\nEFFECT OF WELDING CONSUMABLES ON THE MICROSTRUCTURE AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF A WELDED SA 530 GR 70 STEEL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF WELDING CONSUMABLES ON THE MICROSTRUCTURE AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF A WELDED SA 530 GR 70 STEEL", "id": 31}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The rapid development in the automobile and aircraft industries requires among other things, the integration of unique materials for design purposes that reduce fuel consumption to preserve the dwindling hydrocarbon resources without compromising other attributes such as safety, performance, recyclability and cost. Similarly, the current trend of materials in car industry is towards replacing metal parts more and more by these unique materials in order to improve the fuel economy and reduce the weight of the vehicles. These categories of unique materials include composite materials which are widely used in aerospace, automotive, electronics and medical industries. Composites are materials in which the desirable properties of separate materials are combined by mechanically or metallurgically binding them together. Each of the components retains its structure and characteristic, but the composite generally possesses better properties. Composite materials offer superior properties to conventional alloys for various applications as they have high strength, low weight, high modulus, low ductility, high wear resistance, high thermal conductivity and low thermal expansion.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF WEIGHT PERCENTAGE OF SILICON CARBIDE ON MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF ALUMINUM METAL MATRIX COMPOSITE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF WEIGHT PERCENTAGE OF SILICON CARBIDE ON MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF ALUMINUM METAL MATRIX COMPOSITE", "id": 32}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>In this project (3) alternative design solutions were considered for the locally made electric run.

The popcorn-making machine in constructed with locally made materials at a reduced cost. The design, construction and fabrication of the machine i.e. not in any known text at the moment, the project group therefore faced design, construction and fabrication problem. </p> <p><strong>1.2     DESIGN CONSTRUCTION AND FABRICATION PROBLEM </strong></p> <p>The problems associated with the design of the machine are discussed below. </p> <p>1.                 <strong>Selection of Electric Motor:</strong> In the market, there are various types of motor with varying speed of rotation per minute. The automated popcorn machine has a striver which turns the corn inside the cast opts as heating on. The striver, which rotates due to the rod connected to it from the motor, should rotate with a low speed to produce the desired effect. In our research, we were able to discover that only a low speed motor could give the desired turning effect. </p> <p>2.                 <strong>Heating Element:</strong> Another problem in the choice of heating element. There are various kinds of heating elements available in the market ranging from 850- 1500watts. The elements come in different shapes, sizes, and makes e.g. spring type, ring type and plate type.</p> <p>3.                 <strong>Third Design Problem is Control and Safety:</strong> In the system we discovered that there is the need for the finance circuit to control the operation of the electrical popcorn machine. </p> <p>4.                 <strong>Construction and Fabrication of the Housing for the Machine: </strong>This is fourth problem, which involves the use of per pex holler rectangular aluminum bars in profile glasses and metal handle. With respect to safety. The machine was made to be safer for the users by incorporating the user of insulator in the design.  </p> <p><strong>1.3     OBJECTIVE OF THE DESIGN </strong></p> <p>1.                 To eliminate the use of manual popcorn machine. </p> <p>2.                 To save time and manpower as most of the work in now done by using electricity. </p> <p>3.                 To achieve mass production. </p> <p>4.                 To use electrical energy in the production of popcorn.</p> <p>5.                 To produce popcorn at a reduced cost. </p> <p><strong>1.4            </strong><strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION </strong></p> <p>This project covers design, construction fabrication and operation of the electrical operated popcorn producing machine. </p> <p><strong>1.5            </strong><strong>IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>The project will serve as a means of employment to mechanical engineering graduates when properly carried out. some government can longer guarantee her citizens already made employment. The present economic situation in this country calls for self-reliance. The young technological engineer can embark on the production of the electrical operated popcorn-producing machine on low scale and when buoyant enough can embark on large-scale production. This project serves as a medium of enriching our knowledge of designs and constructions techniques, since it embraces practical and research operation. Thirdly, it will provide employment for the fulltime unemployment house covers. Young men and women who have attended the age of gainful employment from the government. Thus included graduates, young school leavers etc . This will provide means of revenue and livelihood, thereby helping to correct societal ills that is prevail our society. </p> <p>Finally, this project is also relevant to the technology advancement of the nation.

Four plates of dimension 165mm x 80mm x10mm were cast using sand mould. Steel, copper and brass chills in form of cylindrical bar of geometry 7mm in diameter and 50mm long were inserted, side by side at regular intervals of 30mm in each sand mould and the last sample was left unchilled. Experimentation involved testing of mechanical properties and metallographic analysis of cast samples. The results obtained revealed that the sample chilled with copper has the highest mechanical properties (ultimate tensile strength of 126.13MPa, hardness of 6.8Hv and impact strength of 23.5J).Also sample chilled with copper revealed evenly distributed microstructure which is due to the fast solidification rate of the casting due to the high thermal conductivity of copper. The brass chill sample displayed better mechanical properties (ultimate tensile strength of 115.8MPa, hardness of 5.7Hv and impact strength of 22.4J) than sample chilled with steel (ultimate tensile strength of 101.33MPa and hardness of 5.4Hv). However, the unchilled sample showed the lowest ultimate tensile strength of 70.67MPa, hardness of 4.2Hv and impact strength of 22.5J.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0</strong>                                                                         <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1 Background to the study</strong></div> <div>Metal casting is a shape forming process whereby molten metal is poured into a prepared mould and allowed to solidify such that the shape of the solidified object is determined by the shape of the mould cavity. Sand casting is a metal casting process characterized by using sand as the mould material (Ibhadode, 2001). Casting can be broadly divided into two main categories as expendable and nonexpendable mould casting. It can also be classified according to the mould material used to cast the metal such as sand casting, ceramic casting or metal mould casting and depending on the pouring methods as gravity casting, low pressure die casting and high pressure die casting (Navaneeth, 2009).</div> <div>Good mechanical properties are achieved in sand casting with the help of metallic insert in the mould known as chill (Mehr, 2012). Strong directional solidification is difficult to obtain in casting of intricate part made of aluminum alloys without the use of chills. The tendency for solidification to start throughout the metal makes proper feeding difficult. Chills must often be used to obtain satisfactory directional solidification (Chi-Yuan <em>et al.,</em> 2006).</div> <div>Chills are metallic inserts moulded into the sand surface to promote high solidification rate in metal casting. Normally the metal in the mould cools at a certain rate relative to thickness of the casting. When the geometry of the moulding cavity prevents directional solidification from occurring naturally, a chill can be strategically placed to help promote it to obtain good mechanical properties. Chills are of two types, internal and external chills.</div>\n\nPERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS AS CHILLS IN SAND CASTING OF ALUMINIUM ALLOY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS AS CHILLS IN SAND CASTING OF ALUMINIUM ALLOY", "id": 40}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>The performance of the oils selected in this work was tested for considering Viscosity, Viscosity Index, Density, Flash Point, Pour Point, and Carbon Residue. The most important of all the properties which makes the oil protect against wear is viscosity that helps to reduce friction between moving parts in the engine. The Viscosities of the oils; Oando SAE 20W50, Total SAE 20W50, Mobil 1 SAE 0W40, Total SAE 40, and AZ SAE 20W50 at 24.8°C (room temperature) and 100°C (maximum test temperature) are 290 cSt and 18 cSt, 290.5 cSt and 20 cSt, 286.4 cSt and 21.20 cSt, 295.2 cSt and 15.60 cSt, 296.8 cSt and 19.60 cSt respectively. This implies that the Mobil 1 is most preferred as it has the least change in viscosity with respect to change in temperature and Total SAE40, a monograde oil as the least preferred as it has highest change in viscosity with respect to change in temperature when high temperature is expected in the service environment. The pour points of the oils are -240C, -22 0C, -280C, -150C, and -220C respectively. Based on this, all the oils are suitable for use in internal combustion engine in Nigeria and Africa. However, in an environment where very low temperature is expected during winter, the Mobil 1 (synthetic Oil) is most preferred and the monograde Oil is not suitable as the flowability may not be good enough at engine start up. The flash point of the Oils is 175 0C, 160 0C, 160 0C, 102 0C, and 170 0C respectively. These Oils are suitable for use in internal combustion engine as all the flash points are above the expected temperatures (0C) during a normal working condition. The carbon residue found in the Oils was 0.95 %, 0.90 %, 0.60 %, 1.00 %, and 0.95 % respectively. The Synthetic Oil has the lowest carbon residue and the monagrade Oil has the highest carbon residue, and so the synthetic Oil is most preferred based on carbon residue result since high amount of carbon residue is a disadvantage. In all the results of laboratory test, all the Oils were seen to be suitable in internal combustion engine with the most preferred Oil as the synthetic followed by the multigrade and the least performing oil is the monograde. To carry out Pressure Mapping Experiment in this work, a pressure mapping equipment was developed. An Internal Combustion Engine, Thermocouple, Tachometer and Pressure Tube were obtained from the market and integrate together to function as desired based on the theoretical background of pressure mapping. The pressure mapping experiment is a fast method of measuring the performance of the lubricating Oil by mapping the pressure of the Oils in an internal combustion engine. This Oil pressure mapping is recommended for the evaluation of the performance properties of the Oils in our local market.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0</strong>                                                                         <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>Preamble</strong></div> <div>From time immemorial, liquids, including water, have been used as lubricants to reduce</div> <div>friction and wear and remove heat between two surfaces in contact. At present, lubricating oil also called lube oil is the most commonly used lubricant because it has found a wide range of application in the field of engineering.</div> <div>A lubricant, sometimes called lube, is a substance (often a liquid) which is introduced between two surfaces in contact moving relative to each order to keep them separate under all loads, temperatures and speed thus minimizing friction and wear. The substance may act as cooling fluid removing heat from the system and also protect surfaces from the attack of aggressive products formed during the operation. Lubricants may also perform the function of dissolving and transporting foreign particles (http://www.Weareoil</div> <div>.com/technical_properties_of_lubricant.htm)</div> <div>Majorly, there are solid and liquid lubricants. Air and other gas based lubricants are there, but for the purpose of this research work, consideration is limited to liquid lubricants. Examples of liquid lubricants are: mineral oils, vegetable oils and synthetic oils.</div> <div>The most common liquid lubricants are the mineral oils. This is because of the supply of crude oil.

The lowest score (critical value) of 40% is an indication that all aspects considered are relevant/important for this research work. This is also an indication that the findings flow in line with established theories and literatures. The hypotheses also show that majority of the tools have remarkable relationship with UEP implementation success.

Combined with choices available to the consumer and expectation of shorter order fulfillment lead times, customers have become more fickle in their purchasing decisions and less loyal to their old long-standing business relationships.</div> <div>In recent years, companies have become increasingly focused on market demand and customers responsiveness. This has led to the implementation and adoption of manufacturing improvement and optimization techniques in the automotive industry. Optimization is necessary for the control of any business process to achieve better product quality, high productivity with low cost.</div> <div>Optimization is defined as minimization or maximization of cost function with variable input parameters. The word optimization commonly refers to the mathematical handling of parameters in order to maximize or minimize a mathematical function. The global optimization is about finding the best possible solutions for given problems. This makes optimization of various systems an increasingly important activity. Apart from this, manufacturing systems are also optimized using any of the process improvement methods. Improvement methods such as lean, just in time, six sigma and the likes, have contributed immensely to system success and profitability.</div> <div>In order to optimize the manufacturing process, a company has to have the ability to identify its main bottlenecks in manufacturing process. It needs to be able to set the proper goals, i.e. grouping company‟s activities into modules and set the control points.</div>\n\nMANUFACTURING SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION: A STUDY OF UNITY AND EFFICIENCY IN PRODUCTION (UEP) IN PEUGEOT AUTOMOBILE NIGERIA (PAN)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MANUFACTURING SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION: A STUDY OF UNITY AND EFFICIENCY IN PRODUCTION (UEP) IN PEUGEOT AUTOMOBILE NIGERIA (PAN)", "id": 42}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>The study examined the effects of faulty design and construction on the maintenance of building. A survey of randomly selected samples of 20 builders and 15 architects were conducted. Questionnaires were used to collect data from Architects and Builders. The survey included 11 groups of defects and sub defects in each groups. The predominant severity effects of each defects was assessed and ranked based on the severity index as ranked by both the Builders and the Architects. The results shows that 7 defects were rated as most severe, 54 as moderately severe and 6 defects as slightly severe defects. The results also show that increase in maintenance work is the most predominant effects on building maintenance among other factors of defect with an index value of 100.00 as perceived by both the rank of the Architects and that of the builders. The research however includes a hypothesis that Architects and Builders generally agree on the ranking of the severity defects which was tested and proven to be true. The study concluded that there should be a design review before finally approving the design for construction; maintenance expert should not be overlooked in the planning stage of the project and most importantly the employment of professionals for any building projects.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0              </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>Background of the Study</strong></div> <div>'To fail to plan is to plan to fail.'— (Wood, 2003)</div> <div>The essence of all result-oriented work may be identified in this quotation. In the context of design one can adapt this phrase to, 'if a designer fails to plan well the plan will turn out badly'. In understanding this phrase one can use a law of physics as a metaphor. Newton's third law of force is 'For every action there is a reaction'. For designers this law could be interpreted as 'for every design decision/consideration (action) there is a consequence (reaction)'. As such this research tries to explore the actions of design and the consequence of their actions.</div> <p>The relationship between design, construction and maintenance is closely related but not easily distinguished. (Maisarah, 2012) explained the vital role of design in the early stage of project management. They stated that a functional design can promote skill; economy, conveniences, and comforts while a non-functional design can impeded activities of all types of detract from quality of care, and raise cost to intolerable levels. A typical saying by Vonnegut: everybody want to build and nobody want to do maintenance. In Nigeria building design are copied from other countries without considering the conditions that lead to such design, hence maintenance experts are seldom included to advice on maintenance efficiency of such design. In a related development (Iyagba, 2005) reveal that there are substantial numbers of people who do not know the meaning of maintenance.</p>\n\nEFFECT OF FAULTY DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION ON BUILDING MAINTENANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF FAULTY DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION ON BUILDING MAINTENANCE", "id": 43}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This research centers on the design, development and testing of a motorized juice extractor fabricated using locally-available materials. The machine is made essentially of two basic compartments: the chopping compartment and the juice extracting compartment. Other components include feeding hoppers, top cover, auger conveyor housed in a cylindrical barrel, juice sieve, juice collector, waste outlet, transmission belt, main frame, pulleys and bearings. In operation, fruits introduced into the chopping compartment via the first hopper are chopped/sliced and passed into the extracting compartment via a second hopper. The auger conveys, crushes, presses and squeezes the fruits to extract the juice. The juice extracted is filtered through the juice sieve into juice collector while the residual waste is discharged through waste outlet. When tested for freshly harvested pineapple, ginger and orange fruits, results show that the average juice yield for pineapple, orange and ginger were respectively 74 %, 72 % and 34 %; juice extraction efficiencies were respectively 84 %, 80 % and 71 %; and juice extraction losses were respectively 18 %, 16 % and 9 % at optimum machine speed of 335 rpm for pineapple and oranges, and 476 rpm for ginger. Powered by a 3hp electric motor, the machine has a capacity to process 30 litres/hr of oranges, 32 litres/hr of pineapples and 24 litres/hr of ginger and the machine costs of about<strong>N</strong>54,600, hence it is affordable for small-scale farmers.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>Background of the Study</strong></div> <div>Before the discovery of crude oil in commercial quantity in the 1970s, agriculture was the mainstay and sustaining source of the Nigerian economy. The agricultural sector contributed immensely to the gross domestic product (GDP) of the nation. The discovery of oil and the boom that resulted from the exploitation of crude oil in the 70’s inflicted a big blow on the agricultural sector as all attention was shifted to oil, leading to the neglect of this vital sector (Fasanya <em>et al.,</em> 2013). Various programmes such as Operation Feed the Nation (OFN) of 1976 and the Green Revolution of 1979 were embarked upon to ensure that there is enough food for the ever-growing population of Nigeria. This agricultural potential was what Nigeria exploited in the pre-independence and the post-independence period prior to 1975, which gave it its leadership position internationally in the production and export of agricultural products (CBN, 2004). Well over 50 % of the country’s total export earnings came from the agricultural sector prior to the 1970s (CBN, 2004; Ndubisi <em>et al.,</em> 2013). Furthermore, the agricultural sector accounted for about 50 % of the GDP and employed about 72 % of the labour force on average between 1960 and 1970 (CBN, 2004; Fasanya <em>et</em> <em>al., </em>2013).</div> <div>In developed countries like the USA, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Great Britain etc., the productivity of the Agricultural sector is always on the increase. These achievements results from their high level of mechanization. </div>\n\nDESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF A FRUIT JUICE EXTRACTION MACHINE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF A FRUIT JUICE EXTRACTION MACHINE", "id": 44}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <p>Five coal samples from Odagbo (Kogi State), Owukpa (Benue State), Ezimo (Enugu State), Amansiodo (Enugu State) and Inyi (Enugu State) weresubjected to proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, calorific value determination, petrographic and thermogravimetric analysis to determine their suitability for power generation. Tests were carried out at the laboratories of Advanced Coal Technology, South Africa (now Bureau Veritas Testing and Inspections South Africa, BV-TISA) and the Institute of Applied Materials of the University of Pretoria. Based on analysis of results of tests carried out, Amansiodo coal is a bituminous, low sulphur and medium ash coal; while Owukpa coal is a sub-bituminous A, low sulphur, low ash coal rich in huminites. In addition, Odagbo coal is a sub-bituminous B, medium sulphur, low ash coal rich in huminites; Ezimo coal is a sub-bituminous C, low sulphur, high ash coal; while Inyi coal is a sub-bituminous C, low sulphur, high ash coal.Between Odagbo and Owukpa sub-bituminous coals, Owukpa has a lower ignition temperature (283.63oC) due to its higher volatile matter content (39.1%). However, Ezimo sub-bituminous coal, which has a lower volatile matter (31.1%) unexpectedly has the same ignition temperature as Owukpa (283.63oC) due to its higher liptinite content (7.2%) when compared with that of Owukpa (2.9%). The five (5) coal samples analysed can be used for power generation using circulating fluidised bed combustion (CFBC) technology due to its tolerance of a widevariety of coals and particle sizes. Amansiodo coal is suitable for power generation using pulverised coal combustion technology based on comparison of its gross calorific value (27.48MJ/kg), ash content (8.6%), inherent moisture content (5.4%), sulphur content (0.92%), etc with requirements published by coal-fired power plant operators. Gross calorific values, inherent moisture and contents of Odagbo, Owukpa, Ezimo and Inyi sub-bituminous coals make them largely suitable for pulverized coal combustion when compared with the coal fuel used for the Genessee Phase 3 power station in Canada. The ease of combustion of the coal samples in decreasing order is Odagbo, Owukpa, Inyi, Ezimo and Amansiodo. The ignition temperatures of the coals increase with decreasing volatile matter content, their calorific values are strongly correlated with the fixed carbon, elemental carbon, volatile matter and hydrogen contents in decreasing order.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1                   </strong><strong>Background of the Study</strong></div> <div>Access to energy, especially electricity, is a driving force for economic and social development (Sambo<em>et al.</em>, 2009). Energy is a key factor in industrial development and in providing vital services that improve the quality of life. Traditionally, energy has been regarded as the engine of economic progress. Limited access to energy is a serious constraint to development in the developing world, where the per capita use of energy is less than one sixth that of the industrialised world(IAEA, 2005).It is widelyaccepted that there is a strong correlation between socio-economic development and theavailability of energy.</div> <div>The electricity demand in Nigeria far outstrips the current epileptic supply. Nigeria is faced with acute electricity supply problems, which is hindering its development notwithstanding the availability of vast natural resources in the country (Sambo <em>et al.</em>, 2009). There are currently 23 grid-connected generating plants in operation in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) with a total installed capacity of 10,396.0 MW and available capacity of 6,056 MW. Most generation is thermal based, with an installed capacity of 8,457.6 MW (81% of the total) and an available capacity of 4,996 MW (48% of the total). Hydropower from three major plants accounts for 1,938.4 MW of total installed capacity and an available capacity of 1,060 MW (KPMG Nigeria, 2013). </div>\n\nCHARACTERISATION OF SOME NIGERIAN COALS FOR POWER GENERATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CHARACTERISATION OF SOME NIGERIAN COALS FOR POWER GENERATION", "id": 45}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>The physical presence of the oil industry in Nigeria is so large and has resulted in a lot of activities in the upstream sector which has deleterious effects on ecosystem stability and local biodiversity – which the peoples‘ livelihoods depend upon. This research provides an overview of environmental issues in the oil and gas industry in Nigeria with specific focus on oil spillage and also highlights the best approaches to achieving high environmental performance in the oil and gas industry in Nigeria. The materials for this research include the use of existing reports on the oil and gas industry in Nigeria to acquire the required information. Comparative study method was used in which the data obtained Nigerian National Petroleum Company Annual Statistical report for 2013 and Shell Nigeria Monthly/ Annual statistical Reports for 2013 was analysed and logical deductions and sequential presentation of facts were thus made. It was observed in this study that oil spills occur more as a result of vandalisation than rupture during operations. Shell Nigeria has a record of oil spill amounting to about 3.038 billion barrels over a period of ten years (2003 to 2012) from their pipelines alone. The number of incidences of oil spill recorded by Shell Nigeria reduced within the period of 2007 to 2013 from 320 to 200 respectively. Also, it was observed that since 2010 the volume of oil spill has dropped significantly from 102, 000 barrels of 2009 to 20,000 barrels in 2013. Furthermore, the regulatory bodies are not working effectively and some of the country‘s regulations are out of date. Hence, a need for the government to review the regulatory laws and device an efficient means of enforcing them whenever necessary.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>Background of the Study</strong></div> <div>The oil and gas industry is truly global, with operations conducted in every corner of the globe, from Alaska to Australia, from Peru to China, and in every habitat from Arctic to desert, from tropical rainforest to temperate woodland, from mangrove (as is the case in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria) to offshore. The global community will rely heavily on oil and gas supplies for the foreseeable future. World primary energy consumption in 1994 stood at nearly 8000 million tonnes of oil equivalents; oil and gas represented 63 per cent of world energy supply, with coal providing 27 per cent, nuclear energy 7 percent and hydro-electric 3 per cent (BP <em>Statistical</em> <em>Review of World Energy</em>, June 1995).</div> <div>The exploitation of oil and gas reserves has not always been without some ecological side effects. The challenge is to meet world energy demands, whilst minimizing adverse impact on the environment by conforming to current good practice. Oil spills, damaged land, accidents and fires, and incidents of air and water pollution have all been recorded at various times and places. In recent times the social impact of operations, especially in remote communities, has also attracted attention. The oil and gas industry has worked for a long time to meet the challenge of providing environmental protection. Much has already been achieved but the industry recognizes that even more can be accomplished (Adati, 2012).</div>\n\nASSESSMENT OF OIL SPILLAGE AND ITS CONTROL IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF OIL SPILLAGE AND ITS CONTROL IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IN NIGERIA", "id": 46}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>Abstract</strong></div> <div>A solar ovenis a device that converts solar energy into useful heat in a confined space (oven chamber) which can be utilised for cooking and baking purposes.The oven consists of plane reflectors to concentrate the solar radiation on the collector.The heat gain is maximum if the collector and reflectors are continuously adjusted such that the incidence angle of the reflected and direct radiations are minimised. In practise, it is always difficult to manually track the movement of the sun and the use of trackers can be very expensive. As such, an analytical model was developed to evaluate the optimum monthly collector and reflector tilts for maximum output hen employing the single axis tracking mode. The operation of the different components of the oven was modelled using TRNSYS, Microsoft Excel and EES programs alongside solar data for Zaria. Optimisation of the design was carried out based onweather conditions prevalent on the average day of the design month i.e. the month with the least solar radiation. The tilt angles of collector and reflectors required for the optimum collection of solar irradiation for each month were obtained from the simulation results of the oven model carried out for 12 months of the year. The optimum collector area and insulation thickness were also obtained through parametric studies by varying the aforementioned parameters until a stagnation temperature of 100ᵒC was obtained for the average day of the design month. The simulation results for the design with different collector areas and insulation thickness show that an area of 0.49m2 and thickness of 0.12m yields a stagnation temperature of 100ᵒC. However, the stagnation temperature achieved was insensitive to larger values of the design parameters.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1 Background</strong></div> <div>Energy is the focal point of all human activities; it is the basis of industrial civilization. Without energy, modern life would cease to exist. In the past, the demand for energy sources was minimal because it was primarily used for cooking and local production. But as time went on, population increase and technological advancement led to more demand for energy. The major sources of energy are the conventional sources, which include: fossil fuels, and nuclear fuels. Fossil fuels, which include petroleum, coal, and natural gas, provide most of the energy need of modern industrial society. Other uses are found in the transportation, residential heating, and electric-power generation. Nuclear fuels are used to generate electricity, but it is utilised mainly in the developed countries due to high level of supervision and maintenance required. The non-conventional (renewable) sources of energy include: hydroelectric power, solar energy, wind energy, biomass, ocean thermal energy, tidal energy, and geothermal energy, but the potential of these sources is still underutilised because they are much more expensive to harness than energy derived from fossil fuels. Hydroelectric power requires a large capital investment, so it is often uneconomical for a region where coal or oil is cheap. As such, they contribute a little percentage to the massive energy requirement of the world population. However, the fear of depletion of fossil fuels due to the fast rate of consumption has provoked further development of these alternative energy sources, such as solar energy.</div>\n\nDESIGN, SIMULATION, CONSTRUCTION AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF A SOLAR OVEN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN, SIMULATION, CONSTRUCTION AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF A SOLAR OVEN", "id": 47}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Thermal electrical power generation is one of the major methods used in Egbin thermal station.

INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div>This chapter gives a short introduction to the research subject and describes the classification of the power plant, existing power plants, location and their generated power in Nigeria. A thermal power station is a power plant in which the prime mover is steam driven. Water is heated, turns into steam and spins a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator. After which it passes through the turbine, the steam is condensed in a condenser; this is known as the Rankine cycle.</div> <div>Steam turbines are devices used to convert the pressure energy of high pressure steam to kinetic and hence electrical energy in power plants and certain types of engines. While steam turbines might be one of the more revolutionary inventions in the power generation and conversion industry. High performance steam turbines of today are specialized in their design and incorporate many efficiency increasing technologies.</div> <div>Steam turbine maintenance is of high importance to keep the steam turbines efficiency high and to conform to safety standards to avoid any unforeseen dangers. The steam turbine operates under high steam pressures, and has a number of moving parts that move at extremely high velocities. The nozzles and turbine blades are designed via careful analysis and the parts are manufactured to a high degree of finish and accuracy.</div> <div>A steam power plant continuously converts the energy stored in fossil fuels i.e. coal, oil, etc. or fossil fuels e.g. uranium, thorium into shaft work and ultimately into electricity. The working fluid is \"water\" which is sometimes in the liquid phase and sometimes in the vapor phase during its cycle of operations.</div> <div>A fossil fuelled power plant is an example of bulk energy converter from fuel to electricity using \"water\" as the working medium. The energy released by the burning fuel is transferred to water in the boiler to generate steam at high temperature, which then expands in the steam at high temperature, which then expands in the steam turbine to a low pressure to produce shaft work. The steam leaving the turbine is condensed into water in the \"condenser\" where cooling water from a river or sea circulates, carrying away the heat released during condensation. The water (condensate) is then feedback to the boiler by the pump and the cycle goes on repeating itself.</div> <div>Steam turbine power plants operate on \"Rankine cycle\" for the production of electric power. If the steam from the waste heat boiler is used for process or space heating, the term \"cogeneration\" is the more correct terminology (simultaneous production of electric and heat energy).</div> <div>Steam turbine plants generally have a history of achieving up to 95% availability and can operate for more than a year between shutdowns for maintenance and inspections. Their unplanned or forced outage rates are typically less than 2% or less than one week per year. Modern large steam turbine plants (over 500MW) have efficiencies of about 40-45%.

<p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>A bookshelf is a device with partitions use for the purpose of self-guarding books and files in offices, libraries and at homes.</p> <p>A bookshelf can be wooden, metal or glass.  They could also be design in such a way that they could be dismountable or undismountable.  In our project, we decided to design and fabricate on undismountable metallic bookshelf.</p> <p>Amoung they bookshelves, the undismountable metallic bookshelf has the longest lift span because of its rigidity, quantity of material and it ability to with stand heavy loads.  In other words, the constant loosening and coupling of the component parts which lead to the weakness of the bolt and nut, thus subject the shelf to vibration.</p> <p>Our project being the undismountable bookshelf was fabricated with variety of material.  The types of materials involved are mild steel square pipes (25mm x 25mm) mild steel sheet metal, metals nets (wire gauze) etc.  in this, the square pipes were used in the fabrication of the frame work while the mild steel sheets were use to cover the partitions and outside bodies of the shelf and the metal nets (wire gauze) where used in the creating of the two doors.</p> <p>The essence of creating steel fame work with pipes is for it to withstand the stress that will be develop due to the weight of they material and loads or each partition.</p> <p>In fabrication, the frame was first erected before covering with the mild steel sheet.  The mass and volume of the book to be contained by each partition were considered before they were erected, so certain experiment were carried out which will be discusses in detail in this report.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>DESCRIPTION OF THE METAL BOOK

<p>The frame shown in fig.1.2 is the skeleton of the whole shelf, it is made of 25mm square pipe and 25mm (1) by 50mm (2) rectangle pipe.  The frame was first erected together by mean of welding before the sheet was covered at the back, side, top and the partitions.</p> <p>The frame was design to withstand the stress that will be develop on it due to the weight of sheet metal and load on each partition.</p> <p><strong>THE SIDE</strong></p> <p>The side as shown in fig 1.3 is made up of a mild steel of 1.0mm thick with height 1473mm and length 501mm.  It was welded to the frame (at an angle 900).</p> <p><strong>DIAGRAM</strong></p> <p><strong>THE DOOR</strong></p> <p>The metal bookshelf has two doors, the left an d right doors which are covered with metal net or wire gauze respectively shown in fig 1.5.  the doors was constructed with 25mm (1) square pipe and covered with wire gauze to allows the user to view inside the shelf, to know if the particular book or file he/she is searching for is in that particular bookshelf.</p> <p><strong>DIAGRAM</strong></p> <p><strong>THE BACK</strong></p> <p>The back as shown in fig 1.4 is made or mild steel sheet of thickness 1.0mm,

diagonally to the frame. (i.e. at angle 900)</p> <p><strong>DIAGRAM</strong></p> <p><strong>THE STAND</strong></p> <p>The stand were made from a rectangle pipe and a square pipe, that is, the two back stand were made from square pipe while the two front stands were made from the rectangular pipe.  This stand were extended from the frame work to enable stronger gripe, avoid bending, breaking and also to avoid slip.</p> <p>The stand add to the height of the metal bookshelf to total of 1525mm in height and there are four stands under the bookshelf.</p> <p><strong>THE PARTRITIONS</strong></p> <p>The partitions were design to be able to contain large number of books.</p> <p>They are measured 355mm by height, 1222mm by length and 470mm by breath.  The material used for the partitions was mild steel plate of 1.2mm thick was welded to the frame work of the partitions.</p> <p>The volume of the partition</p> <p>= l x b x h</p> <p>= 1222 x 470 x 355</p> <p>= 203, 890, 700mm</p> <p><strong>AREA OF PARTITION</strong></p> <p>= 2(lb + bh + lh)</p> <p>= 2(1222 x 470) + (470 x 355) + (1222 x 355)</p> <p>= 1,749, 340mm.</p>                                                          \n\nTHE CONSTRUCTION AND FABRICATION OF METAL BOOKSHEET<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE CONSTRUCTION AND FABRICATION OF METAL BOOKSHEET", "id": 53}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>          Parameters on which clear prints depends were comprehensively investigated.  The study revealed that clear print depends on the impressed pressure, the working temperature and the silver print paper.   Also studied were the manners of dependence of these parameters on prints impressed on sheets of varied thickness.  The result of this investigations were utilized in the design and construction of a operational hot (manual) printing machine.</p> <p> CHAPTER ONE </p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>IDENTIFICATION OF NEED</strong></p> <p>In recent years Nigeria lays strong emphasis on mass literacy and indigenous technology.  Printed matters are indispensable material in mass literacy campaign. The trend towards indigenous technology imposes a severe clamp down on imported engineering including printing machinery.  Thus, the situation is such that makes the acquisition of printing machinery from outside our own borders extremely difficult.</p> <p>To lessen the economic strain on the mass literacy campaign, the production of local printing machinery I s apparently imperative.  It is this fact that rendered initiative to the conception and realization of this low cost but efficient printing machine based entirely on local technology and resources.</p> <p>This machine is very useful in the printing of many items like paperbacks, cards, leatherbacks etc.  Its design is expected to motivate and advance the design and construction of other machines destined for similar purposes and based on indigenous technology and resources.</p> <p><strong>1.2     PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>Civilization and complexity of modern society has brought a number of social problems to be traced.</p> <p>          The use of textbooks, printed materials such as success cards and posters has now become imperative for the overall dissemination of heart felt  feelings and messages to friends both near and far.</p> <p>          Unfortunately, the prevailing economic pr oblem in the country (Nigeria) have sky rocketed the prices of these items.  Renders for example now rely solely on the libraries for up dating their knowledge.</p> <p>          It becomes clear then, the need to equip the libraries to met up with the challenges of their services.</p> <p>          Apart from refurbishing damaged books libraries are expected to render services such as printing of cards, printing and binding of students write ups like thesis, project etc.</p> <p>          All this needs formed the basis for the construction of this machine because these functions cannot be performed without a printing machine.</p> <p><strong>1.3     DEFINITIONS</strong></p>

non development and non maintenance of the institute community at large.</p> <p>          By this fact the project (mechanical lawn mower) was constructed and design to help in the development and maintenance of institution, community and the society at large in the area of grass cutting in our environment and the improvement in our food production and also the reduction of manpower.</p> <p>          In other words, during the construction and design of this project many things were put into consideration such as our environmental condition, effectiveness of the machine and also maintenance were well observed and a minimized cost of maintenance and a highly successful repair was adopted and also the appropriate tools cost and quality of material were well consider.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>          In the past, cutting of grasses in the schools, sports track, or field, industries hotels, pubic center, etc was done by cutlass this method of manual cutting is time consuming a s it is human effort that is needed for cutting, there was also inaccuracy in cutting level using the manual cutting system.</p> <p>          Apart from all these old method of cutting there is also risk of accident.</p> <p>          The problems of the manual was meant to be overcome with the aid of this project (the construction of a mechanical lawn mower) which is used for cutting of grasses to equal height or level for speedy cutting.</p> <p>          This project lawn mower, is also the accident free as well, it reduced labour and also reduced number personnel that is needed in a particular operation, it also reduced man power as it an internal combustion engineer that dose the actual cutting while the operator provides the efforts, great portion of land can easily be cut with lawn mower.</p> <p>          Again to encourage beauty in our environment this project was embarked on to help in keeping our environment clean because most labourers are finding it difficult in handily tool for gasses cutting.  It is also used for cutting sports field, (like foot ball pitch as well as crowns in hotel and business premises so this project reduces human effort and should be encouraged in school, hotel, business area, etc although mowers can be of electric type too, but we decided to fabricate a mechanical type to overcome the problem of electricity and as such this our lawn mower can be used every where even were there is no electricity.</p> <p><strong>IDENTIFICATION OF NEED</strong></p> <p>          Early before now, West Africa as a whole, the peasant farmer depends on the hoe and cutlass for practically all farm operation.  There tools vary in shape and size from place to place in the high forest zone of Nigeria the small farmer must clear thick bush every three or four years.  All this job is being done either hoe or cutlass for weeding of farm land.  These farm operation depend entirely on the energy of the farmer using the tools which he has at this disposal.   This inability that facing the farmer, has triggered these project group to research into the lasting solution to the problem.</p> <p>          Also, with meant development in the country, daily labour in farm operation is highly exorbitant for the farmer to afford but with these project (mechanical lawn mower) this problem of high payment of local labour can lead to reduction importation cost from Germany USA of this machine Nigerian with high profitability to the farmers.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>            LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>            HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT (SCOPE)</strong></p> <p>Based on the developing countries, technology in farm operation is highly increased.  It is clear that developments in farm machinery in West Africa started far back 1960.  This project must related to the social and ecological condition prevailing in different parts of this great region at the present time two trends a re apparent.</p> <p>i.                   Increase in the use of tractors and large agricultural machinery of farms of large extent both in the high forest and savanna zones, but particularly in the latter.</p> <p>ii.                 The increased use of animal power and small machines on peasant farms operation in West Africa will become increasingly mechanized, and that stage of mechanization mechanized, and that stage of mechanization which lies between the hoe and cutlass on one hand and the tractor combine harvester on the other is referred to as intermediate technology.</p> <p><strong>1.4     IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT TO SOCEITY</strong>  </p>

This cabinet is mainly for office use.</p> <p> CHAPTER ONE </p> <p><strong>1.0</strong>      <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>All over the world today, file and document keeping can not be overemphasized. It has vertically found acceptable place within the market economy in commercial enterprises such as offices, schools and institutions.</p> <p>The above therefore resisted the invention of a device such as cabinet for security purposes.</p> <p>A file is a sequence of bites, information or data as a single unit, typically in a file system in paper, on disk or magnetic tapes.</p> <p>The term is often used in the narrower sense of keeping information/data in such a way that it will be intact for future references/usage.</p> <p>These are various techniques in which files can be kept.</p> <p>(a)         Diskette (floppy disk)</p> <p>(b)        Hard disk</p> <p>(c)         Scrolls</p> <p>(d)        Papers</p> <p>(e)         Magnetic tapes.</p> <p>The process which is applicable is aimed at files safety and security for either references or future usage.</p> <p>In the past different file keeping practices have been invented such as hole, basket, box, Cain, wood etc. But the merits derived from metal cabinet out weights any of the above forementioned inventions. Hence, the design of this metal file cabinet.</p> <p>1.1   <strong>PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>The purpose of the project are as follows;</p> <p>(i)          To provide the security and safety of files and documents.</p> <p>(ii)        To design a cabinet which will be effective and maintenance free.</p> <p>(iii)      To design a cabinet that is of low cost.</p> <p>(iv)       To improve on the existing design with maximum security value.</p> <p>1.1.1<strong>                OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>A revolutionary design of this cabinet is to have a low rate of file loss with security lock.</p> <p><strong>1.1.2</strong>               <strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION</strong></p> <p>The design is for office only and not for commercial usage.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>                      <strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p><strong>1.2.1</strong>               <strong>HOLE</strong></p> <p>Hole was the first method of file keeping. This dated back to the dark ages as soon as the advent of civilization which started inEgypt say in the 15th century.</p> <p>During those days, it was a known fact that 95% of the world population were illiterate. The   5% acclaimed literate used the scrolls for writing down of information. In order for acted as today’s file, they dugged a hole in the then muddy wall and inserted the scroll only to bring it out when the occasion demanded.</p> <p>Looking at this primitive way of file keeping, you wonder what happen to the file if the roof of the house is  leaking, rodents attacking the scroll or even termite. Since the hole was not moveable, the basket method was  introduced.</p> <p><strong>1.2.2</strong>               <strong>BASKET</strong></p> <p>The basket method came in only when the scroll was edged out due to the advent of paper production.</p> <p>The basket stole the show for some time because everyone can afford to get, since the raw material for its production was locally derived.</p> <p>Though, the basket better of than the hole only for its being moveable but it was still not a safer means for file keeping as rodents can  eat up the information on the file thereby the need for a closed up method.</p> <p><strong>1.2.3</strong>               <strong>BOX</strong></p> <p>In other to secure the file, a box method was invented. The box was either made of wood or tin. The box method was a little bit better than the previous ones earlier mentioned in the sense that it was covered up thereby safe guarding the files inside. This method was in existence till the early seventy’s (70s) when it was discovered that the tin rusted faster as a result spoiled the documents inside  since it was not coated before using for construction.</p> <p>The disadvantages was that it can easily be stole (since it was not big in size), easy damage to files due to rusting and limited space or capacity for more files.</p> <p><strong>1.2.4</strong>               <strong>CAIN</strong></p> <p>The cain method solved the problem of capacity  as it was handly made to the size of a normal cabinet or shelve. It came with multiple compactments to accommodate as many files/ document as possible. It’s further advantage is that its free from moisture due to wet floor, from children’s reach as a result of it height but despite all these, it was not still better off as the files were not safe due to the fact that the different compactment does not have a lock. As the day approaches new things began to unfold leading to the construction of a woody file cabinet which can be locked.</p> <p><strong>1.2.5</strong>               <strong>WOOD</strong></p> <p>The wooden method if not of recent was the most used method due to the fact that, it secures the files, gives more space, aesthetically, adds beauty to homes, offices where they  are kept. Wooden type  grained more accelerates s most furniture’s in today’s  home are wooden.</p> <p>Wooden cabinet longerity is determined by the type of wood used for its construction. Here different types of wood exist ranging from cadar, mahogany to obeche. But despite any type used if the wood is not seasoned, it is still not going to last long. Therefore wood seasoning is simply the process of treating wood in order for its life span to be extended.</p> <p>Wooden cabinet at times are heavy while some are light depending on the type of  wood, used for its construction.</p> <p>Nevertheless, wooden cabinet is still en-vogue and as such does not in any way, limiting new inventions which metal method of constructing file cabinet belongs.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>1.2.6</strong>               <strong>METAL</strong></p> <p>In the late 20th century, wooden cabinet began to fade away, in order words lost its acceptance globally as wrought iron construction besieged the market economy and since then, it has been taking the lead. Take for instance, 90% of the furniture used in most fast food and confectionery outlets in our environment are mainly wrought iron works. Therefore, metal file cabinet has gain global acceptance and as such, it has come to stay, not only in this century but probably up to the next century. Its features guarantees the prediction as it more spacious, which can accommodate files in its thousands, secondly, safe guard and secures its contents with the aid of a key and lock.</p>                                                           \n\nDESIGN AND FABRICATION OF AN OFFICE FILE CABINET<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF AN OFFICE FILE CABINET", "id": 56}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study tend to investigate the effect of synthetic and natural moulding sand on casting of flange like component.  In this study FUTA logo was selected to be cast using aluminium metal. The casting was carried out and the result was analysed according to the quality of casting. It was discovered that for large size component using aluminium, it is better to use synthetic sand and which is hereby recommended for casting Aluminum large size component.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0   INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Foundry is a manufacturing process by which metallic products are formed by preparation of mould, melting the required metal, pouring it into a cavity formed by the mould and allow to solidify.  In this way the molten metal takes the shape of the cavity.  This product is cleaned and machined to desired dimension.  Moulds can be made of metals or non-metals but generally they are prepared in Sands.</p> <p>(Oshungbure, 1998). Foundry Technology can also be described as the beginning and the end of Engineering.    Foundry Technology can best be described as underdeveloped in Nigeria.  Considering the fact that Technological development of a nation is anchored on the state of her foundry Technology.  Knowing the fact that machine component even for further production depends on the casting industry.</p> <p>Thus, it can be rightly said that, the country is still in the development process.  Foundry Technology cannot be said to really make impact in Nigeria until the early part of the 1970’s when product of the industry were cast iron and non-ferrous material like aluminium.  Before this period, aluminium product was the prominent product and then very few cottage foundry workshop were around producing aluminum pots.</p> <p>Foundry industries in Nigeria have moved from its traditional arm chair status to a more progressive, more customer emphatic and progress driven activity.</p> <p>The major issues that would drive foundry industry in this country are globalization and Technology.  One common thread that runs through this issue is quality product for the customers is no doubt an imperative for the foundry industry to meet the current and future challenges.</p> <p>(Howard, 1959), Sand used to make moulds must be carefully conditioned and controlled in order to give satisfactory and uniform results.  Ordinary Silica Zircon or Olivine are  compounded with additives to meets some requirements or alternatively Bentonite, Silica Sand and moisture with additives will also meets some requirements.</p> <p>Refractoriness is provided by the basic nature of the sand, cohesiveness, bind or strength obtain by coating the sand grains with clay, such as Bentonite, Kaolite, illite that become cohesive when moistened.  Collapsibility is obtained by adding cereals or other organic materials that burn out when exposed to the hot metal thereby reducing the volume of solid bulk and decreasing the strength of the restraining sand.  Permeability is the ability of moulding sand to allow gasses to escape to atmosphere during pouring of molten metal into a well prepared mould.  Good moulding sand always represent a compromise between conflicting factors, such as grain size of the sand particles, the amount of bonding agents such as clay, moisture content and organic matters combined so as to obtain a satisfactory result.  Consequently some factors must be carefully controlled to assure satisfactory results.  Sand control is little concern to the designer of casting but, it is a matter of great concern to the foundry worker who expected to deliver casting of good and consistent quality.</p> <p>In foundry practice, moulding mixtures of varied composition are used.  These multiple varieties result from the varieties in the nature of the castings and the quality of input materials.</p> <p>These exists however some general characteristic on the basis of which moulding mixture are classified.</p> <p>In hand moulding, usually facing and backing sand are used.  Facing mixture are prepared usually from fresh initially material and has good technological properties.  The fine grain structures of sand are been used hence the working layers of the mould which enters into direct contact with the liquid metals made.  The thickness of this layer is 10 – 15mm depending on the thickness of the casting.</p> <p>Backing sand is meant for filling the remaining part of the mould and consists of already used mixture, which periodically is refreshed by addition of small amounts of silica sand (2 – 3%) and clay (1-2).  Integrated moulding mixtures are used mainly in machine moulding mixtures are used mainly in machine moulding mixtures are used mainly in machine moulding with aim of simplifying the process of preparation, transportation and compaction of the mixture of the mixture, as well as ensuring high labour productivity. They have sufficient good technological properties and produced through refreshing of already used moulding mixtures with sand, clay and other materials moulding mixtures for green moulds must have good permeability and as far possible with little gas forming ability. In this regard, it is recommended that bentonite be used as binder, their compressive strength must be within the range (0.3 – 0.6von/m2) source?</p> <p>All materials used for the manufacture of sand mould and cores are termed moulding materials.</p> <p>In foundry practice, the quality of the mould determines to a large extent the quality of the cast metal product, with the exception of special moulding materials used in the foundry for the casting non-ferrous or light alloy products.  Thus the study of foundry and is very important.</p> <p>In general, the control of sand preparation to ensure the appropriate limits of moisture, permeability, strength and other properties is a necessary consideration in order to guarantee good mould and minimize fetling work, with maximum output of cast metal products.  Principal ingredients of moulding sands are:-</p> <p>1.          Silica sand grains</p> <p>2.          Clay or binder</p> <p>3.          Additives and of course moisture</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>      <strong>Statement of the Research Problem</strong></p> <p>i.            Determining the responsibility of conditioning foundry sand, how it is measured and the main difficulties face in its implementation of producing the cast object within the manufacturing sector.</p> <p>ii.          Determining the impact of foundry sand on Aluminium casting and possible defect after casting of the propose object.</p> <p>iii.        Understanding the widely practice of sand how it being carried out in the foundry shop.</p> <p>Consistency of quality is particularly important when casting most especially Aluminium and it alloys.  Nowadays, in developing economics because of the downstream implication.  In its application sand preparation is taken as prerequisite and important as casting itself.  Any deviation from the characteristics known with a particular mixture of sand could affect the strength of the casting (Aluminium) thereby holding both current and intending customers.</p> <p>The time dimension and varies services the foundries offers coupled with the level of technology in use are measure of quality improvement over the last few years in Nigeria manufacturing of Aluminium casting and responses to foundry sand preparation in the casting industry.</p> <p>In the developing optimum sand for Aluminium casting bring some changes in casting, which automatically reduces wastage in casting.  Considering the pouring of molten metal into mould cavity and solidification of an aluminium alloy.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>      <strong>Objective of the project</strong></p> <p>The objectives of this project are</p> <p>                    i.        To make recommendation for the best foundary sand mixture for Aluminium casting especially big component like flenge.</p> <p>                  ii.        To understand and to determine the best sand to be used between natural moulding sand and synthetic moulding sand.</p> <p>                iii.        To determine the quality of sand being used and the grain structure of sand applied.</p> <p>                 iv.        To contribute towards inceasing the existing body of knowledge in the implementation of the effect of foundry sand on quality of Aluminium casting.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong>      <strong>Purpose of the Project</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study includes the following:-</p> <p>·                    To evaluate the impact of foundry sand preparation on the quality of aluminium casting.</p> <p>·                    To make recommendation for the best foundry sand mixture for Aluminium casting especially big component like flange</p> <p>·                    To understand and to determine the best sand to be used between natural moulding sand and synthetic moulding sand.</p> <p>·                    To determine the quality of sand being used and the grain structure of sand applied.</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong>      <strong>Significance of the Project</strong></p> <p>·                    To contribute towards increasing the existing body of knowledge in the implementation of the effect of foundry sand on quality of Aluminium casting.</p> <p>·                    To determine and to understand the best sand to be used between natural moulding sand and synthetic moulding sand.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong>      <strong>Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study base on the research methodology (i.e. primary source data, Yaba College of Technology Yaba Lagos) as strategy and vital information are not forthcoming as expected due to problem I faced during the construction of moulding box and the moulding for my project i.e. (FUTA LOGO).</p> <p>Failure of electricity supply during the casting of my project and a lot of difficulties during feeling and finishing operations</p>                                                          \n\nINVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECT OF MOULDING SAND (NATURAL &amp;

Cumbersome and difficult method of hand shelling, which encourages time consuming, and human stressfulness. Corn otherwise known as “Oka” in Igbo tribe is mostly used seed across all the tribe in country today. It is widely used in homes, hotels and schools for eating and seeding process (when dried). It is therefore hardly to see any Nigerian who has not tested it in one way or the other.<br/>Now, since it is very imperative for dieting inclusively, it can be refined to form varieties of food supplementary diet such as making of Akamu (pap), semuviter corn powder, corn mill etc.<br/>Today, in our industrial sectors such as ceramics and biscuit industry, it is widely used for making of biscuit, flouring for baking of bread, and corn Mill. Infect to summers all these, junked food that are baked in supermarket today are mostly involves corn in making them.<br/> <br/>In the light of this as technology advances forward, on introduction of this machine (Sheller) made manifest and come into existence which is more stressless, easy to operate, low costing and time reduction with high degree of production volume and efficiency modifications have also been made it possible to be manually and electro – mechanical operated types depending on the choice of design and the speed of shaft required <br/>Today, with the aid of this, it has created availability of corn Sheller (steeling machine) even in the market which indeed removed our difficulties and impossibilities when using and engaging with the modern method of design.<br/>1.1              PURPOSE OF CONSTRUCTION<br/>This project is meant to achieve the following purpose<br/>1)      To design and fabricate corn sheller which easy to operate with high degree of efficiency<br/>2)      To design and fabricate a machine (corn Sheller) that would save time and cost, with high degree of production volume.<br/>3)      To design and construct a corn Sheller that would not have much breaking effect of grains, leaving the cob’s intact during the process.<br/>4)      To design and constrict a corn Sheller that is economical and have little or no complication in maintenance<br/>5)      To design and construct a corn Sheller with high percentage at local technology <br/>6)      To design and construct a machine that is cost effective and manual stress reduction <br/>1.2              IMPORTANCE AND SPECIFICATION OF THE PROJECT<br/>The importance attached to this design is the facilitation and the production of voluminous corn Sheller without much time and without recounting much breakage of the grains of the corn in shortest possible time<br/>The specification was obtained considering the items or component used and the hopper and barrel dimensions put into consideration as well.<br/> The sign parameter for corn Sheller machine are.<br/>1.2.1        BARREL<br/>a.       Outer barrel – The barred do not rotates with the shaft rather stands on itself inside the shelling chambers. It is a half of cylindrical shaped perforated below to enable shelled corn to rush out to the conveyor to the outlet or basin. It is weld and tight at the endwise of the structure; they are flanges at end for the location of the bearings for the shaft. At the lower end of one is an open segments serving as outlet for the cobs and a hood is built covering it.<br/>b)                  Inner barrel – This cylindrical Barrel rotates with the shaft support by end-to-end bearings. The diameter of the shaft is ……………… mm and for the inner barrels diameter is 60…mm having 20 numbers of spikes measuring…mm from the barrel surface and also wounded varies that does the shelling process.  <br/> <br/>Diameter of inner barrel is …mm and its length is…mm and consequently the diameter of the shaft…mm and having a length of ….mm.<br/>Below in the diagram of the inner barrel <br/>HOPPER<br/> This is similar to a port the different is that it is bigger and covered like the port. It is either trapezoid or rectangular in shape, each shape chose have its advantage and disadvantage.

This is done using firewood and a frying pan using spoon to stir the corn. Due to the advancement in technology the used of pot with stirrer using gas cylinders as it sources of energy was introduce to lake care of the problem of the old method. But these methods have of the old method. But these methods have some constraints, which necessitate the introduction of the project (Electric popcorn machines) some of the problem are: The united nature of the system, the cost of buying a cylinder. The machine use electricity as it source and reduces the cost of popcorn production for commercial purpose. <br/>Nigeria being one of the countries in the continent of Africa is faced with some military factors. As a developing nation, There was been cases of bribery and corruption, drug abuse and trafficking, unlawful tempering of our pipe-line most especially in the Niger Delta prostitution, armed robbery and falsification of account. Because of this evident her inability to provide her youth with meaningful employment even after graduation. This social malady if not corb could lead to economic depression and stagnation. Based on this realization, we deem it necessary to embark on a project of this kind which would not only remedy our economy but would also give our youth a source of direction and above all make them to be self-reliant. <br/>The importance of this project cannot be over emphasize since our present economy does not call for our depending on foreign aid but on what we can produce either collectively as a nation or as an individual. Since government can no longer carter for the needs and wants of the longing populace. This project server as a foreign exchange earning for Nigeria thereby making pride we as an advance, Nation technology. Practically, the project could also serves as a means of enriching our knowledge and skills on how to make use of available resources in designing, fabricating, constructing and operating various machines and devices with efficiency of 65.98%, <br/>The benefit to be derived from this project are numerous, the most important is that it create employment opportunity for young graduate, i.e. self- employment. <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0              SPECIFICATION OF THE PROBLEM <br/>1.1       REQUIREMENTS OF THE DESIGN <br/>            The design is expected to achieve the following objective <br/>1)                  Production of popcorn in long scale. <br/>2)                  Increase the efficiency of producing popcorn<br/>3)                  Moderate the rotation of the stirrer by using the right motor. <br/>4)                  To reduce the heat that will be lost by lagging the output. <br/>5)                  To regulate the voltage used to produce popcorn. <br/>6)                  Achieve proper utilization of the heat by using a good conduction as the pot e.g. Aluminum.<br/>7)                  The use of wood as handle to effect easy conveying of the popcorn from the pot. <br/>8)                  The presence of bulb to enhance production at night. <br/>1.2              CONDITION FOR USE<br/>The machine might be used under elevated temperature. <br/>The machine should be stored after used in a clean and dry place. <br/>Routines cleans would be necessary to avoid rusting of the pot. <br/>The motor should service from time to time to maintain it efficiency. <br/>1.3              CHARACTERISTIC <br/>The machine should not be too heavy. The machine should not be too big to enhance effecting stirring. The distance between the pots should not be too large to reduce heat loss. Aluminum should be used for both the frame profile and the construction of the stirrer. Glass should be used to due the case because of the transparency. <br/>1.4       APPERANCE <br/>The product should have a glistening appearance, which can attract the prospective consumers of the popcorn.<br/>Reliability and Life   <br/>The expected useful life in normal circumstance should not be less than 10 years. <br/>Limitation <br/>(1)               There was no conveyor that should remove the popcorn from the hot pot. <br/>(2)               There was no time to indicate when the corn is fully popped. <br/>(3)               There was no thermostat to regulate the temperature of the system.<br/>(4)               There was noting like lagging to trap some of the heat. <br/>1.5       PRECAUTION <br/>Accident can be defined as an unexpected unplanned and unpredicted event, which could course loss of life, damage of properties and stoppage of work. <br/>Safety can also be defined as freedom from accident. <br/>The following precautions are put in place when operating the machine. <br/>1.                  Touching of hot pot during processing is no advisable. <br/>2.                  Line wire most not be touched with unprotected hands. <br/>3.                  Broken glasses and frame should be properly disposed. <br/>1.6       THEORY OF DESIGN AND ANALYSIS <br/>            The diameters of the machine are as follows: <br/>Length of Frame                                 510mm<br/>Base                                                    510mm<br/>Diameter of Bigger Pot           50mm<br/>Diameter of Smaller Pot         45mm<br/>Height of Frame                                  710mm<br/> Volume                                   L x B x H <br/>V                                             184671000<br/>HEAT TRANFER <br/>CONSTRUCTION <br/>This is the method of heat transfer by which heat energy moves from a region of higher concentration of heat to that to lower concentration while the material or body in question remain at fixed point. Most metals allow heat energy to pass through them and are said to be good conductors of heat. Non-metals such as woods, cotton paper and cork do not allow heat to pass through them.  This one called bad conductors or insulators. Though all metals are classified as good conditions, they differ in their ability to conduct heat. In order word, they need material medium for their propagation. <br/>         <br/>\n\nAN ELECTRIC POP-CORN MACHINE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ELECTRIC POP-CORN MACHINE", "id": 60}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A METALLIC  BOOK SHELF<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This project aims at designing and constructing a book metallic shelf hose capability will be to contain different standard sizes of books at minimum paces.<br/>What is taken into consideration in this project are the cost of its production, processes, and maintenance.<br/>Other considerable factors are the functional aspect of the plant/equipment and its durability as well as the reliability.

They could also be design in such a way that they could be dismountable or undismountable. In our project, we decided to design and construction an undismountable metallic bookshelf.<br/>            Among the bookshelves, the undismountable metallic bookshelf has the longest life span because of its rigidity, quality of material and it ability to with stand heavy loads.<br/>In other words, the constant loosening and coupling of the component parts which lead to the weakness of the bolt and nut, thus subject the shelf to vibration.<br/>Our project being the undismountable bookshelf was constructed with variety of material. The type of materials involved are mild steel sheet metal, metals nets (wire gauze) etc. in this the mild steel sheets were use to cover the partitions and outside bodies of the where used in the corruption of the two doors.<br/>The essence of creating steel frame work is for it to with stand the stress that will be develop due to the weight of the material and loads on each partition. In construction, the frame was first erected before covering with the mild steel sheet. The mass and volume of the book to be contained by each partition were considered before they were erected, so certain experiment were carried out which will be discuses in detail in this report.<br/>1.1       DESCRIPTION OF THE METAL BOOKSHELF<br/>The metal bookshelf as shown in fig.1.0 is made up of the following parts and components.<br/>i.          The frame work<br/>ii.         The side<br/>iii.        The back<br/>iv.        The doors<br/>v.         The top or plane<br/>vi.        The stand wheels<br/>vii.       The partitions<br/>viii.      The drawer<br/>viiii.     The top projection<br/>THE FRAME <br/>            The frame shown in fig. 1.1 is the skeleton of the whole shelf, it is made of folded mild steel of bended edge 37.5mm (1 ½) and thickness of 1mm. The frame was first created together by means of welding before the sheet was covered at the back half way on each coach partitions, side, top and the partitions.<br/>            The frame was design to withstand the stress that will be develop on it due to the weight of sheet metals and load on each partition.<br/>Fig. 1.1<br/>THE SIDE<br/>            The side as shown in Fig. 1.2 is made up of a mild steel of 1.0mm thick with height 168cm and length 85cm.  It was welded to the frame (at an angle 900)<br/>            The top project and the stand wheel gives the total height of the (bookshelf) side.<br/>Fig. 1.2<br/>THE BACK<br/>The back as shown in fig 1.3 is made of mild steel sheet of thickness 1.0mm, 168cm by height and 85cm in length and was also welded diagonally to the frame(at an angle 90) half way on each loach partitions to keep away visible book  destructive agent<br/>Fig 1.3<br/>THE DOOR<br/>The metal bookshelf has two door two loaches the left and right doors which are cohered with metal net or wire gauze respectively shown in fig. 1.4, the doors, was  constructed with folded mild steel of bended edge 37 mm and cohered with wire gauze to allows the user to view inside the shelf, to know if the particular book or file he/she is searching for is in that particular bookshelf.<br/>  Fig.1.4                       one side of the door<br/>THE TOP OR PLANE<br/>The top as shown in fig. 1.5 is made of a mild steel sheet of thickness 1.0mm and 168 cm length by 85 cm width and it is also welded diagonally to the frame (I e at angle 90).<br/>Fig 1.5 The plane (top)<br/>THE STAND WHEELS<br/>The stands were made from a rectangle folded mile steel of bended edge and a fixed wheels for easy change of position. The two back stand were made from square pipe while the two front stands were made from the rectangular pipe.<br/>This stand were exerted from the frame work to enable stronger gripe, avoid bending, breaking and also fixed to wheels. The stand and wheels add to the height of the metal bookshelf to total of mm in height and there are four stands under the bookshelf attach to four wheels.<br/>THE PARTITIONS:  <br/>The partitions were design to be able to contain large number of books. They are measured168 cm by height,85 cm by length and 33cm by breadth. The material used for the partitions was mild steel plate of 1.2mm thick was welded to the frame work of the partitions<br/>The volume of the partition<br/>= L X b x h<br/>20cm x 33cm x20cm<br/>= 13200cm.<br/>Area of partition<br/>= 2(Lb+bh+Lh)<br/>= 2(20 x 33 + 33 x20 +20x20)<br/>=2 (660 +660+400)<br/>= 2 (1720) = 3440cm<br/>= 34+4m2<br/> 1.2       PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT <br/>The purpose of this project is to design and construct a metallic bookshelf capable of concerning different standard size of books.

Besides, it has also caught the attention of the youths who will prefer to work in a company with technological operations than one with man-power operations. This project can be used to convey materials ranging from those in powdery forms grit forms, and stones in the size of crushed granites. If applied to the foundry technology practical (sand mould) under gone by the department. The lecture will experience ease in carrying out his lecture as well as satisfaction since there would not be lack of sand as this can be seen to, by an attendant and the lectures will have all the student of the Department in attendance. <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1       INTRODUCTION<br/>CONVEYORS<br/>This is any of various devices that provide mechanized movement of materials as in a factory; they are used principally in industrial applications but also on large forms in warehousing and freight handling, and in movement of law materials. They may be only a few meters in length or they may be in regretted systems several miles along.<br/>Also, it could said to be a family of materials handling machine designed to move individual articles of solid.<br/>Free flowing bulk materials over a fixed horizontal, inclined, declined or vertical path of travel with continuous motion.<br/>SCREW CONVEYOR <br/>            This is a conveyor consisting of a helical screw that rotates upon a single shaft within a stationary tough or casing, and which can move bulk material along a horizontal, inclined or vertical plane. It is also known as AUGER CONVEYOR, SPIRAL CONVEYOR. AND WORM CONVEYOR.<br/>The idea to build this project dawned on us during our practical on the course January technology. We (the students) in ought in sand for a mould practical which was screened by the lecturer and the appropriate ones selected for the practical to be carried out.<br/>            This project is necessary because it will did the lecturer in his lesson as well as stop the stress being put on students to go out and dig up sand for the practical.<br/>The need for this project is to convey sand lactated in a strong facility through the conveyor to the point of use.

ONE<br/>1.0              INTRODUCTION<br/>The design and fabrication of children’s swing is an acknowledged and established work.  Hence, we are trying to imitate or copy the technology and of possible make new innovations to enhance its efficiency and reduce the cost of production.<br/>The children swing is physically operated and it is found commonly in Nursery, Primary, Post-Primary and recreational/relaxation spots.  The main objective of the swing is toe create an atmosphere for children to rock themselves to and fro the seeing.  Thereby reducing the tension in classroom and also avoiding ht kid from indulging themselves in other dangerous recreational facilities.  However, the swing is meant for infants, teenagers and ever adults.<br/>1.1       IDENTIFICATION OF NEEDS<br/>            The children swing is a necessity for any growing child.  It is needed to build up a child psychologically and making him mentally alert.  It also create opportunity for a casual exercise because as one swing, the muscles in the arms and legs are being exercised simultaneously, thereby making the child to be physically fit.  The children swing enables the child to relax his nerves, thus avoiding unnecessary tension in one’s mind<br/>DESIGN SPECIFICATION<br/>            This project is limited primarily to the production children swing.  However, the specification is not limited in this case.  We are expected to improve on the already fabricated design, to ensure that other aspect f the design like its reliability, endurance, efficiency and compatibility is maintained.<br/><br/>\n\nDESIGN AND FABRICATION OF CHILDREN SWING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"

of mobile deep freezer.<br/>It is divided into chapters which discussed expensively the practical  refrigeration cycle  with  rull attention  given to design factors working principals and choice of material. <br/>Also considered  were fabrication assembly and safely requirement<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Firstly refrigeration in the process of removing  heat from a substance or  space in order to make it cooler.<br/>A mobile deep freezer is not different from  all  other refrigeration the only difference is that it can be moved easily by wheel or rollers to different places in a given time with less force applied to effect the movement.<br/>In refrigeration the three mode   of heat transfer is employed causing heat to flow from high  temperature regions to low temperature regions.  The   substance used to carry heat in the refrigeration  is known as the refrigerant.<br/>Refrigerant  is the cooling  agent in refrigeration.  It  makes indirect contact  with the substance to be  cooled.  It  is circulated in the  refrigeration  circult  and  the attendant change of state  from liquid to vapour brings about the  necessary  cooling  that is  required in the system which also involves  INTENT OR SENSIBLE HEAT.<br/>Refrigeration is accompanied  by various method such as the vapour compression system absorption system and steam jet refrigeration cycle.<br/>Refrigeration contributes greatly  to the raising of living standards of people its uses can not be over emphasized in  this book.  The  most common used and one that is readily recognized is the preservation of food.  Most products in our homes businesses  industries laboratories  hospitals  farms etc are affected by refrigeration.<br/>Its application is also extended to other areas  apart  from  food in medicine it is used in blood banks for antibiotic  for  making ice  for compression and low  temperature  surgery for presenting certain tissues that pathologist work on. It is very essential in genetic    engineering  to preserve sperms and eggs or longer years before they work on them  to bring life.<br/>Deep freezer is an Electro- mechanical appliance which  maintains the temperature of substance space or material as requires by the user it produce  artificial cooling.  It operates on the principal of reversed cannot  cycle that is to say that  it absorbs heat from a low temperature and  rejects it to a high temperature region.<br/>The compressor provides the conversion of energy that is  used in circulating the refrigerant round  the circult.<br/>The crankshaft drives the piston through the connecting  rod and it’s moved by the tongue produced by electric  motor.  The pumping effect of the piston produces the  high pressure on the refrigerant which sets it in  motion.  In the causes of circulation and attendant  change of state the refrigerant  returns to the initial state and ready for another cycle.<br/>In a deep freezer the condenser performs function  similar to that of the radiator in an auto mobile.  It cools the hot refrigerator gas by giving out hear to the dryer which traps moisture that can block the metering  device.  The liquid refrigerant passes through the metering device which expands the liquid into the evaporator pipe which is of  large  cross sectional area.<br/>The pipe is laid on the  inside of the deep freezer <br/>A lot of insulation is done to isolate the refrigerated space from the surrounding its heating effect.<br/>WHAT PROMPT THE PROJECT:<br/>Looking into the present situation of things the menace  caused by road side craftsmen who tends to spoil other  progress  in pretence to repairing  or constructing of deep freezer so that they will enrich their  pocket and then gives out fake freezers that will last for few months we then decided to embark on this project.<br/>PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT:<br/>The purpose or objective of the project is to achieve the following <br/>1.                  Designing  and constriction of a portable domestic cooling equipment that would improve on existing design taken into consideration.<br/>2.                  Designing  and constructing a cooling  / freezing system that is efficient  with little or no complexity in maintenance.<br/>3.                  Improving  the designs and construction of cooling  freezing equipment  with a reduced weight.<br/>4.                  To  design and construct  a cooling equipment  that will be mobile economical and cost that  a common man can afford.<br/>IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT<br/>The project is designed to accomplish a fast freezing system without destruction of bottles at very low temperature it is designed in such a way that the freshness and nutrient of food material is refined.<br/>It  is based on reduced weight cost fast freezing techniques compactness longer life span also to improve on existing designs.<br/>BENEFIT OF CTHE PROJECT<br/>Road side craftsmen that enrich  their  pockets instead of  satisfying the consumers will be eliminated food stuff can be preserved   for a very long time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n\nDESIGN AND FABRICATION OF MOBILE\r\nDEEP FREEZER\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF MOBILE\r\nDEEP FREEZER\r\n", "id": 66}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A PRINTING /BLOCK MACHINE <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Parameters on which clear prints depends were comprehensively investigated.  The study revealed that clear print depends on the impressed pressure the working temperature and the gold foil print paper life expectancy.<br/>Also studies were he manner of dependence of these parameters on prints impressed  on sheets of varied thickness.  The results of these investigation were  utizlied in the design and fabrication of an operational manual printing machine using gold foil   sheet depositor clear prints were impressed on papers during the new machine’s operation.<br/>LIST OF FIGURES<br/>Description<br/>Figure 1 sketch of alternative A<br/>Figure 2.

The only books available were those  on the  history of ‘Types’ and trade journals advertising products of foreign companies which were fund to be of little or no relevance.<br/>            However a visit to the government printing press gave us an opportunity to study the ‘types’ available and the basic operations of  the giant printing  (Blocking) machine with respect to the ‘Types’ from there we  were able to establish;<br/>(a)                The effect of temperature on the amount of gold deposited from sheet (sharpness of print ) <br/>(b)               The  effect of life time on the gold foil sheet depositor.<br/>(c)                The effect of pressure on the amount  of gold  deposited from sheet  (sharpness of print )<br/>(d)               The  effect of size of ‘types’ on the sharpness  of print  (amount of gold  deposited )<br/>Definition: <br/>Types : These are the characters or alphabets that forms the  letters.<br/>Print :- This is  the mark or impression produced on paper due to the types. Gold foil  sheet depositor :- is a thin rectangular  cellophane sheet coated with gold compound.<br/>1.3              EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF PRESSURE FOR PRINTING.<br/>The print there must be impact force between two  surfaces on e of which contains the ‘type’ and the other the paper on which print will be made. The force produces the necessary pressure for printing.<br/>         Consider alternative ‘B’ of the possible design solution.  Impact force  is due to the acceleration of mass of moveable plate and rail against the stationary letter box located on the element box.  The pressure for printing is  impact force for a  constant                                                                                                              surface area <br/>Impact surface area the pressure varies with variation in the impact force.  Similarly the impact force varies with the mass and acceleration.  But  the  mass is constant and equal to mass of rail plus mass of moveable plate hence only the acceleration varies. Therefore in this experiment effort has been made to determine.<br/>(a)          The  pressure required  to print clearly on thin cellophane sheet without perforating it.<br/>(b)         The pressure required to  print clearly on paper of average thickness without perforating it <br/>(c)          The  pressure required to print on cardboard sheet such that very sharp prints are obtained  by varying the input acceleration <br/>Materials: very light cellophane paper, paper back of higher education exercise book ceiling sheet (card board)  silver sheets,<br/>Apparatus: Election- speed printer machine <br/>Definition: The electronic speed printer machine is a motorized electronic motor.  It  has a device for varying the acceleration the current input  can varied hence the heat generate and therefore the temperature varied.<br/>Method: the acceleration is varied keeping the temperature and surface area of impact constant.  Already the striking mass is constant.  The following values show the accelerations at which sharpest prints were obtained without perforation of the materials after several trial.  The corresponding forces and pressure are also shown.<br/>TABLE 1<br/>Material    Accel.

Or vice- versa sharpness of prints can be altered provided the temp. Variation does not require a fall below 1550c.<br/>CONCLUSION:<br/>Sharpness of print depends on pressure and on temp (from about 1500c upwards).<br/>(a)                EFFECT OF LIFE TIME ON GOLDEN FOIL DEPOSITION <br/>Gold foil sheet as already defined is a very thin rectangular cellophane sheet coated with golden compound chemical such that temperature and pressure can be regulate its deposition on paper. Form the time of production (coating of gold on  cellophane) the coherency of gold deposit decreases with time until a times when the layers of the compound starts peeling off from the sheet by itself.  Hence sharpness of print depends on  life time of coating.

It is usually powered by electric motor which is connected to the machine and to the power supply source vise-vise.<br/>It is base on this type of Design that we embark on the design of a corn shelling machine.  However, this design is a modification of other existing design.   In other words we considered the feasibility of the design from every engineering details to economics and aesthetics.   The machine is therefore design to be quite reliable, durable and cheap to build and run.<br/>Towards this objective, an depth analysis of the existing similar machines was carried out and necessary modifications base on finding were made, such modifications include using pulleys and bolt, shape of tiny and the inclination of the discharge outlet and also spacing of the perforation and the teeth of the barrels portability, ergonometric heights and aesthetic impact.<br/>For the suitable selection of materials, calculations were made with their physical, chemical and mechanical properties or characteristics properly considered.<br/>The design (Corn Sheller) is capable of shelling ten (10) tons of maize per an hour.  It is operated with a one phase electric motor of 11/2 horse power at a speed of 145 rpm.  Its shaft rotates at a speed of 400rpm.<br/>The component features of the design are as follows.<br/>Barrel: This is subdivided into two, the outer and the inner Barrel. First, we treated the outer barrel and then the inner barrel.<br/>Outer Barrel,   This barrel rotates with shaft rote stands on itself inside the shelling chambers.  It is a half of a cylindrical shape perforated below to enable shelled corn to rush out to the conveyor or to the outlet or basin.  It is welded and tight at the endwise of the structure, they are flanges at the end for the location of the bearing for the shaft. At the lower end of one open segments serving as outlet for the cobs and a hood is built covering it<br/>INNER BARREL:  This is a Cylindercial barrel which rotates with the shaft supported by end to end to bearing.  The diameter of the shaft is 20mm and for the inner barrel diameter is 190mm having 20 numbers of spikes measuring 30mm from the barrel surface and also wounded vanes that does the operation. Diameter of inner barrel is 120mm and its length is 740 and consequently the diameter of the shaft is 20mm.   Below is the diagram of the inner barrel.<br/> TRAY:  This is just similar to a pot but the different is that it is bigger and not covered and have a rectangular shape.   There is a provision of an entry through which the corn enters the shelling chamber and the inner engulfing the shaft. It is obtained after cutting a mild steel and welded with guage 12 Electrode and it has its dimension as 740mm x 100mm.<br/>The diagram of the tray is as shown below in the fig.<br/>RECEPTACLE:  This is the outer funnel that collects the shelled corn from the conveyor to the outside. It is welded to the below of the outer barrel<br/>SPIKES : This is the rod attached to the surface of the inner barrel which does the shelling action with the Ina barrel and the spring vanes.  It is up to 20 in number and measures 20mm vertically up from the inner barrel surface each.<br/>COB OUTLET:  This is an exit through which cobs goes out of the barrel after shelling process to the external environment.<br/>CONVEYOR:  This is a carrier that carries the cobs out of the barrel after selling process. It is run on the body of the inner barrel and is about 20mm in height but runs in a snake like movement from end to end of the inner barrel.<br/>DISCHARGED CHAMBER:<br/>            The are holes perforatedf below the outer barrel through the shelled grain falls out to the conveyor.<br/>COLLECTOR/OUTLET BASIN:<br/>            This is curved mild steel welded below the perforated outer barrel inclined to an angle to enable the falling out of the shelled corn to the receptacle.<br/>INLET:<br/>This is the particular place in the tray through which the corn enters the shelling unit chamber for shelling process.  It is about 180mm in length and 80mm in width.<br/>SPRING VANES:<br/>This is made up of flat tiny metals welded round the barrel together with the spikes.  It is the part of the machine where corn are shelled.  It is always capable of withstanding impact from the corn and posses good chemical resistance, high working temperature (100%) and tensile strength.  Dimensionally.  It is measured from the surface of the inner wounded horizontally.<br/>            Finally, after much analysis and synthesis, the design is of minimum cost, simple to operate easy to construct, durable and easy to maintain.<br/>We hop our work will certainly provoke great interest in the reader as it house a lot of useful information for furtherance of engineering education and productivity.<br/><br/>\n\nDESIGN AND FABRICATION A CORN SHELLING MACHINE <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND FABRICATION A CORN SHELLING MACHINE ", "id": 68}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>FABRICATION OF A FOLDABLE CAMP BED<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>In this project, three alternative design solutions were considered for the foldable cam – bed.

All the existing foldable camp bed, have almost the same dimension but differ in design. Some use rope and ailets while the modern design make use of wood and spring. Some other are constructed using straight bars, pipes of angle iron.<br/>1.10          LIMITATION OF ALREADY EXISTING FOLDABLE CAMP – BED<br/>Some foldable camp beds are made of Iron bars which are too heavy and cannot be carried with ease. Most existing foldable camp – bed are cumbersome to carry because their lengths which are normally six feet or 183 meters or 1830mm.<br/>Some of the materials used for fabrication of the foldable camp bed may not be locally got and this affects its prince, making its availability to become more rare.<br/>            In the market, design that make use of springs to hold the improvised materials or even wood are found. But when the spring fill off, its efficiency is reduced and this make it more profitable to make use of wood than spring to hold improvised mattress.<br/>DESIGN SPECIFICATION OF THE FOLDABLE CAMP BED<br/>It is high in weight<br/>It can be produced locally<br/>It is portable<br/>It has an in built head rest which is adjustable. The tarpaulin material used in folding the foam to the wood can be easily removed along with the wood for cleaning.<br/>It is could carry a person up to 75kg in weight. Pipes (square) used are made of galvanized steel and also the angle Iron used is made if galvanized steel both painted with aluminum oil paint to avoid corrosion.<br/>It is easy to manipulate.<br/>All these specification put together make this project a viable one that can compete favorably with any existing foldable camp bed and also eliminate the limitations posses by earlier

by many experts from both building, and furniture perspective.<br/>            The oxford advance learners dictionary definition of refurbishing is the widely and a generally accepted definition of refurbishing.<br/>            It defines refurbishing as the work embark or undertaken in order to clean and decorate a room, building or in order to make it more attractive and more useful.  This simply means a programme transformation of a particular place or thing at a point in time.<br/>            The drawing studio requires special consideration to preserve the original studio nature after it has deteriorated, and repair work at different period must be considered when the new defects are first discovered, when this is being considered recently, it can serve as a remedy towards breakage of tables and the deterioration of the studio.<br/>            These may be wrongly diagnosed, consequently, the remedies for refurbishing prescribed the drawing studio may fall and further experience and investigation leads to effective remedies or maintenance strategies.<br/>            Refurbishing is sub divided into three types and these are<br/>1.         Life style refurbishing:         This involves improving a home and a way of life.  It might involve building a sunroom for pleasure or converting unused attic space into living quarters to meet ones changing needs.<br/>2.         Retroit Projects Refurbishing:         This usually focuses on home shells or mechanical systems such as <br/>i.                    Upgrading an insulation system<br/>ii.                  Putting on new siding<br/>iii.                Replacing a furnace<br/>3.         Maintenance and Repair Refurbishing:     This project the investment found in a house, workshop, or a room through activities such as:<br/>i.                    Repair of furniture<br/>ii.                  Caulking windows<br/>iii.                Reshingling roofs<br/>iv.                Replacing equestronughs<br/>AIM OF THE PROJECT<br/>            The basic aim of this project is to identify the importance of refurbishing in our institutions of higher learning, and also to know the correct types to be used at any point in time.<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT<br/>            The objectives of the project are as follow<br/>1.                  To know the importance or refurbishing<br/>2.                  To improve the understanding rate of the users of the project, by making them feel comfortable whenever there are in the drawing studio.<br/>3.                  To help bring back to the departmental acceptance of the standard of the drawing studio.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This project “Refurbishing of the Mechanical Engineering Drawing

Strenuous become the consideration to make the project quite affordable, this in the area of cost of production which was over comer by adopting certain amendment with the need to achieving the shelf in such a way that it become a modern lockable bookshelf which can contain quite number of books and files. It was felted with rollers stands and stoppers for stability at any kept point and easy movement and solidity welded<br/>1.2       DESCRIPTION LOCKABLE BOOKSHELF OF THE MODERN<br/>The modern lockable bookshelf as shown in fig 1.1<br/>Was constructed using 20mm square pipe and gauge 15mm mild steel street/plate and comprises of the totting parts /components:<br/>                          i.            Base<br/>                        ii.            Side<br/>                      iii.            Partitions or rocks.<br/>                      iv.            Roller Stands<br/>                        v.            The doors <br/>                      vi.            Locks<br/>                    vii.            Stopper<br/>                  viii.            Book<br/> <br/>MATERAL SELECTION<br/>In everyday work, an engineer comes across certain material like steel grides. Angle non circular bars, wrought iron, Aluminum etc. which are to be used  in fabrication of projects. While selecting a suite as ability t resist stress (tensile stress and comprehensive stress), strewn, elastic limit etc under the external force. It has been observed that under the influence these forces, the material is first deterred and made an the forces and their sheet along with some suitable precutting measures to determine the strength of material and to have a better quality product. As the case may be, this knowledge is very essential for an engineer to enable him design and fabricate his project. <br/>This table below shows the value of elasticity of material under a tensile force.<br/>S/No    Materials    Moderns of (E) in gaine gae/mm2 &amp; km/ mm2<br/>1    Steel    200 to 220<br/>2    Wrought iron    190 to 200<br/>3    Cast iron     100 to 160<br/>4    Copper    90 to 110<br/>5    brass    80 to 90<br/>6    Aluminum     60 to 80 <br/> 7    Limber    w<br/> With this table above, the wrought iron is been selected in fabrication of our project, because it can with sand up to 190 to 200 kn /mm2 of tensile forces. <br/> 1.2.1    THE BASE / BASE TOP.<br/>The base is made up of that sheet properly reinforced with 20mm square pope at all four rectangular sides of the rollers and stopper. The quality of this enforcement was bultress by good welding job and tilling eared out. He width is 70mm. The base top has no roller tiller (. Fig 1B)<br/> 1.2.2. THE SIDES<br/> The side as shown in fig is of a mild steel plate sheet of gauge 20, having a height and width dimensions of 10mm and 370mm it was properly reinforced with a for (20mm) square pope after framing and bending of the sheet at an angle of go which serve a propose of safety handling. The welding of this side was done with guage 12 mild steed. Doctored to show more stability or solidity knowing fully well that it will help in carrying the locks / partitions.<br/>1.2.3                THE BACK<br/>The back of the modern lockable bookshelf was of gauge 15mm mild steel which was formed as was bent at an angle 90o with the correct exact marking out of 910mm as length, 770mm as width. The essential of the back being to serve a cover and support to carry the locks, based on this the back was reinforced and welded in place/position see fig ld.<br/>1.2.4    PARTITIONS OR LOCKS.<br/>  The locks (partition) used were of metal sheet of the gauge 15mm. Being the place where the books will be kept the folding of by an angle 900 was done and welded in the square pope with at most aim of smoothness and easy handing of the book in place. The shape is rectangular length 765mm, 300mm width positioned at a distance of 300mm from one lock to another. The lock was welded inside the shelf properly in other to gain and maintain rigidity <br/>1.2.5                                ROLLERS <br/>The roller fitted to the modern lockable shelf is oracular in shape. The important of the rollers is to enable easy movement and it carries the shelf and also its entire load based in this the rollers was fitted in the shelf by welding to enable strong grip and avoid slip paring of the roller (fig 1f).<br/>1.2.6.   THE DOOR<br/> The door of the shelf is of 370mm width and 850mm length made from metal sheets into shape by an angle of 900 and the welding

chamber in which things are heated or cooked with various sources of power.<br/>Its importance borders around its function, which are as follows;<br/>(i)                 It is used to meet the everyday basic need of cooking, (baking, toasting, gritting, toasting) of food materials for human consumption.<br/>(ii)               Ovens are used for heat treatment of substance in laboratories and industries.<br/>(iii)             Also as a means of preservation by heat application to perishable materials (organic and inorganic) in general.<br/>(iv)             Sterilization of instruments and equipment for industrial use is done by heat application using oven.<br/>(v)               Expelling of moisture content to a required measure in some substance is also done using

nail gasket is a new innovation in technology. The one in existence is manually operated. In which a punch that is adjacent to a die is mounted to the handle  which  is attached to the shaft. A helical spring that is incorporated to the shaft of the punch, helps the handle return to its initial position, which makes the machines tedious and stressful to operate. When the handle is pulled down from its initial position, the punch passes through the die that is placed  vertically adjacent to the punch thereby blanking out the felt materials. The number of the gasket produced is proportional to the strength of the operator. But in our design, we incorporated  a geared motor which does the cutting in a reciprocating form, while the operator  just drags the felt material to the die where it is cut. The efficiency  of the machine is well above 75%, it can produce 216 felts per minutes . sprockets and chains are used to transfer power  instead of belts in other to effect good phases relationship. The material used for the punch is stainless steel rod. The machine is statically and dynamically balanced to curb noise and vibration. One and half (11/2) inch angle iron was used in fabricating the skeletal frame.<br/>Appropriate materials were subsequently selected and fabricated to required size. The machine was then  to perform efficiently thus satisfying the objective for which it was designed.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>Chapter one: Introduction<br/>1.1              Background of study<br/>1.2              Purpose of study<br/>1.3              Scope of study<br/>Chapter Two:    Literature Review<br/>2.1              Specification of problems<br/>2.2              Field survey/study<br/>2.3              Different types of gasket and their uses<br/>Chapter Three: Design Consideration, Specification and Construction<br/>3.1              Design factors/Consideration<br/>3.2              Material selection<br/>3.3              Tools and Equipments Employed<br/>3.4              Design of welded Connections<br/>Chapter Four: Design Calculations and Analysis of the Machine <br/>4.1              Forces analysis on the reciprocating mechanism<br/>4.2              Calculating the displacement, velocity and acceleration of the slider<br/>4.3              Estimating the power of the geared motor<br/>4.4              Chain length calculation<br/>4.5              Design of sprocket teeth for roller chain<br/>4.6              Chain drive selection<br/>Chapter Five: Fabrication Procedure, Materials Selection, Principle of Operation and Cost Analysis.<br/>5.1              Fabrication Procedure<br/>5.2              Materials selection<br/>5.3              Cost analysis<br/>5.4              Guidelines in Designing for production<br/>Recommendations<br/>References<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>Following the advancement of technology, and the need to eliminate the archaic method of producing nail gasket in this era, which really decreases production.<br/>            The aim of our improved motorized nail gasket cutting machine, it to increase production drastically and to reduce human fatigue and cost of the product.<br/>            The materials employed in this design and construction of the machine is mechanically reliable. this work is also helped to act as a catalyst and encouragement  towards the promotion of indigenous ingenuity in technological development of our country.

application the engineering and technological knowledge acquired so far. It is a starting point of actualizing a functional technology in the country. Irrespective of the fact that there are several breads of gas burners in the market, especially the ones imported, we deemed it necessary to work further on it as a way of modifying the brand with cast not left out in such modification.   <br/>1.2       LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>            The development of simple gas burner started in the eighteen countries when people began to use coal gas for burning. The application was fast put into practice by William Mulock who designed the simple gas cooker to be used in his office, home and workplace<br/>            The first experimental gas cooker was made and in use in 1850. The improvement of this has multiplied greatly and is up to date widely used in homes, restaurants and large catering establishments. The different types of gas cookers available in the in the market are based on skills and techniques of the designer or producer.<br/>            Based on the nature of energy supply, some gas cookers are made up of combustion devices of an electric heating element. The well-constructed ones are properly adapted and form an integral combustion of which of which they generate and utilize heat. It is often quite different to draw a line where heat generation stops and where heat utilization starts in a fuel forced cooker. That is the fuel fired cooker being on the pack in the market these days. <br/>            The releasing of heart starts with mixture of air and fuel gas in the nozzle and combustion of the mixture to release heart takes place at the burner. <br/>1.3       SPECIFICATION OF PROBLEM<br/>            In the course of fabricating the two-face gas burner, as a copied project with some propose modification, some condition which ought to be met are found as a standard of comparison with the already existing ones. This posed a difficulty in the course of this construction. Since choice between already existing gas cooker lies on service available, durability, connivance cost.<br/>            The following specifications were considered a problem when we started the design.<br/>1.      PORTABILITY. <br/>How to fabricate a two-face gas burner that will occupy the minimum space in the kitchen was a problem.

Fatigue, probably, is responsible for over 70% of failure of engineering component in operation. Misalignment in shafts and bearing causes excessive load. High speed bearing of aircrafts  that may operate at over 20,000 rpm may become catastrophic if there be any unbalance of the members. Out of balance of machine members creates serious problems on the functionality and durability and machine members and on the machine in general.<br/>It is therefore, with the understanding of he sensitivity of balancing in the design of mechanical components and the need to put balancing into consideration in the fabrication of our local machines, the view to determine the level of out of balance and the subsequent balancing of these machine members that necessitated the idea of designing and constructing a Basic Static and Dynamic Balancing Apparatus of this nature. <br/>1.1       OBJECTIVES <br/>The objective of this project is to design, construct and test a basic static and dynamic balancing apparatus as one of the ways to prevent premature failure of engineering components due to fatigue loading.<br/>1.2       SCOPE OF THE PROJECT <br/>The basic and dynamic balancing machine covers the fundamental exploits of knowledge to design and construct and static  and dynamic balance for any mechanical member since each machine components has its own balance depending on its bulkiness. The basic principle of construction lies on the one chained in our construction. This construction gives illumination for the construction of production and maintenance balance.

A new or better machine is one which is more economical in the overall cost of production, operation and maintenance.<br/>It is on these background that we came out with a design of a machine, which shall help in solving problems of drying spent grains in our breweries.<br/>The major problem facing breweries in the country in how to utilize the spent grains after brewing. Though some breweries use these spent grains as aids by drying and burning them. We hence see this method of recognition as not being economical but wasteful.<br/>There  propelled us to designing a new method of  drying these spent grains to the required moisture content through the use of a SPIN DRYER. When these spent grains are properly dried, it could be a major constituent in the production of  poultry feeds.<br/>With this spin dryer, the unemployed masses could gain jobs by fabricating or buying  this machine for drying of spent grains, and recycling it to a useful feed for poultry.<br/>It  is worthy  to note that the production of a spin dryer is designed in a way that even the unskilled workers could operate it, in fact, we are designing this project as our quota towards the  eradication of unemployment and poverty, which this present government is wedging war against.<br/>Moreover, technology could be bought, borrowed or stolen. Our project is a borrowed technology from the western world, which was primarily used for drying of clothes, but we have expanded this scope to deal favourably with drying of spent grains to the desired moisture content.<br/>1.2              THE PURPOSE OF CONSTRUCTION<br/>This project is designed and constructed to achieve the following goals:<br/>1.                  To design and construct a spin dryer that will recycle brewery waste (spent grains).<br/>2.                  To design and construct a machine that can dry rapidly trough spinning.<br/>3.                  To design and construct a machine that will have high degree of automatization.<br/>4.                  To  design and construct a machine  that will take less drying time.<br/>5.                  To design a machine that will be easy in construction but have high efficiency.<br/>6.                  To design and construct a machine that will be cheap to operate and maintain.<br/>7.                  To design and construct a machine that will require less energy.<br/>8.                  To design and construct a machine that could impress on existing design taking into cognisance, areas of need.<br/>1.3              IMPORTANCE AND SPECIFICATION OF THE PROJECT<br/>The importance attached to the design of the spin dryers is to achieve a fast spinning and drying system for drying of spent grains.<br/>The machine is design in such a way that it does not require squeezing presses to demoisture the spent grains in the perforated spin tub/basket rather works on the theory  of centrifugal motion where the spent grains are spin in the machine away from the centres of rotation at high  velocity rate, squeezing the water out.<br/>This machine is design to remove excess water from spent grains in minutes (it spin almost at a rate of 145orpm) by spinning twice the capacity of a normal dryer. It is designed to have a longer life span and efficient in its operation. It is  driven by a 4kw (5h.p) motor, as the motor is spinning the basket, the moisture content is drain to the drum. The drum encloses the basket which is covered to prevent the moisture content from splashing.

Melon (Citrullus Vulgaris) is widely cultivated in Nigeria, among other seedlings during the planting season yearly. Several tones of the melon seeds are gathered each harvesting period but only very low percentage of the total harvest are dried by atmospheric draught and bagged for storage. High percentage waste is encored due to lack of good processing and storage facilities. <br/>     Melon when properly processed yields a lot of by-products, which could be used as food or as raw material for small and large scale industrial manufacture melon is highly enriched with oil. It has about 45%  oil content. The oil could be extracted to form a very good source of vegetable oil.<br/>          After pressing out the oil, the remaining product can be used as food for human of as an additive in agro-feed manufacture. Melon without oil can be grounded and used as thickener or binder in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.<br/>        The outside shell of the melon seeds when properly harvested in large quantity can equally be used in preparation of agric feed. The shell has about (12-55) MJ/kg calorific value and therefore can be used as a source of energy for industrial use. <br/>         The major problems encountered in the processing of melon seeds are the removal of the yellow outside shell and the separation of the broken shells form the white seeds. Locally as at now, manual approach is used for the de-husking and separation. The consequence of this is low productivity, increase in processing time, and increase in human labour. <br/>        A mechanized method of de – husking and separation will definitely increase productivity, reduce processing time and bring down human labour input to the  minimum.<br/>       These problems arising form the manual de-husking and separation of the melon white seed from the shell necessitated the idea of designing, constructing and testing a melon de-husking and separation machine for our local communities and industries. <br/>1.2 DESCRIPTION OF THE DESIGNED MELON <br/>     DE-HUSKING AND SEPARATION MACHINE <br/>       The assembly drawing of the designed de-husking and separation is shown in appendix.<br/>The machine consists of the following components namely.<br/>1)   Impeller <br/>2)   Inlet hopper<br/>3)   De-husking casing <br/>4)   Inlet channel <br/>5)   Casing cover <br/>6)   Chequer linings <br/>7)   Exit channel <br/>8)    Adapter<br/>9)    Blower<br/>10) Electric Motor <br/>11) Structural Stand<br/>12) Blower Casing <br/>13) Blower Impeller<br/>14) Blower Casing Cover<br/>15) Blower Suction Channel <br/>16) Air exit channel <br/>17) Blower mounting base<br/>18) Flange bearings<br/>19) Bolts and Nuts<br/>20) Blower shaft<br/>        The de-husking impeller is housed by the de-husking casing. The casing is lined with cylindrical chequers. The  cylindrical impeller is mounted very closely to the inside walls of the cylindrical casing leaving  a minimal gap to contain the melon seeds as they flow through this gap from inlet channel to the exit channel. The casing is covered with a cover plate. The impeller is connected to the shaft of the electric motor through an adapter. The blower impeller is housed by the blower casing. The blower sucks air from outside through the suction channel and the impeller forces the air through exist channel as required. All the arrangements of the machine are carried by the structural base. Bolts and nuts are used to ensure proper mounting of components on the structural base.<br/>1.3 PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION                       <br/>     The principle used by this machine to achieve the melon de-husking is attrition and density differential between the cracked shells and the white seeds is applied to achieve the required separation. <br/>     The electric motor provides the primary motion which rotates the de-husking impeller. The melons are introduced through the inlet hopper of gravity. The melons are directed to flow towards the walls of the casing to the chequers. The rotating impeller then rub the melons on the chequers in the direction of rotation of the impeller. The melon must be properly treated with water (moisture) arieated properly before de-husking. <br/>    The rubbing action peels the shells of the melons and equally move them along with the broken shells in the direction of rotation to the exit channel.<br/>        The blower shaft transmits motion from the electric motor to the blower impeller, thereby delivering certain quantity of air which is channel to meet the broken shells and white seeds coming out from the de-husking casing.<br/>    The broken shells being lighter than the white seeds are carried away by the air to a different direction while the white seeds move into a receiver where they are collected. <br/>1.4 ADVANTAGES <br/>i) The machine combines two processes in one ie de-<br/>    Husking and separation.<br/>ii. The machine is portable and occupies <br/>     very little space. <br/>iv. The machine is cheap when constructed locally, <br/>     compared to cost of importation.<br/>v. The machine can be confidently be driven by a <br/>    single phase electric motor thereby making power <br/>    consumption rate very low.<br/>Vi. De-husking and separation time is highly <br/>      reduced by using this machine.                              <br/>vii. Labour input in de-husking and separation is also <br/>      drastically reduced. <br/>viii. Productivity in de-husking and separation is <br/>       highly increased. <br/>1.5 OBJECTIVE <br/>(i) The objective of this project is to design, fabricate and test a melon de-husking and separation machine in order to increase productivity in melon processing and reduce human labour of manual de-husking and separation to the bearest minimum.<br/>(ii) This project will improve the living standard of million of rural dweller who may engage in melon processing. <br/>(iii) It will encourage the growth of small and medium scale industrial enterprise in the agric – processing nation wide. <br/>(iv) This project will contribute to the overall economic development of the nation by encouraging indigenous engineers technologists and technicians in designing, fabricating and testing of processing machines. <br/>1.6 SCOPE <br/>     This machine only handles treated melon. The designed machine is expected to de-husk and separate about 450 kg of melon in an hours work. This is result in about 3, 600kg or 3.6 tonnes in eight (8) hours work.<br/>1.7 BENEFICIARIES<br/>i) The major beneficiaries of this project are rural dweller who might engage themselves in melon processing. <br/> ii)  Small, and medium scale agro-industrial set up who produce products like vegetable oil and food items.<br/>iii) Chemical and pharmaceutical industries who might be using extracts from melon as binders, thickeners for drugs etc. <br/>iv) Agro – feed industries who might be using melon as additive in feed production. <br/><br/>\n\nDESIGN OF MELON DE-HUSKING AND

DUST EXTRACTOR <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Man’s imp act on global environment system especially in the area of dust extraction is now at a scale where it is disrupting.  These dust extractors varies in major ways.The environmental degration is, in turn contributing to health threat in this part of the globe.  Unfortunately most factories, workshops which suppose to posses these machines for dust extractions a re not having them thereby making dust a very dangerous threat to man.  <br/>Due to this ugly development it, is obvious that these factories and workshops can do little or nothing to protect our environment from this poor state.  It is therefore necessary that all and sundry should join the crusade of eradicating dust from our environment thereby making it clean.  Although before now people have tried to contribute their own quota in seeing to the end of the menace, get lack of interest, finance has posed a hindrance to the realization of this achievement.<br/>In view of the above, we deemed it necessary that such a machine should be constructed to the Mechanical Engineering workshop to eradicate dust and thereby make the workshop environment clean and fit for students practical activities. <br/>  The realization of this work started from our supervisor who conceived the idea which we saw as a need, then we defined the need and synthesized it, evaluate and came to a conclusion.<br/>The synthesis led us to drawing board by sketching and drawing to scale after which the design required was chosen.  Fabricated and parts put together to form what we called a dust extractor.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0       Introduction<br/>1.1              Aims and objectives<br/>1.2              Economic importance of a dust extractor<br/>1.3

Recommendation and conclusion<br/>References<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/> INTRODUCTION<br/>Dust is a serious health hazard especially to the respiratory system.  It can have a cumulative effect eventually resulting in permanent damage to the health.<br/>Fine dust is the most dangerous and the most difficult to get rid off.  The sharing and the large particles of dust are not much of a problem as most of it falls to the floor quickly and lungs have a built in mechanism which can eject relatively large particles.<br/>The dust particles that causes damage are normally in the range of 0.2 to 5 micron in size (a micron is one thousand of a millimeter) and so small as t o be invisible to the naked eye.  They can remain suspended in the air for hours.  Even if one cannot see any dust, the atmosphere may still be harming ones lungs.  One is likely to breath 8 to 10 cubic meters of air during and 8 hour working day most especially those working in the engineering workshops that has to do with metal drilling (drilling, shaping etc) drugs manufacturing industry, paint industry and food processing industry.<br/>If the dust in the air average out of 5 mg per cubic meter during that period, then you will suck in 50gm (2 ounces0 of dust.  Most of this w ill be dealt with by the body’s own dust defence mechanism the nasal hair and mucus lined walls of the air ways leading to the lungs will swallow most of it.  Only a very tiny percentage of the dust is permanently trapped in the lungs but it is this which causes the damage.<br/>Dust from some wood can cause skin complaints such as dermatitis.<br/>Dust Extractors:          With a small dust extractor couple with the respirator to give a primary protection.  You must not need a huge powerful machine it w ill help to keep the workshop clean and you can use it with it’s flexible hose to cover up the sharing and remove dust which has settled on surfaces.  Because you have a wood turning lathe you can quickly turn up a wooden adaptor to accept the hose form your domestic vacuum cleaner to give you a handy extension hose.  If you have other wood working machines such as a table saw you can hookup the extractor to them when you need to use them.<br/>EXTRACTING DUST:          The fan sucks the air into an oil drum shaped container and then through an internal filter.  These machines usually also make use of the cyclone effect to reduce the load on the filter.  This type of machine is cheaper, takes less space, has superior filtration and has a stronger suction for hovering.  The motor however is very noisy and the airflow is much less than the external bag machine.<br/>The small filter clog quickly reducing he air flow dramatically.  The wood turner really need is a machine which moves a larger volume of air at a lower speed breeze which wafts the fine suspended dust away from the lathe into an efficient filter.<br/>Those extractors setups for paint spraying welding which consist of a large three sided box built around the work area.  Built into the rear of the box in an array of huge powerful fans which sucks all fine dust and fumes through suitably design filters at the rear and recalculate the air.  They work well because they move a very large volume of air.<br/>Another dust extractor BB100, this is a low cost fine dust extractor (performance rating 3) for the hobby workshop.  It is equipped with a 1000 watt vacuum cleaner motor which generates 195 cubic metres per hour of air flow and provides enough suction to cater for even the smallest of power tool inlets.  The two stage filtration system consist of a pleated paper filter, rather like a car filter, surrounding the in let to the vacuum motor and a sub micron paper bag filter which totally encloses the pleated filter.<br/>Largest sized waste, such as planer chippings, fall straight to the bottom of the drum whilst the smaller dust particles are captured by the paper filters.  The paper filters can be easily replaced as necessary whilst the pleated filter can be a vacuum cleaned periodically.  Typical uses for this extractor are small band saws, bench mounted sanding machines and portable power tools such as routers, planners and sanders.  It also serves as a very effective vacuum cleaner for keeping the workshop clean and tidy.<br/>1.1       AIMS AND OBJECTIVE<br/>This project is aimed not only at providing a dust extraction machine in factories and workshops but:-<br/>To provide a life equipment in the workshop which can be used for exhibition by students.<br/>To provide a machine (dust extractor0 which could be further modified and improved on, for the extraction of dust from the atmosphere, which can favourably compete with the best in the market.<br/>1.1       ECONOMICS IMPORTANCE OF A DUST EXTRACTOR<br/>1.                  For extraction of dust fro the air <br/>2.                  Locally made dust extractors can be sourced in the market<br/>3.                  Effective dust extraction can only be achieved if handled by an experienced person <br/>4.                  Durability if proper maintenance culture is adopted.<br/>1.3       USES OF A DUST EXTRACTOR<br/>1.                  Can be used in extracting dust from the workshops<br/>2.                  Can be produced and soled to factories thereby serving as a source of income to the producer.<br/>3.                  Reduces disease that could have been contacted from the air through dust.<br/>1.4       DESIGN CONSIDERATION<br/>The design and selection of materials is governed by many factors, first, considering the physical characteristics of the extractor i.e the shape, size and weight.<br/>Design also to protect man against his negligence and for the safety of the motor.<br/>Design to work effectively in any place of application.<br/>The weather condition of any place of its application was also considered, therefore it can be used any where without being affected by the weather condition of the environment.<br/>WORKING METHOD<br/>Metal cutting process consist in removing a layer of metal from blank to obtain a machine part of the required shape and dimensions and with a specified quality of surface finish.<br/>A metal cutting tool is the part of a metal cutting machine tool that, in the cutting process, acts directly on the blank from which the finished part is to made.  The metal cutting process accompanied by deformation in compression, tension and shear by a great deal friction and heat generation, tension and shear by a great deal friction and heat generation governed by definite laws.  In order to cut the material from blank, the cutting tool should be harder than the material to be cut, the tool should penetrate the blank and the tool should be strong enough to withstand the forces developed in cutting.<br/>In this construction of these dust extraction machine, a lot of welding activities was done and moreso forging in general.  Welding is defined as a group of processes in which metals are joined by bringing abutting surfaces to a molten state.  It facilitate light weight construction. <br/><br/>\n\nDESIGN A ND

interest.<br/>Essentially, the idea, as demonstrated in an existing design, arises in the project students a feeling of motivation, and hence the search for a way to bring it to reality in a simple, yet intelligent design, like this.<br/>1.2           PROBLEM STATEMENT<br/>           Specifically, this design seeks for a source of energy that is relatively cheap and available, and therefore has an edge over other stoves and ovens using kerosine and gas as sources of energy.  It also aims at making domestic cookers and ovens safe enough as against highly flammable liquid or gas fuel.<br/>           Many Nigerians today are faced with the problem of petroleum fuel scarcity and as per cooking and drying which is not often easy to get fire wood from forests that are often far away especially from the big cities.  Equally too, the few available fuels are of substandard quality with the attendant danger of fire outbreak.<br/>           In addition above, fuel consuming cookers and ovens have two outstanding deficiencies, namely; sooty pre-heating and problem of dogged nozzles which lead to offensive discouraging and dirty burning.<br/>           Above all, deforestation as a result of fire wood consumption is causing great deal of environmental problems in most regions of Africa.  In this modern world and its various invented means of cooking, it largely seems as if non has quite addressed this area by providing an alternative means of cooking and drying.<br/>           In a close observation, large scale cooking and drying as an drying of meat and fish sellers, commercial corn roasters, food sellers and “suya” sellers, etc, need efficient heating system.  The absence of short drying period and hygienic process of preserving our loide and sea foods is another issue, which has led to fast spoiling and give an electrical stove with an oven apartment to sufficiently address these problems.<br/>1.3           PURPOSE OR OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY<br/>           This study is to devise a means of producing an electrical stove with three apartment to address the following:<br/>(1)            The problem of sooty pare-heating as observed in vaporizing cookers.<br/>(2)             Economically, this equipment is designed for cost reduction and easy to maintain.<br/>(2)        To reduce the effect of kerosine scarcity prevailing in our present days.<br/>(3)            To meet up with inadequate availability of fire wood through deforestat6ion.<br/>1.4           LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>           In an extremely large span of time ago, people generally roasted by placing food substances on hot wood coal or on heated rocks, and smoking (drying) ,of meat and fish was done by means of brick oven.  This brick oven was locally made in a dome shape having an opening through which the firewood and other food substances were put.  In use, the firewood was burnt to a sufficient time to provide enough hot coal before the meat or the fish already laid on a perforated sheet or wire was regulated by either gathering the fire wood together for more heat or withdrawing them from the oven so as to reduce the heat.  This event can be dated back at least to the third century AD<br/>Equally too, primitive Africans set fire on a carefully arranged fire wood and used the fire so generated for cooking.  That was when civilization was still in the womb of time.  As a result of science and technology electricity came into during such trend that electrical element was made to generate heat when electric current is passed through it.  About 1914 electricity was adopted for cooking, and become popular in late 1920s.  along side those periods, oil exploration and its various refined products like kerosine, gas, etc for both industrial and domestic consumption were made possible.  Hence, kerosine stores and gas cookers, over the years, began to replace the primitive way of using firewood for cooking and drying, particularly in most civilized regions of Africa.<br/>           Then came a time, late part of the last century and the new millennium, when petroleum fuel scarcity overwhelmed the entire nation, making lives of many Nigerians difficult.  Consequently, kerosine stoves and gas cookers became n o more alternative as before.  Many Nigerians began  using fire wood for cooking and drying.  This period was crucial during the PENGASAM strike, 1994. When a certain container inside which coal is burnt to provide heat for cooking and roasting was named<br/>ABACHA STGOVE:  In the course of the above periods, foreign electrical stoves and ovens flooded our local market, and their maintenance culture were by no means easy.  Thus, economically their uses were not feasible enough domestically.<br/>           Thus threw a challenge to our local engineers to produce electrical stoves and ovens that can stand the test of time within our locality, and to avoid the danger of kerosine and gas explosion which have terminated a lot of lives in our present days.  Such a challenge also paved way for the project students came up with such a dual-purpose domestic electrical heating equipment to sufficiently address the problems being imposed by petroleum fuel consuming stoves and ovens, incessant as stated preciously in 1.2. above.<br/><br/>\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF AN ELECTRICAL STOVE WITH THREE-OVEN APARTMENT<div

files in offices, libraries and at homes.<br/>A bookshelf can be wooden, metal or glass.  They could also be design in such a way that they could be dismountable or undismountable.  In our project, we decided to design and fabricate on undismountable metallic bookshelf.<br/>Amoung they bookshelves, the undismountable metallic bookshelf has the longest lift span because of its rigidity, quantity of material and it ability to with stand heavy loads.  In other words, the constant loosening and coupling of the component parts which lead to the weakness of the bolt and nut, thus subject the shelf to vibration.<br/>Our project being the undismountable bookshelf was fabricated with variety of material.  The types of materials involved are mild steel square pipes (25mm x 25mm) mild steel sheet metal, metals nets (wire gauze) etc.  in this, the square pipes were used in the fabrication of the frame work while the mild steel sheets were use to cover the partitions and outside bodies of the shelf and the metal nets (wire gauze) where used in the creating of the two doors.<br/>The essence of creating steel fame work with pipes is for it to withstand the stress that will be develop due to the weight of they material and loads or each partition.<br/>In fabrication, the frame was first erected before covering with the mild steel sheet.  The mass and volume of the book to be contained by

yet paints are a class of products that serves important aesthetic, protection and functional values.  The few available paints makers are so specialized or professional in presentation that the seem scaring to interested students and industrialist.  The objective of the project pilot  production plant for pant simplified paint making; thereby motivating entrepreneur aspiring in pant making given them adequate viable market as a result of low cost of production.<br/><br/>\n\nDESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A PILOT PRODUCTION PLANT FOR PAINTS (EMULSION AND TEXCOAT)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A PILOT PRODUCTION PLANT FOR PAINTS (EMULSION AND TEXCOAT)", "id": 83}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A WOODLATHE MACHINE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            This work is an attempt to evolve a quicker and easier method of achieving cylindrical shape object from a work price.

With it, comes the choice of various designs and models. In order to meet up with the increasing demand of the industries led to the design of a good number of machines that can be used by the craftsman to create different wood designs, amongst which is the wood lather machine.<br/>1.1       OBJECTIVES<br/>            Apart from putting into practical the theoretical knowledge acquired from the class room, the main objectives of the project are: <br/>a)         To use available local materials in fabrication.<br/>b)         To achieve a reduction in the cost of production of the machine.<br/>c)         To reduce the labour cost and time spent on using hand tools for wood dressing.<br/>d)         To create awareness for, and encouragement of indigenous technology.<br/>e)         Increase productivity and creativity.<br/>The vital need for the fabrication of a wood lathe is significant in the much delay and time as well as energy wasted in using simple hand took to carry out operations moreover, the cost of importation of a lather machine, is too high for average user. <br/>Similar to the use of other machine tools, the wood lathes machine will help to reduce cost, save labour time and consequently increase the rate of production and craftsman’s skill. It is also important to explore the design of machines to improve on the ones already in existence.<br/>By the early middle age the lathe is still driven by a cord, the new lathe used the tension of a bent tree branch or cut pole to provide a stronger and more convenient way of furring coordinated with the pole was a treadle, which pulled down on the cord wrapped around the work itself, or on a spindle attached to the work. The treadle regulates the speed at which the piece turned. This arrangement displeased with the need for an assistant. The troublesome feature of the early lathers that the pole and treadle system did not address was the need for continuous motion.  <br/>The search for a lather that would turn in only one direction probably ended in the fifteenth century, when the lathers powered by cranked flywheels and giant wheels powered by hand foot horse, and even water were invented, Leonardo a Vinci was one of the many inventors who designed the early continuous drive lather. However, today, wood lather machined are powered by an electric motor which provide the continuous motion needed.<br/>Although, wood lathe machines are made from metal steel, iron etc.<br/> 1.2              LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>Traditionally, it was thought that the ancient Egyptians introduced lather turning. Perhaps as much as 4,000 years ago. Despite a lack of hard evidence, it was assumed that a civilized nation as advanced as Egypt’s – is known to develop the Potter’s  wheel and bow drill – possessed the technical know – how and skill to have made the invention of the lathe inevitable. Instead, scholars now believe that the lathe was invented around a thousand years B.C., and that its development may have occurred simultaneously among the Etrusians in Italy, the Celts in Great Britain, and the inhabitants of the Crimea. By the second century B.C., the lather was known to most of the people of the Near East and Europe. Originally, the lather was vertically oriented, like the Potter’s wheel. In the case of farning, the lather was eventually mounted on a table France, to be used mainly in a standing position. Virtually all early lathes were powered by cord and required that a helper assist the Craftsman and Non- metal (Hard wood). Those the frame made of wood are faced with the problem of durability and the ability to withstand shock.<br/>However, the major problems that are prevalent with the existing lathes are:<br/>1.                  Retching and vibration which translates into the spindle and bindweed thereby making it impossible to reduce anything accurately.<br/>2.                  Base not rigid or heavy enough.<br/>3.                  tai/stock base do not lock down well enough and operators often retightening it.       <br/>4.                  Tool rest do not lock down well enough.<br/>Finally, as the furniture and founding industries demand for cylindrical object increases, the need for effective, economical and efficient lathe arise. To meet up with the industrial demand and combat the problems found in the existing wood lathe machines, hence the embarkment of this project.    <br/>1.3              TREND IN LATHE MACHINE FABRICATION<br/>The emergence of the lathe machine dated back to some thousand years B.C., but it gained popularity between sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Then opticians used it for cutting lenses, used in the construction of astronomical Telescopes. They modified the relatively rough technique for special purposes. Artisans and furniture makers used the large lathes in turning fancy works, though the frames were made of wood and headstock depending on the work being done. <br/>Discussed below are some related lathe machines: <br/>A)        CENTRE LATHE MACHINE<br/>            The centre lathe is used to machine metals, by rotating the work piece mounted between centers against a cutting tool. The tool can be fed both transversely and longitudinally with respect to the turning axis of the job. The tool can be operated manually of automatically and many shapes as well as different works can be carried out on the centre lathe such work as cylindrical, eccentric or conical shapes can be machined. Also done on the centre lathe are threading and boring operations.<br/>B)        CERAMIC LATHE MACHINE<br/>            The ceramic lathe is used for ceramic machining alone, though the operation is similar to that of the centre lathe.<br/>C)        WOOD LATHE<br/>            The wood lathe, just like other types of lathe, can be used to carry out a wide range of machining operations. It saves time and does not need much skill as in the use of hand tools.<br/>1.4              DIMENSIONS AND SPECIFICATIONS<br/>Below are the dimensions and specification as regards the fabrication of the wood lathe machine.<br/>1.         Total length of the machine                1680mm<br/>2.         Total height of the machine                1200mm<br/>3.         With of the machine                           240mm<br/>4.         The electric motor                                           <br/>            Rpm                                                                                        2820rpm<br/>            Horse power capacity                                                 3hp<br/>            Power                                                                          2.2KW<br/>            Frequency                                                                   50Hz<br/>            Voltage                                                                                   240V<br/>            Current                                                                                    8.9/49A<br/>5.         The space between the bed rails                     140mm<br/>6.         Diameter of the headstock pulley       137mm<br/>7.         Diameter of electric motor’s pulley    98mm<br/>8.         With of tailstock                                                         240mm<br/>9.         V – belt                                                                                   A-56<br/>10.       Maximum length of work piece                      1100mm<br/>11.       Minimum length of work piece                       300mm<br/>13.       Maximum diameter of work piece                  300mm<br/>BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br/>            To improve the existing wood lathe machine so that the output is increase and operator fatigue is reduce.<br/>CONDITION OF USE<br/>            Lathe to be used in workshop environment, it must be able to withstand mechanical vibration.<br/>PERFORMANCE<br/>            Operation to be no noisier than when manually turned. Wood lather to be capable of an output higher than currently achieved in the existing once. The machine is to be operated continuously for a period of 8hours in a workshop environment without need for any attention. <br/>CAPACITY<br/>            The machine capacity is the distance between centers and the swing which are the two basic measurement of capacity for lathe. The distance between centers is the maximum length of wood you can turn between the headstock and the tailstock. While the swing determines the diameter of the jobs that can be turned over the bed.      <br/>RELIABILITY AND LIFE <br/>            The machine must be sufficiently reliable compare with the existing once. Life expectancy for full loading at 8hours per day must exceed 20years.<br/> STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>The continuous guest to have the problems of man and his growing needs solved has led to the establishment of factories and other industries, which necessitates an intermediate technology. However, simple hand tools that were in used before are no longer efficient for mass production. In the same manner the importation f wood lathe machine as a substitute for these tools, likewise has failed to meet man’s insatiable economy. <br/>Then, there comes the need for urgent attention to a better and locally made wood lathe machine. <br/>1.5              PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>The design and fabrication of wood lathe machine aims among other things at a maximum justification of a simple way of scraping and cutting off wood at its best quality at a minimum cost of labour, so that the financial burden of people can be reduced. <br/>The simple design and construction of the machine, makes it viable reliable, and easy to carry out maintenance services at minimum bearable cost. <br/>1.6              SCOPE OF WORK<br/>Essentially, the machine comprises the frame made of metal, with the headstock fixed in position; the tailstock moves along the bed of the machine, and the tool rest mounted on a cross slide which can be moved both longitudinally and transversely on the bed. It is located between the headstock and the tailstock.<br/>In operations, the machine is limited to only a turning and cutting of any type of wood. Drilling operations cannot be performed on the machine.   <br/> <br/><br/>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A WOODLATHE MACHINE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A WOODLATHE MACHINE", "id": 84}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>REPAIR AND REHABILITATION OF A FAULTY AIR CONDITION<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            The need for an authentic and reliable report relating to the repairs and rehabilitation of a faulty air-conditioner is inevitable.<br/>            Many homes and offices uses the air-conditioner to cool he temperature in their respective homes.  So the maintenance of the air-conditioner should be a top priority of every individual in order to avoid huge expenditure in the repairs of the system.  It’s for this reason that this report is written for the benefit of those whom are privileged to own an air-conditioner in their respective homes.<br/>            This report is based on ordinary and advanced level research, in order to aid easy reading and understanding for an average person.  This report begins with an introduction into the relevance of an air – conditioner, the history, description of the important components of the air – conditioner, the general maintenance and regular maintenance an serving, one is expected to carryout for effective performance of the air-conditioner and the faults discovered together with the repairs carried out.<br/>            Subsequently, advanced information pertaining to the repairs and calculations involving a faulty air conditioner have been giving certain sections of this report, which will be beneficial to those interested in the repairs of the faulty air conditioner.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/> <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1              Introduction<br/>1.2              Literature Review<br/>1.3              Definition Of An Air Conditioner<br/>1.4              Why We Use Air Conditioner<br/>1.5              Significance Of Study<br/>1.6              Limitation Of Study<br/>1.7              Basic Components Of Air Conditioner<br/>1.8              Functions Of The Components<br/>1.9              Air Conditioning System And Properties Of Air<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.1              Statement Of Problem/Faults<br/>2.2              How To Detect The Faults<br/>2.3              Brief Explanation Of Major Tools And Equipment’s Used<br/>2.4              Detecting Of Faults<br/>2.5              Correction Of Faults<br/>2.6              Connection Of The Electrical Components<br/>2.7              Detection Of Shortage Of Gas In The System<br/>2.8              Replacement Of Front Grille And Filter<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.1              Maintenance Of Breakdown Air Conditioner<br/>3.2              Causes Of Air Conditioner Breakdown<br/>3.3              What Is Breakdown Maintenance<br/>3.4              Categories Of Maintenance<br/>3.5              Groups Of Air Conditioner Maintenance<br/>3.6              General Maintenance And Repairs Schedules<br/>3.7              Safety Precautions<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.1              Principle Of An Air Conditioner<br/>4.2              Mathematical Representations And Thermal Efficiency<br/>4.3              Mathematical Analysis And Calculations<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>5.1       Cost Analysis<br/>CHAPTER SIX<br/>6.1              Performance<br/>6.2              Conclusion<br/>6.3              References<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/> <br/>1.1       INTRODUCTION<br/>            Over the years, all the tropical countries have been faced with the problem of air around them.  The relative humidity of air in most of the tropics is very low; Hence the comfort is not there with the populace especially in the places of work.  This consequently reduces the work rate of workers thereby affecting the GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT of a country. <br/>            To this effect, the engineers and scientists are looking into the methods of bringing comfort to the people while at home and at work.  They produced an appliance to help produce a cooler temperature for individuals known as AIR CONDITIONER.  This appliance has been in operation for a very long time but most users prefer dumping their old ones for new Air conditioner due to lack of knowledge on how to maintain, repair or even rehabilitate minor faults in an air conditioner.<br/>1.2       LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>            The origin of an air conditioner is necessary to trace.  Its original conception, and the people that were involved in its production at its initial state.<br/>An air conditioner was gradually developed and produced for cooling, cleaning  heating and facilitating ventilating processes such as:<br/>The end of the 15th century, Leonardo da rinci had built the first ventilating fan.<br/>In the year 1959, Boyle and also in the year 1800, Dalton discovered both discovered laws for ideal gases.<br/>In 1815 Robertson Buchanan published the first book on heating and ventilation.<br/>In the middle of the 19th century fans, boilers and radiators had been invented.<br/>In 1834, Alexander Twinning started commercial production of water ice, using the compression pump and sulphuric either as refrigerant.<br/>Second half of 19th century, brought about the further development of ice making and air conditioning processes.<br/>In the 20th century, Willis H. Carrier who is known as the “Father of Air Conditioning” designed and installed the first year round air conditioning system.  It was performing the four major functions of heating, cooling, humidifying and dehumidifying of the air or rather using the air washer.<br/>Willis H. Carrier (1976 – 1950) developed the applications of a forced draft fans, pipe coil heaters, centrifugal compressors, invented a psychometric chart and generally laid down the theory of air conditioning on a complete thermodynamic basis.  On the most famous paper “Regional psychometric formulae” published in the year 1911, Willis Carrier related the dry bulb, we bulb; dew point temperatures of air with its sensible, latent and total heat and presented a theory adiabatic chart.<br/>Air conditioning was increasingly been in use after Willis carrier’s invention; in cotton,  rayon, silk, paper, tobacco, cady pharmaceutical and printing industries all around the world.<br/>The first comfort for the people the air-conditioning was first installed in cinema building in 1920 in Chicago, employing dry ice machine and in 1922 in Los – Angeles using ammonia compressors.<br/>This brought about an increase in demand and expansion in air conditioning equipments sales to cinema, office building, hostels, hospitals, airport terminal, departmental stores, banks, shops, and individual homes etc in the market, the buyers were assumed of better packages than the earlier ones.<br/>1.3       WHAT IS AN AIR CONDITIONER<br/>            The provision of it can be defined as the process of treating air in order to clean or purify it, to control its temperature and humidity by heating or cooling and by humidifying and dehumidifying and to supply sufficient outdoor air for ventilation.  The word air conditioning is employed to any process or system which fulfil all these requirements. <br/>1.4       WHY WE USE AIR CONDITIONER<br/>1.                  According to science, oxygen is needed for human life and for any living thing to stay alive, is one of the vital use of an air conditioner.<br/>2.                  Air acts as a dilatants; ie the amount of air required depends on the permissible contaminant level for the room.  The contaminant may be C02 human skin or omission from any other processes.<br/>3.                  The air condition promotes air movement in t he space; this brings one of the environment comfort factors.<br/>4.                  An air conditioner controls air borne contamination i.e industrial ventilation.<br/>1.5       SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>            The purpose of studying about Air – conditioner        is to show how necessary it is needed in a house.  In other words, when one owns this appliance and its not functioning properly due to a faulty in the system, this study is very important and a guide to the relevant steps of maintaining and knowing what one should do in order to discover a fault in the air conditioner and having a solution.<br/>1.7       BASIC COMPONENTS OF AN AIR CONDITIONER<br/>            The air conditioning system has four basic component parts.  These are as follows:<br/>1.                  Compressor<br/>2.                  Condenser<br/>3.                  Metering device<br/>4.                   <br/>Evaporator<br/> <br/>Furthermore, there are other components as follows:<br/>1.                  Fan motor<br/>2.                  Fan blade<br/>3.                  Over load<br/>4.                  Relay<br/>5.                  Drier strainer<br/>6.                  Thermostat<br/>7.                  Flexible cable<br/>8.                  Air conditioning junction box<br/>9.                  Bulb<br/>10.              Fiber (lagging) material<br/>11.              Switch<br/>12.              The working fluid (refrigerant)<br/>13.              Back cover (Hide)<br/>14.              Capacitor<br/>15.              Filter<br/>16.              Grile<br/>17.              Fan Blower<br/>18.              Capillary <br/>1.8       FUNCTIONS OF THE COMPONENTS<br/>COMPRESSOR:      The compressor can be explained as the heart of mechanical air conditioning system.<br/>            The compressor pumps the refrigerant gas throughout the entire system.  It draws cool refrigerant gas through the suction line from the gas there by raising the pressure and temperature and then pumps it into the discharge line.<br/>            There are various types of compressor namely:<br/>1.                  Rotary compressor<br/>2.                  Reciprocating compressor<br/>3.                  Centrifugal compressor<br/>4.                  Screw compressor.<br/> THE CONDENSER:           The condenser is a component in the air conditioner, which transfers heat from air conditioning system to a medium where they can be absorbed and moves it to the final disposal point.<br/>            The condenser is the channel through which unwanted heat is liberated out of the air conditioning system.  It is the condenser that superheated high pressured refrigerant vapour is cooled to its boiling (conferring) point by rejecting sensible heat.  The additional rejection of latent heat causes the vapour to condense to the liquid state.<br/>TYPES OF CONDENSER<br/>1.                  Water cooled shell and cool condenser<br/>2.                  Water cooled shell and tube condenser<br/>3.                  Air cooled condenser<br/>4.                  Evaporative condenser.<br/>THE EVAPORATOR<br/>            The evaporator is a device in the low pressure side of an air conditioning system through which an unwanted heat flows.  The evaporator absorbs the heat into system in order that it may be moved or transferred to the condenser.  The evaporator is also known as a “cooling” blower cool, “Chilling unit “.<br/>            Its ultimate function is to absorb heat from the surrounding air or liquid and by means of refrigerant the heat

evaporator<br/>3.                  Submerged coil evaporator<br/>4.                  Boud lot/coolers.<br/>OTHER COMPONENTS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS<br/>DRIER/STRAINER:           This serves as the filter for the filtration of the refrigerant gas, also small amount of heat reduction takes place in it.<br/>OVER LOAD AND RELAY:         These are sensitive materials inside the air conditioner, they serve the purpose of protecting the compressor by tripping off any unwanted current coming into the compressor thereby preventing damage to compressors. <br/>THERMOSTAT:      This can be explained as when the air conditioner attains its maximum cooling point, the thermostat will cut off current; also, it trips off the compressor when the voltage is low.<br/>FLEXIBLE CABLES:         Flexible cables are their copper wire that supplies current from the power source with the help of plug to the air conditioner.<br/>BULB:            Bulb is a power indicator, it lights up when the current has entered the air conditioning system.<br/>FOAM THAT COVERS THE INTERNAL BODY: This is a substance which covers the in cover of the air conditioner so as to avoid loss of cool air or escape of cooled air that comes from the evaporator.<br/>SWITCH:      The switch controls the current coming into the air conditioning system; that is, it is the key which opens and closes (on and off) the activities of the air conditioner.<br/>FRONT GRILLE:    Front grille is used to cover the front part of an air conditioner in other to prevent damages to other components a round it.<br/>FAN MOTORS:        It is known as the unit in between the fan blade and the fan blower where the current is produced to drive the fan blade and fan blower.  <br/>FAN BLADE:           The fan blade is located at the back of the condenser.  It blows away hot air from the room.<br/>FAN BLOWER:       This can be located at the back of the evaporator system.  It blows cool air from the system into the room.<br/>FILTERS:     This is an instrument that filters the air in other to prevent the dust in the air from entering the evaporator.<br/>CAPACITOR:          The capacitor is a unit used to charge and draw more current; it is also used for starting period in maintaining the lowest mark of change in temperature from hot to cold.<br/>CAPILLARY TUBE/METERING DEVICE:     This device is carefully calibrated in length and inside diameter to meet the exact amount of liquid refrigerant flow required for each unit.<br/>FIBER (LAGGING) MATERIAL:           This material is mostly made of wool and it is used to prevent the loss of heat in order to maintain the temperature of the air conditioner.<br/>1.9       AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM/THE PROPERTIES OF AIR<br/>            Air is the medium at which an air conditioner works, before we cool or heat it, we have to condition it first; by so doing, it cools or heats a building and makes it s occupants comfortable.<br/>            An air conditioning is the complete conditioning of air by heating, cooling, humidifying, dehumidifying, filtering, cleaning and distribution.<br/>             All the systems do not   require the induction of all these conditioning processes, but each system requires consideration of all the processes.  The atmospheric air is composed of (i) Dry air (ii) Moisture in the form of water vapour or s team (iii) impurities such as smoke, dust and toxic gases.<br/>            Pure dry air is a moisture of several gases like oxygen, nitrogen and varying amount of carbon (iv) oxide and the inert gases.<br/>PERCENTAGE BY WEIGHT OF

participated indeed in mass shelling of corn using the most primitive, cumbersome, and difficult method of hand shelling which encourages rime consuming and human stressfulness.  Corn otherwise known as “Oka” in Igbo tribe is mostly sued seed across all the tribe in this country today.  It is widely used in homes, hotels, and schools for eating and seedling process (when dried).  It is therefore very rare to see any Nigerian who has not tested it in one way or the other.<br/>            Now, since it is very imperative for dieting inclusively, it can be refined to form varieties of food supplementary diet such as making of Akamu (pap), Semovita corn pounded, corn mill etc. Today, in our industrial sectors such as ceramics and biscuit industry, it is widely used for making of biscuit, flouring for bakery of the bread, and corn mill.  Infact to summarize all this, junked food that are baked in supermarket today are mostly involves corn in making them.<br/>            In the light of this as technology advance forward, an introduction of this machine (sheller) made manifest and come into existence which is more stressless, easy to operate, low costing, and time reduction with high degree of production volume and efficiency.  Modifications have also made it possible to be manually and electro-mechanical operated type depending on the choice of design and the speed of shaft required.<br/>            Today, with the aid of this, it has created availability of corn sheller (shelling machine) even in the market which indeed removes our difficulties and impossibilities when using and engaging with modern method of design.<br/>1.1       PURPOSE OF CONSTRUCTION<br/>            This project is meant to achieve the following purposes.<br/>(1)               To design and construct a corn sheller which is easy to operate with high degree of efficiency.<br/>(2)               To design and construct a machine (corn sheller) that would save time and cost, with high degree of production volume.<br/>(3)               To design and construct a corn sheller that would not have much breaking effect of grains, leaving the cobs intact during the process.<br/>(4)               To design and construct a corn sheller that is economic and have little or no complication in maintenance<br/>(5)               To design and construct a corn sheller with high percentage of local technology.<br/>(6)               To design and construct a machine that is cost effective manual stress reduction.<br/>1.2              IMPORTANCE AND SPECIFICATION OF THE PERFECT<br/>The importance attached to this design is the facilitation and the production of voluminous corn shelling without much time and without encountering much breakage of the grains of the corn in shortest possible time.<br/>The specification was obtained considering the items or component used and the hopper and barrel dimensions put into consideration as well.  The design parameter for corn sheller machine are:<br/>1.2.1        BARREL<br/>(a)        Outer barrel:-            This barrel do not rotates with the shaft rather stands on itself inside the shelling chambers.  It is a half of glindrical shaped perforated below to enable shelled corn to rush out to the conveyor to the outlet basin.  It is weld and tight at ges at the end for the location of the bearings for the shaft.  At the lower end of one is an open segments serving as outlet for the cobs and a hood is built covering it.<br/>            Below is a complete drawing of the outer barrel shown.<br/>DRAWING<br/>(B)       Inner barrel:- This cylindrical barrel rotates with the shaft support by  end to end bearings.  The diameter of the shaft is and for the inner barrel’s diameter is, having number of spikes measuring from the barrel surface and also wounded vanes that does the shelling process.<br/>          1.2.2        HOPPER<br/>This is similar to a port but the difference is that it is bigger and not covered like the port.  It is eight rapezoid or rectangular in shape, each shape chose have its advantage and disadvantages.  It has an entry through which the corn enters the shelling chamber and the inner engulfing the shaft.  It is obtained after cutting a mild steel and welding it with gauge 12 electrode and it’s dimension is.<br/>1.2.3        RECEPTACLE<br/>This is the outer funnel that collects the shelled corn from the conveyor to the outside.<br/>1.2.4        SPIKES<br/>This is the rod attached to the surface of inner barrel which does the shelling process with the inner barrel and the spring vanes.  It is to 27 in number and measured vertically up from the barrels surface each.<br/>1.2.5        COB OUTLET<br/>This is an exit through which the cobs goes out of the barrel after shelling process.<br/>1.2.6        CONVEYOR<br/>This is the carriers that conveys/carry's the cobs out of the barrel after shelling process.<br/>1.2.7        DISCHARGED CHAMBER<br/>These are the holes perforated below the outer barrel through which the shelled grain corn falls out to the conveyor.<br/>1.2.8        COLLECTOR/OUTLET BASIN<br/>This is curved mild steel welded below the perforated outer barrel inclined to enable the falling out of the shelled corn to the receptacle. <br/>1.2.9        INLET<br/>This is the particular place in the hopper through which the corn enters the shelling unit/chamber for shelling process it is measured as.<br/>1.2.9.1 SPINNING VANES<br/>            This is made up of flat tiny metal welded round the inner barrel together it the spikes.  It is the part of the machine where the corn is being shelled.  It is also placed horizontally wounded around the inner barrel and should be capable of withstanding impact from corn and posses good chemical resistance, high working temperature (100%) and tensile strength.  Dimensionally, it is measured 30mm from the surface of the inner barrel wounded horizontally.<br/><br/>\n\nDESIGN AND FABRICATION OF

machine is used for the removal of mescals from the palm fruit. The processes used in the digestion vary according to fundamental technological developments, which affect the system of operation. <br/>The digestion of palm fruit is as old as mankind. The various level of social development change the phase of the digestion action.<br/>The relative humidity content of the palm fruit and other associated, physical sand chemical composition of the palm fruit affect the choice of processes for the digestion of palm fruit.<br/>The digester system within the African countries is usually done in pastel and mortar. The palm fruit is fed in a hermitical cross-sectional mortar and pounded with many reciprocatory up and down blows. This action tends to remove the monocarp from the palm fruit in marshy oil dropping from. This mashy – oil – dropping form now give why for pressing operation which will lead to the bringing out the palm oil. The digester system within the African countries can also bed done in a horizontal sump of about 6ft x 3ft with 8 3ft depth where the palm fruit will be poured when that is done a person will stand on the palm fruit right in the hole and be matching on it for a short period after which the monocarp will be removed from the Nut when it is pressed the oil will come out.<br/>In the fundamental technological development, engineering designs encouraged the construction of different – proto type of digester which aids in the production of more digestible mashy fruit. There are different types of digesters. They are classified into:<br/>1.         Manual digester <br/>2.         Motorized digester.<br/>1.2              MANUAL DIGESTER <br/>Manual digesters are built with different shapes and patterns. These is a ways a handle which is used to turn the palm fruit in the barrel the shaft of the digester is designed and welded onto with flanges of barrel depending on the size of the barrel used the operation is efficient but very slow and involve a lot of human effort for high production. This method of operation can not go on for industrial use because of its low production rate. Above all human effort tends to dominate the whole operation manual digesters are mostly common in industrial African villages and communities where there is no rural electrification. <br/>1.3              MOTORIZED DIGESTER <br/>Motorized digesters consist of a machine with a power driver pulley from the electric motor. The source of power transmission is belt from the driver (i.e) elector motor pulley to the driven digester pulley. The pulley is keyed to the shaft which is supported on two ball bearings located on each end of the shaft. The type of shaft used is the step shaft with the flanges welded unto the bigger correctional part of the shaft. The shaft assembly and flanges are enclosed in a barrel which is usually cylindrical, and the barrel internal surface is about 2cm – 5cm depending on the verities of palm fruit intended for digestion.<br/>1.4              TYPES OF MOTORIZED DIGESTER <br/>Horizontal types of the motorized digester are classified depending on the axis of mounting of the barrel and shaft. The horizontal digester are designed with shaft and barrel parirel to the horizontal axis and will incorporate an electric motor that will generate power to the system that will enable the system to function accordingly the vertical digester are this type which the axis are built at right angle to the horizontal axis, the shaft and barrel are positioned in a vertical direction to work effectively. Most designers prefers this type of vertically mounted system because of it high efficiency and easy construction and even good out put in terms of digestion.     <br/><br/>\n\nDESIGN AND FABRICATION

 <br/>References                              <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>            Creep is defined as time – dependent deformation of a material under a constant stress or load.  At temperature less than 40 percent of the absolute melting point, the extent of creep if negligible, but at temperatures higher than this is commonly thought of as a high temperature test.<br/>            The creep material measuring device is a simple unit designed for demonstrating and investigating the creep characteristics of lead polypropylene specimen at room temperature.  A temperature module is provided to enable the investigation/effects of the temperature as a creep rate.<br/>            A failure may also be due to a phenomenon called creep, which is the plastic flow of a material under load at elevated temperatures in addition, the actual shape of a part may be responsible for failure for example stress concentrations due to sudden changes in contour must be taken into account.  This is especially true when dynamic loads with direction reversals exist and the material is not very ductile.<br/>            The single specimen creep measuring apparatus/machine is a table top apparatus measuring dimensionally 740 x 470 x 310 mm and approximated weight of 14.5kg.  This simple machine uses specimens of lead and various types of plastics which creep significantly at temperature and under loads. <br/>            The design is based on a simple lever principle having a mechanical advantage of 8:1 which provides a steady and uniform tensile load.  The extension of the specimen under load is measured by a dial guage.<br/>            It is made up of vertical column which is the main supporting frame, a lever beam, a stop watch, dial guage, a set of weigh hanger, connecting strip, Aluminum block, Ammeter, circuit breaker, volt meter, temperature control, thermocouple, Heating element and a panel made of mild steel shut to house the above mentioned components.  To ensure correct loading of the specimen, the load beam is filted with harden connecting strip which load is applied by means of a set of weight hanger as required.  This apparatus is especially designed for teaching.<br/>            Generally for satisfactory use of this equipment, a bunch of approximately 1 x 0.6m is recommended.<br/>            A creep curve is a plot of the elongation of a tensile specimen versus time, at a given temperature, under a constant load.  The four stages of creep curve is (1) initial elongation flowing the application at load,

de/dt, is continuously decreasing as show in the figure above.  This is of interest to a designer since it forms part of the extension reached in a given time and may affect clearance.<br/>THE SECONDARY CREEP<br/>Fig 1.2:            This section is a period of approximately constant creep rate and is termed secondary creep; the creep rate is at a minimum over this region.<br/>            This secondary stage is the region at which creep occurs at more or less “STEADY STATE”.  This is the important part of the curve for most applications.<br/>THE TERTIARY CREEP<br/>Fig 1.3:            This stage represents a continuously increasing creep rate and terminates in fracture of the specimen as shown in the figure above.  This tends to be the final stage of the creep curve when the rate

Thus refrigeration is the process of removing heat from a lower temperature. <br/>By its nature heat from a body at a higher temperature to another at a lower temperature but the reverse is the case; it requires external energy to be accomplished.<br/>The refrigeration is accomplished by various methods, such as the vapour compression system, absorption system and steam jet refrigeration cycle. In this project only vapour refrigerating compression system shall be discussed as it is the method used to accomplish to the raising of standards of living of all chastise of people.<br/>Although refrigeration is primarily of thermodynamics but the advances made in refrigeration in recent years are the result of a team approach in which technicians, craft persons, engineers scientists and others from other phases of engineering pool skill and knowledge in the design, manufacture, application and operation of the refrigeration complete knowledge of thermodynamics and properties of refrigeration must be known before the complete cycle analysis can be made.<br/>1.1              THE APPLICATION OF THE REFRIGERATION PRINCIPLE <br/>The application of the refrigeration principle is limitless. The most common used and one that is readily recognized is the preservation of food. Almost all products in the home, on form in industries of in the laboratories are in some ways affected by refrigeration. Thus refrigeration has become an essential commodity in modern living as no family will afford to miss it.<br/>1.2              PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT <br/>The objectives and purpose of the project is to achieve the following viz:<br/>a.                   To design and construct portable domestic cooling equipment that would improve on existing design taken into consideration. <br/>b.                  To design and construct a cooling system that is efficient with little or no complexity in maintenance.<br/>c.                   To design and construct cooling equipment that is economical, with a reduced height. <br/>1.3              BENEFITS OF THE PROJECT <br/>Foodstuff can be preserved with the deep freezer for a very long time to avoid being spoilt before usage. <br/>The design and fabrication of the mobile deep freeze has broadened our practical knowledge and we can be self reliance, if one may decide to go into production in the rear future and acts as a consultant. We can equally work efficiently without or with little guidance.  <br/>ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IN THE REFRIGERATOR <br/>            The power supply from the plug goes to the thermostat, from it to the fuse (overload), from it to the common terminal of the relay of the compressor system using a compressor. In the 1850s there were much development on vapour compression systems and later the introduction of ammonia as a refrigerant enabled efficiency and reliability to be much improved. <br/>            In retrospect refrigerants themselves did more than anything to hold up the development of refrigeration some that are available that time were poisonous or explosive, or both other functions only at pressing so high as to acquire compressors and systems component to be constructed like battle ships, prime movers to noted, this gives a refrigerant a disadvantage. A break through was attained when Thomas Midgly and his associates discovered dichloride flour methane CECl2F2. In three days when tested, it confirm positive function of a refrigerant and it was code named R12.<br/>            The boom of refrigeration were then refracted by world war II but its end made manufacturing facilities available and there was a boom in refrigeration industries and its commercial outlets bigger and better and stores were needed at the docks certainly. Industries use refrigeration in making antibodies and cooling moved in machines churning out such diverse product as condles and golf balls.<br/>            The rapid expansion in refrigeration was accompanied by an almost equal dramatic increase, in air conditioning equipment sales to cinema and theaters, office buildings and bolds hospital air terminal buildings, departmental stores banks and shops, large and small. And the demand grew up for household goods.<br/>     <br/><br/><br/>\n\nDESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A 12M3 MOBILE DEEP FREEZER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A 12M3 MOBILE DEEP FREEZER", "id": 89}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF PUNCH AND DIE FOR PRODUCTION OF CUPS<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            This project is constructed based on careful theoretical analysis of materials of chance and reasons for the selection of the materials.<br/>            The theoretical analysis of heat principles and temperatures of the different fervid which in solid stage should set in the mould were analyzed.<br/>The basic principles of cooling of the mould to avoid physical problems of cracks and distortions involved when high temperature are were studied.  The cup mould design started with the choice of the optimal dimensions and then production of the wooden pattern.<br/>With the completion of the wooden pattern of dimensions 26cm x 12cm x 5cm, the pattern was filled with chemical treated sand and fired over the oven for complete drying exercise.  With the drying operation over, the patterns were filled with the sand and rammed well.  The risers and provision for the core were all provided.  The upper and lower parts of the pattern were tightly fixed together.  The instance of the complete filling and ramming, molten aluminum from the furnace was poured into the pattern.  After about one day, the pattern was opened and then the formed cup mould of aluminum produced.

increase.  With it comes the choice of various designs and models.  This has led to the design of a good number of machines that can be used by the craftsmen to create different wood designs amongst which is the wood lathe machine.<br/> 1.1       OBJECTIVES<br/>            The main objectives of this project are to:<br/>(a)        Use available local materials in fabrication<br/>(b)        Achieve a reduction in the cost of production of the machine<br/> (c)        Reduce the labour cost and time spent on using hand tools for wood dressing<br/>(d)       Create awareness for, and encouragement of indigenous technology<br/>(e)        Increase Productivity and creativity <br/>            The vital need for the fabrication of wood lathe is significant in the much delay and time as well as energy wasted in using simple hand tools to carry out jobs moreover, the cost of importation of a lathe machine is tool high for an average war.  Similar to the use of other machine tools, the wood lathe machine will help to reduce the cost and consequently increase the rate of production and craftsmen skill.  It is also important to explore the design of machines to improve on the ones already in existence.<br/>1.2       LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>            This covers a brief but concise history of the lathe machine, and other works relevant to this project, which had been done earlier.<br/>1.3       TREAD IN LATHE MACHINE FABRICATION<br/>            The emergence of the lathe machine date back to an unknown period, but it gained popularity between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.  Then opticians used it for cutting lenses used in the construction of astronomical telescope.  They modified the relatively rough technique for special purposes.  Artisans and furniture makers used the larger lathes in turning frame works though the frames were made of wood and had one or two headstocks depending on the work being done.  The wooden frame made it inaccurate. <br/>Discussed below are some related lathe machines:<br/>A.        CENTER LATHE MACHINE <br/>            A center lathe is used to machine metals, by rotating the work fierce mounted between centers against a cutting tool.  The tool can be fed both transversely and longitudinally with respect to the turning axis of the job.  The tool can be operated manually or automatically and many shapes as well as different works can be done on the center lathe. Such work as cylindrically, eccentric or conical shape can be machined.  Also done on the center lathe are threading turning and boring operations.<br/>B.        CERAMIC LATHE MACHINE<br/>            The ceramic – lathe is used for ceramic machining along, though the operation is similar to that of the center lathe.<br/>C.        WOOD LATHE<br/>            The wood lather, just like other types of lather, it can be used to carry out a wide range of machining operations, it saves time and does not wed much ski //s as in the use of hand tools.<br/>1.4              DIMENSIONS AND SPECIFICATIONS<br/>Below are the dimensions and specifications as regards t the fabricated wood lathe.<br/>1.                  Total length of the machine<br/>2.                  Total height of the machine<br/>3.                  Width of the machine bed<br/>4.                  Angle of inclination of the tail stock<br/>5.                  The electric motor RPM<br/>Frequency<br/>Power<br/>Voltage<br/>Current<br/>Capacity <br/>6.                  The space between the bed rails<br/>7.                  Diameter of headstock pulley<br/>8.                  Headstock shaft diameter<br/>9.                  Diameter of motor fully<br/>10.              Width of tailstock (H – channel)<br/>11.              V – Belt<br/>12.              Maximum length of work<br/>13.              Minimum length of work<br/>14.              Maximum diameter of work<br/>1.5              STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>The continuous quest to have the problems of man and his growing need solved has led to the establishment of factories and others industries, which necessities an intermediate technology.  However, simple hand tools that were in use before are no longer efficient for mass production.  In the same manner, the importation of wood lathe machine, as a substitute for these tools, likewise has failed to meet man’s insatiable needs because of our unstable economy.<br/>Then, there comes the need for urgent attention to a better and locally made wood lathe machine.<br/>1.6              PURPOSE OF STUDY <br/>The design and fabrication of wood the lathe machine aims among others thing at justifying a simple way of scraping and cutting off wood at it’s hest quality at a minimum cost of labour, so that the financial burden if people can be reduced.<br/>The simple design and fabrication of this machine, makes it viable, reliable and easy to carryout maintenance services at the minimized cost.<br/>1.7       SCOPE OF WORK<br/>            Essentially, the machine comprises the made of metal, with the headstock fixed in position, the tail stock moves along the bed of the machine, and the tool rest mounted on a cross slide which can be moved both longitudinally and transversely on the bed it is located between the headstock and the tail stock.<br/>            In operations, the machine is limited to only scraping and cutting of any type of wood.

Man cooks his food and if not warmed at least every ten hours will get spoilt. Food items like boiled beans, yam, rice, beef etc spoilt. Some days due to lack of adequate preservation facility. Most also after some day work, man needs to take chilled drink in order to maintain or normalize his body temperature. For him to achieve this he uses clay pot to store drinking water. The clay pot does cooling but to an extent.<br/>Man can preserve his food by constant warming, drying under the sun, salting etc but that is not enough for total or adequate preservation. Nowadays, these methods of food preservation are not practiced again.<br/>            For more than decades this problem of food preservation has been a stumbling block in our homes. No sooner than latter did men star looking for a way to solve the problem hence the construction of cooling system (refrigerator)<br/>            The purpose and objectives of embarking on this project is to construct a cooling system that does cooling and preserves food items for future use. For this to be achieved. We need a machine that can transfer heat from a cold chamber which is at a temperature lower than that of its surroundings. This is because, bacteria that would have acted on the food items cannot survive in a very low temperature.<br/>            For a complete refrigeration process, we need to have the following parts of refrigeration system.<br/>1.   Compressor  -                  This  pumps the refrigerant or the gas through the entire system.<br/>2.    Condenser -                    This is the cooling coil for the hot refrigerant gas.<br/>3.    Drier Strainer -               It removes any moisture or impurities associated with hot refrigerant gas.<br/>4.   Metering Device -            The tube is usually soldered along the exterior of the discharge line, forming a heat exchange which helps to cool the hot liquid refrigerant.<br/>5.  Evaporator – At the evaporator, the refrigerant absorbs heat from the strange area and is gradually changed from a liquid and a gas mixture to a gas.<br/>6.  Accumulator -                   It prevents any liquid from returning or un-boil liquid from going into the compressor.<br/>It is very necessary to embark on this project to reduce the problem of lack of preservation facility our country is experiencing. The project is needed to boost our country’s modern technology. The benefits to be derived from this exploration are:<br/>(i)         To help us apply theoretical knowledge to solve industrials related problems.<br/>(ii)        To help us design and conducts a mobile refrigerator (cooling system) without any complication in maintenance.<br/>Age hardening, the stimulation of stratosphere conditions in the laboratory for the testing of all types of air craft equipment, including the engine themselves requires refrigeration at 670f.  In the process industries refrigeration is  used to carryout such operations as the separation used to carryout such operations as the separation of crystals from solutions.<br/>            Application of refrigeration in the medical profession is increasing daily, not only in the preservation of certain products, but also in the actual treatment of some physical ailments. The use of cold anesthesia” has shown great promise in the field of surgery. The manufacture of periling requires refrigeration and removal of moisture under high vacuum. The same process is required in the drying of blood plasma, and the preservation of blood, required refrigeration before the drying is accomplished.  <br/>            In the refrigeration food industry, development are occurring so rapidly that it is difficult to keep abreast of them increase application of domestic refrigeration’ have been supplemented by the entirely new field of domestic low-temperature cabinets for the preparation and storage of frozen foods, both uncooked and precooked.<br/>            In serving some of the function and considering the area and situation of need such as resort centers, picnic, school, etc. hence the need arise more than even prior to design of mobile cooling system of acceptable standard that will met certain essential requirement such as put ability and cost effectiveness.<br/>  <br/>\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF A MOBILE REFRIGERATOR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONSTRUCTION OF A MOBILE REFRIGERATOR", "id": 95}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>REPORT ON CONSTRUCTION OF NYLON SEALING AND CUTTING MACHINE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            This Nylon sealing and cutting machine has an added advantage of making 800 sealed bags per hour.  The constructional machines were sourced locally.<br/>            The machine can cut and seal Nylon at a affordable cost.  The constructional size of 31 cm x 7.5cm x 12.4 which comprises the following component.  The sealing and cutting filament, the transformer with 1000 turns of wire for the secondary and about 1200 turns for the primary.<br/>            Others includes the micro switch, tephlon tape and aluminum sheet casing.<br/>            The machine has high performance and efficiency with reasonable degree of accuracy.<br/>            In the fabrication of the machine aluminum sheet were marked and cut to size.  The aluminum is placed to protect it from external stress and damage.  The filament element and the micro switch converts electrical energy to heat energy.  The total cost of the fabrication is N4020 with exclusion of other cost.   <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>1.0       Introduction                                                                           <br/>1.1       Uses of Polythene/Nylon                                           <br/>CHAPTER TWO                 <br/>2.0       Literature Review                              <br/>2.1       Theory of Sealing       <br/>2.2       Sealing of Cellophane                        <br/>2.3       Types of Sealing                    <br/>2.4       Mode of Operation of the Machine   <br/> CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0       Constructional Procedure                                          <br/>3.1       Cost Estimation                                                         <br/>3.2       Recommendation                               <br/>CHAPTER FOUR                <br/>4.0       Maintenance of the Machine <br/>4.1       Conclusion                                                                 <br/>4.2       Reference                                                                   <br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>            Packaging of materials such as food stuffs, textile etc. is a phenomenon encountered in every day life.

It is defined also as a branch of science that deals with the process of reducing and maintaining the temperature of a space, substance or material below the temperature of the surrounding. <br/>For a space, substance or material to be cooled, it has to loose heat to another substance. On the other hand, for a material or substance to get hot, it has to absorb heat from another substance or material. Therefore heat is the agent of refrigeration process. For heat to flow there must be medium or mode to heat transfer. It is also a known phenomenon that heat flows from high temperature regions to low temperature regions by conduction, convention or radiation. However, in freezer and domestic refrigeration’s generally conduction and convention are employed as modes of heat transfer.<br/>Refrigerant is the cooling agent in refrigeration. It makes indirect contact with the substance to be cooled. It is circulated in refrigeration circuit and the attendant change of state from liquid to vapour brings about the necessary cooling that is required in the system, which also involves latent or sensible heats. <br/>Generally, when a mass absorbs heat, the following physical change takes place. <br/>1.                  The mass expands in physical dimension.<br/>2.                  The temperature increases.<br/>3.                  There may be change in phase (solid, liquid and vapour or gas) and vice versa. <br/>4.                  The specific density decreases (as the mass remains constant while the volume increases). <br/>Since the refrigerant evaporates and condenses it is necessary that the operation is cyclic. Over and over again the process is repeated in order to produce more cooling. A refrigeration cycle is said to be completed when the refrigerant has moved from a point round the components and back to the starting point. <br/>Worth of consideration is the  effect of pressure. It is a linear and positive relationship with temperature, which is the basic property of transmission. An increase in pressure of a body induces internal stress on the body. Also pressure increase brings an increase in the heat capacity of a body. For instance, and increase in the atmospheric pressure of water increase its boiling point and vice versa. This explains the reason for refrigerant to be sealed and circulated under pressure. We can rightly say that pressure increase or decrease of a substance brings about increase or decrease of the temperature on the substance respectively.  <br/>Nevertheless, heat does not flow from a cool region to a hot one as in refrigeration without work being done against the natural principle. This gives rise to energy  that  is required which is artificially produced and at this we talk of Deep Freezer. <br/>Deep freezer:   It is an electron – mechanical appliance, which maintains the temperature of substance, space or materials as required by the user i.e. it produces artificial cooling. It operates on the principle of Reversed Carnot Cycle. That is to say, I t absorbs heat from a low temperature and rejects it to a high temperature region. The compressor provides the conversion of energy  that is used in circulating the refrigerant round the circuit. <br/>The crankshaft, which drives the piston though the connecting rod, is moved by the torque produced by electric motor. The pumping effect of the piston produces the high pressure on the refrigerant, which set it in motion. In the cause of circulation and attendant change of state, the refrigerant returns to the initial state and ready for another cycle. <br/>In a deep freezer, the condenser performs function similar to that of the radiator in an automobile. It cools the hot refrigerant gas by giving out heat to the surrounding and changing to liquid. The liquid is delivered to the dryer, which traps moisture that can block the metering device. The liquid refrigerant passes though the metering device (capillar), which expands the liquid into the evaporator pipe, which is of larger cross sectional area. The pipe is laid on the inside of the Deep Freezer. A lot of insulation is done to isolate the refrigerated space from the surrounding and its heating effect. One fact remains that heat cannot be totally isolated from the refrigerated space. Yet it has to be reduced to the barest minimum. Other modification and appliances are put in place for convenience, efficiency and for security purposes. <br/>  <br/>\n\nREPAIR AND MAINTENANCE OF A FAULTY DEEP FREEZER IN THE DEPARTMENT OF

of heating in winter and by opening windows or using fans.  In summer, is now capable of being varied to meet almost any comfort of industrial demand, anywhere on earth with precise automatic control.<br/>With the introduction of air conditioner, the indoor air can be controlled through the blowing and sucking surrounding.  Thus because of its comfort to man, need for air conditioning, Engineers, contractors, manufacturers and Technicians rising on a daily basis.<br/>Now, consider for a moment the consequences which would result up all air conditioning systems were to stop.  Not only would the temperature and humidity condition become into levable, but industrial production would be adversely affected and activities involving computers, electronics, air craft, precision manufacturing, nuclear power, optics and synthetics, in fact most areas of modern progress would come to a hault.<br/>Today in business, industry, schools, hospitals, hotels, theatres and homes, air conditioner is no longer luxury but an essential part of modern living.<br/>1.2       DEVELOPMENT OF AN AIR CONDITIONING INDUSTRY<br/>            The development of air conditioning industry is an interesting story, illustrating well necessity for close working relationship among scientific, engineering, productions and its beginning with mechanical refrigeration.  In the late 1900s.  but it was not until 1917, when Nillis, H carrier began to meet the challenges of designing suitable experiment.  During the 1930s, the production of air-conditioning began and by firm scientific, engineering and production basis out with a limited market for its products.<br/>1.2              THE AIM AND THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT<br/>The aim of choosing this project, is to put in order the damaged air conditioner in proper shape and better condition for effective usage.<br/>To give wide knowledge of an air conditioner, types of operation and uses to the project group (student participating in the project).<br/>Also to show the need to repair than to rep0lace to or to purchase a new system.<br/>It also serves as a reference to other students that are to do a similar project.<br/>1.3              PRINCIPLE OF AIR CONDITIONER AREVERSED CARNOT CYCLE PRINCIPLE (REFRIGERATION CYCLE).<br/>The air conditioner is related to the refrigeration, hence, both use the same principle of the reversed carnot cycle.<br/>It is called the reversed carnot cycle because it operates in the opposite direction.  In the carnot cycle, heat is received by the  working fluid at a high temperature and rejected at a low temperature.  Both processes are isothermal and also two isentropic processes.  In this case, a net amount of positive work is done by the working fluid.  this is the working of heat engines or heat pump or carnot cycle, positive work is done.<br/>            But cycles can be formed in which the reversed happens.  In this case heat is added or received at a low temperature and rejected at a high temperature.  By so doing, a net amount of negative work is done on the fluid.  this for any refrigeration cycle, the process is made to remove heat from a space or substance to reduce its temperature and transferring that to another space or substance.<br/><br/>\n\nREPAIR OF AN AIRCONDITIONER IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT<div

This project is aimed at serving a community using a small and compact radio broadcasting equipment with a power watt of 1 watt a community of 1 kilometer in radius should be covered comfortable and the audio production very clear unlike the common noisy FM microphone project.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER 1 TRANSMITTER FUNDAMENTAL AND TYPES OF MODULATION<br/>1.1 Transmitters fundamental<br/>1.2       Modulations (analog and digital)<br/>1.3       Amplitude modulation<br/>1.4       Frequency modulation<br/>1.5       Method of fm<br/>1.6       Modulation overview<br/>1.61   Basic reactance modulator<br/>1.62 Theory of reactance modulator<br/>1.70 Types of reactance modulator<br/>1.7.1 Varacto diode modulator<br/>CHAPTER 2 AMPLIFIER EXPLANATIONS<br/>2.10              Amplifier explanations<br/>2.20              Class of amplifier<br/>2.21              Class of amplifier<br/>2.22              Class B amplifier<br/>2.23              Class AB amplifier<br/>2.24              Class c amplifier<br/>2.30              Oscillators<br/>2.31              Types of oscillators<br/>CHAPTER 3.0<br/>TRANSMISSION LINE<br/>3.10        FUNDAMENTALS<br/>3.30        Types of transmission lines<br/>3.31        Rectangular wave guide<br/>3.32        Circular wave guide<br/>3.33        Ridge Wave guide<br/>3.34        Optical fiber<br/>CHAPTER 4 <br/>POWER SUPPLY<br/>4.1 Stages of power supply<br/>4.2  Audio console power supply<br/>4.3 Transmitter power supply design<br/>            CHAPTER 5 AUDIO CONSOLE UNIT<br/>5.1 Audio console transducer<br/>5.2 Audio console pre-amp stage<br/>5.3 Audio console power amp stage<br/>5.4       Audio console control/mixer<br/>5.5       The operation of the audio console<br/> CHAPTER 6 TRANSMITTER AND ANTENNA DESIGN<br/>6.1             Oscillator stage design for transmitter<br/>6.2             Buffer/power amplifier design<br/>6.3             Tank circuit design<br/>6.4             Antenna design<br/>6.41 Types of antenna and application<br/>6.42    Antenna matching network<br/>6.43    Antenna design<br/>CHAPTER 7 COMPONENT DESCRIPTION AND CONSTRUCTION <br/>7.10    LM 386-power amplifier<br/>7.11 Capacitor<br/>7.12 Transistor<br/>7.2   Specification<br/>7.3 Construction and soldering<br/>7.4 Precautions taken during soldering<br/>7.5 Troubleshooting<br/>7.6 Transmitter strip board<br/>7.7 Audio console strip board<br/>RECOMMENDATION<br/>CONCLUSION<br/>REFERENCE:<br/>           LIST OF FIGURES AND DIAGRAM<br/>Fig 1.4  Information signal<br/>Fig 1.62  Reactance modulator circuit<br/>Fig 1.7  Reactance modulator elements<br/>Fig 1.7 Diagram of transistor reactance modulator<br/>Fig 1.8 Varactor diode modulator<br/>Fig 2.1  Amplifier configuration<br/>Fig 2.21 Class a wave form representation<br/>Fig 2.22 Voltage current characteristic of class b amp<br/>Fig 2.3 Block diagram of an oscillator<br/>Fig 3.2 Balanced line<br/>Fig 3.22 Unbalanced wire – line<br/>Fig 3.3  Method of wave propagation in a waveguide<br/>Fig 3.31 Te10 mode in a rectangular waveguide<br/>Fig 3.32  Circular waveguide<br/>Fig 3.33  Rectangular waveguide/ ridge<br/>Fig 3.4 Optical fiber cable<br/>Fig 4.1 Power supply block diagram<br/>Fig 4.2 Audio console power supply regulator<br/>Fig 4.3 Transmitter power supply<br/>Fig 5.2  Audio console pre-amp<br/>Fig 5.3 Audio console power amp<br/>Fig 5.4 Audio console control/ mixer<br/>Fig 6.1 Oscillator stage<br/>Fig 6.2 Buffer amp/power amp<br/>Fig 6.3 Tank circuit<br/>Fig 6.42 Antenna matching network<br/>Fig 7.1 LM 386 (power amp)<br/>Fig 7.11 Capacitor<br/>Fig 7.12 Transistor<br/>Bill of quantity<br/>Block diagram of audio console<br/>Block diagram of transmitter<br/>Audio console schematic<br/>Transmitter schematic<br/>Transmitter casing<br/>Audio console casing<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>This our project work is all about design and construction of a complete radio broadcasting equipment that is compact and miniaturized. It is capable of delivering a power output of 1 watt and assumed to cover a distance of 400 meters ie 200 meters radius depending on obstructions.<br/>            The transmitted signal is frequency modulated stays constant and its frequency varies according to the amplitude variations of the audio signal. When the input signals amplitude increases (ie during the positive half cycle) the frequency of the carrier increases too, on the other hand when the input signal decreases in amplitude (negative half-cycle or no signal) the carrier frequency decreases accordingly.<br/>            The output frequency of the transmitter is adjustable from 88 to 108 MHZ, which is the FM band that is used for radio broadcasting. The circuit as we have already mentioned consist of four stages. Three RF stages and one audio preamplifier for the modulation. The first RF stage is an oscillator is controlled by LC network L-C, C is there to ensure that the circuit continues oscillating and C adjusts the coupling between the oscillator and the next RF stage which is an amplifier. This is built around TR2 which operates in clas c and is tuned by means of L and C. the last RF stage is also an amplifier built around TR3 which operates in class c the input of which is tuned by means of c and l. From the output of this last stage which is tuned by means of l-c is taken then the output signal which through the tune circuit l-c goes to the aerial.<br/>            The circuit of the preamplifier is very simple and is built around TR4. The input sensitivity of the stage is adjustable in order to make it possible to use the transmitter wit different input signals and depends upon the setting of VRI. As it is the transmitter can be modulated directly with a piezoelectric microphone, a small cassette recorder etc. it is of course possible to use an audio mixer in the input for more professional results which we did<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>TRANSMITTER FUNDAMENTAL AND TYPES OF MODULATION <br/>1.1       TRANSMITTER FUNDAMENTALS <br/>            The AM transmitter generates such high power that it’s prime requirement is efficiency. Amplitude modulation can be generated at any point after the radio frequency source as a matter of fact, even a crystal oscillator could be amplitude modulated except that this would be an unnecessary interference with its frequency stability. If the output stage in a transmitter is plate modulated the system is called high-level modulation.<br/>            An AM transmitter which may be either low level or high level modulated have a stable RF source and buffer amplifier followed by RF power amplifier. The audio voltage is processed or filtered so as to occupy the correct bandwidth and compressed somewhat of reduce the ration of maximum to minimum amplitude.<br/>            In IM transmitter, the prime requirement of an FM system is a variable output frequency, with the variation proportional to the instantaneous amplitude or the modulation voltage.<br/>            The power and auxiliary stages of FM transmitter are similar to those in AM transmitter except that FM has an advantage, since it is a constant amplitude modulation system all the power amplifier can be operated in class c and that is very efficient.<br/>1.2       MODULATION (ANALOG AND DIGITAL <br/>Modulation is the systematic transformation of a carrier wave in accordance with the message signal. To a large extent the success of a communication system in any given mission depends on the modulation so much so that the type of modulation is a pivotal decision to system design. There are two basic types of modulating techniques the analog and digital modulation. Analogue modulation uses sinusoidal waveform as the carrier signal while digital modulation uses a discrete or pulse train as the carrier signal. Analogue modulation being a continuous process is obviously suited to signal that are continually varying with time. The carriers are at a frequency much higher modulating signal. The modulation process is thus characterized by frequency translation. Pulse modulation is discontinuous or discrete process in the sense that the pulses are present only at a certain interval of time. In the past, analogue modulation methods have been very largely exploited and still are because of the capital investment in existing systems and theirs basic simplify. The two most important methods of analogue modulation are amplitude modulation.<br/>1.3       AMPLITUDE MODULATION (AM).<br/>            In amplitude modulation the amplitude of a carrier the modulating voltage whose frequency is invariably lower than that of the carrier varies signal. AM is defined as a system of modulation in which the amplitude of the carrier is made proportional to the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating voltage. Let the carrier voltage and the modulating voltage Vc and Vm respectively be represented by<br/>Vc = VC Sin Wct<br/>Vm = Vm Sin Wmt<br/>Note that phase angle has been ignored in both expressions since it is unchanged by the amplitude modulation process from the definition of AIG amplitude vc. Of the unmodulated carrier will have to be made proportion to the instantaneous modulating voltage vm sin wmt where the carrier is amplitude modulated.<br/>1.4       FREQUENCY MODULATION<br/>Frequency modulation is a system in which the amplitude of the carrier is made constant whereas its frequency is varied about its unmodulated frequency in a way and manner determined by the amplitude of the modulating signal. When the information signal is positive the carrier frequency is increased above its unmodulated value. The increase in carrier frequency varies linearly with the instantaneous value of the information reaching a maximum when the modulating signal reaches its peak value. The converse applies when the modulating signals is negative ie the instantaneous carrier.<br/>Frequency being decreased in proportion to the instantaneous value the modulating or information signal.<br/> 1.5      METHOD OF FREQUENCY MODULATION<br/>There are two methods namely direct and indirect. In direct method, frequency modulation is obtained by varying the frequency of an oscillator. If either the capacitance or inductance of an L C oscillator tank is varied FM of some form will result and is the variation is made directly proportional to the voltage supplied by the modulation circuits true FM will be obtained. The direct modulator has the disadvantages of being based on an LC oscillator which is not stable enough for broadcast purposes.<br/>            And if the variation is made directly proportional to the voltage supplied by the modulation circuits true FM will be obtained. The direct modulators have the disadvantages of being based on an LV oscillator, which is not stable enough for broadcast purpose. This requires stabilization of the modulator with attendant circuit complexity: this method is called INDIRECT METHOD.<br/> 1.6      MODULATOR OVERVIEW<br/>            Of the various methods of providing a voltage variable reactions which can be connected across the tank circuits of an oscillator the most common are the reactance modulator and vibratory diode. These will now be discussed as below:<br/>1.61     BASIC REACTANCE MODULATOR<br/>            Provide that certain simple condition are met, the impedance Z as seen at the input terminal A-A of figure is almost entirely reactive. The circuit shown is the basic circuit of FET reactance modulator which behaves as a three- terminal reactance that may be connected across the tank circuit of the oscillator to be frequency modulated. It can be made inductive or capacitive by a simple component change. The value of this reactance is proportional to the Tran conductance of the device, which can be made to depend on the gate bias and its variations<br/>1.62     THEORY OF REACTION MODULATOR<br/>            In order to determine Z, a voltage V is applied to the terminals A-A between which the impedance is to be measured, and the resulting current i is calculated.<br/>            The applied voltage is then divided by this current giving the impedance seen when looking into the terminals. In order for this impedance to be a pure reactance (it is capacitive here). Two requirements must be fulfilled.<br/>Basic reactance  <br/>Modurator circuit       <br/>The first is that the bias network current ib must be negligible compared to the drain current. The impedance of the bias network must be large enough to be ignored. The second requirement is that the drain – to- gate impedance (Xc here) must be greater than the gate to source impedance (R in this case) preferably by more than 5:1. the following analysis may then be applied.<br/>Vg = ibR = RV<br/>R-jXc<br/>FET drain current is<br/>i = gmVg = gmRv <br/>                        R-jXc<br/>:. Impedance at A – A<br/>Z          = V = V – gmRv R – jXc<br/>i R-jXc gmR<br/>            = I . (I jXc)<br/>gm R<br/> <br/>Z = -j Xc<br/>gmR<br/>X eq = Xc = I  I . <br/>gmR 2P fgmRC = 2P Fceq<br/>Ceq = gmRc<br/>Xc = 1<br/>Wc = nR<br/>Ceq = gmRc = gmR<br/>            2 FnR<br/>ceq = gm<br/>2 Fn<br/> 1.7      TYPES OF REACTANCE MODULATOR<br/>            There are four different arrangement of the reactance modulator (including the one initially discussed), which will yield useful results. Their data are shown in table below. The general prerequisite for all of them is that drain current must be much greater than bias network current. It is seen that two of the arrangement gave a capacitive reactance and the other two gave an inductive reactance.<br/>            In the reactance modulator shown below an RC capacitive transistor reactance modulator, quite a common one in use operates on the tank circuit of a clap -Gouriet oscillator. Provided that the correct component values are employed any reactance modulator may be connected across the tank circuit of any LC oscillator (not crystal) with one provision. The oscillator used must not be one that requires two tuned circuits for its operation such as the tuned-base tuned- collector oscillator. The hartly and copitts (or clap-Gouriet) oscillators are most commonly used and each should be isolated with a buffer. RF chokes in the circuit shown are used to isolate various points of the circuit for alternating current while still providing a dc path.<br/> TABLE 1.7 reactance modulator elements<br/>NAME Zgd Zgs Condition Reactance Formula A<br/>RC Capacitive    C    R    Xc&gt; &gt; R    Ceq =gmRC<br/>RC Inductive    R    C    R&gt; &gt; Xc    Leq =RC<br/>gm<br/>RL Iductive    L    R    XL &gt; &gt;R    Leq = L<br/>gmR<br/>RL Capacitive    R    L    R&gt; &gt; XL    Ceq = gmL<br/>            A varactor diode is a semiconductor diode whose junction capacitance varies linearly with the applied voltage when the diode is reverse biased. It may also be used to produce frequency modulation. Varactor diode is certainly employed frequently, together with a reactance modulator to provide automatic frequency correction for an FM transmitter. The circuit below shows such a modulator. It is seen that the diode has been back biased to provide the junction capacitance effect and since this bias is varied by the modulating voltage which is in series with it, the junction capacitance will also vary, causing the oscillator frequency to change accordingly. Although this is the simplest reactance modulator circuit. It does have the disadvantage of using a two terminal device, its applications are some what limited. However it is other used for automatic frequency control and remote turning. <br/>To oscillator           <br/>                                         Cb (Rf)  AF in<br/>   Varactor<br/>

sealing machine is basically used for cellophane and nylon materials sealing.  It is a machine that uses the principle of light, heating materials or element to seal two impressed surfaces or even more impressed surface depending on the nylon usage and application.<br/>The packaging phenomenon was previously done by the use of paper bags but as time went on, this method changed to cellophane packaging system and till date, it has been growing.  This cellophane can be obtained by the process of polymerization of organic compounds to form polyethene.<br/>With the invention or introduction of technology, different types of packaging systems have been deviced, of which the most highly used is the cellophane  packaging and sealing.  Although, the use of time in packaging is still in use.  Cellophane packaging excels since it can be easily obtained, fabricated, as well as store materials of different shapes and sizes.<br/>The properties of poly ethane that made it to be highly useful in all aspects of packaging are inertness, high resistance of acid attack, water, base, organic chemicals, low coefficient etc polyehtene is used in packaging goods like ice cream, treated water, beverages, and biscuits, pharmerceutical products and some other fungicides like cocoabre sandus, copper sulphate (blue stone), ridomil plus etc.<br/>1.1    APPLICATION OF POLYETHENES (CELLOPHANE)<br/>          Cellophane is used for different forms of packaging which include:<br/>1.       Produces wrapping:       Low density polyethene is widely used in the packaging of fresh horticultural produce.  The touch and well sealed films are required for the packaging of these items.<br/>2.       Frozon food packaging:  The toughness of low density polyethene at low temperature coupled with the fact that it can be formed into bags on a film.  Seal basis has led to its use, in frozen food packaging.  These include frozen soft fruits, frozen milks, water etc.<br/>3.       General food pa ckaging:         The interness of low density polyethene has led to its used for packaging of foods like bread, ice cream, biscuits, margarine, storage of sugar etc because it will not react with the food item.<br/>4.       Textile packaging: The textile industries make use of low density polyethene bags to package the textile product after production so as to prevent it from being damped.<br/>5.       Packaging of pharmaceutical products:      The main use of high density polyethene is the strip or blister packaging of pharmaceutical capsules and tablets, especially in cases of hydroscopic products, owing to the high water penetration resistance of polyethenes.<br/>6.       High density polyethene are equally used in the packaging of aerospace hardwares and valves.<br/>7.       Low density polyethene film is used in the field of heavy duty sacks, its main advantage being that the sacks could be stored in the open air and high resistances to tear propagation and ensures visibility to the contents<br/>1.2    TYPES OF SEALING MACHINE<br/>1.       Cellophane sealing machine:   The cellophane sealing machines are used for polyethene and other associated materials.<br/>2.       Fibre bag sealing machine:      This type seals products that are usually contained in fibre salts.<br/>3.       Can sealing machine:     This is mostly used in the metallurgical industries for sealing metal can etc.<br/>4.       Paper sealing machine:  Products that are packaged in bags are usually sealed using the vacuum sealing machine type.<br/>1.3    OTHER USES OF CELLOPHANE ARE<br/>a.       As a sealant:         Cellophane is used in the sealing of plastic contains.<br/>b.       In manufacturing of rain coats:         Cellophane (polyethane) with high densities are used in the manufacturing of rain coats.<br/>c.       They are used as additives to other products.<br/>d.       In lamination:       Because many current packaging application requires combination of properties not available in any single packaging film, two or more different films, are often laminated to obtain the desired properties.  An extremely wide range of properties can be achieved in various combination of cellophane with polyethene aluminum foil, rubber, hydrochloride film, wax and pa per.<br/>e.       Printing:     A printed design or message may be applied to gravure, flexographic or letter press printing, and several colours may be applied consecutive to cellophane.<br/>g.       Hot – melt coating:         One important example is its use in the direct wrap, used on some varieties of processed cheese.<br/>          In our economy today, there is ever increasing demand for cellophanes and as such, it is very necessary to construct a cellophane sealing machine to meet the needs of the people. The project in guestion is aimed at providing this machine at a relatively cheap cost from locally gathered materials, thus, reducing the cost of production of cellophane sealing machine as well as to enhance the effective utilization of cellophane products.<br/>    <br/>\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF CELLOPHANCE SEALING MACHINE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONSTRUCTION OF CELLOPHANCE SEALING MACHINE", "id": 104}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CONSTRUCTION OF METAL SHARPENING AND DULLING DEVICE <br/>ABSTRACT </b><br/>As  a result of modern development in Science and Technology, most of the large scale industrial used machine were now modernized to simple small and efficient machines.

It is commonly referred to as a hand tool style which takes the form of a steel bar with a case hardened paralleled teeth.<br/>        Sharpening, therefore refers to as the process of heating or refining a sharp edge of appropriate shape on a tool or implement designed for cutting sharpening is done by grinding away material on the implement with an abrasive substance harder than the material of the implement, followed sometimes by processes to polish the sharp surface to increase smoothness and to correct small mechanical deformation without regrinding.<br/>        Most metal sharpening tools have a narrow pointed tang at one end to which a handle can be fitted.  A similar tool is the rasp. This is an older form with simpler teeth.  As they have larger clearance between teeth, these are usually used on soften non-metalic material (Ambrose etal 2007).<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Before the existence of metal sharpening, and dulling device, there has been a lot of difficult which one normally face when making use of metal tools which includes.<br/> Physical Strength: Due to the blunt nature of some sharpening instrument, the use of the metal tools requires great pressure and stress before one could achieve his or her main target.  This also cause over labouring of the one making use of the metal tools since it is blunt thereby reducing efficiency. Metal sharpening device enables a metal user to work on the metal with increased ease and efficiency. (Kurtman, 2003).<br/>1.3       AIMS/ OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>The aim of this project is to construct a metal sharpening and dully device which would facilitate the use of metal tools which causes a lot of stress since it has not been properly sharpened to the required extent.  This enables the sharpening of Chisels, plane and blades.  The objectives is to get two perfectly flat surface to end up with a finer grained steel.<br/>        Therefore, this construction creates more available materials for sharpening in order to enhance productivity and reduce human stresses due to the blunt nature of their grinding or metal cutting instrument used for various purposes. (Cheryl, 2011).<br/>1.4       METHOD OF RESEARCH <br/>The research was done by sourcing information from the library, internet, textbooks, and from previous projects.<br/>        Empirical research was also conducted by performing a standard construction of a sharpening or dulling device in the work shop.  The apparatus for the construction was set up and carried out with all the precaution strictly adhered to.<br/>1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>Construction of metal sharpening has played a significance role to mankind and industries.  Metal sharpening increases the productivity of the operators labour due to the increase in the production capacity of the machine tool.  The operator is freed of direct participation in the machining process and it becomes feasible for him to carry on several operation within a short period of time.<br/>        It reduces the physical effort required by an operators, free him of tediously repeated movements and from monotonous nervous and physical stresses.<br/>        One of the main objectives in industry is the integrated automation of manufacturing process. Therefore, the possibility of constructing a metal sharpening tools into an automated production line or automatic transfer machine which is one of the important requirement to be considered in a new metal sharpening and dully devices. For this purpose the layout of the units must be tied in with the handling system of sharpening line as well as with its system of sharpening.

ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>            In the past, cutting of grasses in the schools, sports track, or field, industries hotels, pubic center, etc was done by cutlass this method of manual cutting is time consuming a s it is human effort that is needed for cutting, there was also inaccuracy in cutting level using the manual cutting system.<br/>            Apart from all these old method of cutting there is also risk of accident.<br/>            The problems of the manual was meant to be overcome with the aid of this project (the construction of a mechanical lawn mower) which is used for cutting of grasses to equal height or level for speedy cutting.<br/>            This project lawn mower, is also the accident free as well, it reduced labour and also reduced number personnel that is needed in a particular operation, it also reduced man power as it an internal combustion engineer that dose the actual cutting while the operator provides the efforts, great portion of land can easily be cut with lawn mower.<br/>            Again to encourage beauty in our environment this project was embarked on to help in keeping our environment clean because most labourers are finding it difficult in handily tool for gasses cutting.  It is also used for cutting sports field, (like foot ball pitch as well as crowns in hotel and business premises so this project reduces human effort and should be encouraged in school, hotel, business area, etc although mowers can be of electric type too, but we decided to fabricate a mechanical type to overcome the problem of electricity and as such this our lawn mower can be used every where even were there is no electricity.<br/>IDENTIFICATION OF NEED<br/>            Early before now, West Africa as a whole, the peasant farmer depends on the hoe and cutlass for practically all farm operation.  There tools vary in shape and size from place to place in the high forest zone of Nigeria the small farmer must clear thick bush every three or four years.  All this job is being done either hoe or cutlass for weeding of farm land.  These farm operation depend entirely on the energy of the farmer using the tools which he has at this disposal.   This inability that facing the farmer, has triggered these project group to research into the lasting solution to the problem.<br/>            Also, with meant development in the country, daily labour in farm operation is highly exorbitant for the farmer to afford but with these project (mechanical lawn mower) this problem of high payment of local labour can lead to reduction importation cost from Germany USA of this machine Nigerian with high profitability to the farmers.<br/>1.2              LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>1.3              HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT (SCOPE)<br/>Based on the developing countries, technology in farm operation is highly increased.  It is clear that developments in farm machinery in West Africa started far back 1960.  This project must related to the social and ecological condition prevailing in different parts of this great region at the present time two trends a re apparent.<br/>i.                    Increase in the use of tractors and large agricultural machinery of farms of large extent both in the high forest and savanna zones, but particularly in the latter.<br/>ii.                  The increased use of animal power and small machines on peasant farms operation in West Africa will become increasingly mechanized, and that stage of mechanization mechanized, and that stage of mechanization which lies between the hoe and cutlass on one hand and the tractor combine harvester on the other is referred to as intermediate technology.<br/>1.4       IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT TO SOCEITY   <br/>            Generally this project (mechanical lawn mower) has a great effect towards development and maintenance of any community in the societies which one nominated below.<br/>1.                  Cutting grass of secondary primary and tertiary field thereby reducing human effort needed.<br/>2.                  Great portion of farmland can easily cut or brushed with lawn mower in one day.<br/>3.                  This project reduced number of personnel that needed in a particular farm operation.<br/>4.                  To reduce manpower<br/>5.                  To improve the economy of the country<br/>6.                  Provisions of foreign exchange in the country<br/>7.                  t reduce importation cost t o our country (Nigeria)<br/>8.                  It encourage pupils, and student to be regular and the school because no more cutting of grass with cutlass by pupils or students.<br/>1.5       AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT<br/>            In the past, several investigation w ere made in the lawn mower industry at USA, Germany etc. Nigerian market, from which this production is a development of already existing ones.  It was localized to smite our environments condition aim and objectives of the investigation on the project are nominated below.<br/>1.5.1    REDUCTION OF LABOUR COST<br/>            In application of lawn mower machine in any government field and farm land causes seriously reduction in number of labour needed in the maintenance of the yard, brushing and clearing of the grass but with aid of lawn mower machine, the job is easily performed without much wasting of time.  This project IMT can get the yard well cutted and cleared.<br/>1.5.2    IMPROVEMENT OF FOOD PRODUCTION<br/>            Local farmer can embark on maintenance of 100 hectares of farm land with aid of lawn mower machine.  This project will extract some lazy farmer to embark on farming operation, also many people will developed interest and rendering agricultural engineering or course related to farm.<br/>1.5.3    TIME FACTOR<br/>            The production of this project (lawn mower machine) brings reduction in man hour consumed in cutting of grass which is being improved using lawn  mower machine which employed some minute of an how for  the job.<br/>1.5.4                                IMPROVEMENT IN ECONOMY.<br/>Having farmer embark on large farm land for production of food to the citizen birth aid of lawn mower machine but not hand tools is bound so produce supply enough quantities food to market which extract improvement of country and also ensure stability and the foreign exchange.  Also boosting of employment to the youth of the town.<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF MECHANCIAL LAWN MOWER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn

It is commonly referred to as a hand tool style which takes the form of a steel bar with a case hardened paralleled teeth.<br/>        Sharpening, therefore refers to as the process of heating or refining a sharp edge of appropriate shape on a tool or implement designed for cutting sharpening is done by grinding away material on the implement with an abrasive substance harder than the material of the implement, followed sometimes by processes to polish the sharp surface to increase smoothness and to correct small mechanical deformation without regrinding.<br/>        Most metal sharpening tools have a narrow pointed tang at one end to which a handle can be fitted.  A similar tool is the rasp. This is an older form with simpler teeth.  As they have larger clearance between teeth, these are usually used on soften non-metalic material (Ambrose etal 2007).<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Before the existence of metal sharpening, and dulling device, there has been a lot of difficult which one normally face when making use of metal tools which includes.<br/> Physical Strength: Due to the blunt nature of some sharpening instrument, the use of the metal tools requires great pressure and stress before one could achieve his or her main target.  This also cause over labouring of the one making use of the metal tools since it is blunt thereby reducing efficiency. Metal sharpening device enables a metal user to work on the metal with increased ease and efficiency. (Kurtman, 2003).<br/>1.3       AIMS/ OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>The aim of this project is to construct a metal sharpening and dully device which would facilitate the use of metal tools which causes a lot of stress since it has not been properly sharpened to the required extent.  This enables the sharpening of Chisels, plane and blades.  The objectives is to get two perfectly flat surface to end up with a finer grained steel.<br/>        Therefore, this construction creates more available materials for sharpening in order to enhance productivity and reduce human stresses due to the blunt nature of their grinding or metal cutting instrument used for various purposes. (Cheryl, 2011).<br/>1.4       METHOD OF RESEARCH <br/>The research was done by sourcing information from the library, internet, textbooks, and from previous projects.<br/>        Empirical research was also conducted by performing a standard construction of a sharpening or dulling device in the work shop.  The apparatus for the construction was set up and carried out with all the precaution strictly adhered to.<br/>1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>Construction of metal sharpening has played a significance role to mankind and industries.  Metal sharpening increases the productivity of the operators labour due to the increase in the production capacity of the machine tool.  The operator is freed of direct participation in the machining process and it becomes feasible for him to carry on several operation within a short period of time.<br/>        It reduces the physical effort required by an operators, free him of tediously repeated movements and from monotonous nervous and physical stresses.<br/>        One of the main objectives in industry is the integrated automation of manufacturing process. Therefore, the possibility of constructing a metal sharpening tools into an automated production line or automatic transfer machine which is one of the important requirement to be considered in a new metal sharpening and dully devices. For this purpose the layout of the units must be tied in with the handling system of sharpening line as well as with its system of sharpening.
