Typically, a chat bot will communicate with a real person. Chat bots are used in applications such as ecommerce customer service, call centres and Internet gaming. Chatbots are programs built to automatically engage with received messages. Chatbots can be programmed to respond the same way each time, to respond differently to messages containing certain keywords and even to use machine learning to adapt their responses to fit the situation. A developing number of hospitals, nursing homes, and even private centres, presently utilize online Chatbots for human services on their sites. These bots connect with potential patients visiting the site, helping them discover specialists, booking their appointments, and getting them access to the correct treatment. In any case, the utilization of artificial intelligence in an industry where individuals’ lives could be in question, still starts misgivings in individuals. It brings up issues about whether the task mentioned above ought to be assigned to human staff.

        "content": "CHAPTER ONE\n1.1\t\t\t\tGENERAL INTRODUCTION\nAlong with the popularization and application of information technology in all areas of society, office automation management has increasingly become a trend. The information office has changed the traditional mode of operation, thus to improve the information and the efficiency of data processing, greatly saving manpower, material resources and labor.  Due to the vigorous development these days, the function and performance demanded by the people is rising. Gymnasium and health club in the management aspect are facing many problems, such as low efficiency and performances. In order to solve these problems effectively, to improve the operations benefits of gymnasium owners, this project has carried out the design of the gymnasium management system.\nA gymnasium is an open air or covered location for gymnastics, athletics, and gymnastic services. The word is derived from the ancient Greek gymnasium. The importance of a gymnasium and physical fitness cannot be emphasized enough. In today's society that is moving towards a more sedentary lifestyle, there is a greater need than ever to increase the daily activity level to maintain both cardiovascular fitness and body weight.\nWith a rising trend toward health and wellness, many people are opting for a gymnasium and fitness club membership. While getting in shape requires time and commitment, a gymnasium offers convenient access to state-of-the-art equipment, health assessment, and a variety of classes. Some clubs/gymnasium even offers reduced rates as part of an employer membership, or through certain insurance companies. Discovering all the benefits a fitness club provides helps in the decision-making process. \n1.2\tSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\nThis project research was conducted exclusively in a gymnasium located in a highly populated area that attends to too many customers and members at a time, hence this research was able to track problem such as misplacement of customers and membership records and attendance, member’s fee and plan, slow and strenuous accessibility to customer’s and member’s report and record, inaccurate record keeping and poor information management within the gymnasium. Also, poor communication flow between members and staff because all data is handled by the gymnasium manager.\n\n    • OBJECTIVES\nThe objective of this project is to provide a system which handles the information of the people coming into the gymnasium and maintaining their health care. It is projected towards enhancing the relationship between customers and gymnasium management through the use of Gymnasium Management System. It takes care of all their health information. Data will be stored in the database. It also maintains the people’s attendance, gymnasium records. Also, to develop a user friendly system that requires minimal stress and will enable gymnasium managers to attend to many members or customers without being over worked. It also targets towards contributing to academic research work. It also helps the customer to know the kind of machine to work with after the registration has been done.\n\n1.3\tSIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nThe purpose of this project is to create a new gymnasium management system which will allow an easy operation for both staff and the customer of the gymnasium. Such system is: data entry of customers and members, keeping records of all information about members fees, plan, physical fitness which help to provide good quality of services. Huge files kept through the manual method in offices will no longer be there again because information will be stored on the computer with the help of the computerized gymnasium management System. It will help to keep a comprehensive record of member’s attendance. \n\n1.4\tSCOPE OF THE STUDY\nThis research work is limited to providing a digital gymnasium information management system that will handle electronically both members and staff record, to enable easy accessibility and information flow within the gymnasium.\nThis project is helpful in the Automation of gymnasium record including gymnasium weights, medicines, healthy drinks and gymnasium Management System.\n1.5\tLIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\nThese are the limiting factors and challenges encountered in the course of the project  \n    • Financial Constraints: The design was achieved but not without some financial involvements. Due to the high programming technique that was used, a professional programmer was consulted which cost some amount of money and we also subscribe in order to acquire some information online. Also the typing and planning of the work has its own financial involvements.  \n    • High programming Technique: The programming aspect of this project posed a lot of problematic bugs due to the syntax and semantic error, that took me some days to solve. \n    • Few Literature Sources: The topic though seems to be a common term; it is not a popular topic to surf from the Internet. It had fewer literature sources. \n\n1.6\tORGANIZATION OF THE PROJECT\nThis project was covered under five chapters:\nChapter 1 Deals with the introduction. The background of the project is discussed. The objectives of the project, statement of problem, its significance, scope, and constraints are pointed out, Chapter 2  review the related literature on the research work, Chapter 3 Discuss system Investigation and Analysis. It deals with detailed investigation and analysis of the existing system and problem identification, Chapter 4 describes how the new system was designed, how it works and what it needs or requires. This also shows the implementation of the new system with the written program, use case diagram, flowcharts and information flow diagram, Chapter 5 summarizes, concludes and recommends the research.\n",

A good way to find out what is happening within a salon is to look at the customer reviews mainly the complaints and how these are dealt with. If there is no log of complaint procedures, it becomes difficult for customers to know more about the salon. It means that the salon isn’t keeping a close eye on the complaint, not dealing with team members who are having the complaints, but also not creating best practice from it. In this salon booking system user can review salons and stylist online and can book appointment online. In this system user can register and get logged onto the website. They can select the nearby salon, and also can check for the services. Users can view various beauty related products and purchase.

If not managed well, it can be a problem rather than being a solution. The Employee transportation solution will provide an application platform to organise all the pick and drop related services. The employee transport service application to be designed, will provide a smooth flow of services between the admin and the users, where the admin will be the management of an organisation and the user will be the employees. The admin panel needs to login into the application, the admin will have many functions by which he/she can modify the pick-ups and drop-offs related services. These functions include add driver where he can add the driver, add vehicle where he can add vehicles to the employees, Admin can view bookings and manage time slot. On the other end, the employee’s first needs to register into the system by filling up basic registration details. After successful registration, employee can login by using their login credentials. Once the user logs in into the system, he/she can view available time slots and employee can select a time slot according to their shift timings. All these features will provide a hassle-free pick and drop management system for an organisation.\n       This project was out of the necessity to address the inherent problems encountered by members of staff of super maritime shipping Agency and their customers.\n       The manual process involved in the management of cargo were critical examined and the flows noted.

It is no longer a new thing that loss of customers’ goods is now the order of the day, the reasons are not far-fetched.  Due to this manual procedure involved in Cargo management, clients have no other option than to be at the mercy of these error prone procedures.\nMembers of staff of supper maritime one to the registered shipping agencies and a subsidiary of Nigerian ports plc cannot provide their goods that is the nature of the method used in calculating the tonnage to know the amount of money to pay as cargo fees.\nThe method of information storage in the company is poor.  This limits the number of official documents accessible by the customers because the system is not capable of managing old items of information which could be of use to be customer of anytime.\nThere is little or no security control system where the customers’ goods, document and classified information of the customer could be safe guarded from unauthorized access.\n 1.2     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\nThe loopholes existing in the management of cargo under the suspicious of Nigerian ports plc and super maritime and the subsequent solutions to these existing problems were the driving force in undertaken this project or study.\n 1.3     AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\nThe aims and objectives of this study is to design and implement a computerized cargo transportation management system that will among other thing, make provision for a detailed breakdown of the customers weight of the goods / Cargo, quick retrieval and display of information pertaining to the client.\nProvisions is also made to check fraud and other criminal acts carried out by both parties involved in the transaction and this lead to security and control.  Also another aim of this study is to provide a system that will manage the customer’s document from the port of loading to the port of discharge with his on ground there will be no conflict between the port of loading and port of discharge.\n 1.4     ASSUMPTIONS\nIt is assumed that the new system will do the following:\na.          the new system will create room for the client to know all th necessary facts about the vessel, mat is, the name of the vessel, the Nationality of the vessel and the voyage number with in the he shortest possible time so that transactions will be an easy task for the two parties involved.\nb.          The know the actual port of discharge and port of loading so that the two ports will create no conflict or confusion for the client as regard the documents to be signed and counter signed by the client.  For example, the bill of loading.\nc.           The new system will create an avenue where by the measurement and Gross weight of the cargo will be known and the commensurate fees to be paid.\nd.          The new system will also make all the on-line operations carried out in cargo management in supper maritime and Nigerian ports plc an easy task for official and staff of both establishment.\n \nDESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPUTERIZED CARGO TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM",

        "content": "Canteen Food Ordering and Management System\n\n                                          ABSTRACT\n\nThe main objective of online food ordering system is to automate the existing manual system with the help of advance computerized software so, that valuable data can be stored for longer period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same.\nThe registered user can access the account with valid credentials. User can surf the food items according to categories, Cart and online payment options are available to user. User can track their orders with the food details.\nIn Online Food Ordering System Admin can handle the functionalities like add new food items, edit/delete food items, Enable/Disable the food items according to season and availability. Admin have authority to view order details and update the delivery status of food. The payment transaction and user details are also viewable to admin.\n\n\nDESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ONLINE FOOD ORDERING SYSTEM\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 BACKGROUND OF STUDY\n\nThe online food ordering system is one of the latest servicers most fast food restaurants in the western world are adopting. With this method, food is ordered online and delivered to the customer. This is made possible through the use of electronic payment system. Customers pay with their credit cards, although credit card customers can be served even before they make payment either through cash or cheque. So, the system designed in this project will enable customers go online and place order for their food.\nDue to the great increase in the awareness of internet and the technologies associated with it, several opportunities are coming up on the web. So many businesses and companies now venture into their business with ease because of the internet. One of such business that the internet introduced is an online food ordering system. In today’s age of fast food and take out, many restaurants have chosen to focus on quick preparation and speedy delivery of orders rather than offering a rich dining experience. Until recently, most of this delivery orders were placed over the phone, but there are many disadvantages to this system.\nIt is possible for anybody to order any goods via the internet and have the goods delivered at his/her doorsteps. But while trying to discuss the transfer method of the goods and services, attention is focused on the payment mode. In other words, how possible is it to pay for goods and services via the internet? This then leads to the discussion of the economic consequences of digital cash. What are the implementations from the view point of economic? Since the world is fast becoming a global village, the necessary tool for this process is communication of which telecommunication is a key player. A major breakthrough is the wireless telephone system which comes in either fixed wireless telephone lines or the Global System of Mobile communication (GSM).\n\nWhat I propose is an online ordering system originally designed for use in college cafeterias, but just as applicable in any food delivery industry. The main advantage of this system is that it greatly simplifies the ordering process for both the customer and the restaurant. The system also greatly lightens the load on the restaurants end, as the entire process of taking orders is automated. Once an order is placed on the webpage that will be designed, it is placed into the database and then retrieved, in pretty much real-time, by a desktop application on the restaurants end. Within this application, all items in the order are displayed, along with their corresponding options and delivery details, in a concise and easy to read manner. This allows the restaurant employees to quickly go through the orders as they are placed and produce the necessary items with minimal delay and confusion. The greatest advantage of this system is its FLEXIBILITY.\n\n1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nAs industries are fast expanding, people are seeking for more ways to purchase products with much ease and still maintain cost effectiveness. The vendors need to purchase the products in order to sell to end users. The manual method of going to their local food sales outlets to purchase food is becoming obsolete and more tasking. Food can be ordered through the internet and payment made without going to the restaurant or the food vendor. So there is need for a wide range of publicity and enabling direct order, processing and delivering of food through online system. For this system, there will be a system administrator who will have the rights to enter the menu with current prevailing prices.\n\n1.3 OBJECTIVES OF STUDY\n\n\n \nThis study lays out a framework for a new system to be developed and brought to the market for maximum use and to create an avenue through the web where users can log on to our server and make a selection of whatever goods or food they like and subsequently pay via the internet. The following are the objectives this would bring:\n1. The home page of this web interfile provides an avenue where customers will be able to gather more and reliable information about what the fast food industry really does.\n2. The products and services offered would provide the customers with all the different categories of available products that they can choose and select from.\n3. This will provide a user friendly environment between the customer and employee thus increasing the efficiency of the food ordering system.\n4. There will also be an online purchase form with which valued customers will be using to get in touch with any of their request whenever the need arises.\n5. It will also help for easy retrieval of orders made by the customers.\n\n1.4 SCOPE OF STUDY\n\nIn this project, a fast food company is designed and KRISPY FAST FOOD, AWKA is taken as a case study to enable customers order for food and get it delivered accordingly and also to reduce the long queues of customers at the counter ordering for food and to reduce the work lord on the employees.\nThe following things are among other things that are discussed and what the software would handle:\n About the fast food company\n The fast food and the services offered there\n Online purchase\n Type of food provided.\n\n1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY\n\nIn view of the rapid development of computer technology in almost all the fields of operation and its use in relation to information management, it has become important to look into the development of online ordering system for firms to meet up with demands of the customers. Therefore, the food ordering and delivery system will help customers and management to:\n1. Advertise available foods in their company\n2. Reduce the workload in the present system\n3. Reduce time wasted in data processing\n4. Create a platform for online purchase and delivery of fast food\n5. Keep accurate record on purchased order and delivery.\n\n1.6 LIMITATIONS\n\nDue to time and financial constraints, the software that is developed covers only the aspect of food ordering and payments.\n\n1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nFOOD: Any nutritious substance that people or animals eat or drink, or that plant absorbs, in order to maintain life and growth.\n\nMENU: A list of dishes available in a restaurant or the food available or to be served in a restaurant or at a meal for example “a dinner-party menu”, “politics and sport are on the menu tonight”.\n\nONLINE FOOD ORDERING: Online food ordering services are websites that feature interactive menus allowing customers to place orders with local restaurants and food cooperatives.\n\nCREDIT CARD: A credit card is a payment card issued to users as a system of payment.

        "content": "\n\nDESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF COMPUTERIZED PHARMACY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\nPharmacy management system is a management system that is designed to improve accuracy and to enhance safety and efficiency in the pharmaceutical store. It is a computer based system which helps the Pharmacist to improve inventory management, cost, medical safety etc. The system allows the user to enter a manufacturing and expiry date for a particular  product or drug during opening stock and sales transaction. The system will also give report showing the list of products expiry after a specified date before the product eventually expires. It also involves manual entry upon arrival of new batches of drugs and upon drug movement out of the pharmacy for a certain period, e.g. every month, the pharmacist may want to generate report for the movement of drugs in and out of the pharmacy, getting information about the drugs e.g. expiry date, date purchased, number of drug type left, location of a drug in the pharmacy. At present, manual system is being utilized in the pharmacy. It requires the  pharmacist to manually monitor each drug that is available in the pharmacy. This usually leads to mistakes as the workload of the pharmacist increases.\n\n1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nDue to the size and quality service of the pharmacy, the pharmacy has a very large customer base. These customers tend to visit the pharmacy for services mostly when they close from work. At this period, the number of customers that patronisethe  pharmacy is on the increase, thereby making the workload of the pharmacists much  more tedious. This case makes it difficult for the pharmacist to attend to customers in a short period. Meanwhile the pharmacist has to ensure satisfaction in services to keep their customers. The factors mentioned above, results in delay of the services being rendered to the customers, thereby slowing down sales and risk losing valuable customers in the long run.\n\n1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nPharmacy management has kept paper record in filing cabinets. Managing a very large pharmacy with records on papers will be tedious and difficult to keep track of inventories with regards to the drugs in the store, expiry date, quantity of drugs available based on the categories and their functions. The pharmacist has to order drugs to replenish the already diminishing stock. In addition, ordering of drugs is being carried out manually. Significant amount of time is allocated for writing the order as the pharmacist needs to go through the stock  balance and make rough estimate of the amount to order based on Figures. Drugs are not supposed to be used after they have expired. This project work will  prompt the pharmacist about drugs that are close to expiry, preventing those drugs from being sold and also providing solution to the earlier stated problems.\n\n1.3 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe aim of this project is to develop a software for the effective management of a  pharmaceutical store that will be able to achieve the following objectives:\n\nEnsuring effective policing by providing statistics of the drugs in stock.\n\nMaintaining correct database by providing an option to update the drugs in stock.\n\nImproving the efficiency of the system by ensuring effective monitoring of services and activities.\n\nTo provide optimal drug inventory management by monitoring the drug movement in the pharmacy.\n\nTo ensure that there exists a level of restricted access based on functionality and role.\n\nTo ensure that the system is user friendly.\n\nTo be able to generate report within a specified period of time.\n\n1.4 SCOPE AND LIMITATION\n\nThe scope of this project is limited to the activities of a pharmaceutical store which includes will improving health outcomes, reduce hospital and long term care admissions, enhance access and care in the Estate and surrounding communities and ensuring best use of resources, the use of a computer based management system for improving the efficiency of a pharmacy is needed and it is an essential part of any modern continuously evolving society. The system will not be able to handle drug prescription, drug to drug interaction. The system will not be able to handle contraindication and polypharmacy in a prescription; this implies that these services will be manually completed by the pharmacist.\n\n1.5 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nThe research method used for this project work gives a description of how the  pharmacy management system for Boniks Pharmacy and stores, Gwarimpa Estate, Abuja will be developed. Therefore the method used in the design and collections of information from various sources are as follows:\n\nStudying the present system in detail and the organizational style.\n\nKnowing and understanding the input and output processes of the existing system.\n\nA qualitative form of interview was conducted in the organization to understand the mode of operation of the old system.\n\nPrimary data: This source has to do with the text book contacted for the development of this project.\n\n1.6 DEFINITION OF TERMS System\n\n: Is the complex purposeful collection of interrelated components that work together to take some objectives.\n\nDrug interaction: is a situation in which a substance (usually another drug) affects the activity of a drug when both are administered together.\n\nPolypharmacy: is the use of multiple medications by a patient, especially when too many forms of medication are used by a patient, i.e. when more drugs are prescribed than is clinically warranted.\n\nContraindication : is the condition or factor that serves as a reason to withhold a certain medical treatment.\n\n1.7 CHAPTER LAYOUT\n\nThe chapter layout of this project is outlined in a sequential manner starting with Chapter one which consists of the Introduction, Background of the study, Statement of the problem, Aims and objectives, Significance of study, Research methodology, Scope, Limitation, and Definition of terms. Chapter two consist of introduction, Literature review of the project, an overview of  pharmacy management in the past, at present and also include the benefits of  pharmacy management.

That stat, floating around the Internet, has been attributed jointly (and separately) to the U.S. Department of Labor and a survey by Yahoo!, Whether that information is strictly reliable or not, executives and avid readers everywhere will attest to the value of reading—for personal development, leadership purpose, training, continuous learning and company innovation. To enhance reading culture among students, starting a book club with books that speak to career advancement and fulfillment.\n\nFor promoting reading and developing lifelong reading habits have always been parallel goals with developing information literacy through their integrated school library programs. This has traditionally included developing extensive collections of quality literature books (books and novels), as well as rich information books, all in support of the school curriculum and as resources to support positive reading habits. Computerization and the pervasive infiltration of the Internet have dramatically altered all areas of work for teacher-librarians. The school library community has fully engaged in management uses of technologies: automating library collections; providing reference online; providing access to databases and electronic materials; as well as building a significant virtual presence through school library websites, archives of student work, and collected bookmarks of thematic resources. However, the traditional areas of promoting reading and providing readers’ advisory have often remained static and bound by face-to-face methods such as conducting book talks; building in-library displays; and bulletin board displays, as well as evidence that by improving students' access to reading materials and opportunities to interact with peers about their reading, teachers can do a better job of helping all readers become skillful, motivated readers. Since technology is seen as occupying more and more of students time out of school, it would seem important to explore how these two areas might unite to explore how new technologies such as e-books and e-readers support the goals of motivating students to read. Since digital technologies are so appealing to today’s youth, research seems to support the value of developing an online book club system as a factor in motivating young readers to read more with some evidence they may be particularly valuable in motivating reluctant readers. Online book club will enable e-readers also have been used in research exploring children’s reading comprehension (Larson, 2010). Evidence from this work suggests e-readers offer more than just portability and storage capacity; they support readers through their use of multiple tools and text features such as text-to-speech options, dictionaries and note-taking capabilities (Larson, 2010). There can be little doubt that e-books and e-readers are here to stay. In fact, data from publishers/distributors of e-books and the makers/marketers of e-readers have all indicated that growing sales and growing demands will lead to further innovations in these technologies and wider acceptance of their use. This information, coupled with evidence that those who own an e-reader buy more books now than before they owned an e-reader (Duncan, 2010), should awaken teacher-librarians to a reality that looms before them, one that holds great promise in our goals of supporting literacy and promoting reading habits.\n\n1.2     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe purpose of this research is to develop an online book club management system, to increase the reading culture among members of this online community, to enhance the sharing of books, proper reading, review books, rate books and connect with other readers.\n\n1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nIncrease reading the culture among students’ and members of using the system.\nEliminate borrowing of books from library, informative books will be readable available for the reading pleasure of students.\nReduce money students spend on buying bulk of books.\nTo increase academy performance of students.\n1.4     STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nIn most educational institutions there’s a need to increase the reading culture among students especially in this internet age, were students spend a lot of time on the internet. Students can’t have access to books on holidays or easily without having to visit the school library on campus, it is not only time consuming, but it is also reduce students’ academic performance due to no access to books without stress.\n\n1.5     SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe scope of the project is limited to several processes: handling of student ability to access academic materials without having to visit the campus, improve students’ academic performance through continuous reading with other peers. The system will generate the reports such as books read by a particular student to encourage others read same book. The online book club management system is designed in such a way that makes it possible to access through any device connect to the internet.\n\n1.6     DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nReading - The action or skill of reading.\n\nE-readers – electronic readers.\n\nEducational - Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits.\n\nOnline - while connected to a computer or under computer control.\n\nPerformance – an act of showing improvement or decrease in a particular period of time.\n\nAcademic - of, relating to, or associated with an academy or school especially of higher learning\n\nDESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ONLINE BOOK CLUB MANAGEMENT SYSTEM",

In recent years, there is a growing parity websites helping consumers to buy cheaper commodity. Although these websites can help consumers get the parity price of commodities, the search results are not so ideal. Because these websites may occur problems about the difference commodity between search results and consumers want to search, or the difference commodity price between search results and commodity web page. Therefore, this study attempts to use web mining technique as a basic approach. This study proposes a novel commodity search system to track consumer demand, and that is, when the commodity price of any website is lower than the consumer price conditions, the system will proactively notify consumers.

Many factors affect the performance of appointment systems including arrival and service time variability, patient and provider preferences, available information technology and the experience level of the scheduling staff. In addition, a critical bottleneck lays in the application of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IE/OR) techniques. The most common types of health care delivery systems are described in this article with particular attention on the factors that make appointment scheduling challenging. For each environment relevant decisions ranging from a set of rules that guide schedulers to real-time responses to deviations from plans are described.

The amount of trade conducted electronically has grown extraordinarily with widespread Internet usage. The use of commerce is conducted in this way, spurring and drawing on innovations in electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing, online transaction processing, electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems. Modern electronic commerce typically uses the World Wide Web at least at some point in the transaction's lifecycle, although it can encompass a wider range of technologies such as e-mail as well.\n\nA large percentage of electronic commerce is conducted entirely electronically for virtual items such as access to premium content on a website, but most electronic commerce involves the transportation of physical items in some way. Online retailers are sometimes known as e-tailers and online retail is sometimes known as e-tail. Almost all big retailers have electronic commerce presence on the World Wide Web.\n\nHISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF ONLINE MARKETPLACE\nOver the past decade, there has been an extreme jump in internet sales. For example, in 2006, from November 1st to December 26th online shopping soared to $23.1 billion dollars, increasing by 26% from the previous year. Creating a competitive battle with retail stores, online shopping presents a more convenient method of shopping without the lines and the crowds, however, buying online takes away from the social aspect of shopping. Having recognized the lack of social appeal that e-commerce presents, new navigating tools to ease decision- making are being implemented as a result, people are becoming more comfortable with shopping online. As the pressure from online shopping sites increases, retailers have to focus on better marketing strategies to promote products and influence customers to shop in their stores instead of online. In fact, many retailers are now making their products available online.  Thus, a new influx of “click and mortar” retailers are surfacing. The “click and mortar” retailers that provide online shoppers with easy to use features are increasing their online profits and becoming strict competitors to the top online-only companies (ie Amazon and Netflix.\n\nSTATEMENT OF PROBLEM\nIn human endeavor, there is a lot of development which helps to maximize production, income and operation of businesses at Ogbete main market.  These have brought increase in complexity of marketing system like B2B (Business to Business) and B2C (Business to Consumers) and its operations.\n\nBased on these, a number of problems are facing the Ogbete main market system which include\n\nDay-to-Day pressures of selling\nCoping with customers\nSolving basic business problems\nCompetitions (a new player enters, market conditions changes, sales drops, the company introduces a new products or services).\nMost of the leads came from the sales staff.\nUnable to recognize previously visited customers\nAvailability of market (sales and services) to the whole parts of Nigeria\nUnstable fixed price\nOBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\nThe aim of this study is to design and implement a database driven online virtual marketplace with a particular reference to Ogbete main market. The web based program developed in this research essentially provides all the necessary marketing services and operations done at Ogbete main market which will help increase their operations based on sales and services.\n\nThese operations include general sales and marketing management.\n\nIn this study therefore, the researchers hope to accomplish the following objective:\n\nTo design a better pricing mechanism in the market\nTo solve the problem of geographical location\nTo maximize sales\nTo help improve customer relationship\nIncreases social interaction activities\nReduces pressures mounted on sellers\nIncreases management of stock items\nEasy shopping\nIntroduces bidding system\nAccommodates more marketers\nTo improve quality delivery system\nSIGNIFICANCES OF THE STUDY\nBuying and selling is very important to our everyday life, its very important that we humans have to market what we have like goods and services to other people that needs it, also purchase what we are lacking. Marketing is highly regarded everywhere in the whole parts of the world. The following are some significance of this study:\n\nThe secured site for electronic commerce will help the populace people of Nigeria to get rid of risk in carrying cash around and the convenience of shopping anytime of the day.\n It will reduce the risk of transportation, since the customer does not have to travel far to shop for any items or goods.\nIt will reduce the risk of authentication of the product and improved business transaction as customers are now sure of the originality of the product they purchased.\nSCOPE OF THE STUDY\nThis project looks into the processes involved in marketing of goods and services in the marketplace.  The researchers concentrated on the operation going on the general marketing activities like sales, management of stocks, pricing and registering of customers, security and policy guiding sales.\n\nLIMITATION OF THE STUDY\nSome of the constraints that my have in one-way or another affected the outcome of this work include:\n\nResources: Due to the complex and insecurity associated with human factors during this research work, personnel who are used to the manual system perhaps for fear of losing their jobs have been reserved in relinquishing all necessary information to make this project an enticingly extensive one.\nTime: Due to time allowed for this project work, as a student was limited to come up with a reasonable work within the stipulated time.\nPower: Availability of stable, efficient and reliable power supply was also a major limitation of this project as it had to be suspended several times during design and testing stages.\n1.8     THE ORGANISATION AND HER ENVIRONMENT\n\nChief executive officer\n\nGeneral Manager\n\nManager (order)\n\nManager Inventory\n\nManager Sales\n\nOrder Personnel\n\nStore Personnel\n\nDelivery Personnel\n\nCashier\n\nSales\n\nReceptionist\n\nFig 1.0 Organizational structure\n\n< >DEFINITION OF TERMSE-commerce: Generally refers to exchange of goods or services over electronic system such as internet.\n\nB2B: Refers to selling of products or services to other businesses.\n\nB2C: Refers to selling of product or services to end consumers.\n\nCredit card: it is a card entitling its holder to buy goods and service from certain establishment.\n\nMerchant: Refers to as organization (such as an MIT department) accepting credit card payments for the goods or services they provides.\n\nOrder: A record of a request for goods or services initiated by a customer.\n\nOrder ID: A unique identifier assigned to a customer order in clear commerce.\n\nBanner: An advertisement or image displayed on one or more websites to attract visitors to your site.\n\nShopping cart: A wheeled cart for purchase of goods in a store or supermarket.\n\nDESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF E-COMMERCE WEBSITE\n\n\n\nE-Commerce Website for Visually Challenged\n\nThere are around 161 million people who are visually impaired people and around 36 million are blind. These people are taking help from family member or friends to each and every for their needs. Consider a blind individual who lives alone, but wants to make a purchase from an ecommerce site. He doesn’t have anybody there by his side, in the moment, to either guide him on what to do on the site, or make the purchase for him. It is a difficult for blind people to choose clothes with different colors or they find difficult to online shopping. A system is developed to assist blind people that automatically recognizing clothing patterns and colors. The system processes the voice output, and ask for the input by pressing the button of their desire choices. Which will help them to buy their desire things online. Every kind of instruction will me given them in mode of audio they need to hear and follow the instructions.\n\n    • Modules:\nThe system comprises of 2 major modules with their sub-modules as follows:\n\n    1.

I hope you find it helpful.\n\n   A UK visa is the overseas arm of Britain’s integrated border management.  We have visa offices in 160 locations throughout the world.  The largest handles 300,000 applications a year; the smallest less than 10.  we issue visas to 80% of those who apply and stop only those who are a significant immigration risk to the UK.  We process over 90% of straightforward applications within 24 hours.  This is a record of which we are proud, but we aim to do even better.\n\n  Our new mission statement explains how UK visas will deliver the border objectives set by our parent department, the home office and foreign and common wealth office; to achieve a balance between managing travel and migration and preventing illegal immigration\n\n   Our goals are\n\n·                     to bring communities together\n\n·                     to improve Britain’s competitiveness as a destination for travel, trade, migration and investment\n\n·                     to prevent immigration abuse\n\n·                     to deliver for money\n\n·                     to earn public confidence\n\n1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nIn British visa processing information system, the problems we are facing are (i) Bankruptcy Attorney e.g. consumer present their case at legal match by through extensive client acquisition and market outreach efforts our legal match will assists thousands of visitors every day seeking help with their legal issues.  In some areas consumers can also reach us by phone so new bankruptcy legislation may make it harder to find an attorney.  (ii)       Another problem in visa processing into system is the privacy and security problems ie using illegal or fraud visa to go to overseas. (iii) Health (tuberculosis) screening is another problem in visa processing system since it valid for larger than six months in certain countries now require a certificate to show that they are free from infections tuberculosis (TB) before that person will travel to overseas.  The Government announced on 21 July 2005 its intention is to implement the first phase of an overseas screening programme for TB for people applying to enter the UK for more than 6 months in four year strategy earlier this year.  The benefit of the programme is that successful applicants will benefit on arrival in the UK as they will not need to be referred to the port medical inspector before being allowed to enter the country.\n\n1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\n            The UK purpose of study in visa processing system is to achieve the following Diplomatic mission.\n\n·                     A Diplomatic Mission is the office of a country’s diplomatic representative in the capital city of another country.\n\n·                     Diplomatic Mission are established in accordance with the erovisions of the Vienna convention on Diplomatic relations 1961.\n\n·                     Diplomatic Mission of a common wealth country in another common wealth country is called a “High commission”\n\n·                     The head of mission is called “High commissioner”.\n\n·                     A diplomatic mission in any foreign (i.e. non-common wealth) country is called an Embassy and the head of mission is called Ambassador’\n\n·                     High commissions and Embassies perform the same functions and have the same status.\n\n·                     The good management of our diplomatic mission is essential to the success of their work.\n\n1.4       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\n            UK visas began life as the joint entry clearance unit (JECU) in June 2000.  it was established jointly by the foreign and common wealth officer and the home office to manage the UK’s entry clearance (visa) operation.\n\n            Visa or entry clearance applications are processed by entry clearance officers in UK embassies, high commissions and consulates abroad, collectively known as UK missions.  UK visas work closely with the immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) of the Home office, the Government department responsible for immigration policy and dealing with applications from people already in the UK to extend their stay; or to change their immigration status.  UK visas reports to a joint management board of senior foreign and common wealth (FCD) and Home office officials and to ministers in both departments.\n\n1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\n            The scope of the study is concerned with the review to improve.  Britain’s competitiveness as a destination for travel, trade, immigration and investment and to bring communities together.  Specifically the study covers such areas like how UK visas will deliver the border objectives set by our parent department, such as the home office and the foreign common wealth office in order to achieve a balance between managing people’s travel and migration, and also preventing illegal immigration.

        "content": "Online Transaction Fraud Detection using Backlogging on E-Commerce Website\nWe here come up with a system to develop a website which has capability to restrict and block the transaction performing by attacker from genuine user’s credit card details. The system here is developed for the transactions higher than the customer’s current transaction limit.  We tried to detect fraudulent transaction before transaction succeed. During registration we take required information which is efficient to detect fraudulent user activity. Here we present a Behavior and Location Analysis (BLA). The details of items purchased in Individual transactions are usually not known to any Fraud Detection System (FDS) running at the bank that issues credit cards to the cardholders. Hence, We implemented BLA for addressing this problem. An advantage to use BLA approach to reduce number of false positive transactions identified as malicious by an FDS although they are genuine. An FDS runs at a credit card issuing bank. Each incoming transaction is submitted to the FDS for verification. FDS receives the card details and transaction value to verify, whether the transaction is genuine or not. The types of goods that are bought in that transaction are not known to the FDS. Bank declines the transaction if FDS confirms the transaction to be fraud. User spending patterns and geographical location is used to verify the identity. If any unusual pattern is detected, the system requires re-verification. Based upon previous data of that user the system recognizes unusual patterns in the payment procedure.  System will block the user after 3 invalid attempts.\n\n\n\n\n\nModules and their Description\n\nThis system comprises of 2 major modules with its sub-modules:\n\n    1. Admin\n        a.

This system enables the company to make their services available to the public through the internet and also keep records about their services.\n\nThe world has become a place where there is a lot of technological development; where every single thing done physically has been transformed into computerized form. Nowadays, people’s activities have been transformed into work done by computerized systems. One of which is the main target of this project which is about Car Rental System. The system of renting cars exist back in the previous years, were people rent cars for their personal reasons. Car renting is essential to many peoples’ plan to travel or move from one place to another for business purposes, tour, and visit or holidays, for these reasons Car renting is very helpful.\n\nThe [8] starting point of Car renting is really unknown as said by Thomas Pretty; he also mentioned that many beliefs that Joe Saunders was the first man to start a Car renting company. According to Thomas Pretty, charges were calculated with the help of mileage tracking device. Many people became interested in the Car rental business and hence got involved. Car renting became more popular as years pass by. Today Car renting services is found all over the world, especially in the developed and developing countries. To make this service more popular and accessible to the public it has been transform into a web base system and connected to the internet were everyone can be able to have access to it.\n\n1.1 Objectives\nThe main objectives of this project are:\n\n· To develop a web based system that will help manage the business transactions of car renting.\n\n· To help in advertising the car rental services of a company, through the availability of the system online.\n\n1.2 Scope\nThe scope of this project is as follows:\n\n· The car rental system to keep detail records of both the cars and the customers, the duration they rent car as well as the type of car they rent.\n\n· The system will be mainly design for small a company that renders it car rental services to customers.\n\n· The system will have the ability to generate and print invoice for each successful transaction.\n\nLevel of Access:\n\nThe system will have two levels of access:\n\n· The administrator\n\n· Customer\n\n1.3 Problem Statement\nThe problem with some of the current system is that:\n\n· Based on observations, some small companies already have a car rental system which is not a web based application. This is a limitation that gives them capability to store customer’s details, but at the same time they cannot make their services more available to the public through the internet, they rather make use of posters to advertise their services to the public. These types of companies can overcome these problems by switching to the web base application of their type of system.\n\n· They also make use of phone call reservations which is also limited to many features as compare to a web base system. For example a customer may make a phone call reservation for a particular car, but when he/she comes to pick the car, he/she might turn not to like the car; this could be because the customer could not see a sample picture of the car he/she wants to rent\n\n1.4 Methodology\nThe Iterative Waterfall Model is the development methodology that will be used in this project to develop the CRS. This [1] [2] [18] Model is derived from the evolution of the Traditional Waterfall Model. It consist of five phases, which include; the Requirement and Definition, System and Software Design, Implementation and testing, System testing, Operation and maintenance. Each of these phase is repeated if an error is discover, this enables the correction of errors before moving to the next phase. The Figure 1.1 below represents the Iterative Waterfall Model for this project, and each of the phases is explain accordingly.\n\n, 2014)\n\nFigure 1.1: Iterative Water Fall Model\n\n1.4.1 Requirement analysis and definition\nThe system’s services, constraints and goals are established by consultation with system users. Once these have been agreed, they must be defined in a manner which is understandable by users and development team. For example project scope, objectives.\n\n1.4.2 System and software design\nUsing the requirement definition as a foundation, the requirements are divided into software and hardware. This is called system design. Software design is the process of representing the functions of each software system in a manner which may readily be transformed to one or more computer programs. Use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, entity relationship diagrams (ERD) and data dictionary are use at this level to represent the system design.\n\n1.4.3 Implementation and unit testing\nDuring this stage, the software design is released as a set of programs. Unit testing involves verifying that each unit is working according to the specification of the customer.\n\n1.4.4 System testing\nThe individual programs or units are integrated and tested as a complete system to ensure that the software requirements have been met as specified by the end users. After testing has been completed, the software system is delivered to the customer.\n\n1.4.5 Operation and maintenance\nThis is the longest life cycle phase. The system is installed and put into practical use. Maintenance involves correcting errors which were not discovered in the earlier stages of the life cycle. The software must be adapted to accommodate changes in its external environment. For example, a change required because of a new operating system or peripheral device, or because the customer requires functional or performance enhancement.\n\n1.4.6 Feedback\nDuring use, errors and omissions in the original software requirements are discovered, program and design errors come to light and the need for new functionality is identified.\n\n1.5 Software development tools\nThe project will make use of the tools:\n\n· The programming language to use will be PHP.\n\n· A personal computer or laptop as hardware requirement.\n\n· Microsoft 2003/2007 will be used for project documentation.\n\n· MySQL and wamp server will be used for the development of the database\n\n1.6 Conclusions\n1.6.1 Problem restatement\nBased on the research done, some car rental companies still use desktop application for their car rental services and thus making it to be limited to so many important feature that are not available unlike in the web based application where there are so many feature available. Also some upcoming companies do not only make use of these desktop applications, but also make use of phone call reservation, which is still lacking so many features that are needed for this type of system.\n\n1.6.2 Recommendations\nThe most recommended solution to these problems is to implement a web based system that will have the features required for this kind of services or business.\n\nIn conclusion, the system will be able to serve as a web base application when it is finally developed, where these small upcoming companies can make use of it to publish their services in a wide range and also help the company to manage their service more effectively. On the other hand, it will enable customers to freely make their desire choice more freely and interactively.",

        "content": "CHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n          Estate property renters has been proved to be a difficult task in Enugu due to the unsophisticated antiquated and low skill property management by the estate owners and the agent.\n\n          The project discussed in details the modernized and sophisticated method of property management, when one talk of modernized and sophisticated of estate management, computer has to come in enhance 100% result hence the topic of this project design and implementation of a computerized estate property administration system.\n\n          Presently, it is indeed a tedious job for one to search for and get an estate property to hire due to the reason mention above. If Enugu property owners and agent can borrow a leaf from this project, an estate property hiring seekers few second to get property of his choice. The project also gives the seeker the opportunity to know where some of the estate property are located, the owners. The specification of the estate and year of construction (how new or old the estate is). Although, the above mentioned method of estate management is encouraged, it has its own limitation (each estate owner is suppose to have a computer terminal and computer accessories with which he will access the main data base). This project considered limitations and come out with a well simplified low cost and less cumbersome approval towards overcoming the limitations that is, one computer one operator, one computer room and a set of computer accessories were used to access all the property, there owners and their status (i.e whether vacant or not), the facilities available the location and everything pertaining the property in Enugu, with this a centralized computer room ought to be establish to do the job above. A property hiring seeker has to visit the centralized computer room and  get information about estate property, the landlord and agent has to be feeding the system either through telephone service, network or the equivalent.\n\n          But to have a maximum efficiency, networking method of feeding the centralized computer room has been employed. This entails that each landlord will be feeding the centralized computer. When an update is necessary, he uses the terminal which works with the main computer. The centralized computer uses the software to process and access the records in the database.\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\n          Right from the day of records/information about estate property stated, there has been numerous problems resulting from ineffective and inefficient manual mechanical process of storing and manipulating information of estate  property especially in Okolo Okolo & Co. Enugu. The problems encountered using this process can be summarized below:\n\n-              Time, it takes to access record in the present system, is quite much when compared with the computerized method. It waste time and makes information accessing too cumbersome.\n\n-              The record about estate property are stored in sheets of paper and thus makes it easy accessible to intruders and vandals who may be spying.\n\n-              Sheets of paper that are not properly filed can easily slip off thus making useful information inaccessible.\n\n-              The mode of storage of files makes office look clumsy. This is because files that have to take care of all the estate property in Enugu will be many and there may be no enough space.\n\n-              Records are not organized in a way that will facilitate estate property accessing.\n\n-              Modification and updating of records makes it untidy. This is because of the use of correcting fluid or cancellation. Therefore, the problem of the presently use manual system in accessing estate property in Enugu will be a thing of the past with the introduction of computer in storing, processing and retrieving information.\n\nPURPOSE OF STUDY\n\n          The purpose of this project is to developed a computer based solution of storing and accessing record on estate property Okolo Okolo & Co Enugu. This is aimed to phase out the manual or traditional approach of storing a specially designed form that has been recorded with ask in a labeled file jacket.\n\n          Looking into the organization that takes care of estate property revealed several misappropriation such as hurdling of records, stealing of certain records that are important intruding by the spies, lack of funds to buy materials. Improper method of entering the records and modifying of records due to file movement, untidy outlook of some modifies record and so on. Owing to the difficulties mentioned above, the research considered it necessary to develop a computer based method of estate management administration. This will contribute in the eradication of such difficulties encountered by the manual techniques of estate property administration accessing.\n\nSCOPE AND DELIMITATION      \n\n          The scope of this project limits on house allocation in Okolo, Okolo & Co. Enugu. It takes into consideration the updating of records. The display of any particular land lords record wanted, searching for where an available vacant house can be located. In modification of records, the former records that has been entered will be seen before is being corrected. This has making the user see his mistake before correcting. In the search for any estate property owners is done through the use of primary key, the estate property owners first name help facilitates are also to be provided to help inexperience user.\n\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\n          The aims and objectives of this project can be summarized below:\n\n-              To help make estate property accessing fast.\n\n-              To help government in making provision for basic amenities and to know the concentration of population in any particular location in city.\n\n-              The project is aimed at being a guide to people who are homeless and would wish to find a place to call there home.\n\n-              The project has the objective of helping the strangers in the city and to locate their relatives.\n\n-              This project is also aimed at making provision with which government can access the concentration of any particular type of house in area.",

Form time man is burn, he s being studied to know what likely he will be able to do as he grows up. This has to do with his natural behaviour and mental exercise display. This continues in the family parents and other relations acting as guidance and counseling unit. The child goes in tot school. In school the teacher takes over the guidance and counseling, it is a continuous exercise until one finds his feet, then he can continues from there and equally be in a position to guide and counsel others.\n\n          The stage where much work is carried out on guidance and counseling is in secondary schools. This is a stage when a child is grown to be able to understand maturely and when the Child’s attitude is fully studied in line with academic performance. In all secondary school across the country, there exist a guidance and counselor office where people knowledge in the area of psychology are employed in order to help advise the younger ones in school which way forward to their future career. These people through class visitation, observing students during recreation and calling on them at intervals for questioning, came to know the students better and be able to guide and counsel them in their future career probably in University or in any other area of life endeavour.\n\n          The job of guidance and counseling in secondary school is not an easy job to be taking into consideration the number of students involved with respect to the number of staff involved. It is always, very difficult to handle all the student and to remember everything about the students. This guidance and counseling exercise needs a sophisticated system for the operation of guidance and counseling alliterates some of the problems associated with the exercise. \n\nSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS\n\nThe number of students involved in guidance and counseling in schools are very enormous and few staff in guidance and counseling cannot handle the job effectively. It is always very easy to forget information about students and to reach all the students, contributes another problems.\n\n          Another major problem of he guidance and counseling is information storage. The made of storage of information observed from the student in different forms is not reliable and this makes the guidance and counseling to apply guesswork in trying to direct students in their future career work.\n\nThis is a very big delay in taking decision on students concerning their future career. This is so because referencing to students information for decision-making takes a very long time.\n\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THHE STUDY\n\nThe primary aim of this projects work is to provide lasting solution to the problem affecting guidance and counseling exercise in secondary schools. The following objectives below are of the study.\n\n- To make the criteria and process involved in the exercise of guidance and counseling very easy and flexible.\n\n-          To carry take care of the burden, the staff faces in trying to do the work of guidance and counseling manually.\n\n-          To provide adequate enabling environment for guidance and counseling on student  to give them better career perspective.\n\n-          To maintain adequate observed information on students for future reference and quick decision taking.\n\nIMPORTANT OF THE STUDY\n\n          This study is of numerous important to the guidance and counselor department and the society in general. It will help the guidance and counselor to always direct the students in their best career areas with happiness because it will be result oriented. It will be placed in the place where they can best perform; this will help in rapid development in the society. It will help to eliminate the word frustration among the people, which is very common in the society.\n\nSCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study covers the design and implementation of a computerized career choice counseling system in secondary schools.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n\n          On the course of this project work, time and finance posed a major obstacle to the researcher.

It was been estimated that in an organization such as a tertiary educational community, information is highly essential for correct student’s record and examination data. Student information that is not properly created and stored will cause many errors. Nearly every section of educational system requires information processing. It is fortunate that all education institutions in the developing world, such as universities, colleges of education and polytechnics in Nigeria still operate under the manual method of record keeping and computation of Grade Point Average (GPA) and this method is highly prone to errors.\n\nThe errors associated with the existing manual method of processing students result in most colleges of education in Nigeria, including federal college of education in Osiele, Abeokuta, make it not only desirable but imperative that computerized approach used to the full in measuring students’ progress. With the use of computers for information processing, the following are possible instant access to students’ personal and course information, instant student information updating, automatic computation of the Grade Point Average (GPA), generation of the graduating list, monitoring of failed courses, keeping an up-to-date record of entire student body in the institution, storing course code curse description or title, course unit and scores for the purpose  of GPA computation and p[reducing user-friendly data entry screen for ease of use.\n\nSince the inception of federal colleges of education Osiele, Abeokuta in 1976, the colleges operate with five schools namely: school of science, school of art and social science, school of language, school of vocational education and school of education.\n\nAll of which having student enrollment increasing every year, right from the inception of this great institution. Due to increasing number of student in each school of the institution, computation of the student’s GPA has been a very difficult task. Therefore because of this problems and errors arising from using the manual result processing system, a software-computerized result processing system becomes inevitable: the benefit accruable from the computer based cannot be over emphasized.\n\n1.1              BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nAt present the students grading system used by all colleges of education in Nigeria is the five-point grading system, established by the Nigeria Commission of Colleges of Education (NCCE) in 1898. The NNCE five-point grading system is shown below:\n\nTable 1: The NCCE five point grading system\n\nSCORE (%)\n\nLETTER GRADE\n\nGRADE VALUE\n\nREMARK\n\n70-100\n\nA\n\n5\n\nExcellent\n\n60-69\n\nB\n\n4\n\nVery Good\n\n50-59\n\nC\n\n3\n\nGood\n\n45-49\n\nD\n\n2\n\nAverage\n\n40-44\n\nE\n\n1\n\nPass\n\n0-39\n\nF\n\n0\n\nFail\n\nThe courses offered in a NCE programme are allocated a number of credit hours which vary from one course to another, because the causes vary in their needs and scope. Hence some are allocated greater credit hours than others.\n\n1.2              PROBLEM OF THE STUDY\n\nThe problem of the study can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.      It takes a longer time to design and implement\n\n2.      It require high caliber, experienced and specialized personnel\n\n3.      It is costly\n\n4.      The coding is logical and requires specialized programmers.\n\n1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe purpose of the study is to design and implementation of a computerized result processing system for computer science department at the federal college of education, Osiele, Abeokuta.\n\n1.4              OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe objectives of a computerized:\n\n1.      monitoring the performance of the student in the department\n\n2.      to increase the flexibility of the information available\n\n3.      to make processing of students result faster and easier\n\n1.5              LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the likely challenges that may arise in the process of the investigation. It includes:\n\n1.      Money\n\n2.      Transportation\n\n3.      Time consumption\n\nThere are many other problem that occur when carrying out this research project, the first limitation is due to non availability of material topic which makes it difficult for the researcher to have access to work that has been written on it for the literature review. This makes the study to be limited to the fact obtained from the internet, library and environment factors.\n\n1.6              DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nCOMPUTER: A computer is a programmable machine that receives, stores and manipulates data and provides output in a meaningful and useful format.\n\nCOMPTERIZED: An embedded system is a computer system design to perform one or a few dedicated function often with real time computing constraints. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts.\n\nDesign: To decide upon the look and functioning of (a building, garment or other object) typically by making a detaile",

This led to probing the history of National universities commission, which provides the guidelines for the system, and also that of the computer machine, its development up to the point where this aid of the equipment in different techniques were made. The computer-equipment-aids aid the planning system(s) procedures with due reference to its mode of Operation and its procedural functions were discussed, computer software’s of high flexibility was deviced to execute network analysis, using D-BASE. Computer based planning information system is the name of this software package. Modular program design approach, D-BASE coding structures etc, were used to program development. It features an elaborate software package that is designed to simplify matters for the user by assisting him and providing information for decision making. This package accepts, stores and displays strings of symbols that are grouped in various ways.\n\n          An organisation cannot function without computer (information), hence information system is to the organisation as what the nervous system is to the body. A lack of information (for good information) may seriously impair the effectiveness of an organisation. This work is in the area of projection of Computerized Admission Processing System being one of the functions of the academic programme activity unit that cannot be easily done as fast as computer system.\n\n          The Madonna University Admission processing system of the planning directorate was used as a model.\n\n          Managing information (data, files) generated were used for project control.

While it’s true that modern computer systems involve complex technologies and theories, their use is becoming easier all the time. Computers have a general-purpose nature which makes them endless versatile. They can be applied to a wide range of activities, and increasingly their tasks have an intelligent nature. Today, computers can compose tunes and write songs; they can write short stories and poems; they can outstand human games-players, physicians, mathematicians and chemical analysis; and they are used libraries and institutions.\n\n          In its broadest meaning, a computer is an electronic device which has the ability to accept data (input) from an input device, process it in accordance with a pre-defined program to produce a useful result (output) which is finally transferred to an output device. It can store processed information. We use the computer mainly for speed, accuracy and volume. Computers can perform millions of calculations in one second. In fact, some computers can perform more operations in one hour than we could perform in a life time using pencil and paper, it operates at electronic speed. Another useful feature of the computer is its ability to produce accurate results. Computer is capable of storing large amount of data and handles large amount of work.\n\n          Today, computers are used in different specification (areas). In Nigerian, and in our high institutions one of such institutions is Madonna University Okija in Anambra State. The university was established in 1998. It is owned and controlled by Revered Fr. Emmanuel Edeh.\n\n          The university is located on a piece of land about one and half kilometers off Okija Main-Market, along Onitsha Express Road.\n\n          Currently, the university admitted up to ten thousand students. The institution has employment capacity of five hundred, which is composed of senior, and junior lectures both Professors, BSc, B.Tech and MSc holders most of them are God fearing lecturer.\n\n          It is estimated that the university produce about One thousand graduates yearly.\n\n          In 2002, the university was awarded from National Universities Commission –Abuja due to their work well doing. The institution was awarded with overall certificate and five million naira.\n\n          In the year 2003, the overall students population stood at about five thousands students. Recently, the statistical number of students in Madonna University Okija-is Seven thousand students. \n\n          The design phase was carried out after some relevant feasibility studies and followed by detailed investigative studies of the Madonna University Okija- Anambara admission processing system. \n\n          Certain salient factors in the past, which related to the research problem under investigation, are: \n\n          (a)      Processing of student files manually\n\n          (b)     Inadequate of computer operators; (staff) in the university.\n\n          (c)      Keeping of students file manually;\n\n          (d)     Difficulties in accessing student’s admission files.\n\n          The table below shows the total of admitted and graduate students in the university from 1998 to 2004.\n\n      YEAR\n\n        MALE\n\n     FEMALE\n\n      TOTAL\n\n1998\n\n200\n\n78\n\n278\n\n1999\n\n200\n\n280\n\n489\n\n2000\n\n420\n\n300\n\n720\n\n2001\n\n500\n\n480\n\n980\n\n2002\n\n520\n\n600\n\n1120\n\n2003\n\n677\n\n1000\n\n1677\n\n2004\n\n1010\n\n990\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n500\n\n540\n\n1040\n\nTOTAL\n\n8,695\n\nThe above table is the total score of student graduated in Madonna University, started from the year of establishment 1998 to 2005.\n\nSOURCE:      RESPONDENTS 2005  \n\n1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS\n\n          First, there is the problem of adopting modern commercial data processing equipments because of inadequately of trained and skilled computer scientists.\n\n          Secondly, there is the problem of raising the initial capital require in buying the basic modern admission processing system-equipment. This is because such equipments are expensive and the school management can not afford such huge sums of money because of their low incomes.\n\n          Thirdly, there is the problem of mismanagement students registration files among the different department/ faculties in the institution.\n\n          Again, the ban on the importation of this admission processing facilities and to pay the computer operators will cost the school management enough money to conduct; because of its expensive and they cannot be adequately provided to the university.\n\n          Furthermore, it is not easy for the school to compile the students registrations files due to inadequate processing facilities such as, monitor, keyboard, mouse, system unit, printer, scanner and photocopy machine.\n\n          Finally, there is the problem of lack of computer science professions, who raid computer as a course.\n\n1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\n          The primary aim of this project is to introduce a computer admission processing system that will replace the manual admission processing system. According Godwin (1999) computers extend human brainpower; they are intelligent amplifiers, which provide new dimension in the time available for creative work. Manpower alliance generates better management of resource and enhances firm project control. Thus facilities saving, improved efficiency productivity and development.\n\n1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY \n\n          The significance of the computerized admission processing system are; time reduction, unlike manual processing. Information can be obtained more quickly accurately, completely and presented in a manner more meaningful for the decision to be made. It enables the institution to store it’s data or information (students) that are being admitted. Computerization of relevant data and their retrieval from the storage media.\n\n          This study is significant in many respects. Instance, its finding will be useful to private and federal universities.\n\n          To start with, it has been stated that one of the objectives of this study is to find out why it is still difficult to transform the manual processing system to computerized system. In doing this, therefore the researcher intends to expose all the problems inherent in the process admission processing. The finding of this record will help the university in formulating an effective policy on admission processing.",

The research sample consisted of 70 students from secondary schools the schools were selected based on their location in the local government area. These include St. Mary dedication school, Oredo Girls college, Immaculate conception college, Edo college, Itohan Girls grammar school, and Iguodala primary school.\n\nThe researcher finds out that, majority of the students have the knowledge of computer science, therefore the teacher as resource personnel should be computer literate to enable them carryout effective teaching.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENT\n\nChapter one: introduction\n\nBackground of the study\n\nStatement of the problem\n\nPurpose of the study\n\nSignificant of the study\n\nResearch questions\n\nScope of the study\n\nDefinition of terms\n\nChapter two: review of related literature\n\nIntroduction\n\nInformation and communication technology\n\nChapter three: methodology and procedure of study\n\nResearch design\n\nPopulation of the study\n\nSampling techniques\n\nResearch instrument\n\nValidity of instrument\n\nMethod of data analysis\n\nChapter four: presentation of data and discussion of results\n\nData analysis\n\nChapter five: summary, conclusion and recommendation\n\nSummary\n\nConclusion\n\nRecommendations\n\nReferences\n\nQuestionnaire\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nBACKGROUND OF STUDY\n\nA computer is an electronic device that can process data. Computer system is capable of accepting input data (unprocessed data), through an input device, store and processed the data and place processed data (information) on the out put device generally called output.\n\n            Some people have always responded to as problem with some types of solutions. The birth of electronic multi media like computer is no exception when barter economy was replaced by monetary economy, the need for number, computation and the keeping of records, become apparent. As early as 300 B.C. number were in use in some parts of the world.\n\n            The concept of number and counting is said to have been initiated or developed by Hardsman who after their animals, returned in the evening they could be accounted for. Later other simple methods such as sticks and stones were also used to count. The first real computations aid, abacus, was developed in China as early as 2600 B.C.. Abacus is still commonly used in the world today.\n\n            In 1614 John Napier, a Scotish mathematician invented the Napier logarithm. In 1768, Galvanic became the first man to identify electro mechanical machine which is used to add stored data.  \n\nIn this age of information and communication technology (ICT) where the world seems to be reduced to a global hamlet, no country desire to be mapped out for the relevant hamlet. Information and communication technology is therefore an indispensable tool for global hamlet. In the context of this research, ICT focused on the enhancement of students’ performance of school subjects through the use of computer aided instruction in computer science. In that case, knowledge and skills acquisition are necessary as a fundamental of ICT. Science education in general and computer science in particular today, demand for teachers capable of teaching the new technology and helping students interpret and repackage information and provide information. Rich environment, for communication to use ICT in the learning environment, there is need for students to have access to multimedia like computer, fax machine, telephone and electronic mail etc. Experts however believe that the educational sector is suffering neglect towards effective access of information (Ofulure 1999). The new communication technology has no distance and boundary and time so that the remotest village in Nigeria has the possibility of trapping a global store of knowledge. This development makes it possible to receive vast amount of information from anywhere in the world in seeds. Although cultural compatibility and the high rate of purchase and maintenances multimedia like computer in developing countries may make the demand for multimedia (computer) in science classroom seems luxury. At the moment, this state of affair may not last for a very long period of time. The use of computer to facilitate learning of computer science within the formal learning and teaching situation will eventually enhance the acceptance of this versatile technology in the developing countries, which are normally dominated by the indigenous technology. All teachers are now expected to make use of ICT to support teaching and learning environment. A few feel uncomfortable if asked to teach in an ICT suite rather than their own laboratory that they will do anything they can do to avoid it or will leave the management of the lesson to the ICT technician or coordinator. Many feel that they could do a better job if the resource were more accessible for the lesson and the scheme of work. Being able to use ICT confidentially at home and as the teacher in charge of the lesson are two different things. Apart from the general classroom management issues, there can also be disconcerting technical differences. The extra demands of simply working on a network can provide a large confident benefit. Many staff and the school network security arrangement can make that aspect of using the internet in lesson require a little more planning. For example, it is useful to be able to write hyper link into a word document to make students directly to relevant website but those may need to work in advance with the ICT technical manager to make sure that useful websites are “book marked” or entered in “favorites” for resource centred organizations who packaged folders for easier access or data. Here, book marked sites with their favorites are directly chained or linked to desire web pages of choice.\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nIn recognition of the significant role of ICT in the technology of the nation, the federal government through the federal ministry of education introduced multi media students in unity schools. In 1990 (Borishade, 2000). The ministry did not stop there, it also organized annual holiday multi media programme for secondary school students in collaboration with some oil companies with a view to making every Nigerian citizen literate. It provide some multimedia for the unity school and produce a syllabus for the secondary school multi media (computer) studies. The national policy on education made provision for multi media (computer) education for junior and senior secondary schools as electives. After one decade of the introduction of the programme, very little result to have been achieved. No examination has been written on multi media (computer) education in JSCE. No wonder Jegede (2002) observed that our society is too slow in the uptake of ICT. Lack of qualified teachers in the area of ICT is a serious impediment to its implementation. Only a few universities in the country such as (OAU, RSUER, ESUT) out of the whole lot offer courses in either computer science or computer engineering. It is only OSUT that gives information and communication technology as a course. Most of the computer science STM teachers in our schools are not computer literates and as such are not able not reflect any respect of ICT in their teaching as they can not give what they do not have. Most of our secondary schools do not have enough multi media (computer) for any meaningful learning to take place, even the available computers do not function. Some multi media are not properly maintained due to lack of fund, lack of qualified technicians and poor maintenance culture which is a serious problem in this country.\n\nPURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe purpose of this study includes:\n\ni.)                  To know the use of multi media in the teaching of computer science.\n\nii.)                To know the meaning of information and communication technology.\n\niii.)               \n\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe result of this study will enable the application of multi media in the field of teaching and learning computer science carefully emphasizes and heighten practical results to support stepwise knowledge building, consolidation and claim of proactive education and development. It has platform for designing both curriculum-related activities and computer-based culture technologies, in terms of helping students on how teachers swing within scientific theory and empirical evidence. This strategy will greatly teaching and learning and hence increase understanding of the use of audio-visual aids which shows diagrammatic representation of processed. It will help students participate in the lesson. It will also help students to alleviate the problem of large class size which typifies computer science class.\n\nRESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1.  Will the multi media (computer) facilitate students to learning in developing countries?\n\n2.  In view of the need to be mindful of cost, will cooperative learning techniques with multi media help in promoting students’ achievement?\n\n3.  What is the level of achievement of Nigerian students when learning is undertaking with the use of the multi media?\n\n4.  Do most SIM teaching lack ICT expertise and could not computers as teaching aids?\n\nSCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\n      The scope of this research work is limited to using multi-media as necessary tool to teaching and learning computer science in some select secondary school in Oredo local government area of Edo state. It covers the problems encountered and the solutions to such problems in the case study.\n\nDEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nJ.S.S.C.E.: Junior Secondary School Certificate Examination.\n\nICT: Information and Communication Technology.\n\nOAU: Obafemi Awolowo University.\n\nRESUT: River State University of Technology.\n\nESUT: Enugu State University of Technology.\n\nOSUT: Oyo State University of Technology.\n\nSTM: Science, Technology and Mathematics.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF STAFF PROMOTION SYSTEM\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1       BACKGROUND OF STUDY\n\nAccording to Thompson (2008), Promotion is the advancement of an employee’s rank or position in an organizational hierarchy system. Promotion may be an employee’s reward for good performance, i.e., positive appraisal. Before a company promotes an employee to a particular position it ensures that the person is able to handle the added responsibilities by screening the employee with interviews and tests and giving them training or on-the-job experience. A promotion can involve advancement in terms of designation, salary and benefits, and in some organizations the type of job activities may change a great deal. The opposite of a promotion is a demotion.\n\nA promotion can involve advancement in terms of designation, salary and benefits, and in some organizations the type of job activities may change a great deal. In many companies and public service organizations, more senior positions have a different title: an analyst who is promoted becomes a “principal analyst”; an economist becomes a “senior economist”; or an associate professor becomes a “full professor”. The amount of salary increase associated with a promotion varies a great deal between industries and sectors, and depending on the what parts of the hierarchical ladder an employee is moving between. In some industries or sectors, there may be only a modest increase in salary for a promotions; in other fields, a promotion may substantially increase an employee’s salary.\n\nThe same is true with benefits and other privileges; in some industries, the promotion only changes the title and salary, and there are no additional benefits or privileges (beyond the psycho-social benefits that may accrue to the individual). In some not-for-profit organizations, the values of the organization or the tightness of funding may result in there being only modest salary increases associated with a promotion. In other industries, especially in private sector companies, a promotion to senior management may carry a number of benefits, such as stock options, a reserved parking space, a corner office with a secretary, and bonus pay for good performance. The degree to which job activities change varies between industries and sectors. In some fields, even after an employee is promoted, they continue to do similar work. For example, a policy analyst in the federal government who is promoted to the post of senior policy analyst will continue to do similar tasks such as writing briefing notes and carrying out policy research. The differences may be in the complexity of the files that the individual is assigned to or in the sensitivity of the issues that they are asked to deal with. In other fields, when an employee is promoted, their work changes substantially. For example, whereas a staff engineer in a civil engineering firm will spend their time doing engineering inspections and working with blueprints, a senior engineer may spend most of their day in meetings with senior managers and reading financial reports. In symphony orchestras, when a musician such as a violinist is promoted to the position of concertmaster, their duties change substantially. As a violin player, the individual played the music as part of the violin section. As a concertmaster, the individual plays solo parts, decides on the bowings and interpretation of the music, and leads the violins during performances. Different organizations grant the hiring and promoting managers different levels of discretion to award promotions. In some parts of the private sector, the senior management has a very high level of discretion to award promotions, and they can promote employees without going through much procedures or formalities such as testing, screening, and interviewing. In the public sector and in academia, there are usually many more checks and balances in place to prevent favoritism or bias. In many Western public service bodies, when a manager wants to promote an employee, they must follow a number of steps, such as advertising the position, accepting applications from qualified candidates, screening and interviewing candidates, and then documenting why they chose a particular candidate. In academia, a similar approach is used, with the added safeguard of including several layers of committee review of the proposed promotion using committees which include members of other faculty and experts from other universities.\n\nIn Cross River University of Technology (CRUTECH), promotion is done annually and commences in April. All department heads submits a comprehensive assessment of the teaching administrative abilities of each staff which includes result of students’ evaluation. Staffs are considered for promotion if they have spent up to about three years.\n\nThere is no computerised system which takes in the criteria for promotion in CRUTECH to determined if a staff is fit for promotion or not. All promotion documents are computed manually and pose a lot of problems when promotion is to be given to staffs. There by there is need for the development of a computerised promotion system so as to eliminate the manual promotion determination methods being presently under taken by CRUTECH.\n\n1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nThe present promotion system of Cross River University of Technology, Calabar is done by manual means, whereby a committee (promotion and appointment committee) is form to consider if a particular staff is reach or satisfied all the promotion criteria. This promotion process takes a whole lot of time in doing these, looking into the promotion criteria and secondly, they is bound to be a bias attitude of the committee to favour their own personal interest or candidate and as such, lot of partial is involve in the manual process and this is a big problem to be tackled\n\n1.3       AIM AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe aim is to design and develop an automated staff promotion software to accomplish the following :\n\n1.  \n\nReduce the bias action of the promotion committee members.\n\n2.   Reduce the long process involve in the conducting interview",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF COMPUTER AIDED CHARTING AND GRAPHIC SYSTEM FOR STATISTICAL PRESENTATION\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nStatistic is scientifically the method of organizing, summarizing presenting and analyzing collected data coupled with the drawing of valid conclusion and reasonable decision.\n\nIn a close view, the term  statistic is used to denote the data themselves or numbers derived from the data such as averaged when speaking of employment statistic, accident any events statistics etc.  After collecting statistics data the investigation has to classify and present them in form that make the important features  of his subject matter easily grasped and integrated. The methods of presenting data are as follows:\n\n(i)           The text method\n\n(ii)          The semi text method\n\n(iii)        The tabulat method\n\n(iv)         Diagrammatic and geographic method\n\nIn this write up we are concentrating on diagrammatic and graphic method which is related to our area of study. The diagrammatic and graphic method of presenting statistical data was introduced in the letter part of the eighteenth century by William Playfair, which consist of using diagrams charts and graphs in presenting data. This entails to readiness and quickly understanding of the  presented data\n\nFortunately, information processing technology made a breakthrough in the invention and development of the computer system. A computer is s machine or electronic devices which stores data, analyze it and produce information as required from the data. The manual presentation of data which involves the using protractors and others in platting of graph, drawing pie charts and others is time consuming and it also create s lot of stress to the investigation which may result to in accurate calculation of the presented data\n\nAs the world grow in to a computer one and manual presentation of statistical data couldn’t help in the accurate calculation of the existing population. But with the introduction of the computer into the statistical world the computerize system present a terrific advantage over manually based system in that they enable the investigator to bring together promptly and accurate result of the population of a particular area \n\nIn Nigeria today, there has been a lot of misconception about the introduction of computer and its antecedent effect. Some had gone as far as saying that the impersonal effect associated with the  application of computers will eventually lead to unemployment, while there is not altogether false, there are those that I think  the introduction of computers in statistical presentation of data is a welcome development that had been log awaited.\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThis project was design due to :\n\n(a)          Inaccurate result always yielded due to manual presentation of data\n\n(b)          Time consuming of manual presentation of statistical data\n\n(c)          To give the investigator total relaxation\n\n(d)          To avoid waste of energy in drawing and plotting of graphs\n\nPUPORSE OF THE STUDY\n\n     This project is used to develop a software that will be used for charting in statistical presentation of data . the programme is designed in such a way that it interacts with the investigator and the investigator will give his own command on how he want the chart to be. The charting can be in :\n\n(i)           Pie method\n\n(ii)          Tabular method\n\n(iii)        Graphic method\n\nThe pie method take the form of pie charts which  is drawn in form of a circle showing part of the total statistical data presented. Pie chart area effective diagram used for presenting data of proportion or percentages of a whole. The tabular method involves the systematic arrangement of facts and figures in series of boxes made up of rows and column, which makes the table easy to read and facilitates quick comparison\n\nThe graphic form can be seen inform of bar charts which is a block diagram in which the length of the bar is proportional to the magnitude under consideration. They are used to show comparative figures in statistical presentation of data, several bars are placed together to facilitate comparison.\n\n AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThis study looks into the difficulties and time consuming, the investigator finds  himself into, the charting for statistical presentation was computerized to reduce most of this difficulties.\n\nThe study is therefore designed to bring into account an overview of the application o computers in the various  service being rendered by t he investigator and how the application of computers has affected the efficiency of statistical presentation\n\nSCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nIn this research work, the only considered difficulty is time consuming encountered by the investigator while carrying out statistical research of the population of a particular area, which gives him a lot of stress in calculating of figures, drawing of charts and a lot of time will be wasted while carrying out the research manually .\n\nBut with the help of computer charting, the difficulties and time consuming will be eliminated.  The survey is restricted to civil servants working with statistical presentation of data in Nigeria.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPUTER BASED STOCK MONITORING SYSTEM\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0       INTRODUCTION\n\n            A stock exchange is an organized market where large and small investors alike but and sell through stock brokers. The stocks and shares of companies and government, agencies stock exchange is an institution that provides the facilities that enables both companies and government to raise long term and medium term funds for the establishment, expansion and development of projects through investors. It is really an organized market for already existing security (bounds, stocks and shares) rather than few new issues. Securities of varying types are traded openly on floor of the exchange and through this means, the institution serve as an efficient vehicle for the allocation of available, capital funds to the diverse uses within an economy.\n\nThe application of the computer technology in stock exchange market is believed to faster a dramatic advancement in the mode of operation of the market since speed, accuracy and efficiency remains the Hallmark of the computer technology more so in the next millennium when the application of the computer in every human endeavour will become a condition sine qua non.\n\n1.1       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\n            In spite of the remarkable progress fostered by the stock exchange institution in relation to the economic and social development of the countries that initiate its services, it’s advancement have been hampered as a result of the following factors which have become the bone of the spanner.\n\n(a)        Paucity of shares to buy on the market and trade in i.e. low volume of securities\n\n(b)        The “buy-bond-hold” attitude of Nigeria investors.  \n\n(c)        Infrastructural deficiencies resulting in delays in obtaining share certificates, dividend warrants e.t.c.\n\n(d)       The low level of public awareness as to the benefits derivable from the operation of the capital market\n\n(e)        Inadequate legal framework. \n\n1.2       PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\n            The relevance of this study is to check the anomaly associated with the stock exchange dealings in Nigeria since it’s institution provided transaction is being carried out by man and recordings of the daily transaction and mode of operation done by him, irregularities are bound to be associated which may be as a result of business share prejudice or even undue manipulation of date in favour of a selfish interest at the expense of the investors or the establishments, which are the primary beneficiaries of the invested, capital funds. If these checks and balances are effectively carried out since the aid of the computer stands better chance of accomplishing that, the stock exchange dealings will prove to the world that it is the best avenue of channeling capital investment which will in turn curb the inflationary possibilities of our economy, finance our recurrent budget benefit and improve the balance of payment position of the country.\n\n1.4       AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\n            The basic aims and objective of this project work are as follows.\n\n1.         To eliminate all forms of fraudulent activities associated with the stock exchange market.\n\n2.         To ensure that timely and accurate information about transactions on the floor gets to the marketers.\n\n3.         To eradicate all the difficulties encountered by recording and storage of data which are being done manually.\n\n4.         To encourage easy access to the information about the market.\n\n5.      To facilitate increment in the volume of shares available in the market by discouraging the share-box attitude of Nigeria investors.\n\n1.4       SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\n            This project work is only limited to operations of the stock market in relation to the services they render to both government establishment and companies by ensuring that the shares within their Jurisdiction are adequately sole to the public who constitution the potential investors in accordance to pre-defined rules and regulation. It also incorporate the effective reallocation of shares from existing shareholders to other interested investors is not left out in this piece of work. It also includes a proper updating of the daily transaction on the floor to keep customers a breast with the development on the floor as a guide against frauds and irregularities.\n\n1.5       CONSTRAINTS\n\n            Life is full of impediments which stand as challenges to every human endeavour thus this project work is not an exception as a number of constraints are associated to it, but it must not be forgotten that without challenges. Changes which give room to great height remain illusive.\n\n            Among a number of eliminations to this are the following:\n\n(i)                     Time:  The time stipulated for the completion of this work is not commensurate to the task capacity as a lot is required to give this work a benefiting look.\n\n(ii)        Finance:         The financial requirement for the successful completion of this project is inadequate.

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF COMUPTERIZED BUSINESS FORECASTING SYSTEM USING REGRESSION ANALYSIS\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1     OVERVIEW OF FORCASTING TECHNIQUES.\n\n          Right from the time life started, till now, man ahs sought to forecast the future. Things that happened before are used to justify what will take place in the future. Most of the times, it becomes true while at other time it facts. The ability to forecast the consequence of actions and events is one of the defining properties of the mind.\n\n          In any business situation, it is necessary to be able to make some predictions about the future in order to make some predictions about the future in order to plan the business operations well-Arriving at such an climate of the future is the purpose of the process of forecasting.\n\n          In the service sector, a forecast of demand for the service being offered is necessary to determine the number of staff that will be sufficient enough for the business and the quantity of raw materials to be bought.\n\n          In the retailing sectors, forecast of sales will be needed to decide staffing levels and also to determine what qualifies of stock should be purchased. Excessive levels of stock tie up working capital and storage space, further expenses can be incurred through such process as theft, insurance and possibly, deterioration. On the other head, inadequate re-order quantities such as high, ordering cost and the inability to meet customers demand.\n\n          Forecasting is simply the scientific name for guessing, what the will bring. There are several standard techniques available for forecasting and each techniques has it’s own assumption, benefits and pitfall.\n\n          This project is concerned with the evaluation of the different forecasting techniques used by Anammco Ltd Emene, Enugu to determine how to manage their business operation.\n\n          Consider the following problems.\n\nProblems 1: A sales manager collects together records of the past sales for particular product how does he find a forecasting techniques that gives good forecasts for this data?\n\n          Problems 2: A member of his staff suggests that a particular method of forecasting. How does the sales manager test this method of forecasting to see if it can yield any solution?\n\n          The ability to find answers to questions such as these is obliviously basic to the whole exercise of practical forecasting. It is necessary for me to know which forecasting techniques is best for any particular problems.\n\n1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS.\n\n          The investigation done revealed that workers manually do the record keeping for forecasting.\n\n          The above manual system is outdated in terms of speed of processing and accuracy. This results into wastage of time and in efficiency in productions.\n\n          These inefficiencies call for the computerization of the operations of the forecast.\n\n1.3    Purpose of study.\n\n          The purpose of this research is to present the different forecasting techniques used by Anammco ltd in manufacturing their cars. It  is however to make analysis based in definite statistical data, which will enable an executive to take advantage of future condition to a greater extent than he could do without them.\n\n1.4    Aims and objectives.\n\n          The objective include the following.\n\nA.      To help the managers and all those interacted in obtaining forecast for practical purposes to be able to make decision on which forecasting techniques to use at different situation.\n\nB.      To demonstrate the different methods which Anammco uses in their business forecast.\n\nC.      To point out that all forecast used by Anammco have errors and that the measurement of the errors is critical.\n\nD.      To help the managers and forecasters to know the internal values of forecalls and the degree of confidence they need to have in the forecast.\n\n1.5    SCOPE OF STUDY.\n\n          This project uses the simple linear repression analysis that concerns itself with just one explanatory variable and a linear form of relationship. The explanatory variable could be time of periods.\n\n          The other forecasting methods are the exponential smoothing and the moving average methods, which are used, should a time series observation exhibits a trend. This exhibition of trend can be verified with a scatter diagram of the observation against observed points.\n\n          Forecast can be made from such models built using methods  above after analysis by the software such forecast most likely will be in the short to medium term range.\n\n          The methods though appear complex is simplified as will be seen in the user friendly  user interfaces. The complex or the multi-variable regression analysis was avoided in this project as well as the logarithm exponential smoothing for the purpose of the project.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF COMPUTERIZED STAFF RECORD SYSTEM\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.1   INTRODUCTION\n\nStaff records department in a firm or in an organization like ours is a department that gathers information regarding staff statistics and condition of service. This information is obtained continually to ensure continuity in staff management.\n\nThe conversional methods of keeping the 0se records are basically the same in higher institutions.\n\nWith so much importance attached to the provision of quality records in this   information age, then the need to follow the trend of information technology (I.T) to speed up and reduce the stress in manual method of keeping records. To achieve this, an object oriented programming language like visual basic 6.0 is used to develop the software.\n\n1.2    BACKGROUND OF STUDY\n\nThe federal polytechnic Nekede Owerri was initially established as a college of technology Owerri by edict No.16 dated 1st April, 1978. In 1987 it was renamed, the polytechnic by the Imo state government.\n\nThe institution was taken over by the federal government in April 1993 and is now governed by the federal polytechnic act to perform the following functions:\n\n  a)  To provide full- time or part –time courses of instruction and         training:\n\nOn such other fields of applied science, commerce   and management, and\nOn such other fields of applied learning relevant to the needs of the development of Nigeria in the area of industrial and agricultural\nproduction and distribution and for research in the development and adaptation of techniques as the council may from time to time determine:\nb)    To arrange conference, seminars and study groups relative to the   fields of learning specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection (1):\n\nc)       To perform such function as in the opinion of the council may serve to promote the objectives of the polytechnic.\n\nAt the early stage of this institution staff was few, therefore making the retrieval of information from files very easy. At this early stage, updating staff files was an easy task.  The management on any of the department could go through all folders to make out staff list, compile all the staff salary for a given period of time and it was very easy to monitor the efficiency of each staff.\n\nToday the numbers of staff have increased tremendously which makes it a bit difficult to update the records of staff. Because of this constrain the reason for user application software that could implement all these at the click of a button.\n\nSTATEMENT OF PROBLEM\nInstitutions, organizations and banks in Nigeria at the earlier stages of their inception have been manually operated. That is, records are organized, accessed, and retrieved by human beings manually. This manual method made the whole thing very difficult to handle.\n\nWith the increase in staff in our institution, the above method has been proven very difficult and tedious to work upon. The problems faced here are:\n\nPoor statistics about a particular staff: this may be as a result of lost or misplaced staff files\nLonger Waiting Time: The record clerk wastes so much time in bringing a staff folders. In case the management needs the record for a particular staff, it takes the clerk time to manually organize the data and bring it to the destination where it is needed. Thereby contributing to time wastage.\nInaccurate Staff Report: Sometimes staff report are not properly stated and reported. This results to questionable report being sent to management for planning.\nMishandling of Staff Folders: Staff folders are often handled with little or no regard. This leads to detaching and tearing away of some of the staff important documents.\nUnrestricted Access To Staff Records: Due to poor security checks in most institutions, staff records which are main to be confidential are exposed to unauthorized persons.\nThese and more contribute to inefficient records keeping.\n\nOBJECTIVE OF STUDY\nThe purpose of this project work is to develop an automated staff record system that could speed up records job efficiently and effectively, and also reduce the cost of labour.\n\nUp-To-Date RECORDS OF STAFF ARE KEPT: This allows for easy retrieval of staff files when the need arises. Staff data are kept up-to-date so as to enhance the assessment of the staff both for future, present and past records.\n\nThis can also be used for staff appraisal and also help to monitor the conduct of the staff at a glance through the records. By viewing the database, vital information for planning, staff equipment and the welfare of the institution is obtained thus improving resources allocation.\n\nStaff records are stored by the system: This will eliminate the problem of lost files thereby improving record services tendered   by the records department.\n\nIn a networked environment, terminals or workstation should be present only at the records room and the personnel or administration manager’s office. The software should include security checks to prevent unauthorized access to confidential records of a staff stored in the system’s database. The software would be menu-driven to provide a user-friendly environment\n\n1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY\n\nThis work serves as a launching pad for federal polytechnic Nekede Owerri to enhance the recording system by computerization of their record system.\n\nThis project work is breaking new grounds in the area of computerization of staff record system; it will serve as a stepping-stone for student researchers and her interested explorer in this field.\n\nThough this software is designed using Federal Polytechnic Owerri as a case study any other institution or firm can use the software with just a little modification.\n\n1.6   SCOPE OF STUDY\n\nThe extent to be covered in this project work is, this work creates a database for the staff record system for federal polytechnic Nekede. This project work is going to cover the staff form, arrival report form and annual leave form. With the system on the network the personnel director can view the staff record at a glance, which will help him to know the number of work force he has. It will help him know the number of staff in each department and the department that needs more or less staff.",

It is also entrusted with the task of issuing international traveling passport to eligible Nigerians.\n\n            This study focused on the review of the manual mode of operations at some of the sections, namely the control section, the administration and passport section with a view to computerize their activities.\n\nA computerized information system has been developed to facilitate storage and retrieval of information.\n\n            Furthermore the adequate keeping of records of immigrants entering or leaving Nigeria and finally prints of the individuals involve are the provisional offers of the computerized system.\n\n            All these measures are geared towards improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the immigration department.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe unity and mutual understanding reigning amongst the countries of the world today has encourage the free movement of people all over the world. Such people visits countries of their choice based on their interest many people travel to other countries for business transaction, tourism, education, diplomatic and political purpose and other miscellaneous reasons.\n\nDespite the understanding existing amongst countries, intending visitors to any country are expected to have sought the mandate of the government of that country through the embassy or accredited representatives of the country based on his/her own country.\n\n            The immigration department therefore, is the official government agency responsible for taking care of the interest of intending immigrants or immigrants already residing in the country for monitoring and regulating the entry and exit of immigration into or out of their country.\n\n            The immigration Department in Nigeria established after the promulgation of the immigration act in 1963 are responsible for examining and interrogating any person wishing to enter or leave Nigeria through air, sea or land, moreso, the person’s baggage are searched to identify what he/she is travelling with.\n\nThe control section in the in the immigration department is saddled with the task of approving signed documents for travelling. The administration section deals with the documenting, processing and storage of traveler’s document for future references. The passport in the immigration department is saddled with the task of passport photographs. Filling of the acquired forms and forwarding of the forms to the control section where it will be approved and sign.\n\nThe design of an immigration information system involves a situation whereby all the activities and procedures carried out before an immigrant/emigrant will be credited is processed with the aid of the computer it requires a computer statement of immigration program since the computer can do virtually nothing without a workable computer program. The program contains all the immigration form by a particular immigrant/emigrant.\n\nSTATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\n            From the inception of organisation, emphasizing on a particular department in the organisation the immigration has been engaging or encountering enormous problem running their daily activities in producing the travelling document for the immigrants/emigrants.\n\n            The glaring disadvantages of the manual approach of processing immigration document and some of problems it posses and underlets:\n\n1.      It takes a long time in accessing record in manual system that is in filling cabinet.\n\n2.      Detection of errors and faults on forms.\n\n3.      The fact that records are stored on paper makes it easily accessible for vandalization by unauthorized persons.\n\n4.      Untimely inefficient and inaccurate processing of data and handling of immigrant record by the immigrant officers.\n\nPURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis project is geared towards eradication of all the deformities and loopholes of the manual method of processing immigration requirement. This developing a new system to handle all the jobs/work involves in immigration electronically. Supplying all the deficiencies of the existing system.\n\nConsequent upon the elimination of the deficiencies and edifying of the deformities encountered in the existing system. Over shadowing its operational incapacitation by developing a computer based, solution of storing information and processing of immigrant’s form\n\n            Furthermore, since the immigrations department has been manually functioning ever since it was promoted and established in1963, many people are wondering whether the design of a computerized immigration information system has any impact to their mode of operation. The outcome of these study will be useful to immigration department in general. The study will go along way in highlighting the procedures of the immigration information system been computerized thereby minimizing or eliminating any form of disfunctional or unwanted particulars. The eradication of the problem of traditional method and the implementation of the system will encourage the user’s to work for organisation because it reduces stress of work.\n\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe aim of this project is to work towards the elimination of ineffective mode of operation. It centered on the user to having conductive atmosphere for work thereby minimizing stress and further aimed as a means of safe guarding information, which will serve as reference for making management decision, it is also aimed at accurate and timely processing of immigration forms.\n\n            The objective from the initiator of the proposal is geared towards combating all the aims and the problems being discovered on the existing system. Finding out the requirement needed to build the new system, the type of database  to be produced to suit the comfortability of the user  of the software; would it be based on the sequential or random or index mode of operation.\n\nSCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe scope of this project work covers all the activities of immigration in Nigeria using the Federal Secretariat Enugu as a case study. iT will keep adequate records of immigrants entering or leaving Nigeria and hold a data bank of passport holders.",

In as much as motor vehicle registration has been in existent for ages now, the old system of registration has been in adoption which did not play a significant role on highway safety until the development of the new system of vehicle registration where a reflective sheeting which is more visible to read even in the dark.\n\n            This new system of motor vehicle registration which is the main focus of this project came into existent on the 19th March 1997 and handled by the motor licensing officer. It introduced to enforce strict compliance to traffic rules and regulation as well as providing a proper data as to the behaviour of road users. The roles which the introduction of computer system will play in the function in order to bring about more efficiency, effectiveness and improve competence and discussed in this project. This work is segmented into chapters which will be seen as we move on.\n\n            Motor vehicle registration is done by two offices, namely local government licensing offices for personal vehicles and the cabinet office or any military office. Since motor vehicle registration is absolutely essential traffic matters, it is vital to establish and sustain an information system using a reliable device like computer system in order to maintain and provide proper data/record concerning the road users in the aspect of traffic function.\n\n            In order to eliminate most hardship encountered in most of our licensing offices, the need for computerization with designing and implementation of a state motor vehicle registration and its advantages to the licensing office.\n\nSTATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\n            These are the problems that are being encountered in the manual system of vehicle registration. And the problems goes thus:\n\n(i)         PARTICIPATION OF UNAUTHORIZED OFFICERS\n\nUnauthorized offices according to my observation are involved in this work especially in the registration of illegal vehicles which can encourage fraud.\n\n(ii)        WRONG CHARGING OF FEES\n\nThe officer in-charge is bound to charge a wrong bill to vehicle owners which may be as a result of underassessment or over assessment of vehicles. This could be with motive to commit fraud or as a result of mistake on the part of the officer at work.\n\n(iii)       WRONG SALES ALLOCATION\n\nStaff under a particular state motor vehicle licensing office indulge in registering of vehicles that does not belong to their state.\n\n(iv)       IMPROPER ACCOUNTING\n\nThere is the tendency of the cashier involved in the handling of income generated to make mistake during this process, thus having some measures of inaccuracy in the work.\n\n(v)        There is difficulty at times in tracing a record/information cautioning a vehicle owner due to improper information keeping as a result of carelessness or volume in the size of record kept.\n\n1.2       PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\n            The purpose of this study is to design and implement a state motor vehicle registration since it is important in providing sanity on roads and yielding revenue for the government. In as much as this problems still exists in the manual operation, we intend to carve out a technique which will serve as means of providing solution to the problems\n\n1.3       AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\n            As we have seen from the statement of the problems, the things that stands as puzzle in the manual system of motor vehicle registration aims at introducing a better system which is the computerized system which will contribute on providing solution to the problems.\n\ni.          AUTOMATIC ASSIGNING OF FEES\n\nSince each vehicle is charged based on the amount was bought. This work aims at automatic assigning of correct amount once the above mentioned assessment is done thus preventing the error of wrong assessment.\n\nii.         PROPER ACCOUNTING\n\nThis also aims at giving an up-to-date report of the revenue generate from vehicle registration within a defined period.\n\niii.        RESTRICTION OF ILLEGAL ACCESS\n\nThe told number of users that will have access to this program will be limited therefore password will be created for the application software. This password will just be limited to the officer in charge of the work.\n\niv.        EASY RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION\n\nThis work will help on using the registration of a particular vehicle to call up the information record concerning the owner of the vehicle.\n\n1.4       SCOPE OF STUDY\n\n            Motor vehicle registration since it is two different offices namely local government motor licensing office and cabinet office, and having used motor licensing office Enugu South as my case study which is only involves in registering of personal vehicle just like any other local government. Motor licensing office (L.G.M.L.D) I limited my studies to private vehicles within Enugu.",

Vital information is the life wire or backbone of any organization. From sports statistics to the latest stock market price such facts keep people abreast of time.\n\n          Computing, printing, photography and some recording are all forms of automatic information processing.\n\nIn all of these processed , the information as perceived by man, is captured, processed, transmitted and stored.\n\nFinally it is reproduced in a form which can be easily understood by man.\n\n          Next, there is a need to store the information so that it can be referenced when necessary . computers are unrivalled in their capacity to store data. Therein lies the importance of application software which configure the computer to act as an intelligent typewriter or entrepreneur, so long as the correct command are given.\n\n          A database is one of the most acceptable business software application today. It is a collection of related information that is organized for case of reference.\n\nThis means that one could maintain a database on paper, stored in file holders that were kept in file cabinets.\n\nThat was the case before the advent of computers. File had to be pulled out of cabinets, forms filled and paper shuffled.\n\n          This project describe how all these could be done electronically. It shows how information could be stored, modified and recalled instantly and accurately.\n\nInformation on staff of the establishment of case study is maintained, reports are lodged in and more reports are generated from these.    \n\nORGANIZATION OF WORK\n\n          The project is made up of two section namely the write up and the program section. The write up section is made up of seven chapter each chapter with its sub-headings. Chapter one dealt with the problems, purpose, objective, scope constrains assumptions and definitions of terms used in the project. Chapter two talks about the literature review on the topic of the project chapter three discussed the existing system its problems, input, output and processing procedures.

The main function of this department is to secure the labs and the properties that belongs to this institution. They also settle some problems in between the student and the staff. Eg streting of life and other things. The security department, I.M.T Enugu (S D I E) started in this institution in 1977. in security department, there was a thing they called “ABEEAT ”. BEEAT is an area given to the security man to look after it, during the working hour, to see if there will be any problem around. They also have a communication system, such as telephone, working talking, radio message etc.\n\nThis project ray emphasis on the security department (SOLT) of I.M.T. the security is one of the department under the function called health safety and environment East (HSEE). The main function of this department is to project assets in terms of lives and project.\n\n1.1    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS \n\nSecurity of data or information in many establishment is becoming a sources of concern to the management of the establishment due to problems normally encountered in each department of an organization, security its human, individual data, information and resources and its complexity and duplications some organizations prefer having a security department where all the information’s about human and material resources are put into a data bank which allows for easier access and retrieval of information. However, due to large number of processes that goes on in the manual operation and loss of information associated with it, it therefore becomes necessary to automate the activities of the security department.\n\n1.2    PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT\n\n          Security department, IMT Enugu (SDIE) is the secure with many departments. One of such department is the security department although the operation of all this departments have not be computerized but security been vital to the development of I.M.T Enugu needs to be computerized at all cost. A continued manual operation of the security department of I.M.T Enugu will endanger or put the operation  of IMT in jeopardy, hence the purpose of this project is to automate the operation of the security department in order to ensure good co-ordinations.\n\n1.3    OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT\n\n          Inspite of the larges of I.M.T, the level of automation and computing done there, it may be a little surprising to discover that there are some areas where computing is still at the grassroots level. An one of such is the security department (SDIE0).\n\n          SDIE is very crucial and sensitive. Its importance cannot be over emphasized. It required a certain degree of projection and secrecy, especially of vital information. These cannot be realized in their current system of operation, which is all manual. The aim of this project is to develop a computer software which will maintain a database for the operation of SIDE. It will also provide procedure for the management of other security related information.\n\n1.4       PROJECT SCOPE\n\nThe scope of this project depends on the available facilities and resources  both human and material. The project will cover two broad aspects, those of staff and security information within the limit of available facilities and information given by the IMT staff.\n\n1.5    MAJOR SOFTWARE FUNCTIONS\n\n          This project will cover two broad area of security department.\n\n1.6    STAFF INFORMATION\n\n          This should feature all pertinent information such as the staff name, the staff employment number, residential address, gender (male or female) etc. which might be useful in staff administration.\n\n2.      SECURITY INFORMATION\n\n          This should have facilities for lodging field reports into the system. periodic reports can be generated at intervals, from these. Moreso, other security information can be obtained from this areas. The software will also incorporate  a facility for file maintenance, operations which would be used to update and modify the records whenever necessary.",

This is because computers are everywhere, whirring and whizzing their electronic ways into cars, homes, offices, schools and business activities.\n\nWhen this machine was first developed, the only people who could operate them were highly trained engineers and scientist to unscramble the genetic code, but these days almost everybody operates computers as a part of daily life activities. Of course many people may not necessary think about the fact that are operating computer as they make adjustment to their digital watches. This tells us that it is important to make computer as easy to make use as possible since so many people now happen to operate this machine that its use seem limitless.\n\nNumbers are usually assign symbols by which ideas they represent are coded and the numbers of digits used to code number in any base is equal to the base, but the conversion of numbers from one base to another appear to be difficult with respect to time wasted in trying to calculate especially when dealing with large numbers, that makes its so boring by the time your thinking ability is involved.\n\nThe advent and the introduction of computer machine has brought an aid to help surmount these problems with the use of a given command.\n\nA computer operator can not just start operating on a computer without having a little ideas of what he/she wants to carry out on the computer before a computer should carry out any structure given, you must apply a command before that task can be executed on.\n\nIt takes just a brief introduction of a command for a new user to become familiar with these computer, since it constitutes of a language in which the use user in communicates with the computer.\n\nThe interactions between the computer and the user is what we called a computer interface the term computer interface is meant to cover all aspect of these interaction not just the hardware.  The primary purpose of the computer interface is to enable full communication between the user and the computer system.\n\n1.1    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS\n\n          Some given problems we have to know about in the aspect of a command driven interface are listed below:\n\n1.           Can a given problem be programmed to convert number fro one base to another with the use of a command driven interface?\n\n2.           can the introduction of the command driver interface in the aspect of number base conversion eliminate\n\n1.2       THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study happens to be very important since its purpose and objectives of carrying research on these study and analysis are to:\n\ni.        to design and develop a system that will be more effective in carrying out the operation of base conversion primarily.\n\nii.       to ascertain whether the existing system is adequate.\n\niii.          It will also highlight inadequacies, if any and determine ways through which application packages can minimize or eliminate the established problem.\n\n1.3       SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nSince different conversions exist in curriculum and test this study concentrates on command driven interface with respect to number base conversion.\n\nThe study is restricted to number base ten, base five, base six, base seven, base eight, base nine and base sixteen also a reserve conversion back to base ten.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPUTERIZED INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR A HUMAN RIGHT BASED ORGANISATION\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0     INTRODUCTION\n\nThe word “right” is derived from the Latin word sector which in the noun form means that to which “person has just and valid claims, whether it be land, a thing or privilege of doing something or saving something.  We have what is called a legal right, which is either the liberty 9protected by law) of acting or abstaining from acting in a specific manner or the power (enforced by law) of compelling a specific person to do or abstain from doing a particular thing.  A legal right is thus the capacity sending in one man or a group of man or controlling with the assert and the assistance of the state the actions of others.  “Human” has been defined as pertaining to characteristics of or having the nature of mankind.\n\n          Morals and interest in any human being is simply because of his/her humanity.  The birth right of all mankind.  The expression “human right” in its wildest connotation embarrasses those civil, political, economic, social, cultural, group, solidarity and developmental right which we considered indispensable to meaningful human existence.\n\n          The Nigeria National Human Right Development Commission was created by a military decree promulgated by the Military Government of General Sani Abacha with the announcement of the latrest in a socials of programs for transaction from military to civilian rule (replacing the transition aborted by the annulment of June 12 1993 election) and was clearly designed as an attempt to head of off international critism of continued military rule in general and repressive policies of the Abacha’s government in particular.\n\n          Following the death of general Abacha in June 1998 his successor General Abdusalami Abubakar scrapped the General Abacha transition program and instituted a new one under condition of operation openness.  As a part of the program a new constitution was drafted by a panel set by General Abubakar with new limited public consultation.  Although the organisation had lobbied for its status to be entrenched in the constitution, this did not take place.  The new constitution came in existence on May 20, 1999.  following election late 1991 and early 1999,  According to the military decree, establishing the human right commission is deemed like similar decrease to be an act of the new national assembly.\n\n1.1     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe issues of human right in Nigeria have been a hidden matter right from the first republic.  People in the country do not know their right because these right are outlined in a very voluminous document hence, populace cannot reach them.  The task is too manual and tedious to cover.  The tedious nature and the denial of these documents call for the improvement in the system of presentation of the human right as outlined in the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria.\n\n1.2     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nAs far as Nigeria is concerned, her citizen find it very difficult to know their right in general due to lack of poor documentation via people’s right and problems encountered so far.  Therefore the purpose of this work is for every retrieval and viewing of well documented information on peoples right Human right especially in Nigeria to the populace at any station as far as you get in touch with the internet.\n\n1.3     AIMS AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe main aim of this project work is to begin a fully computerized web-site.  For human right development of and monitory in Nigeria that will ensure\n\n-                     The education of the populace with respect to their right\n\n-                     The exposure of the arbitrary violation of the human right in Nigeria by individual groups or organization and the government at any level.\n\n-                     Accessing immediate ad remote causes of nay swaying crisis with the country and making meaningful contribution that will proper solution to the problem.\n\n-                      \n\n1.4     SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis project work covers the development of human right in Nigeria.  The rate of degrading of the human dignity both in the military and civilian administration since the inception of the first republic was converted.\n\n1.5     CONSTRAINTS\n\nTime was the major limitation that tried to obstruct the smoothness of this research study.  There was limited time to effectively combine the research work with class study.  Which led to the utilization of leisure time to be able to complete this work and moreover financial problem.\n\n1.6     ASSUMPTION\n\nIt is assumed that the implementation of the web-site for human right monitoring in Nigeria will rapidly improve the standard of the human right status in Nigeria.",

RESOURCE ALLOCATION SYSTEM IN A DYNAMIC /VARIABLE RESOURCE UTILIZATION ENVIRONMENT\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0     INTRODUCTION\n\nThere have been considerable activity recently aimed at developing a computing grid – which can be defined as a distributed system on an internet scale that supports collaboration, data sharing, resource sharing across disparate domains and platforms\n\n1.       To enable the submission of jobs to remote sites in a transparent fashion, technologies such as generic dyterm of describing John and defining service level agreements, relating issues such as security, poyomance and quality of service.\n\n2        A resource management system offers facilities that collectively allow users to run John on the pool of computational resources it manages. The pool may be made up of donated resources not being used by their owners at a given time, on resources allocated to the poll on a full-time basis. The lay out of more resource management system (RMS) the involves a central manager that monitors the state of all the machines  in its pool allocates submitted Jobs to resources using scheduling algonthins and holds gueves of Jobs.

        "content": "INTEGRATED STUDY ON THE USE OF A COMPUTER-BASED RESULT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (CBRMIS)\n\n\n CHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0             INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nCaritas University, Amorji Nike, Enugu, is a private University approved by the Federal Government of Nigeria on December 16 2004. It was officially opened on January 21, 2005 by the Federal Ministry for Education, Prof. Fabian Osuji. The formal opening was on January 31, 2005. The pioneer students of 250 matriculated on May 28, 2005 in beautiful ceremony that attracted dignitaries both church and state. It is the second Catholic University in Nigeria founded by Rev. Fr. Prof. Emmanuel Paul Mathew Edeh Cssp, OFR. Although he founded the school, the proprietor of the University is the Congregation of Sisters the Saviour, a religious Congregation of Nuns founded by him.\n\nThe vision of Caritas University is to rescue some of our wandering and teaming youths from further slide into academic and moral decay, and development and transformation of our society through sound and adulterated education. Its mission is to discover, sanctify and apply the knowledge of science, environmental and engineering for human well-being and sound development of man for better society.\n\nCaritas University’s goal is to give efficacy to the University’s motto and to its philosophy of education. We embrace not only sound education for professional skills and competency in various fields; but also maintain strict discipline. We train the mind, body, soul and spirit in the exercise of obedience and self control. The students must not only be intellectually and professionally prepared for different tasks and roles in the world, they must also be morally equipped to face the world itself with all its tensions, conflicts, challenges and contradictions. We achieve this with the help of God Almighty who is with us always.\n\nThe philosophy is to promote sound education for professional skills and competencies in various fields with strict discipline. By discipline the University meant the training of the mind, body and soul and spirit to obedience and self control. Also to prepare the students to be intellectually and professionally sound for different tasks and roles in the word with its tensions, conflicts, challenges and contradictions.\n\nThe University operates faculty system. Presently, the University operates six faculties: Education and Arts, Engineering, Environmental Sciences, Management, Social Sciences and Natural Sciences.\n\n1.2     DEFINITION\n\nA Computer-Based Result Management Information System (CBRMIS) is a set of\nsoftware programs\nthat  is designed to control the\ninstitution’s\n(practically using CARITAS UNIVERSITY),\nstorage\n, management, and\nretrieval\nof\ndata\n(RESULT) in a\ndatabase\n. CBRMISs are categorized according to their data structures or types. The CBRMIS accepts requests for data from an application program and instructs the\noperating system\nto transfer the appropriate data. The\nqueries\nand responses must be submitted and received according to a format that conforms to one or more applicable protocols. When a CBRMIS is used,\ninformation systems\ncan be changed much more easily as the organization's information requirements change. Use of manual imputation of result is discarded and new categories of data can be added to the database so easily without disruption to the existing system.\n\nA database management system provides the ability for many different users to share data and process resources. But as there can be many different users, there are many different database needs. The question now is: How can a single, unified database meet the differing requirement of so many users?\n\nAs this study entails using a different form of database management in connection with organizational result computation and assessment. This brings about the use of computer-based result management information system (CBRMIS).\n\nBefore the database management approach, the institution relied on the manual method of data processing and storage. Each file was specialized to be used with a specific application. Needless to say, file processing was bulky, costly and nonflexible when it came to supplying needed data accurately and promptly.\n\nThis study therefore, examines clearly the effect of the computer-based result management information system (CBRMIS) towards the development of CARITAS UNIVERSITY.\n\n  1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nSince this study is specifically to use the physical view  to make efficient use of storage and processing resources, therefore, the objective of this study includes the following;\n\n1.     To help in facilitating generation of ad hoc query.\n\n2.     To ensure reliability and transparency in the creation and computation of results\n\n3.     To present a platform for assessment of the performance of the students and workers in other to help develop enabling policy for academic quality and standard.\n\n4.     To prevent unauthorized access or mutilation of the results of the students thereby maintaining data integrity.\n\n5.     To help the users of the result database software (RDS) to manage the overall database environment by providing facilities for backup and recovery, security management, query optimization, concurrency control, and change management.\n\n1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe significance of this study is to examine closely the advantage of this result application to the benefit of Caritas University and the entire community.\n\n1.     It will serve as a reference material to those who use this project material.\n\n2.     It is a contribution to knowledge\n\n3.     It will provide information to other researchers/developers on how best and beneficial the use of a management information system can be in providing accurate information for an organization’s decision making.\n\n4.     It will ensure high level quality service development of the management which will ensure that students are not subjected to undue suffering in collection of their transcript or clearance prior to the deployment for youth service.\n\n 1.5     SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe scope of this study is an integrated study on the use of a Computer-based Result Management Information System (CBRMIS) a case of Caritas University.\n\n1.6     LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nRealizing the financial and time constraints usually associated with students in project of this nature, there is no research carried out that does not experience some difficulties. This work is no exception; the following factors posed serious limitations to the research work.\n\nFinancial constraints: a study like this nature is expected to be carried out on a broader base but because of lack of funds required, some function and programs could not be applied.\n\nTime constraint: in the course of the study, time posed a serious problem in carrying out the test. The duration given for the conduct of this study was short.\n\nNon-availability of materials: during the course of this research, there were non-availability of some critical documents and materials which were classified as confidential.\n\nNon-availability of Exit: because of the nature of the school as a private university, Permission to go out was not always granted and this posed a serious problem towards the actualization of this goal.\n\n1.7     DEFINITION OF TERMS/VARIABLES\n\nManagement: Management is a human action, including design, to facilitate the production of useful outcomes from a system.\n\nProcessing: To deal with somebody or something according to an established procedure\n\nSystem: a set of computer components i.e. in assembly of Computer hardware, software and peripherals functioning together.\n\nAutomation: the replacement of human workers by technology; a system in which a workplace or processes has been converted to one that replaced or ministries human labour with electronic or mechanical equipment.\n\nInformation: Data that has been worked upon and processed.\n\nDatabase: a systematically arranged collection of data, designed so that it can be automatically retrieved or manipulated  easily by authorized users.\n\nDatabase servers:\nDatabase servers\nare computers that hold the actual databases and run only the DBMS and related software.\n\nData structure:\nData structures\n(fields, records, files and objects) optimized to deal with very large amounts of data stored on a      \npermanent\ndata storage device\n(which implies relatively slow access\ncompared\nto\nvolatile main memory\n).\n\nData security:\nData security\nprevents unauthorized users from viewing or updating the database by the use of passwords.\n\nData consistency: Data consistency ensures a consistent view of data to every user.\n\nPassword: this is a secret code that a user must type into a computer to enable He/she access it or its applications.

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPUTERIZED RESULT PROCESSING AND TRANSCRIPT GENERATING SYSTEM (A CASE STUDY OF CARITAS UNIVERSITY)\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\nThere were three fundamentally distinct education systems in Nigeria in 1990.  The indigenous system, Quranic Schools and formal Europeanstyle education institutions.  In the rural areas where the majority lived, children learned the skills of farming and other work, as well as the duties of adulthood, from participation in the community, this process was of ten supplemented by age based schools in which groups of young boys were instructed in community responsibilities by mature men.  By the 1970s, education experts were asking how the system could be integrated into the more formal schooling of the young, but the question remained unresolved by 1990.\n\nWestern-style education came to Nigeria with the missionaries in the mid-Nineteenth century.  Although the first mission school was founded in 1843 by Methodists, it was the Anglican Church missionary society that pushed forward in the early 1850s to found a chain of missions and schools.  Followed quickly in the late 1850s by the Roman Catholics in 1887 in what is now Southern Nigeria, an education department was founded that began setting curricum requirement and administered grants to the mission societies.  By 1914, when North and South were\n\nUnited into one colony, there were fifty-nine government and ninety-one mission primary schools in the South; all eleven secondary schools, except for king’s college in Lagos, work run by the missions.\n\nThe education system focused strongly on examinations. In 1916 Fredrick Lugard, first governor of the Unified Colony, set up a school inspectorate.  Discipline, building and adequacy of teaching staff were to be inspected, but the most points given to a school’s performance went to the numbers and ranking of it’s examinations results.  This stress on examination was still used in 1990 to judge educational results and to obtain qualification for jobs in government and the private sector. As more information is made available in a variety of formats and media and in a variety of locations, the need to manage information/data efficiently becomes more and more critical.  Both staff and public users want access to stored information and want to access it more efficiently.  It is the university policy to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of result processing operations (student record/grades), and services through the implementation of A computerized transcript management system.\n\n1.1 Background of the study\n\nCaritas university, Amorji Nike, Enugu, is a private university approved by the federal government of Nigeria on December 16, 2004.  it was officially opened on January 21, 2005 by the Federal Ministry for Education, Prof. Fabian Osuji, the formal opening was on January 31, 2005.  The pioneer students of 250 matriculated on May 28, 2005 in beautiful ceremony that attracted dignitaries both church and state.  It is the second Catholic University in Nigeria founded by Rev. Fr. Prof. Emmanuel Paul Matthew Edeh CSSP, OFR.  Although he founded the\n\nschool, the proprietor of the University is the congregation of sisters, the Saviour, a religious congregation of Nums founded by him.\n\nThe vision of Caritas university is to reserve some of our wandering and teaming youth from further slide into academic and moral decay, and development and transformation of our society through sound and adulterated education.  It’s mission is to discover, sanctify and apply the knowledge of science, environment central and engineering for human well-being and sound development of man for better society.\n\nCaritas university’s goal is to give efficacy to the university’s motto and to it’s philosophy of education.  We embrace not only sound education for professional skills and competency in various fields; but also maintain strict discipline.  We train the mind, body, soul and spirit in the exercise of obedience and self control.  The students must not only be\n\nintellectually and professionally prepared for different tasks and roles in the world, they must also be morally equipped to face the world itself with all its tensions, conflicts, challenges and contradictions, we achieve this with the help of God Almighty who is with us always.\n\nThe philosophy is to promote sound education for professional skills and competencies in various fields with strict discipline.  By discipline the university meant the training of the mind, body and soul and spirit to obedience and self control.  Also to prepare the students to be intellectually and professionally sound for different tasks and roles in the word with its tensions, conflict, challenges and contradictions.\n\nThe university operates faculty system.  Presently, the university operates six faculties.  Education and Arts, Engineering, Environmental\n\nSciences, Management, Social Sciences and Natural Sciences.\n\n1.2 Statement of Problem\n\nThis project research was conducted exclusively conducted in a caritas university located in a highly populated area that attends to too many students at a time, hence this research was able to track problem such as misplacement of student records, student’s grades, slow and strenuous accessibility to students report and record, inaccurate record keeping and poor information management within the schools.\n\n1.3 Aims and Objectives of the Study\n\nThe aim of this study is to identify the problems inherent in the existing system of transcript management systems, and to proffer a remedy to the existing problem. The solutions are as follows:\n\nØ Record and reports of students will be easily retrieved with increased data security.\n\nØ There will be reduction in the amount of resources, which in turn will lower the cost of processing of student’s transcripts, since information will be stored in a database with reduced data Redundancy.\n\nØ School personnel can attend to many student without being over worked.\n\nØ There will be reduction in time used in retrieval of student’s files.\n\nØ Reduction in bulkiness of files and record.\n\nØ It will make available the storage room that was used for storage of\n\nfiles.\n\n1.4 Significance of the Study\n\nThe project research haven’t identify the problem that was existing in the old system of operation , is designed specifically to come up with a more resound and effective system that will not only counteract this problem but also provides a detailed future plan that will give room for more information technological improvement in the transcript sector.\n\n1.5 Scope of the Study\n\nThis research work are limited to providing a digital transcript’s  information management system that will handle electronically both students and staff record , to enable easy accessibility and information flow within the university.\n\n1.6 Limitation of the Study\n\nThis research work is limited to providing a more reliable information management system that will handle electronically the record of both student and staff within the university.\n\n1.7 Organization of Work\n\nThis project work was arranged specifically arranged in chapters, hence it follows the order: Chapter One: General Introduction, Chapter Two:\n\nLiterature Review, Chapter Three: System Analysis, Chapter Four System Design, and System Implementation, Chapter five: Summary,\n\nConclusion and Recommendation.",

Recent emphasis on information and data processing in most of our business and shipping industries has grown vastly as in the case of super manifest shipping company Lagos that an alternative method has to be mechanical handling of data, preparing of freight, manifest etc.\n\nSuper maritime shipping company is a company which handle the clearing and forwarding of goods, importation of goods and undertakes the clearing of shipping documents and goods within the vessel leaves, the port for a designated ware house as the clients of the company wishes computer technology has come to be accepted as an indispensable innovation in shipping system. It is an all purpose machine that accepts data as input and process it using a set of information given out result as output which can be retrieved for future use. And its revolution has been evident in shipping in order to eliminate most hardship encountered in most of air shipping industries, the need for the computerization with the design and implementation of a computerized goods transportation management information system and its advantage to the shipping industries in needed.\n\n1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study is based on design and implementation of a computerized haulage system. The study helps one to understand the origin of goods transportation and of the same time some loop holes occurs in the management of goods and its solutions.\n\n1.2     AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe aims and objectives of this study is to develop and implement a computerized haulage system that will make provision of the following to ensure a fast and more efficient services to the customer based on quick access of data and accurate information. The branch of all routine work which does not demand quantitative consideration to enable then provide letter counter services.\n\nTo  be  receivable   and  capable  of  providing  an  to date  information  relevant  to  company  and  their  clients.\n\nTo affect a simpler handling of bill leading and updating of customers manifest checking of fraud and other criminal acts which lead to security and control.\n\n1.3     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe management of goods/goods in Nigeria has over the years attracted poor patronage as a result of errors that loss of customers goods is now the order of the day, the reason are not for fetched due to the manual procedure involved, chat have no other option than to be at the mercy of this error prime procedures and the storage of information such as files and other important documents can easily be last hereby attracting distrust of the firm by its client/customer as a result of eagerness would prefer their goods to be cleared on time but since there are so many activities involved there will be delay in processing and this does not portray the image of the company in a good way.\n\n1.4     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe existing system of custom and exercise office has exhibited some loop holes and it is against this loop holes that this work was carried out, the study is also undertaken to produce  a system which will address the loophole and co-operate need of the customs at the smallest possible cost and within the limit of technology available which was the driving force of this project.\n\n1.5     JUSTIFICATION\n\nWith the computerization of the shipping company, this bitting system will be sufficient and reliable, the establishment of the new system will create for a faster and efficient means if transacting business between the shipping company and their customers, there will be a networked and direct of communication between shipping companies both in and outside the country process like billing daily report generation customer registration will be for formed with speed, efficiently existing loots incurred. The information pertaining to the customer and his goods will be secured as they are contained in the computer and there will be case to store and retrieve information to and fro from the computer.\n\n1.6     SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study is restricted to the full operations of custom and office department.\n\n1.7     DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nGOOD- Goods carried in a ship\n\nTONNAGE- A measure of the capacity of a ship (1 ton = 100 cubic feet)\n\nPORT- A place where ship load and unload goods shattered form storms.\n\nVESSEL- A ship for transport by water\n\nBILL OF LOADING- A list giving details of a ships goods\n\nCONSIGNCE- A person or company to whom goods are sent form the counting of export and who receives them.\n\nMANIFEST- A list of all goods on the ship\n\nWHARF- This is a landing stage built along the shares for loading or unloading vessels.\n\nLABOUR- An area of water protected from the open sea by land or walls in which ships can shelter.\n\nBERTH- This is a place in the wharf where a ship can be died up or swing at anchor.\n\nPORT OF LOADING- A place where ships load goods and leave for the definition.\n\nPORT OF DISCHARGE- A place where unload goods from poof of loading.\n\nOCEAN FREIGHT- This is an amount charged by the carrier by the carrier for transportation of goods by sea.\n\nVOYAGE- A journey by water mostly a long one in a ship.\n\nSHIPPING- This is the process of pulling things on in a ship or transportation goods by ship\n\nWAREHOUSE- This is a store house\n\nTRASNPORT- This is carriage of goods from one place to another\n\nSAILING- This is the movement of ship on a sea from one place to another\n\nCUSTOM- This are the people that are in charge of checking the vessel if it contains any contraband items and the paper that contains the particulars of the container in the vessels.\n\nROTATION NUMBER- A number allocated by the department of customs and exercise to every ship entering into future use.\n\nCOMPUTER- This is an electronic machine that accepts data as input, process it using a set of instructions and given out result as output.

        "content": "ABSTRACT\n\nThis proposed work is an attempt to control the speed of the vehicle designed with computer software to enable the third party or owner to get the location, speed and activity of the driver. To achieve this, the system can transmit the information in real time. The use of GSM/GPRS technologies allows the system to track the objects and provide the up-to-date information. This information is authorized to specific users over the internet as the server gets the information. It is the tele-mointoring system to transmit data to the remote user. Thus the applications are used in real time traffic surveillance. This study proposes a prototype model for location tracking using Geographical Positioning System (GPS) and Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) technology. The development is based on the windows phone 8 application by means it can provide flexibility and portability for the user to get the information from anywhere. As these GPS technologies having greater range of frequencies, the user can get the information as quicker as possible. This system is very useful to speed control at specific traffic roads.\n\nThese days, mass-produced vehicles benefit from research on Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). One prime example of ITS is vehicle Cruise Control (CC), which allows it to maintain a pre-defined reference speed, to economize on fuel or energy consumption, to avoid speeding fines, or to focus all of the driver’s attention on the steering of the vehicle. However, achieving efficient Cruise Control is not easy in roads or urban streets where sudden changes of the speed limit can happen, due to the presence of unexpected obstacles or maintenance work, causing, in inattentive drivers, traffic accidents. In this communication we present a new Infrastructure to Vehicles (I2V) communication and control system for intelligent speed control, which is based upon Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for identification of traffic signals on the road, and high accuracy vehicle speed measurement with a Hall effect-based sensor. A fuzzy logic controller, based on sensor fusion of the information provided by the I2V infrastructure, allows the efficient adaptation of the speed of the vehicle to the circumstances of the road. The performance of the system is checked empirically, with promising results.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION                                     \n\n1.1 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM                              \n\n1.2 PURPOSE OF STUDY                                        \n\n1.3 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES                                    \n\n1.4 SCOPE/DELIMITATIONS                              \n\n1.5 LIMITATIONS/CONSTRAINTS                                 \n\n1.6 DEFINITION OF TERMS    \n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\n2.0 LITERATURE REVIEW   \n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\n3.0 METHODS FOR FACT FINDING AND DETAILED DISCUSSIONS OF THE SYSTEM\n\n3.1 METHODOLOGIES FOR FACT-FINDING \n\n3.2 DISCUSSIONS  \n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\n4.0 FUTURES, IMPLICATIONS AND CHALLENGES OF THE SYSTEM \n\n4.1 FUTURES \n\n4.2 IMPLICATIONS\n\n4.3 CHALLENGES\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\n5.0 RECOMMENDATIONS, SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION     \n\n5.1 RECOMMENDATION                                    \n\n5.2 SUMMARY                                               \n\n5.3 CONCLUSION \n\n5.4 REFERENCES\n\nVehicle Tracking Using Driver Mobile Gps Tracking\n\nThe Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based satellite navigation system that provides location information .This system uses GPS to track the location of the vehicle.

        "content": "Child Monitoring System\n\n\nThese Days parents are worried about their children’s so they want a complete track of them and monitor them all the time, This is physically not possible so we introduce Safety Monitoring system which is helpful for monitoring or tracking the child and their activities from anywhere in the world.The major issue of child missing can be solved with the help of child tracking system as well as parents who need to keep a track of their every steps, this system plays a vital role. The android application uses GPS and telephony services to locate their child’s location.This application secretly retrieves all the Call Logs, Message Details, Contact list and accurate Location without the children’s permission or without their knowledge as this application runs is in background and the major advantage of this feature is, if child reboots the Mobile phone the background process starts as the reboot is complete, so the process is never ending.\nThis application sends all the data from the child’s phone to the server and from the server to the parent’s phone in every 10 minutes interval. This  application is divided into 2 Apps, one is for the parent where they can see all the activities of their children and other is the Child Part, where the child can only see a calculator while the data is been fetched in the background without child’s knowledge.\n\nParent:\n    • Register: Parent need to register themselves by filling up basic registration details and by creating valid login credentials.\n\n    • Login: After successful registration, parent need to login using their valid login credentials.\n\n\n    • Add/ View Child Details: Once the parent is logged into the application, he/she can add their children details. Parent can also view their added children’s.\n\n    • View: Once the child details are added, parent can view various details from child’s Smartphone as follows:\n            i. Call Logs: Displays all the recent call logs from child’s Smartphone.\n            ii. Messages: Displays all the messages from child’s Smartphone.\n            iii. Location: Displays location of child’s Smartphone.\n            iv. Contacts: Displays all the contact from child’s Smartphone.\nChild:\n    • Login: Registered child need to login using valid login credentials.\n    • Use Calculator: After successful login, a fully functional calculator will be displayed which can be used by the child itself.\n\nSoftware Requirements:\n    • Windows XP, Windows 7(ultimate, enterprise) \n    • Android Studio\n    • Visual Studio\nHardware Components:\n    • Processor – i3\n    • Hard Disk – 5 GB\n    • Memory – 1GB RAM\n    • Android Phone with Kitkat and higher\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages:\n\n    • Parent could be able to track child using their separate android application provided for the parent.\n    • Parent could track the location and also could get all the call logs, messages and contact list from the child mobile phone.\n    • Parent can locate and retrieve details anywhere and anytime.\n    • Application automatically operates location requests without user interaction because at that time child not have knowledge to update his location at map. The system requires location and telephony services. Third advantage is it can be used at indoors where GPS satellites connectivity is not available. At that time, it can use network provides for location services.\n    • Network provider service uses cellular ID such as IMEI number for location tracking. Lastly all the controls are in parent side. The child side has less control access. \n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n    • The application is not worked well when there is no network available. In that case the application fails the exact location. But the application stores the last location which can be stored at the database server. When mobile is switched off then we consider this as a one of the drawback of system.\n    • Requires active internet connection.\n    • Child need to login once into the application.\n    • System will provide inaccurate results if data not entered correctly.\n\nApplications:\n    • This application can be used by any parent who wants to track or monitor their child without any physical interference.",

        "content": "Railway Ticket Booking System Using QR Code\n\nThe current ticketing system of Abuja kaduna railway system works manually and is quite time consuming. People may carry android  but if that is misplaced somehow or if anyone forgets to produce it at the right place these are of no use. The main objective for this project is developing an android application so that passengers can book the tickets online directly from their smart phones and a received message to their own phones is enough for travelling a desired distance. Thus the process of standing in lines to book the tickets and after that carrying the tickets is curdled. This System generates ticket in the form of QR Code, which can be checked by the ticket checker directly through scanning the QR code. The User can’t just directly register into the system; he should have an Aadhaar id to register.\n\nAdmin:\n    • Login: Admin can login his personal account.\n    • Add passenger  Detail: Admin can add users passenger     detail, including passenger Unique no., name, gender etc.\n    • View User: Admin can see user detail.\n    • View Booking: Admin can see all booking details.\n    • Logout: Admin can logout from his account.\nUser:\n    • Register: User need to register with his/her personal details.\n    • Login: User can login using valid username and password of his/her personal account.\n    • Booking: User can book a railway ticket by selecting source and destination and also can enter the count of people travelling with the user and book their tickets too.\n    • Booking History: User can see previous booking details.\n    • Logout: User can logout from his personal account.\nTicket Checker:\n    • Set Station: Checker can set his station detail.\n    • Check Ticket: Checker can check user’s Ticket by scanning the ticket using barcode scanner.\n\nSoftware Requirements:\n    • Windows XP, Windows 7(ultimate, enterprise) \n    • Android Studio\n    • Visual Studio\nHardware Components:\n    • Processor – i3\n    • Hard Disk – 5 GB\n    • Memory – 1GB RAM\n    • Android Phone with Kitkat and higher\n    • QR Scanner\n\nAdvantages:\n\n    • Very easy and user friendly system.\n    • Ticket should be available without wasting time.\n    • Ticket should be check using scanning this should be advance technology use in that system and also secure.\n    • Only register user and book a ticket.\n    • User can book one or more than one ticket at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n    • Active internet connection required to book a ticket.\n    • User cannot cancel his booking.\n\nApplications:\n    • This application can be used by any person who travel by train and wants to avoid queues and book their ticket online.",

        "content": "EXAMINATION VERIFICATION SYSTEM USING BIOMETRIC\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\nMy research Project is to develop fingerprint biometrics systems that assist in the elimination of examination impersonation. Up till now, the WAEC examination board (WAEC) is not using fingerprint as mode of identification, this has resulted in people sitting for WAEC examinations for others who collect the result at the end. With the adoption of fingerprint, this will be eliminated as fingerprint; this will be eliminated as fingerprint identification will also be employed during collection of results and certificates. This target can be mainly decomposed into image preprocessing, feature extraction and feature match. For each sub-task, some classical and up-to-date methods in literatures are analyzed. Based on the analysis, an integrated solution for fingerprint recognition is developed for demonstration. My demonstration program is coded using visual studio for the program, some optimization at coding level and algorithm level are proposed to improve the performance of my fingerprint recognition system. These performance enhancements are shown by experiments conducted upon a variety of fingerprint images. Also, the experiments illustrate the key issues of fingerprint recognition that are consistent with what the available literatures say. Main objective is to eliminate any form impersonation during exam by employing a more secured means of fingerprint biometrics.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\nFormal examination can rightly be defined as the assessment of a person‘s Performance, when confronted with a series of questions, problems, or tasks set him, in order to ascertain the amount of knowledge that he has acquired, the extent to which he is able to utilize it, or the quality and effectiveness of the skills he has developed.\n\nThe Jesuits introduced written examination into their schools in the 16th century. The Definitive Ratio Argue Institution Studiorum of 1599, which was not revised until 1932, contains a code of rules for the conduct of school examinations, which were held annually, and determined whether or not children were promoted to a higher class. During the 19th century, formal written examinations became regular in universities, schools, and other educational institutions. Examinations were also increasingly employed for the selection of recruits to the civil service, and the professions, and to posts in industry and commence. Over the ages, standardized testing has been the most common methodology, yet the validity and credibility of the expanded range of contemporary assessment techniques have been called into question.\n\nThere are two types of systems that help automatically establish the identity of a person: \n\n1)  Authentication (verification) systems and\n\n2)  Identification systems. In a verification system, a person desired to be identified submits an identity claim to the system, usually via a magnetic stripe card, login name, smart card, etc., and the system either rejects or accepts the submitted claim of identity (Am I who I claim I am?). In an identification system, the system establishes a subject‘s identity (or fails if the subject is not enrolled in the system data base) without the subject‘s having to claim an identity (Who am I?). The topic of this paper is channel towards the development of examination impersonation elimination system and this system would strictly do with the unique feature of identification by means of finger print. A verification system based on fingerprints, and the terms verification, authentication, and identification are used in a loose sense and synonymously.\n\nAccurate automatic personal identification is becoming more and more important to the operation of our increasingly electronically interconnected information society. Traditional automatic personal identification technologies to verify the identity of a person, which use ―Something that you know,‖ such as a personal identification number (PIN), or ―something that you have,‖ such as an identification (ID) card, key, etc., are no longer considered reliable enough to satisfy the security requirements of electronic transactions or school management system. All of these techniques suffer from a common problem of inability to differentiate between an authorized person and an impostor who fraudulently acquires the access privilege of the authorized person.\n\nBiometrics is a technology that (uniquely) identifies a person based on his physiological or behavioral characteristics. It relies on ―something that you are‖ to make personal identification and therefore can inherently differentiate between an authorized person and a fraudulent imposter. Although biometrics cannot be used to establish an absolute ―yes/no‖ personal identification like some of the traditional technologies, it can be used to achieve a ―positive identification‖ with a very high level of confidence, such as an error rate of 0.001%. Fingerprint technology using biometrics employ certain advantage of eradicating the problem of examination impersonation by allowing the measure of what you are to perform the security activities of student participation in the exams.\n\n1.1     BACKGROUND OF STUDY\n\nAn examination board is an organization that sets\nexaminations\nand is responsible for marking them and distributing results. Examination boards have the power to award qualifications, such as\nSAT\nscores, to students. Most exam boards are running as non-profit organizations.\n\nThe West African Examinations Council (WAEC) is a not-for-profit\nexamination\nboard\nformed out of the concern for\neducation\nin\nAfrica.\nEstablished in 1952, the council has contributed to education in Anglophonic countries of West Afric\na\n(Ghana,\nLiberia,\nNigeria,\nSierra Leon\ne,\nand the Gambi\na)\n, with the number of examinations they have coordinated, and certificates they have issued. They also formed an endowment fund, to contribute to the education in West Africa, through lectures, and aid to those who cannot afford education.\n\nDr. Adeyegbe, HNO of WAEC Nigeria (2004) said \"the council has developed a team of well-trained and highly motivated staff, and has administered Examinations that are valid and relevant to the educational aspirations of member countries\". In a year, over three million candidates registered for the exams coordinated by WAEC. The council also helps other examination bodies (both local and international) in coordinating Examinations.\n\nThe University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate, University of\n\nLondon School Examinations Matriculation Council and West African Departments of Education met in 1948, concerning\neducation\nin\nWest Africa.\nThe meeting was called to discuss the future policy of\neducation\nin\nWest Africa.\nAt the meeting, they appointed Dr.\nGeorge Barker Jeffery\n(Director of the University Of London Institute Of Education) to visit some West African countries, so as to see the general\neducation\nlevel and requirements in\nWest Africa.\nAt the end of Jeffery's three month visit (December 1949- March 1950) to Ghana, the Gambi\na,\nSierra\nLeone,\nand\nNigeria,\nhe tendered a report (since known as Jeffery report) strongly supporting the need for a West African Examination Council, and making detailed recommendations on the composition and duties of the Council. Following this report, the groups met with the\ngovernments\nof these countries, and they agreed on establishing a West African Examination council, fully adopting Jeffery's recommendations.\n\nThe\nlegislative assemblies\nof Nigeria, Ghana,\nSierra Leone,\nand the Gambia passed an\nordinance\n(West African Examinations Council Ordinance NO. 40) approving the West African Examination Council in Dec 1951. The\nOrdinance\nagreed to the coordination of exams, and issuing of certificates to students in individual countries by the West African Examination Council. Liberia later issued their\nordinance\nin 1974, at the annual meeting held in\nLagos,\nNigeria. After the success of forming an examination council, the council called a first meeting in\nAccra,\nGhana on March 1953. In the meeting, the registrar briefed everybody about the progress of the council. In that same meeting, five committees were formed to assist the council. These committees are: Administrative and Finance Committee,\n\nSchool Examinations Committee, Public Service Examinations Committee, The\n\nProfessional, Technical and Commercial Examinations Committee, and the Local\n\nCommittee. The total number of people present for this meeting was 26.\n\nDATABASE\n\nADMINISTRATOR \n\nINVIGILATORS\n\nCHAIRMAN OF\n\nEDUCATIONAL SHCEME\n\nCHAIRMAN OF\n\nEDUCATIONAL SCHEDULLING\n\nORGANIZATIONAL DIAGRAM\n\nCHAIRMAN OF COUNCIL\n\nDIRECTOR OF BOARD\n\n1.2       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe objective of this study is as follows\n\n To create a system that is capable of tracking impersonators in the examination system using the methodology of finger print biometrics.\n\n      To reduce rate of corruption in the educational sector and increase the rate of self confidence on students.",

        "content": "ACCESS PROTOCOL FOR WEB SERVICES\n\nNEED URGENT HELP WITH THIS PROJECT?\n\nChapter one\n\n1.0            introduction\n\nSimple object Access protocol, is a protocol for exchanging structural information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. It relies on Extensible markup language (XML) for its massage format, and usually relies on other application layer protocols, most notably Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and simple mail. Transfer protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission. Web services are software components that communicate using pervasive, standard-based web technology including HTTP and XML- based messaging.\n\nWeb services are designed to be accessed by other applications and vary in complexity from simple operations, such as checking a banking account balance online, to complex processes running CRM (customer relationship management) or enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. Since they are based on open standards such as HTTP and XML-based protocols including SOAP and WSDL, Web services are hardware, programming language and operating system independent, this means that applications written in different programming language and running on different platforms can seamlessly exchange data over intranet or the internet using web services.\n\nWeb services are powered by XML and three other core technology: WSDL, SOAP and UDDI. Before building a web service, its developers create its definition in the form of a WSDL document that describes the service’s location on the web and the functionality the services provides. Information about the services may then be entered in a UDDI registry, which allows web services customer to search for and locate the services they need. This step is optional but is beneficial when a company want its web services to be discovered by internal and/or external service consumers. Based on the  information in the UDDI registry, the service client developer uses instructions in the WSDL to construct SOAP message for exchanging data with the service over HTTP.\n\n1.1            STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nSome of the problem identified in this project are.\n\n1.

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ON-LINE DRUG CONTROL INFORMATION SYSTEM\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0       INTRODUCTION\n\nThe National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) is a Nigerian Government Agency under the federal ministry of health that is responsible for regulatory and controlling the manufacture, importation, exportation, advertisement, distribution, sale and use of food, drug, cosmetics, medical devices, chemicals and prepackaged water. The current Director General of NAFDAC Dr. Paul Orhii, holds a PHD in Medicine.\n\nIn Nigeria today, there is an influx into the market of fake machine parts, fake motor spare part, take chemicals, fake adulterated food items, amongst others. It may appear that almost every existing product has a fake counterpart. The era 1985-2000 in Nigeria has heralded the regime of faking and quackery, counterfeit drugs, quack doctors, illegal chemist shops ad hospitals. Drugs are no exception (Ohuabunwa, 2002). The menace of fake drug became prevalent in the last decade and the present situation is alarming in the West African Sub-region, including Nigeria. Empirical observations have shown that there may be more fake than genuine drug in circulation (Osibo, 1998).\n\nA disturbing aspect of the counterfeit drug menace is that the effects of consuming such drugs go unnoticed most of the times except in such cases where it results in mass deaths. There are generally no reliable data on the mortality or morbidity arming from the consumption of counterfeit drugs in Nigeria. In 1947, 14 children were reported dead after being administered Chloroquine phosphate injections and in 1990, 1909 children died after being administered fake Paracetamol (Aluko, 1994). Usually such incidence stimulates governments into taking positive steps, principally arising from public outcry.\n\nThe trend in the last decade prompted the public and particularly the professional bodies notably pharmaceutical society of Nigeria, to pressure the government to take definite steps towards controlling the preponderance of fake drugs in Nigeria, the government responded by promulgating the counterfeit and fake drugs (miscellaneous provisions) decree No.21 of 1988. This decree prohibited the sale and distribution of counterfeit, adulterated, banned and fake drugs or poisons in open markets and without License of registration. It also created penalties for the breach of the responsibility of seizing any drug or poison illegally displayed unlicensed or unregistered premises. Shortcomings in the degree led to its being repealed by decree No.21 in 1989 and subsequent amendments.\n\nThe drug situation in Nigeria:\n\nThere is a large market for drugs in Nigeria. out of over 130 existing pharmaceutical manufacturers only 60 are in active manufacturing. This is despite the installed capacity of the industry to produce between 50% and 75% of the nation’s drug needs. Capacity utilization is below 30% and about 70% of the drugs are thus imported, (Okoli, 2002).\n\nDrug availability in the public and private health care delivery system in Nigeria is a poor state. Various reasons have been adducted for this trend (Ertun, 1996). These include:\n\na.       Inadequate funding of hospitals pharmacies and the “out of stock syndrome”.\n\nb.      Involvement of unqualified persons in the procurement and distribution of drugs.\n\nc.       Inadequate storage facilities, transportation and distribution.\n\nThe adoption of an essential drugs program through the promulgation of decree 43 of 1989 on essential drug was a step taken to ensure the availability of drugs. Ordinarily, banded drug prescribing is still quite common in much public health institution, contrary to specification of the essential drug Act. (Govt. of Nigeria). This has partially eroded the expected gains of the essentials drugs program.\n\nThe drug distribution network in Nigeria is in a state of chaos because it consists of markets patent medicine stores, community pharmacist, private and public hospitals, wholesalers/importers and pharmaceutical manufacturers. It is a common scene in Nigeria to see petty traders who sell kola nuts, cigarette and oranges among other items, in market kiosk, motor parks and road sides hawking drugs that range from over the counter items to antibiotics (popularly called Capsules) (Adelusi Adeluyi, 2000). The medicines are usually left under the sun in such conditions that could facilitate the deterioration of the active ingredients. Patent medicine stores are owned by the holders of patent and proprietary medicine vendor’s licenses ordinarily, the patent medicine should be sold in their original packs. Over the counter (OTC) drugs are the only drugs authorized to be sold by vendors but they generally sell all types of drugs as determined by their financial capability. Considering the knowledge base of these vendors, whose minimum academic requirement to obtain a license is the First School-Leaving-Certificate.\n\nCommunity pharmacies are statutorily registered with the pharmacist’s council of Nigeria. a superintending pharmacist, who is also registered and licensed overseas the pharmacy anytime it is opened for business with such pharmacies there should not be any serious problem of sale of fake drugs. Unfortunately however, there are many unregistered pharmacies thriving. And in such premises drugs are purchased from doubtful sources with its attendant danger to the health of the public (Erhun and Adeola, 1995).\n\n1.1       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe major problem encountered in this study was the initial reluctance of regulatory bodies to divulge vital information that will reveal their level of performance.\n\na.       Adequacy of the laws governing the eradication of counterfeit drugs in Nigeria\n\nb.      Why counterfeit drugs are common\n\nc.       The performance of the state task forces\n\nd.      Methods employed by the task forces in carrying out their duties and the major problem affecting performance.\n\ne.

        "content": "FORMALIZING GHC’S TYPE SYSTEM\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n6.0             INTRODUCTION\n\nHaskell is a purely functional  programming language, with a type system that supports algebraic data types, type inference, parametric (Highter-Kinded) polymorphism, and type class constraints (Marlow (Ed), 2012). In recent years, the developers of GHC, a prominent Haskell compiler, have implemented a variety of extensions to this type system, with the aim of providing greater expressiveness, ease of use, or static verification capabilities. Some are straight forward, such as generalizing type classes to type relations via milti-parameter types classes. Some require more significant extensions to the type system, such as type families (Kiselyov et al; 2012) and the earlier functional dependencies extension; some make types inference significantly more difficult and major extension, such as GADTS (Schrijvers et al; 2009), impredicative polymorphism and arbibrary-rank types (Peyton Jones et al; 2007). While GHC accommodates all of these extension simultaneously, the papers that introduce each one discuses type inference and types checking only in isolation, and sometimes quite informally. This is makes the properties of GHC’s types reconstruction algrittm difficult to determine when multiple extension are combined. As a first step towards solving this problem, the GHC team (specifically vytinidis, Peyton Jones, Schigvers and Surmann) published outdid inpxq, a modular type inference system that accommodates all of the extension (and possibly more), along with soundness and principality proofs (Vytinitis et al; 2011) our work aims to more ruinously formalize outsidelnpxq in the dependently-typed programming language cum proof assistant Agda 2 (Norell, 2008). The outsidelnpxq system itself is similar in presentation of ML’S type inference, first presented in (orderky et al; 1997) and more rigorously formalized in (Potter and Remy, 2005). It is the culmination of years of work and is the latest in a series of types inference system for GADTs in Haskell based on “Wobbly types” (Schrijvers et al; 2009) right up to the very similar LHMPXQ system presented in (Vytiniotis et al; 2012). Types inference in a proof assistant, and what litte5r work that has been done is primarily focused on types inference for Ml. Nipkow and Narachewski have formalized Milners’s original W algorithm for the HM calculus in lsabelle/HOL and proven soundness (Naraschewski and Nipkow, 1999), and Dubois et al; simultaneously performed a similar verification in coq (Dubois, Menissier-Morais, 1999 for the purposes of developing a certified ML compiler (Dubois, 2000), surprisingly, no types inference algorithm have been formalized in Agda before.\n\nEven more surprisingly, no algorithm which includes support for GADTs or other advanced types system features had ever been formalized in a proof assistant, to our knowledge. The techniques we use for term representation are drawn heavily from Bird’s observation of monadic structure in syntax  trees (Bird and Paterson, 1999), a concept first explored in (Bellegard and Hook, 1994). We also draw several representational ticks from work in generic  programming using dependent types (Morris et al; 2004) and Mc Bride’s works on structurally recursive unification (McBride, 2003), which is used directly in our simple in sanitation.\n\nWhy mechanize outsidelnpxq?\n\nAny handwritten formalization or proof will likely lack the amount of rigour necessary to be accepted by a proof assistant, much like a handwrite algorithm is unlikely to be accepted by a programming language compiler. Formalizing outsideinpxq in a proof assistant is therefore more difficult than it proof assistant requires use to redesign those parts of the system that are not amenable to automated checking, and to make rigorous all those parts of the originals intuition. By formalizing outsideinpxq in a proof assistant,, we achieve two main goals.\n\nFirstly, we make explicit that which was implicitly and to prove that which was assumed in the original outsideinpxq paper, ensuring that our formal work stands on solid ground’s and secondly, we encourage those developing extensions fro the types system formalization, along with the necessary practical implementation of the new  extension in GHC’s type checker. By making run formalization available as code, we hope to mitigate the social problem of formal work on a type system being publishing in a long paper and subsequently ignored.",

        "content": "MICROCONTROLLER BASED DIGITAL CLOCK AND TIMER\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1      Background\n\nA clock is an instrument used for indicating and maintaining the time and passage thereof. The word clock is derived ultimately (via Dutch, Northern French, and Medieval Latin) from the Celtic words clagan and clocca meaning \"bell\". For horologists and other specialists the term clock continues to mean exclusively a device with a striking mechanism for announcing intervals of time acoustically, by ringing a bell, a set of chimes, or a gong. A silent instrument lacking such a mechanism has traditionally been known as a timepiece. In general usage today, however, a \"clock\" refers to any device for measuring and displaying the time which, unlike a watch, is not worn on the person.\n\nIn this project, I shall be designing a 24 – Hours digital clock using MSI.\n\n1.7      Objectives\n\nThe objective of this project work is directed towards the following areas:\n\n1.  To design and implement a 24 – Hours Digital Clock using MSI\n\n2.  To be able to develop a complete clock that can be used for any other timing purposes.\n\n1.8      Justification\n\nIf this prototype is fully developed will be very useful in many areas such as:\n\na.       This system will serve as a prototype that will encourage local manufacturers to develop interest in microcontroller based designs\n\nb.      It can be a substitute for home and industrial use\n\nc.       It can be used by schools further research purposes.\n\n1.9      Scope of the Project\n\nThis project will feature the design of digital clock using AT89S52 and program written in basic language.  The output will be implemented using LCD.  Push buttons will be used to implement the input.\n\n1.10  Constraints\n\nOne the major constraint of this work was finance.  Another like it was in availability of the required information. \n\n1.6   Project Report Organization\n\nThis report is organized into six chapters.  The first chapter takes care of introduction.  Chapter two surveys the literature review of this work.  In chapter three, the project analysis was done.  The input, processing and output modules are critically analyzed.\n\nIn chapter four, system implementation was carefully done.  Chapter five takes care of Testing and Implementation.  Finally chapter six closes up with summary and conclusions.",

        "content": "A STUDY OF THE USE OF COMPUTER IN MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM IN FIRST BANK PLC, ENUGU\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nComputer has become a very powerful tool in the business world today because of its ability to store, process and disseminate large amount of information accurately, efficiently and effectively for quick decision.\n\nAccording to Ani (200:5A), computer can be defined as an electronic tool capable of accepting data, interpreting data, performing ordered operation on data and reporting on the outcome of these operation.  It is therefore a tool managers can use to assist them in the complicated and time consuming task of generating information.\n\nThe computer took many centuries to come to the age of four generation, reckoning from time, serious efforts began towards simplifying mathematical computations Quite a few people were involved in the development of the computer and several of the scientists who made those useful contributions did not really aim at developing a computer but their inventions turned out to be an important step towards the development of computer\n\nAccording to Alan Trunning (1937) showed that a computer can be built with a set of simple instruction while any problem having a logical solution can be reduced to a solution based upon a small set of simple instruction.  A few years later, John Von Neuman (1946) set out a summary of the design requirement far a modern computer as follows:-\n\n1.                 The processing of data instructions which include the use of modification of programs.\n\n2.                 Binary codes is used to represent data and instruction in a way that makes no distinction of the two and still allow them the storage space in the computer.\n\nBased on those contributions and innovations of these scientists and others, the modern computer came to be.  IT underwent series of improvement which gave rise to farth computer generation, before we have today, MODERN COMPUTER.\n\nHowever, the introduction of this general purpose device and machine and simple programming languages greatly increased the computer utility especially in management information system (MIS) which basically deals on how information is obtained, retrieved and utilized.  Computers are now indispensable tools in any business activities because electronic data processing is growing and meeting the expected need of people’s speed, accuracy and efficiency in handling of data and security.  IT also extended to other areas such as marketing, accounting, inventory management and production process.\n\n     According to Lutter Quick (1954) The concept of management information system (MIS) was formulated by Lutter Quick whole delivering a speech in October, 1960 at Ihe Rochester Institute of Technology, their are then it become obvious and necessary that information should play a vital role in the solution of business and management problems in a price-meal fashion thereby focusing almost entirely on the mechanization of all office chores.\n\n     Basically, Management Information System attempt to provide managers at all levels with the information they need to guide their enterprises.  It provides an organization with flexible integrated tool for the planning and control function of their endeavours, with the ability to planned and unplanned information requirement at all management levels.\n\n     According to Onuigbo (1990:487) Management information System (MIS) is he formal processing and dispersing of information in internal and external within the organization in an effective and efficient manner.\n\n     Primarily, the management information system (MIS) is set up of the purpose of providing, planning and controlling information to all levels of management to effect appropriate decision making.  Thus, it does this by gathering data, inputting and processing them into information and further dissemination these items of information, we can therefore, say that management information system can be sub-divided into functional information system such as marketing information system, Ihe financial information system and Ihe personnel information system and so on depending on the type of organization.\n\n     The management information system provides managements with varying information depending on the level, thereby making increased in the efficiency of the organization through better management decisions.\n\n          However, owing to the fact that organizations have grown in sizes, information flow has become so voluminous that face to face communication and even writing memoranda can no longer effect adequate communication or effective processing of data.  The management information system of these organizations have in recent times fond it difficult to meet with The increasing demand being made on information as a result, The manual means o operation is Jam-packet with scored of data to be processed.  Hence delay and inaccuracies in data collection and analysis.  Delay often makes decision making to be inaccurate.  Also, there is problem of misappropriation of important document of files or even cases of stolen files.",

Difficult and strenuous jobs that were carried out by humans in the past have today been easily and effectively carried out by computers.\n\n          In the development and maintenance of life, Agriculture plays an enormous role. As the population of human increases so also the requirement of food and their need for other agricultural products will be high in order to satisfy the huge population with food, shelter and raw materials for their industries.\n\n          Since human being have limit in all they do, it deems imperative therefore that services of this great and tireless machine be put into all of man’s activities including the Agricultural sector for mass production and provision of food and other agricultural benefits to man.\n\n          In the field of animals husbandry, whose services are also needed for further (addition) production to satisfy every aspect of man’s wants, because of the usefulness of this sector of Agriculture it is necessary that computer are introduced, in order that its activities be easily carried out for better results.\n\n          This projects is concerned with computerizing a poultry farm but our center of attraction is in general stock keeping and other activities that will be done easily and effectively by computers.

Introducing the computer system will greatly improve materials requirement planning in the following aspects.\n\n(a)  Reliability\n\n(b)  Validity\n\n(c)   Accuracy\n\n(d)  Appropriate storage of data\n\n(e)   Timeliness\n\nThe above factors are due to the fact that the computer possesses some great features, and advantages over traditional approach.\n\n1.2            STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS\n\nNo doubt that the use of traditional system has created a lot of problems in production of roofing sheets at EMENITE.  The quantity and amount of materials and sub-assembly needed to produce a product cannot be traceable because of glaring disadvantages stated below.\n\nØ Poor information storage method: The use of office files and file cabinets is not a good form of information storage.\n\nØ Insecurity of data because it is prone to vandalization and unauthroised accessibility\n\nØ Duplication of data in various departments because of the nature of work needed\n\nIt takes a long time in accessing records in the manual system (filing system) due to the nature of the job.  It is not always good for materials to finish unnoticed, so the re-ordering of materials are not made as and when due.\n\nThe introduction of the computer system will help eliminate these problems to an extent.\n\n1.3            PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis project is generally towards eradication of all the deformities and curb hookups of the manual method of bill-of-materials processing, thus developing a new system to handle the jobs involved in the processing of Bill-of-material electronically.\n\n1.4            AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nIn an organization whether manufacturing or not manufacturing where the competitors and the objectives of the organization are at the top of the scale of preference especially the meeting of the standard in the market, there is always a focus on the organizational goal which might not be the goals of the sub-system to avoid sub-optimality, working towards a divisional or individual benefits.\n\nThe aims of this work include the following;\n\n(1)      To work towards the elimination of ineffective modes of operation; it centers on the user having a good atmosphere for work thereby minimizing stress.\n\n(2)      The objective from the initiator of the proposal is generally towards combating al the aims and the problems being discovered on the existing system, which are listed under problem of study.\n\n(3)      Safeguarding of information through effective monitoring of access is the filing system (database).\n\n(4)      Knowing when materials are almost out of stock, in order to make an order so as not to show the production pace of the labourers.\n\n1.5            SCOPE OF STUDY\n\nThe scope of this project work covers all the areas of bill-of-materials processing systems, which include the cost of individual material responsible for production, the stock control or inventory areas, and every other necessary areas.  The storage of records, which have different fields that could be expanded a little to form files.  These file five rooms for editing, updating and retrieval of information when needed.  Some of these fields are item description, quality, total requirement, re-ordering point, labour cost, overhead cost, profit, lower cost, etc.\n\nThis project is focused on the entire information recorded on Bill-of-material processing for EMENITE NIGERIA LIMITED, EMENE, ENUGU STATE",

It is aimed at developing a computerized case filling information system , the developed system will provide  required information for quick and accurate prosecution of crime suspects in a court of competent jurisdiction. Those who require this information may include lawyers, NDLEA and judges etc.\n\nIt will also keep accurate record of those convicted of crimes to help the criminal justice system have accurate record for decision making. With this the government can always know when to grant pardon to repentant prisoners. The data collection of this project work is mainly interview from NDLEA officers. The implementation of this case filling information system project was carried out using C# programming language and C# database for the database platform. In conclusion, the work met all the objectives intended, it is thereby recommended for Central Registry of Criminal Identification department of  NDLEA.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n National Drug law Enforcement Agency was set up in the year 1984 during the regime of  Buhari the acting president of that year. It was established when caught on drug reaffixing called cocaine they are Bartholomew bologna Laval ojulope and Benard Obenegbe and were executed by then government Buhari. It was established to take care of the problem that Nigeria are facing due to the problem of hard drugs that existed in Nigeria  then.\n\nNDLEA act N30 laws of the federation in 2004 they state the practical operation in the year 1990 from airport commissioners when they saw some groups of boys carrying drugs and then want to stop them.\n\nFedelis Ojakilome was the first chairman of NDLEA and he handed over to kwajafa whose was an assistance inspector of police (AIG) and handed over to papa jamare who only lasted for 2 months and Bamaji took over from him in 1994 and lasted for five years. He was replaled by 1994 Onovo 1.0 from Enugu also a police personnel who remains in office till 2000 and handed over to lockdam also AIG and lasted for 3-4 months them Lafia gim took over who was an SSS boss before he came to Drug Ground October.\n\nIn 2006, Ahmadu ginelde a retimed police officer is as at now the preset boss in NDLEA company.\n\n1.2            AIM/OBJECTIVE\n\nThe Aim and objective of this company is to make sure that Nigeria’s partake in the habit of fighting against Dreg Anuse like other countries and it was established to present illicit cultivation production mainefactive of illicit trafficking of hard dugs which begins to take place in Nigeria.\n\n1.2.1           STATEMENT/PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\n          The statement of the study and some of the problem they face in their company is that they lack awareness of their members of their operation brandy by the public as such they do not like their search on the carport seaport and international air ports that which shows that they don’t know their privacy and the powers given to NSLEA. They also lack co-operation for general public that is they don’t volatile information on drugs offenders in the area because of Libras unstuck.\n\n          They encounter some undue interfere in their investigation by luring place individuals in the society. They poor remigration on their works because their workers are not well paid which now daises some of their workers not be active in work. They also encounter some logic problem including vehicles that are not regard enough to with stand the pressure of the day to day activities. The hostile attitude needed from the general public to the law enforcement Agents are not there.\n\n1.3            JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY\n\nWhen some investigation are being carried out there are many problem they encounter which at the end later become on their own behalf for instance when they lack awareness of the public are aware that they want to come and airiest anybody of groups of people it is believed that the public can’t keep quiet and allow them to come and arrest so the lack of awareness of the public helps them a lot.\n\nAgain no body known the secret of Drug Agents or the powers given to their officers which now encourage them to go ahead and arrest any body that go against their law. They have the right to  entire into any place whether forcible to entire so far they get the news that some changers addicts are staging inside the place.\n\n1.4            SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis is to enforce the trafficking and abuse of illicit drugs that are found  in all parts of Nigeria. This NDLEA people are found in all parts of Nigeria which hampers the operation of the traffickers. In international air ports, land boarders and other places there are may people that fight against Drug in all those places which help to radices the high rate of drugs abusers because they have branches in all conges of the world which help them to got information about any drug person ground so that they will went on for an arrest of that person.

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPUTER BASED BILL OF MATERIAL PROCESSING SYSTEM\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBill of material processing can be described the compilation of the raw materials required to produce any desired product.  This means billing the materials before processing so as to achieve a cost-effective production, avoiding less in buying the materials for production and also in the sale of products after production.\n\n          There are a lot of problems encountered in the manual bill of martial processing system.  It is difficult to maintain the relationship between raw materials at the lowest level and the in which this raw materials are combined to form final products are not shown in the manual bill of material processing.\n\n          Most raw materials are used for more than one product.  It becomes difficult to determine the final products in which a particular raw materials is used unless a separate record of the usage of raw materials is maintained.\n\n          In Nigeria, some companies are a manufacturing company that produces spare parts (ie motorcycle or motor spare parts).\n\n          Those companies are the producers of engine blocks, piston and Rings, brake shoes, Inner kick, Inner gear, con rod, clutch Fiber, Tyre and Tube etc.  the bill of material processing system is operated manually.\n\n          Those involved are the production manager who is in charge of production.  He lists all the raw materials that are needed for production.  The stores manager takes Inventory of available raw materials and notes those that are not available.  He then notifies the purchasing manager.\n\n          The purchasing manager who is the head of the purchasing department is also involved.  He is responsible for buying and bringing down the materials from the source.\n\n          The Head of Finance and Accounts who is responsible for releasing funds for the purchase of raw materials.\n\n          Those people co0operate with the marketing department.  This is because price of the raw materials may affect the price at which products are marketed.\n\n          This study involves an analysis of the manual system and the design of a new computer based system.\n\n1.1     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nA lot of problems have been encountered in the existing manual system of bill of material processing system.  The particular raw materials used in a product and the quantity used cannot be traced because of the following:-\n\n1.                 Inefficient processing and storage system for bill of materials information.\n\n2.                 Wrong transcriptions and mutilations by accident or on purpose.  The information is very insecure and can be accessed by wrong persons.\n\n3.                 Use of filling cabinets makes retrieval of information very difficult.  Also the filling cabinets are prone to termites and rats.\n\n4.                 Management decisions are often based on incomplete, incomprehensive, incorrect and unreliable information and as such planning and other management activities are affected.\n\n5.                 Duplication of tasks will be eliminated so that the staff will gear their talents towards more challenging and innovative tasks.\n\n1.2     AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe purpose of this study is to eliminate the problems that occur to improper billing of materials.\n\nThe steps involved are:-\n\n1.                 To produce an inventory of all the raw materials used in Nigeria.\n\n2.                 To critically examine the present trends in the billing system of the companies.\n\n3.                 To identify the causes and sources of the problems encountered in the billing of materials.\n\n4.                 To identify the effects of these problems and offer suggestions on how to solve them.\n\n5.                 To serve as a reference to other researchers in this and other related fields of study.\n\n1.3     PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\nThe objective of this project is to design a computer-base bill of materials processing system.\n\nAn in-depth analysis of the existing system is necessary so as to identify the problems and to justify the development of the new system.\n\nThe new system aims at access and retrieval to authorized person, security and control against abuse. Efficiency and effectiveness will be enhanced. Timely accurate and up – to – date reports will be generated.\n\nMost importantly, the staff will be free from boring and repetitive chores from which they drive no job satisfaction. They can then redirect their effort to more challenging and creative task. They will not be made redundant by the advent of a computer – based system.",

Major Banks are mainly guided by financial profit for their shareholders.  They are after minimization of financial risks.  Such strategies don’t leave much room to people on low income or even small organizations that strive for their survival.\n\n          This research studied the computer-based loan scheme management system-as was done in Harvard Trust Bank Enugu.  Loans are readily given to people who have an account (mostly current Account) in the Harvard Trust Bank.  Apart from being a customer to the necessary for giving him loan.  Such conditions may include: provision of collateral security, having at lest one guarantor and filling the bank loan management form.  The collateral security must be a landed property before the bank will accept it.  Also, the guarantor must have an account in that bank and must be a reportable person in the society.\n\n          The role of computer in loan scheme management can never be overemphasized.  The computerized bank loan management form enables bankers to work without stress.  Information can be updated as soon as a positive change occurs.\n\n          I therefore recommend this project to all who may like to have a look at what the topic is all about.  The research work will enable them know the importance of computer in loan scheme management which yield fruitful results as that of other fields of human endeavour.\n\n1.1            STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe events of loan scheme management system have been documented. This research will evaluate the perceived motion of computer-based loan scheme management system.\n\n          In doing so, attempts will be made to answer the following questions:\n\na.                 What steps are taken in designing a computer-base loan scheme management system?\n\nb.                 How can a computer-base loan scheme management be implemented?\n\nc.                  What are the implications of not meeting the above requirements?\n\nd.                 How far have the computer-base loan scheme management system gone in achieving the desired goals?\n\n1.2            PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\nThe purpose of this study is to bring to check the anomaly associated with the Harvard Trust computer-based loan scheme management system.\n\n          As the loan scheme management is done by man, irregularities are bound to be associated with it.\n\n          If these loan scheme management systems are effectively carried out in the computer, it will yield fruitful results.\n\n1.3            AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThis project will have the following aims and objectives:\n\na.                 To shed light on the issue of computer-based loan scheme management system.\n\nb.                 To create awareness of such management to other banks who may be interested.\n\nTo suggest the ways in which a computer-based loan scheme management can be enhanced.\n\n1.4            SCOPE OF STUDY\n\nThis research work will access the design and implementation of computer-based loan scheme management system in Harvard Trust Bank Enugu.  It will look into the operations of this bank in the aspect of loan management system.  The interest charged on loans as well as the updating of information as soon as they are received.\n\n1.5            CONSTRAINTS\n\nThis project will be limited to the data available at hand, data outside the researcher will not be made use of.\n\n          The limitations militating against this research are financial constraints, time factor and other circumstances.",

The activities of the Board are meant to generate revenue for the government.  The motor licensing department are located at each of the local government Area, head- quarters of the country. The motor driving licensing office at the local government areas of a state are under the state motor licensing office. The ministry by keeping rate of all necessary documents regarding each vehicle driving owner within the state. It is surprising that despite efforts to records of registered vehicle drivers owners by the state government, these records have been disappearance. This is the issue of comprehensive record keeping is yet to be effectively handled in the state.\n\n1.1            STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nSince the inception of the licensing office or motor driving license office. There have been constant request by the staff for an enhanced or sophisticated technology tools for the processing of motor licensing data.\n\nThese constant quest are necessitated and propelled by the simple need to address the challenges posed by the existing manual system of data processing. This challenges otherwise viewed by the staff as problems among which are inaccuracies in data processed, ineffective, inefficiency in identifying and improper keeping of records.\n\nUnnecessary delays in attending to customers due to the manual processing of information and delays in going through heap of file in their achieve to get necessary information that will aid in present information processing. Lack of space in packing of file and register sometime these files are destroyed in order to make space for new ones. This lead to the destruction of vital information. Misappropriation of public and by the staff because of lack adequate means of fund management. Those misappropriation are inched by the error prone manual handling of the charge and accounting systems of this system.\n\nAbove reasons gave room to touts to operate in the premises of the establishment. They change extra money from customers whom are fed up with wastage cause by snail pace of operation in the office.\n\n1.2            PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\nThe purpose of this study is to liap-frog chasm inherent in the existing manual system of processing through a computerized approach by designing and implementing a computerized motors vehicle drivers license system.\n\nHowever, other purposes are:\n\n-                     Explore the intricacies of the computer software.\n\n-                     Demonstrate the capabilities of computer technology.\n\n-                     To eradicate the inherent problem encountered by the motor vehicle driving license office.\n\n1.3            AIMS AND OBJECTIVE.\n\ni.                    The aim of this project is to develop a software that could checkmate these ill practice, thereby  improving the present operation (manual) and also helped in the creation of a common data based for driver’s licensing system.\n\nii.                  Computerization of motor vehicle driving license system in Enugu State and the country at large. That is by using computer system and develop led programmes to replace the manual and tedious method of motor driving license exercise.\n\niii.                To keep a good record of the driver’s licenses in their office so that any information desired from the record by the authority or from any other source like the police can be easily retrieved.\n\niv.               Improved the security of motor driver’s license records against unwarranted access or malicious handling by non-personnel.\n\nv.                 To render services to the public on behalf of the government in their vehicles, issue the driver’s licenses and renew them when it expired.\n\n1.4            SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nHaving stated the problem facing motor vehicle driving license vehicle registration. This also intends to provide a common data base of registered vehicles form which enquires can be made at anytime in case of identification, if there is a loss. Also if one breaks traffic rules and regulations and tries to escape, the registration number driver’s license will aid in tracing him/her out. There is need to elaborates on the system to be computerized and maintained.\n\n          Since it is an academic exercises, the project is designed to handle only some of the activities of the department namely:\n\n1.                 Change of ownership\n\n2.                 insurance and renewal of motor license\n\n3.                 report generation\n\n4.                 enquiry\n\n5.                 modification, display, deletion, addition of motor license records.\n\nAlthough the scope of the project is limited to only Enugu state and certain customer, it could be enhanced to take care of those other state by making little additions and modification.",

However little or no thought has been given to designing a complete and through intelligence test on a computer system in out immediate environment.  Although in advanced countries, where computerized games have been developed, computers have proved that they constitute of ways of indirectly testing intelligence.\n\nThis system is designed in order to implement intelligence test on a computer system.  It tries as much as possible to incorporate the important aspect of intelligence on a wide scale.  It is designed to test intelligence of secondary school leavers using the Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE) and the University Matriculation Examination (UME) as a standardized sample, and as such the Psychological implication of such a design is very important.\n\nThe design of the system is quite simple and easily understood.  Its flexibility makes it amenable for future changes and amendment to either incorporate other aspects of intelligence or to be designed for any other school age or class.\n\nThe question of the intelligence test are programmed and visually displayed on the systemâ€™s screen in an interactive form. The student answers the question on the computer system.\n\nThe results obtained from the test give an estimate on userâ€™s (student) intelligence quotient (IQ).  This is equally displayed and tells the student in what category he/she falls within.  The result of the test is also displayed of the end of the test which goes a long way to lesson the fears of students that they were marked down in the examination.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENT\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0Introduction\n\n1.1background of study\n\n1.2statement of problem\n\n1.3aims and objective\n\n1.4delimitation\n\n1.5scope\n\n1.6limitation\n\n1.7definition\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\n2.0review of the related literature\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\n3.0description and analysis of the existing system\n\n3.1facts finding method\n\n3.2objectives of the existing system\n\n3.3input, process and output specification\n\n3.4information flow diagram\n\n3.5problems of the existing system\n\n3.6justification for the new system\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\n4.0design for the new system\n\n4.1input specification and design\n\n4.2output specification and design\n\n4.3file design\n\n4.4procedure chart\n\n4.5system flowchart\n\n4.6system requirement\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\n5.0implementation\n\n5.1program design\n\n5.2program flowchart\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\n6.0documentation\n\n6.1loading computer based intelligence test system (cbits)37\n\n6.2executing the intelligence test system (cbits)\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\n7.0Recommendation\n\n7.1References.",

As students and other institutions and organizations beginning to use the Internet as a new method for awareness creation and information search, then there comes a need for a website that will provide them with the comprehensive list of all the research materials they need. This was what motivated us into embarking on this research work.Finally, this project was well arranged for Layman’s understanding and finally the website were design in pages but the book collection was limited to computer books and some others. \n\nTABLE OF CONTENT\n\nChapter One1.0 Introduction 1.1 Statement Of The Problem 1.2 Purpose Of The Study 1.3 Aims And Objectives Of The Study 1.4 Scope Of The Study 1.5 Limitations Of The Study 1.6 Assumption 1.7 Definition Of Terms\n\nChapter Two2.0 Literature Review\n\nChapter Three3.0 Description & Analysis Of The Existing System 3.1 Fact-Finding Methods Used 3.1.1 Interview Method 3.1.2 Observation Method 3.2 Objectives Of The Existing System 3.3 Input Process / Output Analysis 3.3.1 Input Process 3.3.2 Output Analysis 3.4 Information Flow Diagram 3.5 Problems Of The Existing System 3.6 Justification For The New System\n\nChapter Four4.0 Design Of The New System 4.1 Factors Considered In Designing The System 4.2 Output Specification And Design 4.3 Input Specification And Design 4.4 File Design 4.5 Feedback Page Design 4.6 Search Page Design 4.7 System Requirements 4.8 Hardware Requirement 4.9 Software Requirement\n\nChapter Five5.0 Implementation / Web – Site Design 5.1 Program Flow Chart 5.1.1 Sign – In – Page 5.1.2 Home Page 5.1.3 Feedback Page 5.1.4 Content Page 5.2 Pseudo Code 5.3 Source Program\n\nChapter Six6.0 Documentation\n\nChapter Seven\n\n7.0 Recommendation 7.1 Conclusion References \n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\nInformation Technology is able to facilitate the revolution of changes, which optimize performance and profitability to companies because it provides solution to one of the key business and communication barriers; distance and difficulties associated with crossing them. Emergence of Internet and its technologies has led to the death of distance and collapsed the entire world into a “Global Village”.\n\nThe word Virtual means many things to many people, but according to Encarta Encyclopedia: Virtual means being something in effect even if not in reality or not conforming to the general accepted definition of term. Again it can be seen as used to describe a particle whose existence is suggested to explain observed phenomena but is not proved or directly observable. Finally, it can be seen as simulated by a computer for reasons of economics, convenience, or performance.The term “Virtual Library” emanates from Virtual Reality; the virtual reality is a system that enables one or more users to look, more, and react in a computer-simulated world. Various types of interface devices allow users to have the illusory experiences of seeing, touching, picking up, and even manipulating virtual (simulated) objects. Virtual worlds and everything in them, (including computer images of the participants) are represented by mathematical models and computer programs.\n\nA library can be seen as a room, building or institution where a collection of books or other research materials is kept or a collection of books, newspapers, records, tapes, or other materials that are valuable for research or a collection of things for use on a computer, for example programs or diskettes, or a collection of routines or instructions used by a computer program.\n\nBut, may looking at all this our main aim on this project is to make a library look virtual; thereby making the collection of books and other research materials to be in electronics form, for global access across the globe term “Virtual Library”.\n\n1.1 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMIn Nigeria as a developing country, most institutions and large organization are not yet able to create or setup standard library for their organizations especially schools (higher school in the country), thereby making it difficult for their members to have access to research data and valuable materials.It also limits them from knowing what is happening in the globe. It is likely one of the major cause or out-dated knowledge that students suffer in institution of higher learning in Nigeria.To cope with high pace technology in this information age, the researcher is prompted to provide an effective channel or medium that will serve as a virtual library through which university students and organization of different kind can have access in any-part of the world for retrieving information and for their knowledge update.\n\n1.2 PURPOSE OF THE STUDYIn the context of technological advancement, computer is playing a leading and indispensable role. This is based on its ability to provide or perform a lot of tasks.\n\nBased on this, the purpose of this study is to discourage the manual and time wasted in the process of going through bookshelves in search of books or information or data(s) in the library and also to make research material available at a point.\n\n1.3 AIMS AND OBJECTIVESComputer being one of the newest development in technology, the populace fail to apprehend its multiples retrieving importance. This study will first• Aim at utterly clearing off the misconceptions and biases about computer and discouraging the boring method of creating awareness, which does not extend to a wide society.• To provide the globe with Virtual Library where they will go in need of vital and research information.• To create a Virtual Library that will be easily updated.• To minimize research time and make it more efficient.• To setup a Virtual Library where electronics books will be centralized\n\n1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY This research work is strictly based on SAMS Publishing, Macmillan Computer Publishing’s and other electronics based publishing company that make use of the Internet, for knowledge repository.\n\nThe research also looks into necessary items and information which schools need especial the computer science students of various level; and at the same time prepares a web-site where the Virtual Library will be published, for global access.\n\n1.5 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDYA lot of factors posed as problem to the development of this study:• Time: Because the project must be completed within a specified date, the researchers do not have enough time to get all required.• This project is limited to only computer textbooks and some news journals and magazines.• Resources: Lack of resources also contributed to the limitations of the project to this extends. Everybody knows the financial state of the country now.\n\n1.6 ASSUMPTIONThe only assumption made in this work is that the users of this Virtual Library must be On-Line and must run Microsoft Internet Explorer in other to have access to the Library; and the web-site is in conformity with all the rule based on site development and will not in any form cause windows illegal operation, or misdirects the user. Finally, it is users friendly.\n\n1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMSIt has become necessary to define some of the technical terms used in their work as this will help to make the work easily understood to many lay-people, in other professions.\n\n• HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): The formatting language that makes use of tags to specify how text and other item will be displayed in the browser.\n\n• HOME PAGE: The starting point for a web site, usually the first or main page displayed upon visiting a site.\n\n• FTP (File Transfer Protocol): A protocol and a program used to transfer files between computer on network or Internet.\n\n• PROTOCOL: The rule that govern communication devices on a communication environment.\n\n• SERVER: A device or process that responds to request from clients, (terminal).\n\n• TERMINAL: The end point of a network where data can be entered or outputted.\n\n• INTERNET: A global Network of interconnected computers and Networks.\n\n• INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER (ISP): A company that provide individual and companies with an account of accessing the Internet.\n\n• PUBLISH: To make a site available to other users of Internet. \n\n• WEB SITE: A collection of information-based pages published to the net for accessible by net users.\n\n• INTERNET EXPLORER: The software from Microsoft developed for net stuffing or browse ring or searching",

The personnel database is the comprehensive information update of employees under a particular employee at a particular time.  The maintenance and management of employee information has bee a big problem in the Nigerian society workers denied of their primary and secondary entitlements and the most sad aspect of inadequacy in the maintenance of employee information is the erupt of ghost workers syndrome, this has the greatest thing this laxity in personal database system has caused in the society.  The problem of promotion is also on offspring of inadequate personnel database management; who to promote when there is necessity for promotion is always the problem faced by personnel officers in change of promotion exercise.\n\n          Workers have suffered a lot under this error of ignorance and sheet wickedness in every activity work of life, the first thing to be observed is always information about the staff involved.  This helps to give out desired incentives for the works, to help them put in their best in their work the non-payment of salary or in some cases, the delay in payment of salary is always caused by the problems associated with personnel database.\n\nThis work researched into the operational activities of existing system of maintaining personnel database in Enugu state with a view to detecting and solving the problems making it not to work out smoothly.\n\n1.2            STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe problem caused by poor management and maintenance of personnel database in Enugu state is numerous.  Th procrastination in payment of workers salary is a work force badly.  Because of the fact that act information of worker s in the state is not known the state faces the problem of how to provide incentives for its worker.  A lot of public money is been diverted into private purses due to the problem of poor information management concerning personnel records.\n\n1.3            PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to provide ever lasting solution to the current problems facing the Enugu state personnel database maintenance system through a well computerized design.\n\n1.4            AIM/OBJECTIVES OF STUDY\n\nThe primary aim of this work is to make sure that personnel database management system of Enugu State is to serve the citizen better by producing a new computerized system that will tackle the problems currently facing it.\n\nThe objectives include:\n\n1.                 To create a system that will maintain workers records randomly and give easy and tidy access to the stored record for easy information retrieval.\n\n2.                 To maintain a database that will support sorting and searching of records automatically\n\n3.                 To maintain an internecine database.\n\n1.5            SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThis study is carried out covering the totality of personnel database system in Enugu state in the areas of quick information retrieval automatic promotion list generation, ghost workers control and timely salary payment\n\nASSUMPTIONS\n\nIf the new design is completely implemented the whole problems associated with the existing system will be all solved.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A NETWORK BASED SECURITY INFORMATION SYSTEM\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW\n\n1.0            SECURITY CONCEPT\n\nSecurity is defined in many ways due to the many contexts of its existence.  In other words, security generally has to do with protection.  It might be protection from undue access.  Some attributes security to safe guiding from that, which may or may not lead to destruction.  It might also be interesting to understand that security has to do with protection of the environment.  It also has to do with valuables; this means that anything has to be secured must have value.  Things of less importance to humanity and therefore anything that pose threat to life must also be prevented.  Security is a very important issue in any organizations (system), no wonder VINCENT .E. ASOR in his seminar presentation at the Nigerian computer society’s conference of 2002 stated that an organization with 98 percent security is actually 100 percent insecure.  This means that adequate security must be in place for a smooth running of an organizational affair or a system.  The police, who is the case study organization here defined security in the police training manual as the protection of lives and property coupled with the maintenance of law and order in a society.\n\n2.1     SECURITY THREATS\n\nThey are criminal acts, which have a particular harmful effects on peoples lives and property and do more than interfere with merely private rights.  They are simply crimes, Now the above brings us to the crime concept.  What is crime? According to the BLACKSTONE, crime is violation of public rights and duties due to the whole community considered as a community.  Williams defined crime as acts that is capable of being followed by a criminal proceedings having one of the types of outcome – Punishments.\n\nAlso Hulsbury’s Law (adopted by the House of Lord’s in Board of Trade V. Ower 1957 as correct) defined crime as an unlawful act or default which is an offence against the public and render the person guilty of the act liable to legal punishment.\n\nThe summary of the above crime definitions by the police manual defined crime as an unlawful act committed by a person or a group of persons.\n\n2.2            CHARACTERISTICS OF SECURITY THREATS\n\nThey are wrong doings which Judges have held, or the parliament has from time to time laid down which are sufficiently injurious to the public to warrant the application of a criminal procedure to deal with them, of course this does not enable us to recognize an act as a crime when we see one.  Some acts are obviously harmful to the public that anyone would say they should be criminal and such acts almost certainly are, but there are many others about which opinions may differ widely.  According to SIR CARLETON ALLEN, crime is crime because it  consists of wrongdoings which directly and in serious degree threatens the security or well being of the society.  This explains why acts have to be made crimes either by judicial decisions or by legislation.  A crime may remain a crime long after it has ceased to be a threat to the security or well being of the society.  This ALLEN’S proposition tells us what (as he thinks) ought to be crime rather than what is crime.  The public nature of crimes is evidenced by the contrast between the rulers of civil and criminal procedure.  Any citizen can, as a general rule and in the absence of some provision to the contrary bring a criminal prosecution, whether or not he has suffered any special harm over and above other members of the public.  As a member of the public he has an interest in the enforcement of the criminal law.\n\n2.3            CLASSFICATION OF CRIMES\n\nThere is a problem that exist in the crime reporting system in Nigeria and especially the B’OPS COMMUNICATION OF THE POLICY, ENUGU STATE BRANCH in particular.  This arises in the variations in definition of crimes among localities.  This obstacle, as far as uniformity in definitions is concerned was removed by the adoption of a standard set of crime classification generally connotes its content.  However in reading the explanation of each category, it is very important to keep in mind that because of the differences between the state codes, there is no possibility in a system such as ‘felony’ and ‘misdemeanor’.\n\nCrime classifications are in three categories.  Viz crime against persons, crimes against property and crime of violence or crime against local acts.\n\nCrime against persons include:\n\n-        Murder and non-negligent manslaughter\n\n-        Aggravates assault forcible rape\n\n-        Forcible rape\n\n-        Robbery\n\nCrime against property includes:\n\n-        Burglary\n\n-        Arson\n\n-        Stealing\n\n-        Forgery and counterfeiting\n\n-        Vandalism\n\nCrimes against local acts include;\n\n-        Narcotic\n\n-        Illegal possession, carrying of weapons\n\n-        Prostitution and commercialized vice.\n\n2.4            SECURITY AND INFORMATION\n\nThere is no known security system that works without an information technology system.  In fact security of a given society is to a high degree determined by the amount of information technology on ground.  Thus it might interest one the to know that security are of differing contexts.  An information system for a bankers dealing via an automatic teller machine differs from a network based information system for collecting, collating and analyzing statistical data for management use.  There is also a system of inbuilt detectors in doors on entries to check explosives and metals.  There is also a camera system on focus connected to a visual display unit for monitoring activities especially in banking halls and supermarkets.  Hence information technology has a vital role to play in the task of ensuring maximum security.  This work is based on an network based information system for collecting and collating as well as analyzing crime for the use of management at all levels of an organization in their task of decision taking, planning and control strategies based on security.

People who are separated by distances can effectively and conveniently reach one another to do business together through communication. This is therefore very necessary that every government provided enough and adequate communication for it’s citizens so that they will have a sense of belonging in the Global world.\n\nThe so-called western countries are where they are today because they realized the importance of communication and followed it up with better (good) approach. The major problems in the so-called under developed countries are their nonchalant effect on the economy.\n\nOur country Nigeria is still in the “dark” age because they have failed to appreciate and fully embrace communication in its fullness. The sole telephone line subscriber (NITEL) in Nigeria today had failed to provide enough lines for its citizenry and the available ones are not distributed equally so that every citizen will have a share of the “essential commodity”.\n\nThe mode of telephone lines allocation by NITEL is inconsistent and unreliable in the sense that NITEL has failed to strictly follow the criteria laid down by it’s management in telephone line allocation. Recently, NITEL has cut down it connection fees but problem of telephone line allocation still persists. This why I chose to write this topic with a view of the coming out with a lasting solution to the work on the neck of NITEL, which affects the country today and it decreased the rate of development.\n\n1.1     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM.\n\nLines that are available in the nation today is not enough to serve the teaming population and among the available line, many are faulty because of lack of maintenance. Our government is not given enough funds to NITEL management.\n\nNITEL is crying daily for insufficient line, but with all this more than one line are allocated to some individuals\n\nThe Network of NITEL cabinets are no longer useful and the under-ground cable system is no more serving the population currently in the society.\n\nNITEL is finding it difficult to maintain the identity and record of its subscribers, this makes it impossible for them to know the people line are allocated to and those people lines are not allocated to.",

To the ultimate consumers processing of any Nigerian company especially N.B.L 9th mile Enugu to be computerized to help save difficulties encountered during the distribution of the final product. In Nigerian Breweries PLC 9th mile Enugu, where drinks like Star Lager Beer, Guilder the Ultimate, Legend Stout Beer, Guinness Stout and Guinness Malt, Amstel Malt are produced, distribution is done manually. So the aim of this project is to computerized the distribution processing and monitor the company goods.       1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY Distribution as often said is a system by which products are transferred from the production area to the final consumer through different channels like wholesalers, retailers etc. distribution started when the idea of producing goods came up. If goods are produced without being sold, it becomes a waste of time, money and resources. Distribution takes different forms. There are goods produced that need to be distributed directly to the final consumer and there are some that will undergo certain processes. E.g. the distribution channels before it gets to the final consumer. There are some companies e.g. Nigeria Breweries 9th mile which are situated or sited at the urban area. Goods produced here cannot reach those that need them in the rural area and other urban area where the goods are not produced. This is the reason why distribution is necessary and through the help of distribution channels these products get to those that need them.\n\n    1.2     STATEMENT OF PROBLEM This has to do with the title of the project, which is the design, and implementation of a computerized product in distribution monitoring system in Nigeria Breweries PLC 9th mile. Due to the setback experienced in the distribution of drinks in Nigeria Breweries PLC using manual method, the company finds it difficult and useful to spread or disseminate information on distribution. The problem caused by the use of manual method can only be solved by computerizing the distribution processing.\n\n  1.3     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The main purposes of this project are 1.     To computerize the distribution product in monitoring system in Nigerian Breweries PLC 9th mile. 2.     To devise the effective efficient cost effective means of using automated or computerized method to disseminate or spread information 3.     To ensure adequate circulation of finished product. 4.     To facilitate the services of the company to its customer. 5.     To increase turn over.\n\n1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY The beneficiaries of this study are. i.         The manufacturers. ii.        The wholesaler iii.       The retailers iv.       The consumer.\n\ni)     THE MANUFACTURERS: Computerization of the distribution processing will help the manufacturer know the brand that has the highest demand and produced it more. ii)     THE WHOLESALER: There will be no market if the wholesalers carry goods, which the customers will reject. They know the taste of their customers and types of goods they like most. These are the one they will demand or request.iii)    THE RETAILER: The retailers sell direct to customers. They know that their customers like and dislike so this study help know the actual products they prefer. iv)    THE CUSTOMER:. Computerization of distribution processing will help the customers to always get their taste because the suppliers will now know the actual products they like most and supply it to them.   1.5   SCOPE OF THE STUDY Different Nigeria Bottling companies have different ways of distributing their product. Our concern is the distribution monitoring system of Nigeria Breweries Ama 9th mile PLC. Distribution here takes three forms. Depot Delivery Self collection Direct delivery In depot delivery the drinks are being transferred from the production area to the depots in different places.  People, institution, hotels, some establishments, go to these depots to buy.  Self-collection is a process by which the customers themselves go to the production area to buy.  Direct delivery needs salesman who will come to the production area, collect the products, sell them and bring back the money to the company.",

Defining the broad extent of privatization;\n\n2.                 Stating clearly the political, economic and social objective to be achieved;\n\n3.                 Establishing clear guidelines or criteria for evaluations\n\n4.                 Selecting techniques;\n\n5.                 Ensuring transparency and accountability in the privatization process and which competitive bidding to the fullest extent possible;\n\n6.                 Building marketing up frost in each privatization operation in order to stimulate potential interest among investors and their to enhance the value of the public enterprise to be privatized.\n\n7.                 Promoting employee participation in the privatization process through the allocation of a proportion of corporate shares;\n\n8.                 Establishing procedure for monitoring the progress all results of privatization etc;\n\nThe above strategies cannot be achieved manually; many privatization programs have suffered from poor design, in adequate preparation, and weak implementation.  This is clearly evidenced by the long average time its complete transaction.  It is based on these drawbacks that the need for computerization arise.\n\nThe study will focus on the application of computerized procedures for privatization of a corporate enterprise using the Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL LTD) as a case study.\n\nSTATEMENTS OF THE PROBLEMS\n\nAlthough the problems associated with the creation of corporate enterprise have not always been clearly stated.  In spite of the bug’s investment in public enterprise in Nigeria, their senses could not meet the demand aspiration of the populace; the report of Onosode Presidential commission (1984) reveals that corporate enterprises are infested with some problems.  In the case of NITEL LTD the following problems were obsessed in relation to the on going privatization exercise in the country.\n\ni.                   Defective capital structure resulting in heavy dependency burden on national treasuring:\n\nii.                 Mismanagement of funds and operations;\n\niii.              Misuse of monopoly power cumulating in corruption and lack of competition;\n\niv.              Bureaucratize bottle necks within the organization;\n\nv.                 Lack of transpierce in the on going privatization programme;\n\nvi.              Failure to entrench operational antonomy of the enterprise in such area as authority limit, tariff determination, procurement policy constitutes major areas of concern.\n\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\n          The aims and objectives of the project work are:\n\ni.                   To create a database for the storage of all information requirements for the privatization of the enterprise.\n\nii.                 To eliminate all the darn backs of manual techniques of data collection and record keeping into computerized system.\n\niii.              Assist in the planning, designing and implementation of education and training programs for corporate groups.\n\niv.              To provide organizational efficiency through computerization.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPUTERIZED HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHuman resources management at least in a primitive form has existed since the drawn of group of effort. Certain human resources functions even though information nature was performed wherever people come together for a common purpose.\n\nThe contemporary area of human resources management begins in the late (1920’s) it was characterized by an increase concern for human element in management. During the course of this century, however, the process of managing people has become more formalized and specialized and also a growing body of knowledge has been accumulated by practitioners and scholars.\n\nThe human resources management (HRM) is a relatively modern label for the ranges of themes and practices involved in managing people.\n\nIn organization “people” (Workers) are critical factors in its well-being. Since every organization is made up of people, hiring and maintaining good and qualified people critical to the effectiveness or success of organization. For the fact that every organization is human oriented, a factor without which the organization is reduced to nothing, the process of acquiring human services, developing skills, motivating them and ensuring their loyalty in the organization are vital instrument for achieving organization objectives be it public or private sector.\n\nHuman resources is simply defined as the supply of required staff of people with various qualitative skills which when applied, organizational or institutional objectives will be achieved.  The globalization process today dictates a need for continuous improvement in productivity and quantity necessary for an effective use of new technologies on organization that would like to survive these challenges of the present and future time anticipate its system reviews and change.\n\nToday things are changing very fast the world has become so much unpredictable and uncertain especially in areas of rapid and radical technological development which focus more on computerization.\n\nThis goal could only be achieved by organization engaging in proper utilization of its human resource elements.  Manages the implementation and delivery of human resources services and operations agency-wide; implements human resources policies and operating procedures in a consistent manner throughout the agency.  Employ technology to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations, including electronic recruitment and staffing systems.  This lad to this research and project work “Design and implementation system” using the Emenite Limited (EL) Enugu as a case study of stream line the conduct of company operation with the global demand of present the technological development.  Emenite limited has been a member of the Belgium group Etex started operation in 1963 under the name ‘Turners & Sbetos cement company Nigeria Limited and later change to turners building products (Emene) Limited.  Due to dividing fortunes of the company, in March 24, 1998, turners and Newall Ltd diverted its interest in the company and transferred 51% of its shareholding to Eteroutreme societe Anonyme of Belgium (now Etex group S.A) and balance went to Eastern Zones that change the name to Emenite Limited.\n\n          In the course of the work Emenite Limited (EL) the computer is used to compute the flow of data, production, quality control, and data processing.  This production appointment will properly kept and access information, retrieval of information, storage easy and simply to generate helps to make more reports available to the management and better handling of production, appropriate quality control, personnel data and information flow in other departments.\n\n1.1            STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nThe non-satisfaction of customers demand when needed (inadequate production); the time wastage in delivery of goods; the improvement on adequate payment of workers.\n\n1.2            OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe effectiveness of an organization firm or system is determined by its ability to allow certain goals maintain itself internally and adopt to it environment.  The main of this project is to improve in production and data flow during delivery within Emenite organization using a more feasible alternative that will eliminate some of the problems in the existing system.  The set objectives of the project can be summarized as follows:\n\n-                     Improvement in production\n\n-                     To avoid unnecessary delay in time delivery.\n\n-                     To improve on adequate payment of workers.",

These processes involve monitoring and analyzing public institutions financial conditions, general and special account, management budgetary procedures, financial statements and reports, payroll/income tax calculation and salary payments, and managing cash flow.\n\n          Price to the emergence and introduction of computer all these processes and activities were done manually. The expansion of the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital UNTH, Enugu just like any other public institution, will not only intensity but also diversify the financial operations thereby making the activities increasingly difficult and wearisome. The volume of transaction has already increased to a level that requires automation.\n\n          Convincingly, the field of data processing was not easy to get by and so over the years (in the field of data processing with utmost speed), mankind has searched for the extra-ordinary. At such time came the emergence of the computer which is widely used virtually in all areas of human endeavor.\n\n          The increase in the use of computer in both public and private institutions of the world economic is an undisputable conclusion for efficiency, speed and accuracy of its operations in achieving results.\n\n          However, the manual processes and procedures of financial resources allocation and utilization is our contemporary days has been confronted with consistent problems of errors and wastage of time which are traceable to human mistakes and shortcomings.\n\n          The establishment of a sustainable, manageable, reliable and flexible financial management system for UNTH to curb these problems  inherent in the existing system is the bases of this project work. Such a financial management system will support all operational accounting procedures as well as financial management.\n\n1.1     STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\n          The problems faced in the financial management activities includes\n\n1.                 The consistent prevalence of errors in calculations carried out on financial reports which are traceable to human mistakes and shortcoming.\n\n2.                 Improper handling of financial statement, reports and records as a result of the problem of space for storage and retrieval purposes which led to many files been misplaced.\n\n3.                 The interval or time consumed in analyzing and ascertaining the accuracy and approval of financial statements and accounts which in turn affects decision making and policy formulation.\n\nThis research work is prompted to these problem g\\for it is the basis of the above problems facing manual financial management procedures and activities today that instilled the researcher to look into the subject of curbing and controlling financial management activities manually.\n\n1.2     PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\nThis project work is very essential in various ways to a number of people including the business men, sole proprietors, firms, organization, companies etc. both private and public institution whose utmost desire is to ensure expansion of their institution through proper financial resources allocation and management. It will be enormous benefits to both accountants and auditors from time to time.\n\nAlso it is to remove repetitive, inefficient processes and unclear procedures and provides adequate information supporting financial decision making which enables the institution to secure its resources against dubious minded managers as well as unreliable information.\n\n          Finally, the project work is also to serve as a reference or guide for future research to be carried out for proper documentation.\n\n1.3     AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe aim and objectives of this study is to minimize and if possible eradicate the problems or errors made by human beings due to shortcomings. This will be achieved by the establishment of a sustainable, manageable and flexible financial management system.\n\n          Another aim is to ensure that financial records are properly stored thereby preventing them from getting lost since these records will be used in the future especially when making or planning for budget.

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPUTERIZED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING SYSTEM FOR A HOTEL INDUSTRY\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFinance is the life wire of any business organization.  It is required for the execution of production, sales and administration of a business operation.  As a discipline, finance is concerned with the acquisition and administration of the use of the firms’ funds as well as profit planning and control financial analysis is inevitable for the effective planning and control of any firm.\n\n          To effectively plan for the future, the financial manager should be able to assess the financial position of the firm and relates this to its confronting investment opportunities.  Since funds are scarce, financial analysis helps the financial manager to assess the returns on investment accruing from ploughing the firms’ assets and thereby efficiently allocating resources.\n\n          However, financial accounting is the employment of the firm’s balance sheet and income statement to establish some relationship between one figure and another in order to highlight the strengths and weakness of the concerned business.  The balance sheet of a firm is also called the financial position because it shows the position of the business in monetary term at a given point in time while the income statement show how the position depicted by the balance sheet has been attained.  The results of financial analysis are normally expressed as financial ratios, which could be broadly classified as liquidity, leverage, activity and profit ratio.  The suppliers of the firm’s funds and the investing public are usually interested in these ratios.  But the nature of interest expressed on the firm determines the ratios to be emphasized by each concerned parts.  This implies that different people emphasize on different ratios and as a result financial analysis means different thing to different people.\n\n          For instance, creditors are interested on those ratios, which measure the ability of the form to service their debts and pay the principal as and when due while the equity owners are interested on the profitability ratios.  The financial manager occupies a unique position in the firm as he should be able to computer interpret and explain these ratios to various interest groups in the firm when the firm requires funds from outside sources, the financial manager should be able to use the relevant ratio to convince investors to supply their funds.  Also the financial manager should be able to justify the reasonableness of some investment or project being under taken by management before the shareholders.\n\n          However, the cost involved in the employment of a financial manager makes it mandatory for small-scale companies to engage the services of a financial consultant. The increased use of high-speed computers in various facets of business should popularize the use of financial ratios in business decision.  This is because computer would provide the necessary equipment to handle problems associated with voluminous maze of financial data due to lack of time or more.\n\n          This study therefore, aims at the development of a database for financial statements and a set of programs to computer, store and retrieve various financial ratios for some companies.\n\nSTATEMENT OF PROBLEMS\n\nThe Nigeria Company Act of 1968 stipulate that all registered companies in Nigeria should file their audited annual balance sheet this will guide the investors in the development of the funds and to provide basis for company taxation.  But there are some problems facing the financial accounting of any hotel.  These problems includes:-\n\n1.                 Illegal use of money cards – some managers has taken the privilege of using both credit and debit cards to steal companies money and some do not know how to use this cards thereby causing problems to the hotels.\n\n2.                 One of the major loopholes of an un-computerized financial accounting system is its ability to fraud a company.  This poses a problem to the management of a hotel.\n\n3.                 Some companies employ inexperienced managers who are not professionals in the field of computing and this will restrict the objectives of the computerized system to a certain limit.\n\n4.                 Insufficient fund- to set up a complete computerized financial accounting system requires a huge amount of money.  Some hotels find it difficult to afford or cannot afford it.\n\nOBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\n1.                 The use of password and other security measures enable a company to prevent unauthorized user of the files.\n\n2.                 The use of money cards by some customers will act as a security measure against armed robbers and other inconveniences ca-use by the bulkiness of their money.\n\n3.                 Information can be stored for future use and can also be retrieved at an electronic speed.  This will prevent the time wasting while using the manual files.\n\n4.                 The computer has been proved without any doubt to be far more accurate than either any know person or any previous machine performing mechanical operation with data.\n\n5.                 Computer works at incredible high speed.  It performs millions of calculations, sort and combines information in different ways within a second.\n\nDELIMITATION OF STUDY\n\nThis study is focused on Modotel, one of the prominent hotels in Enugu, owned by private individual.  It has been chosen as case study because it is expected that given it size, modernity and its promoters.  It will satisfy our data need.  In examining the management of the hotel, this project is limited to the financial aspect of the management.",

It started official production in 1981, and has to date made an enviable mark on the nation’s industrial growth, adding over 20,000 vehicles to the nations transport sector, backed up effectively with a network of over 36 after-sales service points and spare parts supply depots.\n\nMB-ANAMMCO manufactures commercial vehicles and leads in the production of both private and commercial vehicles in Nigeria.   This plant which occupies a sprawling 300,000 square meters site at Emene, near Enugu is virtually a shining example of a profitable and viable economic and technological co-operation between the government and people of Nigeria and Germany.\n\nThe multi-million-naira plant was initially planned to produce trucks for the Nigerian market.   But today, the plant has diversified its production range to include the full range of commercial and private vehicles for the rapid industrialization of the country.  It not only produces trucks as originally planned but has gone a step further in fabrication, manufacturing, and production of buses and other utility vehicles.  Part of its product range today include; MB 0131, L 608 D, MB 1520, MB 230, MB 500 SEL, MB 1414, MB 911, MB 809, fire fighting vehicles, ambulances, mobile clinic collector and other various specialized types of vehicles.  The company has expanded its bus programme to start producing a new intercity bus (MB 1635).  It should also be noted that the MB-ANAMMCO has achieved over 657 local consent in some of these vehicles, especially in buses.\n\nAs a formidable representative of MB-A in Nigeria, MB-ANAMMCO brings mecedes-benz technology and know-how to Nigerians while at the same time create over 800 employment opportunity for Nigerians.  Indeed, the establishment of MB-ANNAMMCO marked the realization of a great dream of developing the country technologically and industrially.\n\nMB-ANNAMMCO has actively participated in the federal government assisted mass transit programme.  It has supplied over 800 units of different bus models to the federal urban mass transit agency and state and local government mass transit programme.  These buses are still strong and very capable as they are supported by the unbeatable after sale s services of the company and their renowned distributors and dealers.  Only recently, the company was invited to produce 700 additional mass transit vehicles for the country to oushion the effect of the increase in the price of petroleum products.\n\nTraining facilities/opportunities centre were commissioned in April 26, 1982, sales, services and spare parts training for their staff and staff of their distributors, dealers and fliet owners.\n\nMB-ANNAMMCO continues to live up to its social responsibilities in all ramifications.  It takes care of its 800 employees by offering them medical services, recreational facilities, etc.  In addition, it occasionally donates to charity organisations and identifies with the government in its socio-cultural endeavours and community development projects.\n\n1.2            JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT\n\nComputerization or computer-based in this concept means the introduction of the computer to the different aspects and levels of the company.  Rather than looking forward to handling information from, messenger – supervisor – maintenance- engineer- manager- expatiate manager –General manager – Board of Directors, this approach is necessary because computer is nearest to information systems.  Not only that, it yields better results because a better information system normally improves organizational result.\n\nSo system must change.  The purpose of this new trend is to outline orderly methods of design and effect the changes which is systematic in changing system.  The system of modifying and reviewing them is called the system development cycle. \n\n1.3                 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe project accept different sources of spare parts, different models of vehicle and keeps track of them in files and can act any given time when needed by anybody generate the organisations report.\n\n1.4            SCOPE OF STUDY\n\nThe scope of this study is mainly for the Anambra Motor Manufacturing Company (ANAMMCO) Nig. Ltd, Emene, Enugu state.\n\n1.5            AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe aims and objectives of this work is that when the system becomes operational, it will,\n\n1.       Permit on-line-time data storage and information retrieval.\n\n2.       Save the production time per section and as such ensure customer satisfaction.\n\n3.       Increase the operational efficiency and accuracy  ",
