Typically, a chat bot will communicate with a real person. Chat bots are used in applications such as ecommerce customer service, call centres and Internet gaming. Chatbots are programs built to automatically engage with received messages. Chatbots can be programmed to respond the same way each time, to respond differently to messages containing certain keywords and even to use machine learning to adapt their responses to fit the situation. A developing number of hospitals, nursing homes, and even private centres, presently utilize online Chatbots for human services on their sites. These bots connect with potential patients visiting the site, helping them discover specialists, booking their appointments, and getting them access to the correct treatment. In any case, the utilization of artificial intelligence in an industry where individuals’ lives could be in question, still starts misgivings in individuals. It brings up issues about whether the task mentioned above ought to be assigned to human staff.

        "content": "CHAPTER ONE\n1.1\t\t\t\tGENERAL INTRODUCTION\nAlong with the popularization and application of information technology in all areas of society, office automation management has increasingly become a trend. The information office has changed the traditional mode of operation, thus to improve the information and the efficiency of data processing, greatly saving manpower, material resources and labor.  Due to the vigorous development these days, the function and performance demanded by the people is rising. Gymnasium and health club in the management aspect are facing many problems, such as low efficiency and performances. In order to solve these problems effectively, to improve the operations benefits of gymnasium owners, this project has carried out the design of the gymnasium management system.\nA gymnasium is an open air or covered location for gymnastics, athletics, and gymnastic services. The word is derived from the ancient Greek gymnasium. The importance of a gymnasium and physical fitness cannot be emphasized enough. In today's society that is moving towards a more sedentary lifestyle, there is a greater need than ever to increase the daily activity level to maintain both cardiovascular fitness and body weight.\nWith a rising trend toward health and wellness, many people are opting for a gymnasium and fitness club membership. While getting in shape requires time and commitment, a gymnasium offers convenient access to state-of-the-art equipment, health assessment, and a variety of classes. Some clubs/gymnasium even offers reduced rates as part of an employer membership, or through certain insurance companies. Discovering all the benefits a fitness club provides helps in the decision-making process. \n1.2\tSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\nThis project research was conducted exclusively in a gymnasium located in a highly populated area that attends to too many customers and members at a time, hence this research was able to track problem such as misplacement of customers and membership records and attendance, member’s fee and plan, slow and strenuous accessibility to customer’s and member’s report and record, inaccurate record keeping and poor information management within the gymnasium. Also, poor communication flow between members and staff because all data is handled by the gymnasium manager.\n\n    • OBJECTIVES\nThe objective of this project is to provide a system which handles the information of the people coming into the gymnasium and maintaining their health care. It is projected towards enhancing the relationship between customers and gymnasium management through the use of Gymnasium Management System. It takes care of all their health information. Data will be stored in the database. It also maintains the people’s attendance, gymnasium records. Also, to develop a user friendly system that requires minimal stress and will enable gymnasium managers to attend to many members or customers without being over worked. It also targets towards contributing to academic research work. It also helps the customer to know the kind of machine to work with after the registration has been done.\n\n1.3\tSIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nThe purpose of this project is to create a new gymnasium management system which will allow an easy operation for both staff and the customer of the gymnasium. Such system is: data entry of customers and members, keeping records of all information about members fees, plan, physical fitness which help to provide good quality of services. Huge files kept through the manual method in offices will no longer be there again because information will be stored on the computer with the help of the computerized gymnasium management System. It will help to keep a comprehensive record of member’s attendance. \n\n1.4\tSCOPE OF THE STUDY\nThis research work is limited to providing a digital gymnasium information management system that will handle electronically both members and staff record, to enable easy accessibility and information flow within the gymnasium.\nThis project is helpful in the Automation of gymnasium record including gymnasium weights, medicines, healthy drinks and gymnasium Management System.\n1.5\tLIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\nThese are the limiting factors and challenges encountered in the course of the project  \n    • Financial Constraints: The design was achieved but not without some financial involvements. Due to the high programming technique that was used, a professional programmer was consulted which cost some amount of money and we also subscribe in order to acquire some information online. Also the typing and planning of the work has its own financial involvements.  \n    • High programming Technique: The programming aspect of this project posed a lot of problematic bugs due to the syntax and semantic error, that took me some days to solve. \n    • Few Literature Sources: The topic though seems to be a common term; it is not a popular topic to surf from the Internet. It had fewer literature sources. \n\n1.6\tORGANIZATION OF THE PROJECT\nThis project was covered under five chapters:\nChapter 1 Deals with the introduction. The background of the project is discussed. The objectives of the project, statement of problem, its significance, scope, and constraints are pointed out, Chapter 2  review the related literature on the research work, Chapter 3 Discuss system Investigation and Analysis. It deals with detailed investigation and analysis of the existing system and problem identification, Chapter 4 describes how the new system was designed, how it works and what it needs or requires. This also shows the implementation of the new system with the written program, use case diagram, flowcharts and information flow diagram, Chapter 5 summarizes, concludes and recommends the research.\n",

A good way to find out what is happening within a salon is to look at the customer reviews mainly the complaints and how these are dealt with. If there is no log of complaint procedures, it becomes difficult for customers to know more about the salon. It means that the salon isn’t keeping a close eye on the complaint, not dealing with team members who are having the complaints, but also not creating best practice from it. In this salon booking system user can review salons and stylist online and can book appointment online. In this system user can register and get logged onto the website. They can select the nearby salon, and also can check for the services. Users can view various beauty related products and purchase.

If not managed well, it can be a problem rather than being a solution. The Employee transportation solution will provide an application platform to organise all the pick and drop related services. The employee transport service application to be designed, will provide a smooth flow of services between the admin and the users, where the admin will be the management of an organisation and the user will be the employees. The admin panel needs to login into the application, the admin will have many functions by which he/she can modify the pick-ups and drop-offs related services. These functions include add driver where he can add the driver, add vehicle where he can add vehicles to the employees, Admin can view bookings and manage time slot. On the other end, the employee’s first needs to register into the system by filling up basic registration details. After successful registration, employee can login by using their login credentials. Once the user logs in into the system, he/she can view available time slots and employee can select a time slot according to their shift timings. All these features will provide a hassle-free pick and drop management system for an organisation.\n       This project was out of the necessity to address the inherent problems encountered by members of staff of super maritime shipping Agency and their customers.\n       The manual process involved in the management of cargo were critical examined and the flows noted.

It is no longer a new thing that loss of customers’ goods is now the order of the day, the reasons are not far-fetched.  Due to this manual procedure involved in Cargo management, clients have no other option than to be at the mercy of these error prone procedures.\nMembers of staff of supper maritime one to the registered shipping agencies and a subsidiary of Nigerian ports plc cannot provide their goods that is the nature of the method used in calculating the tonnage to know the amount of money to pay as cargo fees.\nThe method of information storage in the company is poor.  This limits the number of official documents accessible by the customers because the system is not capable of managing old items of information which could be of use to be customer of anytime.\nThere is little or no security control system where the customers’ goods, document and classified information of the customer could be safe guarded from unauthorized access.\n 1.2     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\nThe loopholes existing in the management of cargo under the suspicious of Nigerian ports plc and super maritime and the subsequent solutions to these existing problems were the driving force in undertaken this project or study.\n 1.3     AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\nThe aims and objectives of this study is to design and implement a computerized cargo transportation management system that will among other thing, make provision for a detailed breakdown of the customers weight of the goods / Cargo, quick retrieval and display of information pertaining to the client.\nProvisions is also made to check fraud and other criminal acts carried out by both parties involved in the transaction and this lead to security and control.  Also another aim of this study is to provide a system that will manage the customer’s document from the port of loading to the port of discharge with his on ground there will be no conflict between the port of loading and port of discharge.\n 1.4     ASSUMPTIONS\nIt is assumed that the new system will do the following:\na.          the new system will create room for the client to know all th necessary facts about the vessel, mat is, the name of the vessel, the Nationality of the vessel and the voyage number with in the he shortest possible time so that transactions will be an easy task for the two parties involved.\nb.          The know the actual port of discharge and port of loading so that the two ports will create no conflict or confusion for the client as regard the documents to be signed and counter signed by the client.  For example, the bill of loading.\nc.           The new system will create an avenue where by the measurement and Gross weight of the cargo will be known and the commensurate fees to be paid.\nd.          The new system will also make all the on-line operations carried out in cargo management in supper maritime and Nigerian ports plc an easy task for official and staff of both establishment.\n \nDESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPUTERIZED CARGO TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM",

        "content": "Canteen Food Ordering and Management System\n\n                                          ABSTRACT\n\nThe main objective of online food ordering system is to automate the existing manual system with the help of advance computerized software so, that valuable data can be stored for longer period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same.\nThe registered user can access the account with valid credentials. User can surf the food items according to categories, Cart and online payment options are available to user. User can track their orders with the food details.\nIn Online Food Ordering System Admin can handle the functionalities like add new food items, edit/delete food items, Enable/Disable the food items according to season and availability. Admin have authority to view order details and update the delivery status of food. The payment transaction and user details are also viewable to admin.\n\n\nDESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ONLINE FOOD ORDERING SYSTEM\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 BACKGROUND OF STUDY\n\nThe online food ordering system is one of the latest servicers most fast food restaurants in the western world are adopting. With this method, food is ordered online and delivered to the customer. This is made possible through the use of electronic payment system. Customers pay with their credit cards, although credit card customers can be served even before they make payment either through cash or cheque. So, the system designed in this project will enable customers go online and place order for their food.\nDue to the great increase in the awareness of internet and the technologies associated with it, several opportunities are coming up on the web. So many businesses and companies now venture into their business with ease because of the internet. One of such business that the internet introduced is an online food ordering system. In today’s age of fast food and take out, many restaurants have chosen to focus on quick preparation and speedy delivery of orders rather than offering a rich dining experience. Until recently, most of this delivery orders were placed over the phone, but there are many disadvantages to this system.\nIt is possible for anybody to order any goods via the internet and have the goods delivered at his/her doorsteps. But while trying to discuss the transfer method of the goods and services, attention is focused on the payment mode. In other words, how possible is it to pay for goods and services via the internet? This then leads to the discussion of the economic consequences of digital cash. What are the implementations from the view point of economic? Since the world is fast becoming a global village, the necessary tool for this process is communication of which telecommunication is a key player. A major breakthrough is the wireless telephone system which comes in either fixed wireless telephone lines or the Global System of Mobile communication (GSM).\n\nWhat I propose is an online ordering system originally designed for use in college cafeterias, but just as applicable in any food delivery industry. The main advantage of this system is that it greatly simplifies the ordering process for both the customer and the restaurant. The system also greatly lightens the load on the restaurants end, as the entire process of taking orders is automated. Once an order is placed on the webpage that will be designed, it is placed into the database and then retrieved, in pretty much real-time, by a desktop application on the restaurants end. Within this application, all items in the order are displayed, along with their corresponding options and delivery details, in a concise and easy to read manner. This allows the restaurant employees to quickly go through the orders as they are placed and produce the necessary items with minimal delay and confusion. The greatest advantage of this system is its FLEXIBILITY.\n\n1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nAs industries are fast expanding, people are seeking for more ways to purchase products with much ease and still maintain cost effectiveness. The vendors need to purchase the products in order to sell to end users. The manual method of going to their local food sales outlets to purchase food is becoming obsolete and more tasking. Food can be ordered through the internet and payment made without going to the restaurant or the food vendor. So there is need for a wide range of publicity and enabling direct order, processing and delivering of food through online system. For this system, there will be a system administrator who will have the rights to enter the menu with current prevailing prices.\n\n1.3 OBJECTIVES OF STUDY\n\n\n \nThis study lays out a framework for a new system to be developed and brought to the market for maximum use and to create an avenue through the web where users can log on to our server and make a selection of whatever goods or food they like and subsequently pay via the internet. The following are the objectives this would bring:\n1. The home page of this web interfile provides an avenue where customers will be able to gather more and reliable information about what the fast food industry really does.\n2. The products and services offered would provide the customers with all the different categories of available products that they can choose and select from.\n3. This will provide a user friendly environment between the customer and employee thus increasing the efficiency of the food ordering system.\n4. There will also be an online purchase form with which valued customers will be using to get in touch with any of their request whenever the need arises.\n5. It will also help for easy retrieval of orders made by the customers.\n\n1.4 SCOPE OF STUDY\n\nIn this project, a fast food company is designed and KRISPY FAST FOOD, AWKA is taken as a case study to enable customers order for food and get it delivered accordingly and also to reduce the long queues of customers at the counter ordering for food and to reduce the work lord on the employees.\nThe following things are among other things that are discussed and what the software would handle:\n About the fast food company\n The fast food and the services offered there\n Online purchase\n Type of food provided.\n\n1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY\n\nIn view of the rapid development of computer technology in almost all the fields of operation and its use in relation to information management, it has become important to look into the development of online ordering system for firms to meet up with demands of the customers. Therefore, the food ordering and delivery system will help customers and management to:\n1. Advertise available foods in their company\n2. Reduce the workload in the present system\n3. Reduce time wasted in data processing\n4. Create a platform for online purchase and delivery of fast food\n5. Keep accurate record on purchased order and delivery.\n\n1.6 LIMITATIONS\n\nDue to time and financial constraints, the software that is developed covers only the aspect of food ordering and payments.\n\n1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nFOOD: Any nutritious substance that people or animals eat or drink, or that plant absorbs, in order to maintain life and growth.\n\nMENU: A list of dishes available in a restaurant or the food available or to be served in a restaurant or at a meal for example “a dinner-party menu”, “politics and sport are on the menu tonight”.\n\nONLINE FOOD ORDERING: Online food ordering services are websites that feature interactive menus allowing customers to place orders with local restaurants and food cooperatives.\n\nCREDIT CARD: A credit card is a payment card issued to users as a system of payment.

        "content": "\n\nDESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF COMPUTERIZED PHARMACY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\nPharmacy management system is a management system that is designed to improve accuracy and to enhance safety and efficiency in the pharmaceutical store. It is a computer based system which helps the Pharmacist to improve inventory management, cost, medical safety etc. The system allows the user to enter a manufacturing and expiry date for a particular  product or drug during opening stock and sales transaction. The system will also give report showing the list of products expiry after a specified date before the product eventually expires. It also involves manual entry upon arrival of new batches of drugs and upon drug movement out of the pharmacy for a certain period, e.g. every month, the pharmacist may want to generate report for the movement of drugs in and out of the pharmacy, getting information about the drugs e.g. expiry date, date purchased, number of drug type left, location of a drug in the pharmacy. At present, manual system is being utilized in the pharmacy. It requires the  pharmacist to manually monitor each drug that is available in the pharmacy. This usually leads to mistakes as the workload of the pharmacist increases.\n\n1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nDue to the size and quality service of the pharmacy, the pharmacy has a very large customer base. These customers tend to visit the pharmacy for services mostly when they close from work. At this period, the number of customers that patronisethe  pharmacy is on the increase, thereby making the workload of the pharmacists much  more tedious. This case makes it difficult for the pharmacist to attend to customers in a short period. Meanwhile the pharmacist has to ensure satisfaction in services to keep their customers. The factors mentioned above, results in delay of the services being rendered to the customers, thereby slowing down sales and risk losing valuable customers in the long run.\n\n1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nPharmacy management has kept paper record in filing cabinets. Managing a very large pharmacy with records on papers will be tedious and difficult to keep track of inventories with regards to the drugs in the store, expiry date, quantity of drugs available based on the categories and their functions. The pharmacist has to order drugs to replenish the already diminishing stock. In addition, ordering of drugs is being carried out manually. Significant amount of time is allocated for writing the order as the pharmacist needs to go through the stock  balance and make rough estimate of the amount to order based on Figures. Drugs are not supposed to be used after they have expired. This project work will  prompt the pharmacist about drugs that are close to expiry, preventing those drugs from being sold and also providing solution to the earlier stated problems.\n\n1.3 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe aim of this project is to develop a software for the effective management of a  pharmaceutical store that will be able to achieve the following objectives:\n\nEnsuring effective policing by providing statistics of the drugs in stock.\n\nMaintaining correct database by providing an option to update the drugs in stock.\n\nImproving the efficiency of the system by ensuring effective monitoring of services and activities.\n\nTo provide optimal drug inventory management by monitoring the drug movement in the pharmacy.\n\nTo ensure that there exists a level of restricted access based on functionality and role.\n\nTo ensure that the system is user friendly.\n\nTo be able to generate report within a specified period of time.\n\n1.4 SCOPE AND LIMITATION\n\nThe scope of this project is limited to the activities of a pharmaceutical store which includes will improving health outcomes, reduce hospital and long term care admissions, enhance access and care in the Estate and surrounding communities and ensuring best use of resources, the use of a computer based management system for improving the efficiency of a pharmacy is needed and it is an essential part of any modern continuously evolving society. The system will not be able to handle drug prescription, drug to drug interaction. The system will not be able to handle contraindication and polypharmacy in a prescription; this implies that these services will be manually completed by the pharmacist.\n\n1.5 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nThe research method used for this project work gives a description of how the  pharmacy management system for Boniks Pharmacy and stores, Gwarimpa Estate, Abuja will be developed. Therefore the method used in the design and collections of information from various sources are as follows:\n\nStudying the present system in detail and the organizational style.\n\nKnowing and understanding the input and output processes of the existing system.\n\nA qualitative form of interview was conducted in the organization to understand the mode of operation of the old system.\n\nPrimary data: This source has to do with the text book contacted for the development of this project.\n\n1.6 DEFINITION OF TERMS System\n\n: Is the complex purposeful collection of interrelated components that work together to take some objectives.\n\nDrug interaction: is a situation in which a substance (usually another drug) affects the activity of a drug when both are administered together.\n\nPolypharmacy: is the use of multiple medications by a patient, especially when too many forms of medication are used by a patient, i.e. when more drugs are prescribed than is clinically warranted.\n\nContraindication : is the condition or factor that serves as a reason to withhold a certain medical treatment.\n\n1.7 CHAPTER LAYOUT\n\nThe chapter layout of this project is outlined in a sequential manner starting with Chapter one which consists of the Introduction, Background of the study, Statement of the problem, Aims and objectives, Significance of study, Research methodology, Scope, Limitation, and Definition of terms. Chapter two consist of introduction, Literature review of the project, an overview of  pharmacy management in the past, at present and also include the benefits of  pharmacy management.

That stat, floating around the Internet, has been attributed jointly (and separately) to the U.S. Department of Labor and a survey by Yahoo!, Whether that information is strictly reliable or not, executives and avid readers everywhere will attest to the value of reading—for personal development, leadership purpose, training, continuous learning and company innovation. To enhance reading culture among students, starting a book club with books that speak to career advancement and fulfillment.\n\nFor promoting reading and developing lifelong reading habits have always been parallel goals with developing information literacy through their integrated school library programs. This has traditionally included developing extensive collections of quality literature books (books and novels), as well as rich information books, all in support of the school curriculum and as resources to support positive reading habits. Computerization and the pervasive infiltration of the Internet have dramatically altered all areas of work for teacher-librarians. The school library community has fully engaged in management uses of technologies: automating library collections; providing reference online; providing access to databases and electronic materials; as well as building a significant virtual presence through school library websites, archives of student work, and collected bookmarks of thematic resources. However, the traditional areas of promoting reading and providing readers’ advisory have often remained static and bound by face-to-face methods such as conducting book talks; building in-library displays; and bulletin board displays, as well as evidence that by improving students' access to reading materials and opportunities to interact with peers about their reading, teachers can do a better job of helping all readers become skillful, motivated readers. Since technology is seen as occupying more and more of students time out of school, it would seem important to explore how these two areas might unite to explore how new technologies such as e-books and e-readers support the goals of motivating students to read. Since digital technologies are so appealing to today’s youth, research seems to support the value of developing an online book club system as a factor in motivating young readers to read more with some evidence they may be particularly valuable in motivating reluctant readers. Online book club will enable e-readers also have been used in research exploring children’s reading comprehension (Larson, 2010). Evidence from this work suggests e-readers offer more than just portability and storage capacity; they support readers through their use of multiple tools and text features such as text-to-speech options, dictionaries and note-taking capabilities (Larson, 2010). There can be little doubt that e-books and e-readers are here to stay. In fact, data from publishers/distributors of e-books and the makers/marketers of e-readers have all indicated that growing sales and growing demands will lead to further innovations in these technologies and wider acceptance of their use. This information, coupled with evidence that those who own an e-reader buy more books now than before they owned an e-reader (Duncan, 2010), should awaken teacher-librarians to a reality that looms before them, one that holds great promise in our goals of supporting literacy and promoting reading habits.\n\n1.2     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe purpose of this research is to develop an online book club management system, to increase the reading culture among members of this online community, to enhance the sharing of books, proper reading, review books, rate books and connect with other readers.\n\n1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nIncrease reading the culture among students’ and members of using the system.\nEliminate borrowing of books from library, informative books will be readable available for the reading pleasure of students.\nReduce money students spend on buying bulk of books.\nTo increase academy performance of students.\n1.4     STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nIn most educational institutions there’s a need to increase the reading culture among students especially in this internet age, were students spend a lot of time on the internet. Students can’t have access to books on holidays or easily without having to visit the school library on campus, it is not only time consuming, but it is also reduce students’ academic performance due to no access to books without stress.\n\n1.5     SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe scope of the project is limited to several processes: handling of student ability to access academic materials without having to visit the campus, improve students’ academic performance through continuous reading with other peers. The system will generate the reports such as books read by a particular student to encourage others read same book. The online book club management system is designed in such a way that makes it possible to access through any device connect to the internet.\n\n1.6     DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nReading - The action or skill of reading.\n\nE-readers – electronic readers.\n\nEducational - Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits.\n\nOnline - while connected to a computer or under computer control.\n\nPerformance – an act of showing improvement or decrease in a particular period of time.\n\nAcademic - of, relating to, or associated with an academy or school especially of higher learning\n\nDESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ONLINE BOOK CLUB MANAGEMENT SYSTEM",

In recent years, there is a growing parity websites helping consumers to buy cheaper commodity. Although these websites can help consumers get the parity price of commodities, the search results are not so ideal. Because these websites may occur problems about the difference commodity between search results and consumers want to search, or the difference commodity price between search results and commodity web page. Therefore, this study attempts to use web mining technique as a basic approach. This study proposes a novel commodity search system to track consumer demand, and that is, when the commodity price of any website is lower than the consumer price conditions, the system will proactively notify consumers.

Many factors affect the performance of appointment systems including arrival and service time variability, patient and provider preferences, available information technology and the experience level of the scheduling staff. In addition, a critical bottleneck lays in the application of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IE/OR) techniques. The most common types of health care delivery systems are described in this article with particular attention on the factors that make appointment scheduling challenging. For each environment relevant decisions ranging from a set of rules that guide schedulers to real-time responses to deviations from plans are described.

The amount of trade conducted electronically has grown extraordinarily with widespread Internet usage. The use of commerce is conducted in this way, spurring and drawing on innovations in electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing, online transaction processing, electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems. Modern electronic commerce typically uses the World Wide Web at least at some point in the transaction's lifecycle, although it can encompass a wider range of technologies such as e-mail as well.\n\nA large percentage of electronic commerce is conducted entirely electronically for virtual items such as access to premium content on a website, but most electronic commerce involves the transportation of physical items in some way. Online retailers are sometimes known as e-tailers and online retail is sometimes known as e-tail. Almost all big retailers have electronic commerce presence on the World Wide Web.\n\nHISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF ONLINE MARKETPLACE\nOver the past decade, there has been an extreme jump in internet sales. For example, in 2006, from November 1st to December 26th online shopping soared to $23.1 billion dollars, increasing by 26% from the previous year. Creating a competitive battle with retail stores, online shopping presents a more convenient method of shopping without the lines and the crowds, however, buying online takes away from the social aspect of shopping. Having recognized the lack of social appeal that e-commerce presents, new navigating tools to ease decision- making are being implemented as a result, people are becoming more comfortable with shopping online. As the pressure from online shopping sites increases, retailers have to focus on better marketing strategies to promote products and influence customers to shop in their stores instead of online. In fact, many retailers are now making their products available online.  Thus, a new influx of “click and mortar” retailers are surfacing. The “click and mortar” retailers that provide online shoppers with easy to use features are increasing their online profits and becoming strict competitors to the top online-only companies (ie Amazon and Netflix.\n\nSTATEMENT OF PROBLEM\nIn human endeavor, there is a lot of development which helps to maximize production, income and operation of businesses at Ogbete main market.  These have brought increase in complexity of marketing system like B2B (Business to Business) and B2C (Business to Consumers) and its operations.\n\nBased on these, a number of problems are facing the Ogbete main market system which include\n\nDay-to-Day pressures of selling\nCoping with customers\nSolving basic business problems\nCompetitions (a new player enters, market conditions changes, sales drops, the company introduces a new products or services).\nMost of the leads came from the sales staff.\nUnable to recognize previously visited customers\nAvailability of market (sales and services) to the whole parts of Nigeria\nUnstable fixed price\nOBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\nThe aim of this study is to design and implement a database driven online virtual marketplace with a particular reference to Ogbete main market. The web based program developed in this research essentially provides all the necessary marketing services and operations done at Ogbete main market which will help increase their operations based on sales and services.\n\nThese operations include general sales and marketing management.\n\nIn this study therefore, the researchers hope to accomplish the following objective:\n\nTo design a better pricing mechanism in the market\nTo solve the problem of geographical location\nTo maximize sales\nTo help improve customer relationship\nIncreases social interaction activities\nReduces pressures mounted on sellers\nIncreases management of stock items\nEasy shopping\nIntroduces bidding system\nAccommodates more marketers\nTo improve quality delivery system\nSIGNIFICANCES OF THE STUDY\nBuying and selling is very important to our everyday life, its very important that we humans have to market what we have like goods and services to other people that needs it, also purchase what we are lacking. Marketing is highly regarded everywhere in the whole parts of the world. The following are some significance of this study:\n\nThe secured site for electronic commerce will help the populace people of Nigeria to get rid of risk in carrying cash around and the convenience of shopping anytime of the day.\n It will reduce the risk of transportation, since the customer does not have to travel far to shop for any items or goods.\nIt will reduce the risk of authentication of the product and improved business transaction as customers are now sure of the originality of the product they purchased.\nSCOPE OF THE STUDY\nThis project looks into the processes involved in marketing of goods and services in the marketplace.  The researchers concentrated on the operation going on the general marketing activities like sales, management of stocks, pricing and registering of customers, security and policy guiding sales.\n\nLIMITATION OF THE STUDY\nSome of the constraints that my have in one-way or another affected the outcome of this work include:\n\nResources: Due to the complex and insecurity associated with human factors during this research work, personnel who are used to the manual system perhaps for fear of losing their jobs have been reserved in relinquishing all necessary information to make this project an enticingly extensive one.\nTime: Due to time allowed for this project work, as a student was limited to come up with a reasonable work within the stipulated time.\nPower: Availability of stable, efficient and reliable power supply was also a major limitation of this project as it had to be suspended several times during design and testing stages.\n1.8     THE ORGANISATION AND HER ENVIRONMENT\n\nChief executive officer\n\nGeneral Manager\n\nManager (order)\n\nManager Inventory\n\nManager Sales\n\nOrder Personnel\n\nStore Personnel\n\nDelivery Personnel\n\nCashier\n\nSales\n\nReceptionist\n\nFig 1.0 Organizational structure\n\n< >DEFINITION OF TERMSE-commerce: Generally refers to exchange of goods or services over electronic system such as internet.\n\nB2B: Refers to selling of products or services to other businesses.\n\nB2C: Refers to selling of product or services to end consumers.\n\nCredit card: it is a card entitling its holder to buy goods and service from certain establishment.\n\nMerchant: Refers to as organization (such as an MIT department) accepting credit card payments for the goods or services they provides.\n\nOrder: A record of a request for goods or services initiated by a customer.\n\nOrder ID: A unique identifier assigned to a customer order in clear commerce.\n\nBanner: An advertisement or image displayed on one or more websites to attract visitors to your site.\n\nShopping cart: A wheeled cart for purchase of goods in a store or supermarket.\n\nDESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF E-COMMERCE WEBSITE\n\n\n\nE-Commerce Website for Visually Challenged\n\nThere are around 161 million people who are visually impaired people and around 36 million are blind. These people are taking help from family member or friends to each and every for their needs. Consider a blind individual who lives alone, but wants to make a purchase from an ecommerce site. He doesn’t have anybody there by his side, in the moment, to either guide him on what to do on the site, or make the purchase for him. It is a difficult for blind people to choose clothes with different colors or they find difficult to online shopping. A system is developed to assist blind people that automatically recognizing clothing patterns and colors. The system processes the voice output, and ask for the input by pressing the button of their desire choices. Which will help them to buy their desire things online. Every kind of instruction will me given them in mode of audio they need to hear and follow the instructions.\n\n    • Modules:\nThe system comprises of 2 major modules with their sub-modules as follows:\n\n    1.

I hope you find it helpful.\n\n   A UK visa is the overseas arm of Britain’s integrated border management.  We have visa offices in 160 locations throughout the world.  The largest handles 300,000 applications a year; the smallest less than 10.  we issue visas to 80% of those who apply and stop only those who are a significant immigration risk to the UK.  We process over 90% of straightforward applications within 24 hours.  This is a record of which we are proud, but we aim to do even better.\n\n  Our new mission statement explains how UK visas will deliver the border objectives set by our parent department, the home office and foreign and common wealth office; to achieve a balance between managing travel and migration and preventing illegal immigration\n\n   Our goals are\n\n·                     to bring communities together\n\n·                     to improve Britain’s competitiveness as a destination for travel, trade, migration and investment\n\n·                     to prevent immigration abuse\n\n·                     to deliver for money\n\n·                     to earn public confidence\n\n1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nIn British visa processing information system, the problems we are facing are (i) Bankruptcy Attorney e.g. consumer present their case at legal match by through extensive client acquisition and market outreach efforts our legal match will assists thousands of visitors every day seeking help with their legal issues.  In some areas consumers can also reach us by phone so new bankruptcy legislation may make it harder to find an attorney.  (ii)       Another problem in visa processing into system is the privacy and security problems ie using illegal or fraud visa to go to overseas. (iii) Health (tuberculosis) screening is another problem in visa processing system since it valid for larger than six months in certain countries now require a certificate to show that they are free from infections tuberculosis (TB) before that person will travel to overseas.  The Government announced on 21 July 2005 its intention is to implement the first phase of an overseas screening programme for TB for people applying to enter the UK for more than 6 months in four year strategy earlier this year.  The benefit of the programme is that successful applicants will benefit on arrival in the UK as they will not need to be referred to the port medical inspector before being allowed to enter the country.\n\n1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\n            The UK purpose of study in visa processing system is to achieve the following Diplomatic mission.\n\n·                     A Diplomatic Mission is the office of a country’s diplomatic representative in the capital city of another country.\n\n·                     Diplomatic Mission are established in accordance with the erovisions of the Vienna convention on Diplomatic relations 1961.\n\n·                     Diplomatic Mission of a common wealth country in another common wealth country is called a “High commission”\n\n·                     The head of mission is called “High commissioner”.\n\n·                     A diplomatic mission in any foreign (i.e. non-common wealth) country is called an Embassy and the head of mission is called Ambassador’\n\n·                     High commissions and Embassies perform the same functions and have the same status.\n\n·                     The good management of our diplomatic mission is essential to the success of their work.\n\n1.4       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\n            UK visas began life as the joint entry clearance unit (JECU) in June 2000.  it was established jointly by the foreign and common wealth officer and the home office to manage the UK’s entry clearance (visa) operation.\n\n            Visa or entry clearance applications are processed by entry clearance officers in UK embassies, high commissions and consulates abroad, collectively known as UK missions.  UK visas work closely with the immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) of the Home office, the Government department responsible for immigration policy and dealing with applications from people already in the UK to extend their stay; or to change their immigration status.  UK visas reports to a joint management board of senior foreign and common wealth (FCD) and Home office officials and to ministers in both departments.\n\n1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\n            The scope of the study is concerned with the review to improve.  Britain’s competitiveness as a destination for travel, trade, immigration and investment and to bring communities together.  Specifically the study covers such areas like how UK visas will deliver the border objectives set by our parent department, such as the home office and the foreign common wealth office in order to achieve a balance between managing people’s travel and migration, and also preventing illegal immigration.

        "content": "Online Transaction Fraud Detection using Backlogging on E-Commerce Website\nWe here come up with a system to develop a website which has capability to restrict and block the transaction performing by attacker from genuine user’s credit card details. The system here is developed for the transactions higher than the customer’s current transaction limit.  We tried to detect fraudulent transaction before transaction succeed. During registration we take required information which is efficient to detect fraudulent user activity. Here we present a Behavior and Location Analysis (BLA). The details of items purchased in Individual transactions are usually not known to any Fraud Detection System (FDS) running at the bank that issues credit cards to the cardholders. Hence, We implemented BLA for addressing this problem. An advantage to use BLA approach to reduce number of false positive transactions identified as malicious by an FDS although they are genuine. An FDS runs at a credit card issuing bank. Each incoming transaction is submitted to the FDS for verification. FDS receives the card details and transaction value to verify, whether the transaction is genuine or not. The types of goods that are bought in that transaction are not known to the FDS. Bank declines the transaction if FDS confirms the transaction to be fraud. User spending patterns and geographical location is used to verify the identity. If any unusual pattern is detected, the system requires re-verification. Based upon previous data of that user the system recognizes unusual patterns in the payment procedure.  System will block the user after 3 invalid attempts.\n\n\n\n\n\nModules and their Description\n\nThis system comprises of 2 major modules with its sub-modules:\n\n    1. Admin\n        a.

This system enables the company to make their services available to the public through the internet and also keep records about their services.\n\nThe world has become a place where there is a lot of technological development; where every single thing done physically has been transformed into computerized form. Nowadays, people’s activities have been transformed into work done by computerized systems. One of which is the main target of this project which is about Car Rental System. The system of renting cars exist back in the previous years, were people rent cars for their personal reasons. Car renting is essential to many peoples’ plan to travel or move from one place to another for business purposes, tour, and visit or holidays, for these reasons Car renting is very helpful.\n\nThe [8] starting point of Car renting is really unknown as said by Thomas Pretty; he also mentioned that many beliefs that Joe Saunders was the first man to start a Car renting company. According to Thomas Pretty, charges were calculated with the help of mileage tracking device. Many people became interested in the Car rental business and hence got involved. Car renting became more popular as years pass by. Today Car renting services is found all over the world, especially in the developed and developing countries. To make this service more popular and accessible to the public it has been transform into a web base system and connected to the internet were everyone can be able to have access to it.\n\n1.1 Objectives\nThe main objectives of this project are:\n\n· To develop a web based system that will help manage the business transactions of car renting.\n\n· To help in advertising the car rental services of a company, through the availability of the system online.\n\n1.2 Scope\nThe scope of this project is as follows:\n\n· The car rental system to keep detail records of both the cars and the customers, the duration they rent car as well as the type of car they rent.\n\n· The system will be mainly design for small a company that renders it car rental services to customers.\n\n· The system will have the ability to generate and print invoice for each successful transaction.\n\nLevel of Access:\n\nThe system will have two levels of access:\n\n· The administrator\n\n· Customer\n\n1.3 Problem Statement\nThe problem with some of the current system is that:\n\n· Based on observations, some small companies already have a car rental system which is not a web based application. This is a limitation that gives them capability to store customer’s details, but at the same time they cannot make their services more available to the public through the internet, they rather make use of posters to advertise their services to the public. These types of companies can overcome these problems by switching to the web base application of their type of system.\n\n· They also make use of phone call reservations which is also limited to many features as compare to a web base system. For example a customer may make a phone call reservation for a particular car, but when he/she comes to pick the car, he/she might turn not to like the car; this could be because the customer could not see a sample picture of the car he/she wants to rent\n\n1.4 Methodology\nThe Iterative Waterfall Model is the development methodology that will be used in this project to develop the CRS. This [1] [2] [18] Model is derived from the evolution of the Traditional Waterfall Model. It consist of five phases, which include; the Requirement and Definition, System and Software Design, Implementation and testing, System testing, Operation and maintenance. Each of these phase is repeated if an error is discover, this enables the correction of errors before moving to the next phase. The Figure 1.1 below represents the Iterative Waterfall Model for this project, and each of the phases is explain accordingly.\n\n, 2014)\n\nFigure 1.1: Iterative Water Fall Model\n\n1.4.1 Requirement analysis and definition\nThe system’s services, constraints and goals are established by consultation with system users. Once these have been agreed, they must be defined in a manner which is understandable by users and development team. For example project scope, objectives.\n\n1.4.2 System and software design\nUsing the requirement definition as a foundation, the requirements are divided into software and hardware. This is called system design. Software design is the process of representing the functions of each software system in a manner which may readily be transformed to one or more computer programs. Use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, entity relationship diagrams (ERD) and data dictionary are use at this level to represent the system design.\n\n1.4.3 Implementation and unit testing\nDuring this stage, the software design is released as a set of programs. Unit testing involves verifying that each unit is working according to the specification of the customer.\n\n1.4.4 System testing\nThe individual programs or units are integrated and tested as a complete system to ensure that the software requirements have been met as specified by the end users. After testing has been completed, the software system is delivered to the customer.\n\n1.4.5 Operation and maintenance\nThis is the longest life cycle phase. The system is installed and put into practical use. Maintenance involves correcting errors which were not discovered in the earlier stages of the life cycle. The software must be adapted to accommodate changes in its external environment. For example, a change required because of a new operating system or peripheral device, or because the customer requires functional or performance enhancement.\n\n1.4.6 Feedback\nDuring use, errors and omissions in the original software requirements are discovered, program and design errors come to light and the need for new functionality is identified.\n\n1.5 Software development tools\nThe project will make use of the tools:\n\n· The programming language to use will be PHP.\n\n· A personal computer or laptop as hardware requirement.\n\n· Microsoft 2003/2007 will be used for project documentation.\n\n· MySQL and wamp server will be used for the development of the database\n\n1.6 Conclusions\n1.6.1 Problem restatement\nBased on the research done, some car rental companies still use desktop application for their car rental services and thus making it to be limited to so many important feature that are not available unlike in the web based application where there are so many feature available. Also some upcoming companies do not only make use of these desktop applications, but also make use of phone call reservation, which is still lacking so many features that are needed for this type of system.\n\n1.6.2 Recommendations\nThe most recommended solution to these problems is to implement a web based system that will have the features required for this kind of services or business.\n\nIn conclusion, the system will be able to serve as a web base application when it is finally developed, where these small upcoming companies can make use of it to publish their services in a wide range and also help the company to manage their service more effectively. On the other hand, it will enable customers to freely make their desire choice more freely and interactively.",

        "content": "CHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n          Estate property renters has been proved to be a difficult task in Enugu due to the unsophisticated antiquated and low skill property management by the estate owners and the agent.\n\n          The project discussed in details the modernized and sophisticated method of property management, when one talk of modernized and sophisticated of estate management, computer has to come in enhance 100% result hence the topic of this project design and implementation of a computerized estate property administration system.\n\n          Presently, it is indeed a tedious job for one to search for and get an estate property to hire due to the reason mention above. If Enugu property owners and agent can borrow a leaf from this project, an estate property hiring seekers few second to get property of his choice. The project also gives the seeker the opportunity to know where some of the estate property are located, the owners. The specification of the estate and year of construction (how new or old the estate is). Although, the above mentioned method of estate management is encouraged, it has its own limitation (each estate owner is suppose to have a computer terminal and computer accessories with which he will access the main data base). This project considered limitations and come out with a well simplified low cost and less cumbersome approval towards overcoming the limitations that is, one computer one operator, one computer room and a set of computer accessories were used to access all the property, there owners and their status (i.e whether vacant or not), the facilities available the location and everything pertaining the property in Enugu, with this a centralized computer room ought to be establish to do the job above. A property hiring seeker has to visit the centralized computer room and  get information about estate property, the landlord and agent has to be feeding the system either through telephone service, network or the equivalent.\n\n          But to have a maximum efficiency, networking method of feeding the centralized computer room has been employed. This entails that each landlord will be feeding the centralized computer. When an update is necessary, he uses the terminal which works with the main computer. The centralized computer uses the software to process and access the records in the database.\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\n          Right from the day of records/information about estate property stated, there has been numerous problems resulting from ineffective and inefficient manual mechanical process of storing and manipulating information of estate  property especially in Okolo Okolo & Co. Enugu. The problems encountered using this process can be summarized below:\n\n-              Time, it takes to access record in the present system, is quite much when compared with the computerized method. It waste time and makes information accessing too cumbersome.\n\n-              The record about estate property are stored in sheets of paper and thus makes it easy accessible to intruders and vandals who may be spying.\n\n-              Sheets of paper that are not properly filed can easily slip off thus making useful information inaccessible.\n\n-              The mode of storage of files makes office look clumsy. This is because files that have to take care of all the estate property in Enugu will be many and there may be no enough space.\n\n-              Records are not organized in a way that will facilitate estate property accessing.\n\n-              Modification and updating of records makes it untidy. This is because of the use of correcting fluid or cancellation. Therefore, the problem of the presently use manual system in accessing estate property in Enugu will be a thing of the past with the introduction of computer in storing, processing and retrieving information.\n\nPURPOSE OF STUDY\n\n          The purpose of this project is to developed a computer based solution of storing and accessing record on estate property Okolo Okolo & Co Enugu. This is aimed to phase out the manual or traditional approach of storing a specially designed form that has been recorded with ask in a labeled file jacket.\n\n          Looking into the organization that takes care of estate property revealed several misappropriation such as hurdling of records, stealing of certain records that are important intruding by the spies, lack of funds to buy materials. Improper method of entering the records and modifying of records due to file movement, untidy outlook of some modifies record and so on. Owing to the difficulties mentioned above, the research considered it necessary to develop a computer based method of estate management administration. This will contribute in the eradication of such difficulties encountered by the manual techniques of estate property administration accessing.\n\nSCOPE AND DELIMITATION      \n\n          The scope of this project limits on house allocation in Okolo, Okolo & Co. Enugu. It takes into consideration the updating of records. The display of any particular land lords record wanted, searching for where an available vacant house can be located. In modification of records, the former records that has been entered will be seen before is being corrected. This has making the user see his mistake before correcting. In the search for any estate property owners is done through the use of primary key, the estate property owners first name help facilitates are also to be provided to help inexperience user.\n\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\n          The aims and objectives of this project can be summarized below:\n\n-              To help make estate property accessing fast.\n\n-              To help government in making provision for basic amenities and to know the concentration of population in any particular location in city.\n\n-              The project is aimed at being a guide to people who are homeless and would wish to find a place to call there home.\n\n-              The project has the objective of helping the strangers in the city and to locate their relatives.\n\n-              This project is also aimed at making provision with which government can access the concentration of any particular type of house in area.",

Form time man is burn, he s being studied to know what likely he will be able to do as he grows up. This has to do with his natural behaviour and mental exercise display. This continues in the family parents and other relations acting as guidance and counseling unit. The child goes in tot school. In school the teacher takes over the guidance and counseling, it is a continuous exercise until one finds his feet, then he can continues from there and equally be in a position to guide and counsel others.\n\n          The stage where much work is carried out on guidance and counseling is in secondary schools. This is a stage when a child is grown to be able to understand maturely and when the Child’s attitude is fully studied in line with academic performance. In all secondary school across the country, there exist a guidance and counselor office where people knowledge in the area of psychology are employed in order to help advise the younger ones in school which way forward to their future career. These people through class visitation, observing students during recreation and calling on them at intervals for questioning, came to know the students better and be able to guide and counsel them in their future career probably in University or in any other area of life endeavour.\n\n          The job of guidance and counseling in secondary school is not an easy job to be taking into consideration the number of students involved with respect to the number of staff involved. It is always, very difficult to handle all the student and to remember everything about the students. This guidance and counseling exercise needs a sophisticated system for the operation of guidance and counseling alliterates some of the problems associated with the exercise. \n\nSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS\n\nThe number of students involved in guidance and counseling in schools are very enormous and few staff in guidance and counseling cannot handle the job effectively. It is always very easy to forget information about students and to reach all the students, contributes another problems.\n\n          Another major problem of he guidance and counseling is information storage. The made of storage of information observed from the student in different forms is not reliable and this makes the guidance and counseling to apply guesswork in trying to direct students in their future career work.\n\nThis is a very big delay in taking decision on students concerning their future career. This is so because referencing to students information for decision-making takes a very long time.\n\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THHE STUDY\n\nThe primary aim of this projects work is to provide lasting solution to the problem affecting guidance and counseling exercise in secondary schools. The following objectives below are of the study.\n\n- To make the criteria and process involved in the exercise of guidance and counseling very easy and flexible.\n\n-          To carry take care of the burden, the staff faces in trying to do the work of guidance and counseling manually.\n\n-          To provide adequate enabling environment for guidance and counseling on student  to give them better career perspective.\n\n-          To maintain adequate observed information on students for future reference and quick decision taking.\n\nIMPORTANT OF THE STUDY\n\n          This study is of numerous important to the guidance and counselor department and the society in general. It will help the guidance and counselor to always direct the students in their best career areas with happiness because it will be result oriented. It will be placed in the place where they can best perform; this will help in rapid development in the society. It will help to eliminate the word frustration among the people, which is very common in the society.\n\nSCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study covers the design and implementation of a computerized career choice counseling system in secondary schools.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n\n          On the course of this project work, time and finance posed a major obstacle to the researcher.

It was been estimated that in an organization such as a tertiary educational community, information is highly essential for correct student’s record and examination data. Student information that is not properly created and stored will cause many errors. Nearly every section of educational system requires information processing. It is fortunate that all education institutions in the developing world, such as universities, colleges of education and polytechnics in Nigeria still operate under the manual method of record keeping and computation of Grade Point Average (GPA) and this method is highly prone to errors.\n\nThe errors associated with the existing manual method of processing students result in most colleges of education in Nigeria, including federal college of education in Osiele, Abeokuta, make it not only desirable but imperative that computerized approach used to the full in measuring students’ progress. With the use of computers for information processing, the following are possible instant access to students’ personal and course information, instant student information updating, automatic computation of the Grade Point Average (GPA), generation of the graduating list, monitoring of failed courses, keeping an up-to-date record of entire student body in the institution, storing course code curse description or title, course unit and scores for the purpose  of GPA computation and p[reducing user-friendly data entry screen for ease of use.\n\nSince the inception of federal colleges of education Osiele, Abeokuta in 1976, the colleges operate with five schools namely: school of science, school of art and social science, school of language, school of vocational education and school of education.\n\nAll of which having student enrollment increasing every year, right from the inception of this great institution. Due to increasing number of student in each school of the institution, computation of the student’s GPA has been a very difficult task. Therefore because of this problems and errors arising from using the manual result processing system, a software-computerized result processing system becomes inevitable: the benefit accruable from the computer based cannot be over emphasized.\n\n1.1              BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nAt present the students grading system used by all colleges of education in Nigeria is the five-point grading system, established by the Nigeria Commission of Colleges of Education (NCCE) in 1898. The NNCE five-point grading system is shown below:\n\nTable 1: The NCCE five point grading system\n\nSCORE (%)\n\nLETTER GRADE\n\nGRADE VALUE\n\nREMARK\n\n70-100\n\nA\n\n5\n\nExcellent\n\n60-69\n\nB\n\n4\n\nVery Good\n\n50-59\n\nC\n\n3\n\nGood\n\n45-49\n\nD\n\n2\n\nAverage\n\n40-44\n\nE\n\n1\n\nPass\n\n0-39\n\nF\n\n0\n\nFail\n\nThe courses offered in a NCE programme are allocated a number of credit hours which vary from one course to another, because the causes vary in their needs and scope. Hence some are allocated greater credit hours than others.\n\n1.2              PROBLEM OF THE STUDY\n\nThe problem of the study can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.      It takes a longer time to design and implement\n\n2.      It require high caliber, experienced and specialized personnel\n\n3.      It is costly\n\n4.      The coding is logical and requires specialized programmers.\n\n1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe purpose of the study is to design and implementation of a computerized result processing system for computer science department at the federal college of education, Osiele, Abeokuta.\n\n1.4              OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe objectives of a computerized:\n\n1.      monitoring the performance of the student in the department\n\n2.      to increase the flexibility of the information available\n\n3.      to make processing of students result faster and easier\n\n1.5              LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the likely challenges that may arise in the process of the investigation. It includes:\n\n1.      Money\n\n2.      Transportation\n\n3.      Time consumption\n\nThere are many other problem that occur when carrying out this research project, the first limitation is due to non availability of material topic which makes it difficult for the researcher to have access to work that has been written on it for the literature review. This makes the study to be limited to the fact obtained from the internet, library and environment factors.\n\n1.6              DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nCOMPUTER: A computer is a programmable machine that receives, stores and manipulates data and provides output in a meaningful and useful format.\n\nCOMPTERIZED: An embedded system is a computer system design to perform one or a few dedicated function often with real time computing constraints. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts.\n\nDesign: To decide upon the look and functioning of (a building, garment or other object) typically by making a detaile",

This led to probing the history of National universities commission, which provides the guidelines for the system, and also that of the computer machine, its development up to the point where this aid of the equipment in different techniques were made. The computer-equipment-aids aid the planning system(s) procedures with due reference to its mode of Operation and its procedural functions were discussed, computer software’s of high flexibility was deviced to execute network analysis, using D-BASE. Computer based planning information system is the name of this software package. Modular program design approach, D-BASE coding structures etc, were used to program development. It features an elaborate software package that is designed to simplify matters for the user by assisting him and providing information for decision making. This package accepts, stores and displays strings of symbols that are grouped in various ways.\n\n          An organisation cannot function without computer (information), hence information system is to the organisation as what the nervous system is to the body. A lack of information (for good information) may seriously impair the effectiveness of an organisation. This work is in the area of projection of Computerized Admission Processing System being one of the functions of the academic programme activity unit that cannot be easily done as fast as computer system.\n\n          The Madonna University Admission processing system of the planning directorate was used as a model.\n\n          Managing information (data, files) generated were used for project control.

While it’s true that modern computer systems involve complex technologies and theories, their use is becoming easier all the time. Computers have a general-purpose nature which makes them endless versatile. They can be applied to a wide range of activities, and increasingly their tasks have an intelligent nature. Today, computers can compose tunes and write songs; they can write short stories and poems; they can outstand human games-players, physicians, mathematicians and chemical analysis; and they are used libraries and institutions.\n\n          In its broadest meaning, a computer is an electronic device which has the ability to accept data (input) from an input device, process it in accordance with a pre-defined program to produce a useful result (output) which is finally transferred to an output device. It can store processed information. We use the computer mainly for speed, accuracy and volume. Computers can perform millions of calculations in one second. In fact, some computers can perform more operations in one hour than we could perform in a life time using pencil and paper, it operates at electronic speed. Another useful feature of the computer is its ability to produce accurate results. Computer is capable of storing large amount of data and handles large amount of work.\n\n          Today, computers are used in different specification (areas). In Nigerian, and in our high institutions one of such institutions is Madonna University Okija in Anambra State. The university was established in 1998. It is owned and controlled by Revered Fr. Emmanuel Edeh.\n\n          The university is located on a piece of land about one and half kilometers off Okija Main-Market, along Onitsha Express Road.\n\n          Currently, the university admitted up to ten thousand students. The institution has employment capacity of five hundred, which is composed of senior, and junior lectures both Professors, BSc, B.Tech and MSc holders most of them are God fearing lecturer.\n\n          It is estimated that the university produce about One thousand graduates yearly.\n\n          In 2002, the university was awarded from National Universities Commission –Abuja due to their work well doing. The institution was awarded with overall certificate and five million naira.\n\n          In the year 2003, the overall students population stood at about five thousands students. Recently, the statistical number of students in Madonna University Okija-is Seven thousand students. \n\n          The design phase was carried out after some relevant feasibility studies and followed by detailed investigative studies of the Madonna University Okija- Anambara admission processing system. \n\n          Certain salient factors in the past, which related to the research problem under investigation, are: \n\n          (a)      Processing of student files manually\n\n          (b)     Inadequate of computer operators; (staff) in the university.\n\n          (c)      Keeping of students file manually;\n\n          (d)     Difficulties in accessing student’s admission files.\n\n          The table below shows the total of admitted and graduate students in the university from 1998 to 2004.\n\n      YEAR\n\n        MALE\n\n     FEMALE\n\n      TOTAL\n\n1998\n\n200\n\n78\n\n278\n\n1999\n\n200\n\n280\n\n489\n\n2000\n\n420\n\n300\n\n720\n\n2001\n\n500\n\n480\n\n980\n\n2002\n\n520\n\n600\n\n1120\n\n2003\n\n677\n\n1000\n\n1677\n\n2004\n\n1010\n\n990\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n500\n\n540\n\n1040\n\nTOTAL\n\n8,695\n\nThe above table is the total score of student graduated in Madonna University, started from the year of establishment 1998 to 2005.\n\nSOURCE:      RESPONDENTS 2005  \n\n1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS\n\n          First, there is the problem of adopting modern commercial data processing equipments because of inadequately of trained and skilled computer scientists.\n\n          Secondly, there is the problem of raising the initial capital require in buying the basic modern admission processing system-equipment. This is because such equipments are expensive and the school management can not afford such huge sums of money because of their low incomes.\n\n          Thirdly, there is the problem of mismanagement students registration files among the different department/ faculties in the institution.\n\n          Again, the ban on the importation of this admission processing facilities and to pay the computer operators will cost the school management enough money to conduct; because of its expensive and they cannot be adequately provided to the university.\n\n          Furthermore, it is not easy for the school to compile the students registrations files due to inadequate processing facilities such as, monitor, keyboard, mouse, system unit, printer, scanner and photocopy machine.\n\n          Finally, there is the problem of lack of computer science professions, who raid computer as a course.\n\n1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\n          The primary aim of this project is to introduce a computer admission processing system that will replace the manual admission processing system. According Godwin (1999) computers extend human brainpower; they are intelligent amplifiers, which provide new dimension in the time available for creative work. Manpower alliance generates better management of resource and enhances firm project control. Thus facilities saving, improved efficiency productivity and development.\n\n1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY \n\n          The significance of the computerized admission processing system are; time reduction, unlike manual processing. Information can be obtained more quickly accurately, completely and presented in a manner more meaningful for the decision to be made. It enables the institution to store it’s data or information (students) that are being admitted. Computerization of relevant data and their retrieval from the storage media.\n\n          This study is significant in many respects. Instance, its finding will be useful to private and federal universities.\n\n          To start with, it has been stated that one of the objectives of this study is to find out why it is still difficult to transform the manual processing system to computerized system. In doing this, therefore the researcher intends to expose all the problems inherent in the process admission processing. The finding of this record will help the university in formulating an effective policy on admission processing.",

The research sample consisted of 70 students from secondary schools the schools were selected based on their location in the local government area. These include St. Mary dedication school, Oredo Girls college, Immaculate conception college, Edo college, Itohan Girls grammar school, and Iguodala primary school.\n\nThe researcher finds out that, majority of the students have the knowledge of computer science, therefore the teacher as resource personnel should be computer literate to enable them carryout effective teaching.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENT\n\nChapter one: introduction\n\nBackground of the study\n\nStatement of the problem\n\nPurpose of the study\n\nSignificant of the study\n\nResearch questions\n\nScope of the study\n\nDefinition of terms\n\nChapter two: review of related literature\n\nIntroduction\n\nInformation and communication technology\n\nChapter three: methodology and procedure of study\n\nResearch design\n\nPopulation of the study\n\nSampling techniques\n\nResearch instrument\n\nValidity of instrument\n\nMethod of data analysis\n\nChapter four: presentation of data and discussion of results\n\nData analysis\n\nChapter five: summary, conclusion and recommendation\n\nSummary\n\nConclusion\n\nRecommendations\n\nReferences\n\nQuestionnaire\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nBACKGROUND OF STUDY\n\nA computer is an electronic device that can process data. Computer system is capable of accepting input data (unprocessed data), through an input device, store and processed the data and place processed data (information) on the out put device generally called output.\n\n            Some people have always responded to as problem with some types of solutions. The birth of electronic multi media like computer is no exception when barter economy was replaced by monetary economy, the need for number, computation and the keeping of records, become apparent. As early as 300 B.C. number were in use in some parts of the world.\n\n            The concept of number and counting is said to have been initiated or developed by Hardsman who after their animals, returned in the evening they could be accounted for. Later other simple methods such as sticks and stones were also used to count. The first real computations aid, abacus, was developed in China as early as 2600 B.C.. Abacus is still commonly used in the world today.\n\n            In 1614 John Napier, a Scotish mathematician invented the Napier logarithm. In 1768, Galvanic became the first man to identify electro mechanical machine which is used to add stored data.  \n\nIn this age of information and communication technology (ICT) where the world seems to be reduced to a global hamlet, no country desire to be mapped out for the relevant hamlet. Information and communication technology is therefore an indispensable tool for global hamlet. In the context of this research, ICT focused on the enhancement of students’ performance of school subjects through the use of computer aided instruction in computer science. In that case, knowledge and skills acquisition are necessary as a fundamental of ICT. Science education in general and computer science in particular today, demand for teachers capable of teaching the new technology and helping students interpret and repackage information and provide information. Rich environment, for communication to use ICT in the learning environment, there is need for students to have access to multimedia like computer, fax machine, telephone and electronic mail etc. Experts however believe that the educational sector is suffering neglect towards effective access of information (Ofulure 1999). The new communication technology has no distance and boundary and time so that the remotest village in Nigeria has the possibility of trapping a global store of knowledge. This development makes it possible to receive vast amount of information from anywhere in the world in seeds. Although cultural compatibility and the high rate of purchase and maintenances multimedia like computer in developing countries may make the demand for multimedia (computer) in science classroom seems luxury. At the moment, this state of affair may not last for a very long period of time. The use of computer to facilitate learning of computer science within the formal learning and teaching situation will eventually enhance the acceptance of this versatile technology in the developing countries, which are normally dominated by the indigenous technology. All teachers are now expected to make use of ICT to support teaching and learning environment. A few feel uncomfortable if asked to teach in an ICT suite rather than their own laboratory that they will do anything they can do to avoid it or will leave the management of the lesson to the ICT technician or coordinator. Many feel that they could do a better job if the resource were more accessible for the lesson and the scheme of work. Being able to use ICT confidentially at home and as the teacher in charge of the lesson are two different things. Apart from the general classroom management issues, there can also be disconcerting technical differences. The extra demands of simply working on a network can provide a large confident benefit. Many staff and the school network security arrangement can make that aspect of using the internet in lesson require a little more planning. For example, it is useful to be able to write hyper link into a word document to make students directly to relevant website but those may need to work in advance with the ICT technical manager to make sure that useful websites are “book marked” or entered in “favorites” for resource centred organizations who packaged folders for easier access or data. Here, book marked sites with their favorites are directly chained or linked to desire web pages of choice.\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nIn recognition of the significant role of ICT in the technology of the nation, the federal government through the federal ministry of education introduced multi media students in unity schools. In 1990 (Borishade, 2000). The ministry did not stop there, it also organized annual holiday multi media programme for secondary school students in collaboration with some oil companies with a view to making every Nigerian citizen literate. It provide some multimedia for the unity school and produce a syllabus for the secondary school multi media (computer) studies. The national policy on education made provision for multi media (computer) education for junior and senior secondary schools as electives. After one decade of the introduction of the programme, very little result to have been achieved. No examination has been written on multi media (computer) education in JSCE. No wonder Jegede (2002) observed that our society is too slow in the uptake of ICT. Lack of qualified teachers in the area of ICT is a serious impediment to its implementation. Only a few universities in the country such as (OAU, RSUER, ESUT) out of the whole lot offer courses in either computer science or computer engineering. It is only OSUT that gives information and communication technology as a course. Most of the computer science STM teachers in our schools are not computer literates and as such are not able not reflect any respect of ICT in their teaching as they can not give what they do not have. Most of our secondary schools do not have enough multi media (computer) for any meaningful learning to take place, even the available computers do not function. Some multi media are not properly maintained due to lack of fund, lack of qualified technicians and poor maintenance culture which is a serious problem in this country.\n\nPURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe purpose of this study includes:\n\ni.)                  To know the use of multi media in the teaching of computer science.\n\nii.)                To know the meaning of information and communication technology.\n\niii.)               \n\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe result of this study will enable the application of multi media in the field of teaching and learning computer science carefully emphasizes and heighten practical results to support stepwise knowledge building, consolidation and claim of proactive education and development. It has platform for designing both curriculum-related activities and computer-based culture technologies, in terms of helping students on how teachers swing within scientific theory and empirical evidence. This strategy will greatly teaching and learning and hence increase understanding of the use of audio-visual aids which shows diagrammatic representation of processed. It will help students participate in the lesson. It will also help students to alleviate the problem of large class size which typifies computer science class.\n\nRESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1.  Will the multi media (computer) facilitate students to learning in developing countries?\n\n2.  In view of the need to be mindful of cost, will cooperative learning techniques with multi media help in promoting students’ achievement?\n\n3.  What is the level of achievement of Nigerian students when learning is undertaking with the use of the multi media?\n\n4.  Do most SIM teaching lack ICT expertise and could not computers as teaching aids?\n\nSCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\n      The scope of this research work is limited to using multi-media as necessary tool to teaching and learning computer science in some select secondary school in Oredo local government area of Edo state. It covers the problems encountered and the solutions to such problems in the case study.\n\nDEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nJ.S.S.C.E.: Junior Secondary School Certificate Examination.\n\nICT: Information and Communication Technology.\n\nOAU: Obafemi Awolowo University.\n\nRESUT: River State University of Technology.\n\nESUT: Enugu State University of Technology.\n\nOSUT: Oyo State University of Technology.\n\nSTM: Science, Technology and Mathematics.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF STAFF PROMOTION SYSTEM\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1       BACKGROUND OF STUDY\n\nAccording to Thompson (2008), Promotion is the advancement of an employee’s rank or position in an organizational hierarchy system. Promotion may be an employee’s reward for good performance, i.e., positive appraisal. Before a company promotes an employee to a particular position it ensures that the person is able to handle the added responsibilities by screening the employee with interviews and tests and giving them training or on-the-job experience. A promotion can involve advancement in terms of designation, salary and benefits, and in some organizations the type of job activities may change a great deal. The opposite of a promotion is a demotion.\n\nA promotion can involve advancement in terms of designation, salary and benefits, and in some organizations the type of job activities may change a great deal. In many companies and public service organizations, more senior positions have a different title: an analyst who is promoted becomes a “principal analyst”; an economist becomes a “senior economist”; or an associate professor becomes a “full professor”. The amount of salary increase associated with a promotion varies a great deal between industries and sectors, and depending on the what parts of the hierarchical ladder an employee is moving between. In some industries or sectors, there may be only a modest increase in salary for a promotions; in other fields, a promotion may substantially increase an employee’s salary.\n\nThe same is true with benefits and other privileges; in some industries, the promotion only changes the title and salary, and there are no additional benefits or privileges (beyond the psycho-social benefits that may accrue to the individual). In some not-for-profit organizations, the values of the organization or the tightness of funding may result in there being only modest salary increases associated with a promotion. In other industries, especially in private sector companies, a promotion to senior management may carry a number of benefits, such as stock options, a reserved parking space, a corner office with a secretary, and bonus pay for good performance. The degree to which job activities change varies between industries and sectors. In some fields, even after an employee is promoted, they continue to do similar work. For example, a policy analyst in the federal government who is promoted to the post of senior policy analyst will continue to do similar tasks such as writing briefing notes and carrying out policy research. The differences may be in the complexity of the files that the individual is assigned to or in the sensitivity of the issues that they are asked to deal with. In other fields, when an employee is promoted, their work changes substantially. For example, whereas a staff engineer in a civil engineering firm will spend their time doing engineering inspections and working with blueprints, a senior engineer may spend most of their day in meetings with senior managers and reading financial reports. In symphony orchestras, when a musician such as a violinist is promoted to the position of concertmaster, their duties change substantially. As a violin player, the individual played the music as part of the violin section. As a concertmaster, the individual plays solo parts, decides on the bowings and interpretation of the music, and leads the violins during performances. Different organizations grant the hiring and promoting managers different levels of discretion to award promotions. In some parts of the private sector, the senior management has a very high level of discretion to award promotions, and they can promote employees without going through much procedures or formalities such as testing, screening, and interviewing. In the public sector and in academia, there are usually many more checks and balances in place to prevent favoritism or bias. In many Western public service bodies, when a manager wants to promote an employee, they must follow a number of steps, such as advertising the position, accepting applications from qualified candidates, screening and interviewing candidates, and then documenting why they chose a particular candidate. In academia, a similar approach is used, with the added safeguard of including several layers of committee review of the proposed promotion using committees which include members of other faculty and experts from other universities.\n\nIn Cross River University of Technology (CRUTECH), promotion is done annually and commences in April. All department heads submits a comprehensive assessment of the teaching administrative abilities of each staff which includes result of students’ evaluation. Staffs are considered for promotion if they have spent up to about three years.\n\nThere is no computerised system which takes in the criteria for promotion in CRUTECH to determined if a staff is fit for promotion or not. All promotion documents are computed manually and pose a lot of problems when promotion is to be given to staffs. There by there is need for the development of a computerised promotion system so as to eliminate the manual promotion determination methods being presently under taken by CRUTECH.\n\n1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nThe present promotion system of Cross River University of Technology, Calabar is done by manual means, whereby a committee (promotion and appointment committee) is form to consider if a particular staff is reach or satisfied all the promotion criteria. This promotion process takes a whole lot of time in doing these, looking into the promotion criteria and secondly, they is bound to be a bias attitude of the committee to favour their own personal interest or candidate and as such, lot of partial is involve in the manual process and this is a big problem to be tackled\n\n1.3       AIM AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe aim is to design and develop an automated staff promotion software to accomplish the following :\n\n1.  \n\nReduce the bias action of the promotion committee members.\n\n2.   Reduce the long process involve in the conducting interview",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF COMPUTER AIDED CHARTING AND GRAPHIC SYSTEM FOR STATISTICAL PRESENTATION\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nStatistic is scientifically the method of organizing, summarizing presenting and analyzing collected data coupled with the drawing of valid conclusion and reasonable decision.\n\nIn a close view, the term  statistic is used to denote the data themselves or numbers derived from the data such as averaged when speaking of employment statistic, accident any events statistics etc.  After collecting statistics data the investigation has to classify and present them in form that make the important features  of his subject matter easily grasped and integrated. The methods of presenting data are as follows:\n\n(i)           The text method\n\n(ii)          The semi text method\n\n(iii)        The tabulat method\n\n(iv)         Diagrammatic and geographic method\n\nIn this write up we are concentrating on diagrammatic and graphic method which is related to our area of study. The diagrammatic and graphic method of presenting statistical data was introduced in the letter part of the eighteenth century by William Playfair, which consist of using diagrams charts and graphs in presenting data. This entails to readiness and quickly understanding of the  presented data\n\nFortunately, information processing technology made a breakthrough in the invention and development of the computer system. A computer is s machine or electronic devices which stores data, analyze it and produce information as required from the data. The manual presentation of data which involves the using protractors and others in platting of graph, drawing pie charts and others is time consuming and it also create s lot of stress to the investigation which may result to in accurate calculation of the presented data\n\nAs the world grow in to a computer one and manual presentation of statistical data couldn’t help in the accurate calculation of the existing population. But with the introduction of the computer into the statistical world the computerize system present a terrific advantage over manually based system in that they enable the investigator to bring together promptly and accurate result of the population of a particular area \n\nIn Nigeria today, there has been a lot of misconception about the introduction of computer and its antecedent effect. Some had gone as far as saying that the impersonal effect associated with the  application of computers will eventually lead to unemployment, while there is not altogether false, there are those that I think  the introduction of computers in statistical presentation of data is a welcome development that had been log awaited.\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThis project was design due to :\n\n(a)          Inaccurate result always yielded due to manual presentation of data\n\n(b)          Time consuming of manual presentation of statistical data\n\n(c)          To give the investigator total relaxation\n\n(d)          To avoid waste of energy in drawing and plotting of graphs\n\nPUPORSE OF THE STUDY\n\n     This project is used to develop a software that will be used for charting in statistical presentation of data . the programme is designed in such a way that it interacts with the investigator and the investigator will give his own command on how he want the chart to be. The charting can be in :\n\n(i)           Pie method\n\n(ii)          Tabular method\n\n(iii)        Graphic method\n\nThe pie method take the form of pie charts which  is drawn in form of a circle showing part of the total statistical data presented. Pie chart area effective diagram used for presenting data of proportion or percentages of a whole. The tabular method involves the systematic arrangement of facts and figures in series of boxes made up of rows and column, which makes the table easy to read and facilitates quick comparison\n\nThe graphic form can be seen inform of bar charts which is a block diagram in which the length of the bar is proportional to the magnitude under consideration. They are used to show comparative figures in statistical presentation of data, several bars are placed together to facilitate comparison.\n\n AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThis study looks into the difficulties and time consuming, the investigator finds  himself into, the charting for statistical presentation was computerized to reduce most of this difficulties.\n\nThe study is therefore designed to bring into account an overview of the application o computers in the various  service being rendered by t he investigator and how the application of computers has affected the efficiency of statistical presentation\n\nSCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nIn this research work, the only considered difficulty is time consuming encountered by the investigator while carrying out statistical research of the population of a particular area, which gives him a lot of stress in calculating of figures, drawing of charts and a lot of time will be wasted while carrying out the research manually .\n\nBut with the help of computer charting, the difficulties and time consuming will be eliminated.  The survey is restricted to civil servants working with statistical presentation of data in Nigeria.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPUTER BASED STOCK MONITORING SYSTEM\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0       INTRODUCTION\n\n            A stock exchange is an organized market where large and small investors alike but and sell through stock brokers. The stocks and shares of companies and government, agencies stock exchange is an institution that provides the facilities that enables both companies and government to raise long term and medium term funds for the establishment, expansion and development of projects through investors. It is really an organized market for already existing security (bounds, stocks and shares) rather than few new issues. Securities of varying types are traded openly on floor of the exchange and through this means, the institution serve as an efficient vehicle for the allocation of available, capital funds to the diverse uses within an economy.\n\nThe application of the computer technology in stock exchange market is believed to faster a dramatic advancement in the mode of operation of the market since speed, accuracy and efficiency remains the Hallmark of the computer technology more so in the next millennium when the application of the computer in every human endeavour will become a condition sine qua non.\n\n1.1       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\n            In spite of the remarkable progress fostered by the stock exchange institution in relation to the economic and social development of the countries that initiate its services, it’s advancement have been hampered as a result of the following factors which have become the bone of the spanner.\n\n(a)        Paucity of shares to buy on the market and trade in i.e. low volume of securities\n\n(b)        The “buy-bond-hold” attitude of Nigeria investors.  \n\n(c)        Infrastructural deficiencies resulting in delays in obtaining share certificates, dividend warrants e.t.c.\n\n(d)       The low level of public awareness as to the benefits derivable from the operation of the capital market\n\n(e)        Inadequate legal framework. \n\n1.2       PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\n            The relevance of this study is to check the anomaly associated with the stock exchange dealings in Nigeria since it’s institution provided transaction is being carried out by man and recordings of the daily transaction and mode of operation done by him, irregularities are bound to be associated which may be as a result of business share prejudice or even undue manipulation of date in favour of a selfish interest at the expense of the investors or the establishments, which are the primary beneficiaries of the invested, capital funds. If these checks and balances are effectively carried out since the aid of the computer stands better chance of accomplishing that, the stock exchange dealings will prove to the world that it is the best avenue of channeling capital investment which will in turn curb the inflationary possibilities of our economy, finance our recurrent budget benefit and improve the balance of payment position of the country.\n\n1.4       AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\n            The basic aims and objective of this project work are as follows.\n\n1.         To eliminate all forms of fraudulent activities associated with the stock exchange market.\n\n2.         To ensure that timely and accurate information about transactions on the floor gets to the marketers.\n\n3.         To eradicate all the difficulties encountered by recording and storage of data which are being done manually.\n\n4.         To encourage easy access to the information about the market.\n\n5.      To facilitate increment in the volume of shares available in the market by discouraging the share-box attitude of Nigeria investors.\n\n1.4       SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\n            This project work is only limited to operations of the stock market in relation to the services they render to both government establishment and companies by ensuring that the shares within their Jurisdiction are adequately sole to the public who constitution the potential investors in accordance to pre-defined rules and regulation. It also incorporate the effective reallocation of shares from existing shareholders to other interested investors is not left out in this piece of work. It also includes a proper updating of the daily transaction on the floor to keep customers a breast with the development on the floor as a guide against frauds and irregularities.\n\n1.5       CONSTRAINTS\n\n            Life is full of impediments which stand as challenges to every human endeavour thus this project work is not an exception as a number of constraints are associated to it, but it must not be forgotten that without challenges. Changes which give room to great height remain illusive.\n\n            Among a number of eliminations to this are the following:\n\n(i)                     Time:  The time stipulated for the completion of this work is not commensurate to the task capacity as a lot is required to give this work a benefiting look.\n\n(ii)        Finance:         The financial requirement for the successful completion of this project is inadequate.

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF COMUPTERIZED BUSINESS FORECASTING SYSTEM USING REGRESSION ANALYSIS\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1     OVERVIEW OF FORCASTING TECHNIQUES.\n\n          Right from the time life started, till now, man ahs sought to forecast the future. Things that happened before are used to justify what will take place in the future. Most of the times, it becomes true while at other time it facts. The ability to forecast the consequence of actions and events is one of the defining properties of the mind.\n\n          In any business situation, it is necessary to be able to make some predictions about the future in order to make some predictions about the future in order to plan the business operations well-Arriving at such an climate of the future is the purpose of the process of forecasting.\n\n          In the service sector, a forecast of demand for the service being offered is necessary to determine the number of staff that will be sufficient enough for the business and the quantity of raw materials to be bought.\n\n          In the retailing sectors, forecast of sales will be needed to decide staffing levels and also to determine what qualifies of stock should be purchased. Excessive levels of stock tie up working capital and storage space, further expenses can be incurred through such process as theft, insurance and possibly, deterioration. On the other head, inadequate re-order quantities such as high, ordering cost and the inability to meet customers demand.\n\n          Forecasting is simply the scientific name for guessing, what the will bring. There are several standard techniques available for forecasting and each techniques has it’s own assumption, benefits and pitfall.\n\n          This project is concerned with the evaluation of the different forecasting techniques used by Anammco Ltd Emene, Enugu to determine how to manage their business operation.\n\n          Consider the following problems.\n\nProblems 1: A sales manager collects together records of the past sales for particular product how does he find a forecasting techniques that gives good forecasts for this data?\n\n          Problems 2: A member of his staff suggests that a particular method of forecasting. How does the sales manager test this method of forecasting to see if it can yield any solution?\n\n          The ability to find answers to questions such as these is obliviously basic to the whole exercise of practical forecasting. It is necessary for me to know which forecasting techniques is best for any particular problems.\n\n1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS.\n\n          The investigation done revealed that workers manually do the record keeping for forecasting.\n\n          The above manual system is outdated in terms of speed of processing and accuracy. This results into wastage of time and in efficiency in productions.\n\n          These inefficiencies call for the computerization of the operations of the forecast.\n\n1.3    Purpose of study.\n\n          The purpose of this research is to present the different forecasting techniques used by Anammco ltd in manufacturing their cars. It  is however to make analysis based in definite statistical data, which will enable an executive to take advantage of future condition to a greater extent than he could do without them.\n\n1.4    Aims and objectives.\n\n          The objective include the following.\n\nA.      To help the managers and all those interacted in obtaining forecast for practical purposes to be able to make decision on which forecasting techniques to use at different situation.\n\nB.      To demonstrate the different methods which Anammco uses in their business forecast.\n\nC.      To point out that all forecast used by Anammco have errors and that the measurement of the errors is critical.\n\nD.      To help the managers and forecasters to know the internal values of forecalls and the degree of confidence they need to have in the forecast.\n\n1.5    SCOPE OF STUDY.\n\n          This project uses the simple linear repression analysis that concerns itself with just one explanatory variable and a linear form of relationship. The explanatory variable could be time of periods.\n\n          The other forecasting methods are the exponential smoothing and the moving average methods, which are used, should a time series observation exhibits a trend. This exhibition of trend can be verified with a scatter diagram of the observation against observed points.\n\n          Forecast can be made from such models built using methods  above after analysis by the software such forecast most likely will be in the short to medium term range.\n\n          The methods though appear complex is simplified as will be seen in the user friendly  user interfaces. The complex or the multi-variable regression analysis was avoided in this project as well as the logarithm exponential smoothing for the purpose of the project.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF COMPUTERIZED STAFF RECORD SYSTEM\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.1   INTRODUCTION\n\nStaff records department in a firm or in an organization like ours is a department that gathers information regarding staff statistics and condition of service. This information is obtained continually to ensure continuity in staff management.\n\nThe conversional methods of keeping the 0se records are basically the same in higher institutions.\n\nWith so much importance attached to the provision of quality records in this   information age, then the need to follow the trend of information technology (I.T) to speed up and reduce the stress in manual method of keeping records. To achieve this, an object oriented programming language like visual basic 6.0 is used to develop the software.\n\n1.2    BACKGROUND OF STUDY\n\nThe federal polytechnic Nekede Owerri was initially established as a college of technology Owerri by edict No.16 dated 1st April, 1978. In 1987 it was renamed, the polytechnic by the Imo state government.\n\nThe institution was taken over by the federal government in April 1993 and is now governed by the federal polytechnic act to perform the following functions:\n\n  a)  To provide full- time or part –time courses of instruction and         training:\n\nOn such other fields of applied science, commerce   and management, and\nOn such other fields of applied learning relevant to the needs of the development of Nigeria in the area of industrial and agricultural\nproduction and distribution and for research in the development and adaptation of techniques as the council may from time to time determine:\nb)    To arrange conference, seminars and study groups relative to the   fields of learning specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection (1):\n\nc)       To perform such function as in the opinion of the council may serve to promote the objectives of the polytechnic.\n\nAt the early stage of this institution staff was few, therefore making the retrieval of information from files very easy. At this early stage, updating staff files was an easy task.  The management on any of the department could go through all folders to make out staff list, compile all the staff salary for a given period of time and it was very easy to monitor the efficiency of each staff.\n\nToday the numbers of staff have increased tremendously which makes it a bit difficult to update the records of staff. Because of this constrain the reason for user application software that could implement all these at the click of a button.\n\nSTATEMENT OF PROBLEM\nInstitutions, organizations and banks in Nigeria at the earlier stages of their inception have been manually operated. That is, records are organized, accessed, and retrieved by human beings manually. This manual method made the whole thing very difficult to handle.\n\nWith the increase in staff in our institution, the above method has been proven very difficult and tedious to work upon. The problems faced here are:\n\nPoor statistics about a particular staff: this may be as a result of lost or misplaced staff files\nLonger Waiting Time: The record clerk wastes so much time in bringing a staff folders. In case the management needs the record for a particular staff, it takes the clerk time to manually organize the data and bring it to the destination where it is needed. Thereby contributing to time wastage.\nInaccurate Staff Report: Sometimes staff report are not properly stated and reported. This results to questionable report being sent to management for planning.\nMishandling of Staff Folders: Staff folders are often handled with little or no regard. This leads to detaching and tearing away of some of the staff important documents.\nUnrestricted Access To Staff Records: Due to poor security checks in most institutions, staff records which are main to be confidential are exposed to unauthorized persons.\nThese and more contribute to inefficient records keeping.\n\nOBJECTIVE OF STUDY\nThe purpose of this project work is to develop an automated staff record system that could speed up records job efficiently and effectively, and also reduce the cost of labour.\n\nUp-To-Date RECORDS OF STAFF ARE KEPT: This allows for easy retrieval of staff files when the need arises. Staff data are kept up-to-date so as to enhance the assessment of the staff both for future, present and past records.\n\nThis can also be used for staff appraisal and also help to monitor the conduct of the staff at a glance through the records. By viewing the database, vital information for planning, staff equipment and the welfare of the institution is obtained thus improving resources allocation.\n\nStaff records are stored by the system: This will eliminate the problem of lost files thereby improving record services tendered   by the records department.\n\nIn a networked environment, terminals or workstation should be present only at the records room and the personnel or administration manager’s office. The software should include security checks to prevent unauthorized access to confidential records of a staff stored in the system’s database. The software would be menu-driven to provide a user-friendly environment\n\n1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY\n\nThis work serves as a launching pad for federal polytechnic Nekede Owerri to enhance the recording system by computerization of their record system.\n\nThis project work is breaking new grounds in the area of computerization of staff record system; it will serve as a stepping-stone for student researchers and her interested explorer in this field.\n\nThough this software is designed using Federal Polytechnic Owerri as a case study any other institution or firm can use the software with just a little modification.\n\n1.6   SCOPE OF STUDY\n\nThe extent to be covered in this project work is, this work creates a database for the staff record system for federal polytechnic Nekede. This project work is going to cover the staff form, arrival report form and annual leave form. With the system on the network the personnel director can view the staff record at a glance, which will help him to know the number of work force he has. It will help him know the number of staff in each department and the department that needs more or less staff.",

It is also entrusted with the task of issuing international traveling passport to eligible Nigerians.\n\n            This study focused on the review of the manual mode of operations at some of the sections, namely the control section, the administration and passport section with a view to computerize their activities.\n\nA computerized information system has been developed to facilitate storage and retrieval of information.\n\n            Furthermore the adequate keeping of records of immigrants entering or leaving Nigeria and finally prints of the individuals involve are the provisional offers of the computerized system.\n\n            All these measures are geared towards improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the immigration department.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe unity and mutual understanding reigning amongst the countries of the world today has encourage the free movement of people all over the world. Such people visits countries of their choice based on their interest many people travel to other countries for business transaction, tourism, education, diplomatic and political purpose and other miscellaneous reasons.\n\nDespite the understanding existing amongst countries, intending visitors to any country are expected to have sought the mandate of the government of that country through the embassy or accredited representatives of the country based on his/her own country.\n\n            The immigration department therefore, is the official government agency responsible for taking care of the interest of intending immigrants or immigrants already residing in the country for monitoring and regulating the entry and exit of immigration into or out of their country.\n\n            The immigration Department in Nigeria established after the promulgation of the immigration act in 1963 are responsible for examining and interrogating any person wishing to enter or leave Nigeria through air, sea or land, moreso, the person’s baggage are searched to identify what he/she is travelling with.\n\nThe control section in the in the immigration department is saddled with the task of approving signed documents for travelling. The administration section deals with the documenting, processing and storage of traveler’s document for future references. The passport in the immigration department is saddled with the task of passport photographs. Filling of the acquired forms and forwarding of the forms to the control section where it will be approved and sign.\n\nThe design of an immigration information system involves a situation whereby all the activities and procedures carried out before an immigrant/emigrant will be credited is processed with the aid of the computer it requires a computer statement of immigration program since the computer can do virtually nothing without a workable computer program. The program contains all the immigration form by a particular immigrant/emigrant.\n\nSTATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\n            From the inception of organisation, emphasizing on a particular department in the organisation the immigration has been engaging or encountering enormous problem running their daily activities in producing the travelling document for the immigrants/emigrants.\n\n            The glaring disadvantages of the manual approach of processing immigration document and some of problems it posses and underlets:\n\n1.      It takes a long time in accessing record in manual system that is in filling cabinet.\n\n2.      Detection of errors and faults on forms.\n\n3.      The fact that records are stored on paper makes it easily accessible for vandalization by unauthorized persons.\n\n4.      Untimely inefficient and inaccurate processing of data and handling of immigrant record by the immigrant officers.\n\nPURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis project is geared towards eradication of all the deformities and loopholes of the manual method of processing immigration requirement. This developing a new system to handle all the jobs/work involves in immigration electronically. Supplying all the deficiencies of the existing system.\n\nConsequent upon the elimination of the deficiencies and edifying of the deformities encountered in the existing system. Over shadowing its operational incapacitation by developing a computer based, solution of storing information and processing of immigrant’s form\n\n            Furthermore, since the immigrations department has been manually functioning ever since it was promoted and established in1963, many people are wondering whether the design of a computerized immigration information system has any impact to their mode of operation. The outcome of these study will be useful to immigration department in general. The study will go along way in highlighting the procedures of the immigration information system been computerized thereby minimizing or eliminating any form of disfunctional or unwanted particulars. The eradication of the problem of traditional method and the implementation of the system will encourage the user’s to work for organisation because it reduces stress of work.\n\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe aim of this project is to work towards the elimination of ineffective mode of operation. It centered on the user to having conductive atmosphere for work thereby minimizing stress and further aimed as a means of safe guarding information, which will serve as reference for making management decision, it is also aimed at accurate and timely processing of immigration forms.\n\n            The objective from the initiator of the proposal is geared towards combating all the aims and the problems being discovered on the existing system. Finding out the requirement needed to build the new system, the type of database  to be produced to suit the comfortability of the user  of the software; would it be based on the sequential or random or index mode of operation.\n\nSCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe scope of this project work covers all the activities of immigration in Nigeria using the Federal Secretariat Enugu as a case study. iT will keep adequate records of immigrants entering or leaving Nigeria and hold a data bank of passport holders.",

In as much as motor vehicle registration has been in existent for ages now, the old system of registration has been in adoption which did not play a significant role on highway safety until the development of the new system of vehicle registration where a reflective sheeting which is more visible to read even in the dark.\n\n            This new system of motor vehicle registration which is the main focus of this project came into existent on the 19th March 1997 and handled by the motor licensing officer. It introduced to enforce strict compliance to traffic rules and regulation as well as providing a proper data as to the behaviour of road users. The roles which the introduction of computer system will play in the function in order to bring about more efficiency, effectiveness and improve competence and discussed in this project. This work is segmented into chapters which will be seen as we move on.\n\n            Motor vehicle registration is done by two offices, namely local government licensing offices for personal vehicles and the cabinet office or any military office. Since motor vehicle registration is absolutely essential traffic matters, it is vital to establish and sustain an information system using a reliable device like computer system in order to maintain and provide proper data/record concerning the road users in the aspect of traffic function.\n\n            In order to eliminate most hardship encountered in most of our licensing offices, the need for computerization with designing and implementation of a state motor vehicle registration and its advantages to the licensing office.\n\nSTATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\n            These are the problems that are being encountered in the manual system of vehicle registration. And the problems goes thus:\n\n(i)         PARTICIPATION OF UNAUTHORIZED OFFICERS\n\nUnauthorized offices according to my observation are involved in this work especially in the registration of illegal vehicles which can encourage fraud.\n\n(ii)        WRONG CHARGING OF FEES\n\nThe officer in-charge is bound to charge a wrong bill to vehicle owners which may be as a result of underassessment or over assessment of vehicles. This could be with motive to commit fraud or as a result of mistake on the part of the officer at work.\n\n(iii)       WRONG SALES ALLOCATION\n\nStaff under a particular state motor vehicle licensing office indulge in registering of vehicles that does not belong to their state.\n\n(iv)       IMPROPER ACCOUNTING\n\nThere is the tendency of the cashier involved in the handling of income generated to make mistake during this process, thus having some measures of inaccuracy in the work.\n\n(v)        There is difficulty at times in tracing a record/information cautioning a vehicle owner due to improper information keeping as a result of carelessness or volume in the size of record kept.\n\n1.2       PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\n            The purpose of this study is to design and implement a state motor vehicle registration since it is important in providing sanity on roads and yielding revenue for the government. In as much as this problems still exists in the manual operation, we intend to carve out a technique which will serve as means of providing solution to the problems\n\n1.3       AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\n            As we have seen from the statement of the problems, the things that stands as puzzle in the manual system of motor vehicle registration aims at introducing a better system which is the computerized system which will contribute on providing solution to the problems.\n\ni.          AUTOMATIC ASSIGNING OF FEES\n\nSince each vehicle is charged based on the amount was bought. This work aims at automatic assigning of correct amount once the above mentioned assessment is done thus preventing the error of wrong assessment.\n\nii.         PROPER ACCOUNTING\n\nThis also aims at giving an up-to-date report of the revenue generate from vehicle registration within a defined period.\n\niii.        RESTRICTION OF ILLEGAL ACCESS\n\nThe told number of users that will have access to this program will be limited therefore password will be created for the application software. This password will just be limited to the officer in charge of the work.\n\niv.        EASY RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION\n\nThis work will help on using the registration of a particular vehicle to call up the information record concerning the owner of the vehicle.\n\n1.4       SCOPE OF STUDY\n\n            Motor vehicle registration since it is two different offices namely local government motor licensing office and cabinet office, and having used motor licensing office Enugu South as my case study which is only involves in registering of personal vehicle just like any other local government. Motor licensing office (L.G.M.L.D) I limited my studies to private vehicles within Enugu.",

Vital information is the life wire or backbone of any organization. From sports statistics to the latest stock market price such facts keep people abreast of time.\n\n          Computing, printing, photography and some recording are all forms of automatic information processing.\n\nIn all of these processed , the information as perceived by man, is captured, processed, transmitted and stored.\n\nFinally it is reproduced in a form which can be easily understood by man.\n\n          Next, there is a need to store the information so that it can be referenced when necessary . computers are unrivalled in their capacity to store data. Therein lies the importance of application software which configure the computer to act as an intelligent typewriter or entrepreneur, so long as the correct command are given.\n\n          A database is one of the most acceptable business software application today. It is a collection of related information that is organized for case of reference.\n\nThis means that one could maintain a database on paper, stored in file holders that were kept in file cabinets.\n\nThat was the case before the advent of computers. File had to be pulled out of cabinets, forms filled and paper shuffled.\n\n          This project describe how all these could be done electronically. It shows how information could be stored, modified and recalled instantly and accurately.\n\nInformation on staff of the establishment of case study is maintained, reports are lodged in and more reports are generated from these.    \n\nORGANIZATION OF WORK\n\n          The project is made up of two section namely the write up and the program section. The write up section is made up of seven chapter each chapter with its sub-headings. Chapter one dealt with the problems, purpose, objective, scope constrains assumptions and definitions of terms used in the project. Chapter two talks about the literature review on the topic of the project chapter three discussed the existing system its problems, input, output and processing procedures.

The main function of this department is to secure the labs and the properties that belongs to this institution. They also settle some problems in between the student and the staff. Eg streting of life and other things. The security department, I.M.T Enugu (S D I E) started in this institution in 1977. in security department, there was a thing they called “ABEEAT ”. BEEAT is an area given to the security man to look after it, during the working hour, to see if there will be any problem around. They also have a communication system, such as telephone, working talking, radio message etc.\n\nThis project ray emphasis on the security department (SOLT) of I.M.T. the security is one of the department under the function called health safety and environment East (HSEE). The main function of this department is to project assets in terms of lives and project.\n\n1.1    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS \n\nSecurity of data or information in many establishment is becoming a sources of concern to the management of the establishment due to problems normally encountered in each department of an organization, security its human, individual data, information and resources and its complexity and duplications some organizations prefer having a security department where all the information’s about human and material resources are put into a data bank which allows for easier access and retrieval of information. However, due to large number of processes that goes on in the manual operation and loss of information associated with it, it therefore becomes necessary to automate the activities of the security department.\n\n1.2    PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT\n\n          Security department, IMT Enugu (SDIE) is the secure with many departments. One of such department is the security department although the operation of all this departments have not be computerized but security been vital to the development of I.M.T Enugu needs to be computerized at all cost. A continued manual operation of the security department of I.M.T Enugu will endanger or put the operation  of IMT in jeopardy, hence the purpose of this project is to automate the operation of the security department in order to ensure good co-ordinations.\n\n1.3    OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT\n\n          Inspite of the larges of I.M.T, the level of automation and computing done there, it may be a little surprising to discover that there are some areas where computing is still at the grassroots level. An one of such is the security department (SDIE0).\n\n          SDIE is very crucial and sensitive. Its importance cannot be over emphasized. It required a certain degree of projection and secrecy, especially of vital information. These cannot be realized in their current system of operation, which is all manual. The aim of this project is to develop a computer software which will maintain a database for the operation of SIDE. It will also provide procedure for the management of other security related information.\n\n1.4       PROJECT SCOPE\n\nThe scope of this project depends on the available facilities and resources  both human and material. The project will cover two broad aspects, those of staff and security information within the limit of available facilities and information given by the IMT staff.\n\n1.5    MAJOR SOFTWARE FUNCTIONS\n\n          This project will cover two broad area of security department.\n\n1.6    STAFF INFORMATION\n\n          This should feature all pertinent information such as the staff name, the staff employment number, residential address, gender (male or female) etc. which might be useful in staff administration.\n\n2.      SECURITY INFORMATION\n\n          This should have facilities for lodging field reports into the system. periodic reports can be generated at intervals, from these. Moreso, other security information can be obtained from this areas. The software will also incorporate  a facility for file maintenance, operations which would be used to update and modify the records whenever necessary.",

This is because computers are everywhere, whirring and whizzing their electronic ways into cars, homes, offices, schools and business activities.\n\nWhen this machine was first developed, the only people who could operate them were highly trained engineers and scientist to unscramble the genetic code, but these days almost everybody operates computers as a part of daily life activities. Of course many people may not necessary think about the fact that are operating computer as they make adjustment to their digital watches. This tells us that it is important to make computer as easy to make use as possible since so many people now happen to operate this machine that its use seem limitless.\n\nNumbers are usually assign symbols by which ideas they represent are coded and the numbers of digits used to code number in any base is equal to the base, but the conversion of numbers from one base to another appear to be difficult with respect to time wasted in trying to calculate especially when dealing with large numbers, that makes its so boring by the time your thinking ability is involved.\n\nThe advent and the introduction of computer machine has brought an aid to help surmount these problems with the use of a given command.\n\nA computer operator can not just start operating on a computer without having a little ideas of what he/she wants to carry out on the computer before a computer should carry out any structure given, you must apply a command before that task can be executed on.\n\nIt takes just a brief introduction of a command for a new user to become familiar with these computer, since it constitutes of a language in which the use user in communicates with the computer.\n\nThe interactions between the computer and the user is what we called a computer interface the term computer interface is meant to cover all aspect of these interaction not just the hardware.  The primary purpose of the computer interface is to enable full communication between the user and the computer system.\n\n1.1    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS\n\n          Some given problems we have to know about in the aspect of a command driven interface are listed below:\n\n1.           Can a given problem be programmed to convert number fro one base to another with the use of a command driven interface?\n\n2.           can the introduction of the command driver interface in the aspect of number base conversion eliminate\n\n1.2       THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study happens to be very important since its purpose and objectives of carrying research on these study and analysis are to:\n\ni.        to design and develop a system that will be more effective in carrying out the operation of base conversion primarily.\n\nii.       to ascertain whether the existing system is adequate.\n\niii.          It will also highlight inadequacies, if any and determine ways through which application packages can minimize or eliminate the established problem.\n\n1.3       SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nSince different conversions exist in curriculum and test this study concentrates on command driven interface with respect to number base conversion.\n\nThe study is restricted to number base ten, base five, base six, base seven, base eight, base nine and base sixteen also a reserve conversion back to base ten.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPUTERIZED INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR A HUMAN RIGHT BASED ORGANISATION\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0     INTRODUCTION\n\nThe word “right” is derived from the Latin word sector which in the noun form means that to which “person has just and valid claims, whether it be land, a thing or privilege of doing something or saving something.  We have what is called a legal right, which is either the liberty 9protected by law) of acting or abstaining from acting in a specific manner or the power (enforced by law) of compelling a specific person to do or abstain from doing a particular thing.  A legal right is thus the capacity sending in one man or a group of man or controlling with the assert and the assistance of the state the actions of others.  “Human” has been defined as pertaining to characteristics of or having the nature of mankind.\n\n          Morals and interest in any human being is simply because of his/her humanity.  The birth right of all mankind.  The expression “human right” in its wildest connotation embarrasses those civil, political, economic, social, cultural, group, solidarity and developmental right which we considered indispensable to meaningful human existence.\n\n          The Nigeria National Human Right Development Commission was created by a military decree promulgated by the Military Government of General Sani Abacha with the announcement of the latrest in a socials of programs for transaction from military to civilian rule (replacing the transition aborted by the annulment of June 12 1993 election) and was clearly designed as an attempt to head of off international critism of continued military rule in general and repressive policies of the Abacha’s government in particular.\n\n          Following the death of general Abacha in June 1998 his successor General Abdusalami Abubakar scrapped the General Abacha transition program and instituted a new one under condition of operation openness.  As a part of the program a new constitution was drafted by a panel set by General Abubakar with new limited public consultation.  Although the organisation had lobbied for its status to be entrenched in the constitution, this did not take place.  The new constitution came in existence on May 20, 1999.  following election late 1991 and early 1999,  According to the military decree, establishing the human right commission is deemed like similar decrease to be an act of the new national assembly.\n\n1.1     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe issues of human right in Nigeria have been a hidden matter right from the first republic.  People in the country do not know their right because these right are outlined in a very voluminous document hence, populace cannot reach them.  The task is too manual and tedious to cover.  The tedious nature and the denial of these documents call for the improvement in the system of presentation of the human right as outlined in the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria.\n\n1.2     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nAs far as Nigeria is concerned, her citizen find it very difficult to know their right in general due to lack of poor documentation via people’s right and problems encountered so far.  Therefore the purpose of this work is for every retrieval and viewing of well documented information on peoples right Human right especially in Nigeria to the populace at any station as far as you get in touch with the internet.\n\n1.3     AIMS AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe main aim of this project work is to begin a fully computerized web-site.  For human right development of and monitory in Nigeria that will ensure\n\n-                     The education of the populace with respect to their right\n\n-                     The exposure of the arbitrary violation of the human right in Nigeria by individual groups or organization and the government at any level.\n\n-                     Accessing immediate ad remote causes of nay swaying crisis with the country and making meaningful contribution that will proper solution to the problem.\n\n-                      \n\n1.4     SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis project work covers the development of human right in Nigeria.  The rate of degrading of the human dignity both in the military and civilian administration since the inception of the first republic was converted.\n\n1.5     CONSTRAINTS\n\nTime was the major limitation that tried to obstruct the smoothness of this research study.  There was limited time to effectively combine the research work with class study.  Which led to the utilization of leisure time to be able to complete this work and moreover financial problem.\n\n1.6     ASSUMPTION\n\nIt is assumed that the implementation of the web-site for human right monitoring in Nigeria will rapidly improve the standard of the human right status in Nigeria.",

RESOURCE ALLOCATION SYSTEM IN A DYNAMIC /VARIABLE RESOURCE UTILIZATION ENVIRONMENT\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0     INTRODUCTION\n\nThere have been considerable activity recently aimed at developing a computing grid – which can be defined as a distributed system on an internet scale that supports collaboration, data sharing, resource sharing across disparate domains and platforms\n\n1.       To enable the submission of jobs to remote sites in a transparent fashion, technologies such as generic dyterm of describing John and defining service level agreements, relating issues such as security, poyomance and quality of service.\n\n2        A resource management system offers facilities that collectively allow users to run John on the pool of computational resources it manages. The pool may be made up of donated resources not being used by their owners at a given time, on resources allocated to the poll on a full-time basis. The lay out of more resource management system (RMS) the involves a central manager that monitors the state of all the machines  in its pool allocates submitted Jobs to resources using scheduling algonthins and holds gueves of Jobs.

        "content": "INTEGRATED STUDY ON THE USE OF A COMPUTER-BASED RESULT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (CBRMIS)\n\n\n CHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0             INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nCaritas University, Amorji Nike, Enugu, is a private University approved by the Federal Government of Nigeria on December 16 2004. It was officially opened on January 21, 2005 by the Federal Ministry for Education, Prof. Fabian Osuji. The formal opening was on January 31, 2005. The pioneer students of 250 matriculated on May 28, 2005 in beautiful ceremony that attracted dignitaries both church and state. It is the second Catholic University in Nigeria founded by Rev. Fr. Prof. Emmanuel Paul Mathew Edeh Cssp, OFR. Although he founded the school, the proprietor of the University is the Congregation of Sisters the Saviour, a religious Congregation of Nuns founded by him.\n\nThe vision of Caritas University is to rescue some of our wandering and teaming youths from further slide into academic and moral decay, and development and transformation of our society through sound and adulterated education. Its mission is to discover, sanctify and apply the knowledge of science, environmental and engineering for human well-being and sound development of man for better society.\n\nCaritas University’s goal is to give efficacy to the University’s motto and to its philosophy of education. We embrace not only sound education for professional skills and competency in various fields; but also maintain strict discipline. We train the mind, body, soul and spirit in the exercise of obedience and self control. The students must not only be intellectually and professionally prepared for different tasks and roles in the world, they must also be morally equipped to face the world itself with all its tensions, conflicts, challenges and contradictions. We achieve this with the help of God Almighty who is with us always.\n\nThe philosophy is to promote sound education for professional skills and competencies in various fields with strict discipline. By discipline the University meant the training of the mind, body and soul and spirit to obedience and self control. Also to prepare the students to be intellectually and professionally sound for different tasks and roles in the word with its tensions, conflicts, challenges and contradictions.\n\nThe University operates faculty system. Presently, the University operates six faculties: Education and Arts, Engineering, Environmental Sciences, Management, Social Sciences and Natural Sciences.\n\n1.2     DEFINITION\n\nA Computer-Based Result Management Information System (CBRMIS) is a set of\nsoftware programs\nthat  is designed to control the\ninstitution’s\n(practically using CARITAS UNIVERSITY),\nstorage\n, management, and\nretrieval\nof\ndata\n(RESULT) in a\ndatabase\n. CBRMISs are categorized according to their data structures or types. The CBRMIS accepts requests for data from an application program and instructs the\noperating system\nto transfer the appropriate data. The\nqueries\nand responses must be submitted and received according to a format that conforms to one or more applicable protocols. When a CBRMIS is used,\ninformation systems\ncan be changed much more easily as the organization's information requirements change. Use of manual imputation of result is discarded and new categories of data can be added to the database so easily without disruption to the existing system.\n\nA database management system provides the ability for many different users to share data and process resources. But as there can be many different users, there are many different database needs. The question now is: How can a single, unified database meet the differing requirement of so many users?\n\nAs this study entails using a different form of database management in connection with organizational result computation and assessment. This brings about the use of computer-based result management information system (CBRMIS).\n\nBefore the database management approach, the institution relied on the manual method of data processing and storage. Each file was specialized to be used with a specific application. Needless to say, file processing was bulky, costly and nonflexible when it came to supplying needed data accurately and promptly.\n\nThis study therefore, examines clearly the effect of the computer-based result management information system (CBRMIS) towards the development of CARITAS UNIVERSITY.\n\n  1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nSince this study is specifically to use the physical view  to make efficient use of storage and processing resources, therefore, the objective of this study includes the following;\n\n1.     To help in facilitating generation of ad hoc query.\n\n2.     To ensure reliability and transparency in the creation and computation of results\n\n3.     To present a platform for assessment of the performance of the students and workers in other to help develop enabling policy for academic quality and standard.\n\n4.     To prevent unauthorized access or mutilation of the results of the students thereby maintaining data integrity.\n\n5.     To help the users of the result database software (RDS) to manage the overall database environment by providing facilities for backup and recovery, security management, query optimization, concurrency control, and change management.\n\n1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe significance of this study is to examine closely the advantage of this result application to the benefit of Caritas University and the entire community.\n\n1.     It will serve as a reference material to those who use this project material.\n\n2.     It is a contribution to knowledge\n\n3.     It will provide information to other researchers/developers on how best and beneficial the use of a management information system can be in providing accurate information for an organization’s decision making.\n\n4.     It will ensure high level quality service development of the management which will ensure that students are not subjected to undue suffering in collection of their transcript or clearance prior to the deployment for youth service.\n\n 1.5     SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe scope of this study is an integrated study on the use of a Computer-based Result Management Information System (CBRMIS) a case of Caritas University.\n\n1.6     LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nRealizing the financial and time constraints usually associated with students in project of this nature, there is no research carried out that does not experience some difficulties. This work is no exception; the following factors posed serious limitations to the research work.\n\nFinancial constraints: a study like this nature is expected to be carried out on a broader base but because of lack of funds required, some function and programs could not be applied.\n\nTime constraint: in the course of the study, time posed a serious problem in carrying out the test. The duration given for the conduct of this study was short.\n\nNon-availability of materials: during the course of this research, there were non-availability of some critical documents and materials which were classified as confidential.\n\nNon-availability of Exit: because of the nature of the school as a private university, Permission to go out was not always granted and this posed a serious problem towards the actualization of this goal.\n\n1.7     DEFINITION OF TERMS/VARIABLES\n\nManagement: Management is a human action, including design, to facilitate the production of useful outcomes from a system.\n\nProcessing: To deal with somebody or something according to an established procedure\n\nSystem: a set of computer components i.e. in assembly of Computer hardware, software and peripherals functioning together.\n\nAutomation: the replacement of human workers by technology; a system in which a workplace or processes has been converted to one that replaced or ministries human labour with electronic or mechanical equipment.\n\nInformation: Data that has been worked upon and processed.\n\nDatabase: a systematically arranged collection of data, designed so that it can be automatically retrieved or manipulated  easily by authorized users.\n\nDatabase servers:\nDatabase servers\nare computers that hold the actual databases and run only the DBMS and related software.\n\nData structure:\nData structures\n(fields, records, files and objects) optimized to deal with very large amounts of data stored on a      \npermanent\ndata storage device\n(which implies relatively slow access\ncompared\nto\nvolatile main memory\n).\n\nData security:\nData security\nprevents unauthorized users from viewing or updating the database by the use of passwords.\n\nData consistency: Data consistency ensures a consistent view of data to every user.\n\nPassword: this is a secret code that a user must type into a computer to enable He/she access it or its applications.

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPUTERIZED RESULT PROCESSING AND TRANSCRIPT GENERATING SYSTEM (A CASE STUDY OF CARITAS UNIVERSITY)\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\nThere were three fundamentally distinct education systems in Nigeria in 1990.  The indigenous system, Quranic Schools and formal Europeanstyle education institutions.  In the rural areas where the majority lived, children learned the skills of farming and other work, as well as the duties of adulthood, from participation in the community, this process was of ten supplemented by age based schools in which groups of young boys were instructed in community responsibilities by mature men.  By the 1970s, education experts were asking how the system could be integrated into the more formal schooling of the young, but the question remained unresolved by 1990.\n\nWestern-style education came to Nigeria with the missionaries in the mid-Nineteenth century.  Although the first mission school was founded in 1843 by Methodists, it was the Anglican Church missionary society that pushed forward in the early 1850s to found a chain of missions and schools.  Followed quickly in the late 1850s by the Roman Catholics in 1887 in what is now Southern Nigeria, an education department was founded that began setting curricum requirement and administered grants to the mission societies.  By 1914, when North and South were\n\nUnited into one colony, there were fifty-nine government and ninety-one mission primary schools in the South; all eleven secondary schools, except for king’s college in Lagos, work run by the missions.\n\nThe education system focused strongly on examinations. In 1916 Fredrick Lugard, first governor of the Unified Colony, set up a school inspectorate.  Discipline, building and adequacy of teaching staff were to be inspected, but the most points given to a school’s performance went to the numbers and ranking of it’s examinations results.  This stress on examination was still used in 1990 to judge educational results and to obtain qualification for jobs in government and the private sector. As more information is made available in a variety of formats and media and in a variety of locations, the need to manage information/data efficiently becomes more and more critical.  Both staff and public users want access to stored information and want to access it more efficiently.  It is the university policy to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of result processing operations (student record/grades), and services through the implementation of A computerized transcript management system.\n\n1.1 Background of the study\n\nCaritas university, Amorji Nike, Enugu, is a private university approved by the federal government of Nigeria on December 16, 2004.  it was officially opened on January 21, 2005 by the Federal Ministry for Education, Prof. Fabian Osuji, the formal opening was on January 31, 2005.  The pioneer students of 250 matriculated on May 28, 2005 in beautiful ceremony that attracted dignitaries both church and state.  It is the second Catholic University in Nigeria founded by Rev. Fr. Prof. Emmanuel Paul Matthew Edeh CSSP, OFR.  Although he founded the\n\nschool, the proprietor of the University is the congregation of sisters, the Saviour, a religious congregation of Nums founded by him.\n\nThe vision of Caritas university is to reserve some of our wandering and teaming youth from further slide into academic and moral decay, and development and transformation of our society through sound and adulterated education.  It’s mission is to discover, sanctify and apply the knowledge of science, environment central and engineering for human well-being and sound development of man for better society.\n\nCaritas university’s goal is to give efficacy to the university’s motto and to it’s philosophy of education.  We embrace not only sound education for professional skills and competency in various fields; but also maintain strict discipline.  We train the mind, body, soul and spirit in the exercise of obedience and self control.  The students must not only be\n\nintellectually and professionally prepared for different tasks and roles in the world, they must also be morally equipped to face the world itself with all its tensions, conflicts, challenges and contradictions, we achieve this with the help of God Almighty who is with us always.\n\nThe philosophy is to promote sound education for professional skills and competencies in various fields with strict discipline.  By discipline the university meant the training of the mind, body and soul and spirit to obedience and self control.  Also to prepare the students to be intellectually and professionally sound for different tasks and roles in the word with its tensions, conflict, challenges and contradictions.\n\nThe university operates faculty system.  Presently, the university operates six faculties.  Education and Arts, Engineering, Environmental\n\nSciences, Management, Social Sciences and Natural Sciences.\n\n1.2 Statement of Problem\n\nThis project research was conducted exclusively conducted in a caritas university located in a highly populated area that attends to too many students at a time, hence this research was able to track problem such as misplacement of student records, student’s grades, slow and strenuous accessibility to students report and record, inaccurate record keeping and poor information management within the schools.\n\n1.3 Aims and Objectives of the Study\n\nThe aim of this study is to identify the problems inherent in the existing system of transcript management systems, and to proffer a remedy to the existing problem. The solutions are as follows:\n\nØ Record and reports of students will be easily retrieved with increased data security.\n\nØ There will be reduction in the amount of resources, which in turn will lower the cost of processing of student’s transcripts, since information will be stored in a database with reduced data Redundancy.\n\nØ School personnel can attend to many student without being over worked.\n\nØ There will be reduction in time used in retrieval of student’s files.\n\nØ Reduction in bulkiness of files and record.\n\nØ It will make available the storage room that was used for storage of\n\nfiles.\n\n1.4 Significance of the Study\n\nThe project research haven’t identify the problem that was existing in the old system of operation , is designed specifically to come up with a more resound and effective system that will not only counteract this problem but also provides a detailed future plan that will give room for more information technological improvement in the transcript sector.\n\n1.5 Scope of the Study\n\nThis research work are limited to providing a digital transcript’s  information management system that will handle electronically both students and staff record , to enable easy accessibility and information flow within the university.\n\n1.6 Limitation of the Study\n\nThis research work is limited to providing a more reliable information management system that will handle electronically the record of both student and staff within the university.\n\n1.7 Organization of Work\n\nThis project work was arranged specifically arranged in chapters, hence it follows the order: Chapter One: General Introduction, Chapter Two:\n\nLiterature Review, Chapter Three: System Analysis, Chapter Four System Design, and System Implementation, Chapter five: Summary,\n\nConclusion and Recommendation.",

Recent emphasis on information and data processing in most of our business and shipping industries has grown vastly as in the case of super manifest shipping company Lagos that an alternative method has to be mechanical handling of data, preparing of freight, manifest etc.\n\nSuper maritime shipping company is a company which handle the clearing and forwarding of goods, importation of goods and undertakes the clearing of shipping documents and goods within the vessel leaves, the port for a designated ware house as the clients of the company wishes computer technology has come to be accepted as an indispensable innovation in shipping system. It is an all purpose machine that accepts data as input and process it using a set of information given out result as output which can be retrieved for future use. And its revolution has been evident in shipping in order to eliminate most hardship encountered in most of air shipping industries, the need for the computerization with the design and implementation of a computerized goods transportation management information system and its advantage to the shipping industries in needed.\n\n1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study is based on design and implementation of a computerized haulage system. The study helps one to understand the origin of goods transportation and of the same time some loop holes occurs in the management of goods and its solutions.\n\n1.2     AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe aims and objectives of this study is to develop and implement a computerized haulage system that will make provision of the following to ensure a fast and more efficient services to the customer based on quick access of data and accurate information. The branch of all routine work which does not demand quantitative consideration to enable then provide letter counter services.\n\nTo  be  receivable   and  capable  of  providing  an  to date  information  relevant  to  company  and  their  clients.\n\nTo affect a simpler handling of bill leading and updating of customers manifest checking of fraud and other criminal acts which lead to security and control.\n\n1.3     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe management of goods/goods in Nigeria has over the years attracted poor patronage as a result of errors that loss of customers goods is now the order of the day, the reason are not for fetched due to the manual procedure involved, chat have no other option than to be at the mercy of this error prime procedures and the storage of information such as files and other important documents can easily be last hereby attracting distrust of the firm by its client/customer as a result of eagerness would prefer their goods to be cleared on time but since there are so many activities involved there will be delay in processing and this does not portray the image of the company in a good way.\n\n1.4     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe existing system of custom and exercise office has exhibited some loop holes and it is against this loop holes that this work was carried out, the study is also undertaken to produce  a system which will address the loophole and co-operate need of the customs at the smallest possible cost and within the limit of technology available which was the driving force of this project.\n\n1.5     JUSTIFICATION\n\nWith the computerization of the shipping company, this bitting system will be sufficient and reliable, the establishment of the new system will create for a faster and efficient means if transacting business between the shipping company and their customers, there will be a networked and direct of communication between shipping companies both in and outside the country process like billing daily report generation customer registration will be for formed with speed, efficiently existing loots incurred. The information pertaining to the customer and his goods will be secured as they are contained in the computer and there will be case to store and retrieve information to and fro from the computer.\n\n1.6     SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study is restricted to the full operations of custom and office department.\n\n1.7     DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nGOOD- Goods carried in a ship\n\nTONNAGE- A measure of the capacity of a ship (1 ton = 100 cubic feet)\n\nPORT- A place where ship load and unload goods shattered form storms.\n\nVESSEL- A ship for transport by water\n\nBILL OF LOADING- A list giving details of a ships goods\n\nCONSIGNCE- A person or company to whom goods are sent form the counting of export and who receives them.\n\nMANIFEST- A list of all goods on the ship\n\nWHARF- This is a landing stage built along the shares for loading or unloading vessels.\n\nLABOUR- An area of water protected from the open sea by land or walls in which ships can shelter.\n\nBERTH- This is a place in the wharf where a ship can be died up or swing at anchor.\n\nPORT OF LOADING- A place where ships load goods and leave for the definition.\n\nPORT OF DISCHARGE- A place where unload goods from poof of loading.\n\nOCEAN FREIGHT- This is an amount charged by the carrier by the carrier for transportation of goods by sea.\n\nVOYAGE- A journey by water mostly a long one in a ship.\n\nSHIPPING- This is the process of pulling things on in a ship or transportation goods by ship\n\nWAREHOUSE- This is a store house\n\nTRASNPORT- This is carriage of goods from one place to another\n\nSAILING- This is the movement of ship on a sea from one place to another\n\nCUSTOM- This are the people that are in charge of checking the vessel if it contains any contraband items and the paper that contains the particulars of the container in the vessels.\n\nROTATION NUMBER- A number allocated by the department of customs and exercise to every ship entering into future use.\n\nCOMPUTER- This is an electronic machine that accepts data as input, process it using a set of instructions and given out result as output.

        "content": "ABSTRACT\n\nThis proposed work is an attempt to control the speed of the vehicle designed with computer software to enable the third party or owner to get the location, speed and activity of the driver. To achieve this, the system can transmit the information in real time. The use of GSM/GPRS technologies allows the system to track the objects and provide the up-to-date information. This information is authorized to specific users over the internet as the server gets the information. It is the tele-mointoring system to transmit data to the remote user. Thus the applications are used in real time traffic surveillance. This study proposes a prototype model for location tracking using Geographical Positioning System (GPS) and Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) technology. The development is based on the windows phone 8 application by means it can provide flexibility and portability for the user to get the information from anywhere. As these GPS technologies having greater range of frequencies, the user can get the information as quicker as possible. This system is very useful to speed control at specific traffic roads.\n\nThese days, mass-produced vehicles benefit from research on Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). One prime example of ITS is vehicle Cruise Control (CC), which allows it to maintain a pre-defined reference speed, to economize on fuel or energy consumption, to avoid speeding fines, or to focus all of the driver’s attention on the steering of the vehicle. However, achieving efficient Cruise Control is not easy in roads or urban streets where sudden changes of the speed limit can happen, due to the presence of unexpected obstacles or maintenance work, causing, in inattentive drivers, traffic accidents. In this communication we present a new Infrastructure to Vehicles (I2V) communication and control system for intelligent speed control, which is based upon Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for identification of traffic signals on the road, and high accuracy vehicle speed measurement with a Hall effect-based sensor. A fuzzy logic controller, based on sensor fusion of the information provided by the I2V infrastructure, allows the efficient adaptation of the speed of the vehicle to the circumstances of the road. The performance of the system is checked empirically, with promising results.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION                                     \n\n1.1 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM                              \n\n1.2 PURPOSE OF STUDY                                        \n\n1.3 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES                                    \n\n1.4 SCOPE/DELIMITATIONS                              \n\n1.5 LIMITATIONS/CONSTRAINTS                                 \n\n1.6 DEFINITION OF TERMS    \n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\n2.0 LITERATURE REVIEW   \n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\n3.0 METHODS FOR FACT FINDING AND DETAILED DISCUSSIONS OF THE SYSTEM\n\n3.1 METHODOLOGIES FOR FACT-FINDING \n\n3.2 DISCUSSIONS  \n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\n4.0 FUTURES, IMPLICATIONS AND CHALLENGES OF THE SYSTEM \n\n4.1 FUTURES \n\n4.2 IMPLICATIONS\n\n4.3 CHALLENGES\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\n5.0 RECOMMENDATIONS, SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION     \n\n5.1 RECOMMENDATION                                    \n\n5.2 SUMMARY                                               \n\n5.3 CONCLUSION \n\n5.4 REFERENCES\n\nVehicle Tracking Using Driver Mobile Gps Tracking\n\nThe Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based satellite navigation system that provides location information .This system uses GPS to track the location of the vehicle.

        "content": "Child Monitoring System\n\n\nThese Days parents are worried about their children’s so they want a complete track of them and monitor them all the time, This is physically not possible so we introduce Safety Monitoring system which is helpful for monitoring or tracking the child and their activities from anywhere in the world.The major issue of child missing can be solved with the help of child tracking system as well as parents who need to keep a track of their every steps, this system plays a vital role. The android application uses GPS and telephony services to locate their child’s location.This application secretly retrieves all the Call Logs, Message Details, Contact list and accurate Location without the children’s permission or without their knowledge as this application runs is in background and the major advantage of this feature is, if child reboots the Mobile phone the background process starts as the reboot is complete, so the process is never ending.\nThis application sends all the data from the child’s phone to the server and from the server to the parent’s phone in every 10 minutes interval. This  application is divided into 2 Apps, one is for the parent where they can see all the activities of their children and other is the Child Part, where the child can only see a calculator while the data is been fetched in the background without child’s knowledge.\n\nParent:\n    • Register: Parent need to register themselves by filling up basic registration details and by creating valid login credentials.\n\n    • Login: After successful registration, parent need to login using their valid login credentials.\n\n\n    • Add/ View Child Details: Once the parent is logged into the application, he/she can add their children details. Parent can also view their added children’s.\n\n    • View: Once the child details are added, parent can view various details from child’s Smartphone as follows:\n            i. Call Logs: Displays all the recent call logs from child’s Smartphone.\n            ii. Messages: Displays all the messages from child’s Smartphone.\n            iii. Location: Displays location of child’s Smartphone.\n            iv. Contacts: Displays all the contact from child’s Smartphone.\nChild:\n    • Login: Registered child need to login using valid login credentials.\n    • Use Calculator: After successful login, a fully functional calculator will be displayed which can be used by the child itself.\n\nSoftware Requirements:\n    • Windows XP, Windows 7(ultimate, enterprise) \n    • Android Studio\n    • Visual Studio\nHardware Components:\n    • Processor – i3\n    • Hard Disk – 5 GB\n    • Memory – 1GB RAM\n    • Android Phone with Kitkat and higher\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages:\n\n    • Parent could be able to track child using their separate android application provided for the parent.\n    • Parent could track the location and also could get all the call logs, messages and contact list from the child mobile phone.\n    • Parent can locate and retrieve details anywhere and anytime.\n    • Application automatically operates location requests without user interaction because at that time child not have knowledge to update his location at map. The system requires location and telephony services. Third advantage is it can be used at indoors where GPS satellites connectivity is not available. At that time, it can use network provides for location services.\n    • Network provider service uses cellular ID such as IMEI number for location tracking. Lastly all the controls are in parent side. The child side has less control access. \n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n    • The application is not worked well when there is no network available. In that case the application fails the exact location. But the application stores the last location which can be stored at the database server. When mobile is switched off then we consider this as a one of the drawback of system.\n    • Requires active internet connection.\n    • Child need to login once into the application.\n    • System will provide inaccurate results if data not entered correctly.\n\nApplications:\n    • This application can be used by any parent who wants to track or monitor their child without any physical interference.",

        "content": "Railway Ticket Booking System Using QR Code\n\nThe current ticketing system of Abuja kaduna railway system works manually and is quite time consuming. People may carry android  but if that is misplaced somehow or if anyone forgets to produce it at the right place these are of no use. The main objective for this project is developing an android application so that passengers can book the tickets online directly from their smart phones and a received message to their own phones is enough for travelling a desired distance. Thus the process of standing in lines to book the tickets and after that carrying the tickets is curdled. This System generates ticket in the form of QR Code, which can be checked by the ticket checker directly through scanning the QR code. The User can’t just directly register into the system; he should have an Aadhaar id to register.\n\nAdmin:\n    • Login: Admin can login his personal account.\n    • Add passenger  Detail: Admin can add users passenger     detail, including passenger Unique no., name, gender etc.\n    • View User: Admin can see user detail.\n    • View Booking: Admin can see all booking details.\n    • Logout: Admin can logout from his account.\nUser:\n    • Register: User need to register with his/her personal details.\n    • Login: User can login using valid username and password of his/her personal account.\n    • Booking: User can book a railway ticket by selecting source and destination and also can enter the count of people travelling with the user and book their tickets too.\n    • Booking History: User can see previous booking details.\n    • Logout: User can logout from his personal account.\nTicket Checker:\n    • Set Station: Checker can set his station detail.\n    • Check Ticket: Checker can check user’s Ticket by scanning the ticket using barcode scanner.\n\nSoftware Requirements:\n    • Windows XP, Windows 7(ultimate, enterprise) \n    • Android Studio\n    • Visual Studio\nHardware Components:\n    • Processor – i3\n    • Hard Disk – 5 GB\n    • Memory – 1GB RAM\n    • Android Phone with Kitkat and higher\n    • QR Scanner\n\nAdvantages:\n\n    • Very easy and user friendly system.\n    • Ticket should be available without wasting time.\n    • Ticket should be check using scanning this should be advance technology use in that system and also secure.\n    • Only register user and book a ticket.\n    • User can book one or more than one ticket at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n    • Active internet connection required to book a ticket.\n    • User cannot cancel his booking.\n\nApplications:\n    • This application can be used by any person who travel by train and wants to avoid queues and book their ticket online.",

        "content": "EXAMINATION VERIFICATION SYSTEM USING BIOMETRIC\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\nMy research Project is to develop fingerprint biometrics systems that assist in the elimination of examination impersonation. Up till now, the WAEC examination board (WAEC) is not using fingerprint as mode of identification, this has resulted in people sitting for WAEC examinations for others who collect the result at the end. With the adoption of fingerprint, this will be eliminated as fingerprint; this will be eliminated as fingerprint identification will also be employed during collection of results and certificates. This target can be mainly decomposed into image preprocessing, feature extraction and feature match. For each sub-task, some classical and up-to-date methods in literatures are analyzed. Based on the analysis, an integrated solution for fingerprint recognition is developed for demonstration. My demonstration program is coded using visual studio for the program, some optimization at coding level and algorithm level are proposed to improve the performance of my fingerprint recognition system. These performance enhancements are shown by experiments conducted upon a variety of fingerprint images. Also, the experiments illustrate the key issues of fingerprint recognition that are consistent with what the available literatures say. Main objective is to eliminate any form impersonation during exam by employing a more secured means of fingerprint biometrics.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\nFormal examination can rightly be defined as the assessment of a person‘s Performance, when confronted with a series of questions, problems, or tasks set him, in order to ascertain the amount of knowledge that he has acquired, the extent to which he is able to utilize it, or the quality and effectiveness of the skills he has developed.\n\nThe Jesuits introduced written examination into their schools in the 16th century. The Definitive Ratio Argue Institution Studiorum of 1599, which was not revised until 1932, contains a code of rules for the conduct of school examinations, which were held annually, and determined whether or not children were promoted to a higher class. During the 19th century, formal written examinations became regular in universities, schools, and other educational institutions. Examinations were also increasingly employed for the selection of recruits to the civil service, and the professions, and to posts in industry and commence. Over the ages, standardized testing has been the most common methodology, yet the validity and credibility of the expanded range of contemporary assessment techniques have been called into question.\n\nThere are two types of systems that help automatically establish the identity of a person: \n\n1)  Authentication (verification) systems and\n\n2)  Identification systems. In a verification system, a person desired to be identified submits an identity claim to the system, usually via a magnetic stripe card, login name, smart card, etc., and the system either rejects or accepts the submitted claim of identity (Am I who I claim I am?). In an identification system, the system establishes a subject‘s identity (or fails if the subject is not enrolled in the system data base) without the subject‘s having to claim an identity (Who am I?). The topic of this paper is channel towards the development of examination impersonation elimination system and this system would strictly do with the unique feature of identification by means of finger print. A verification system based on fingerprints, and the terms verification, authentication, and identification are used in a loose sense and synonymously.\n\nAccurate automatic personal identification is becoming more and more important to the operation of our increasingly electronically interconnected information society. Traditional automatic personal identification technologies to verify the identity of a person, which use ―Something that you know,‖ such as a personal identification number (PIN), or ―something that you have,‖ such as an identification (ID) card, key, etc., are no longer considered reliable enough to satisfy the security requirements of electronic transactions or school management system. All of these techniques suffer from a common problem of inability to differentiate between an authorized person and an impostor who fraudulently acquires the access privilege of the authorized person.\n\nBiometrics is a technology that (uniquely) identifies a person based on his physiological or behavioral characteristics. It relies on ―something that you are‖ to make personal identification and therefore can inherently differentiate between an authorized person and a fraudulent imposter. Although biometrics cannot be used to establish an absolute ―yes/no‖ personal identification like some of the traditional technologies, it can be used to achieve a ―positive identification‖ with a very high level of confidence, such as an error rate of 0.001%. Fingerprint technology using biometrics employ certain advantage of eradicating the problem of examination impersonation by allowing the measure of what you are to perform the security activities of student participation in the exams.\n\n1.1     BACKGROUND OF STUDY\n\nAn examination board is an organization that sets\nexaminations\nand is responsible for marking them and distributing results. Examination boards have the power to award qualifications, such as\nSAT\nscores, to students. Most exam boards are running as non-profit organizations.\n\nThe West African Examinations Council (WAEC) is a not-for-profit\nexamination\nboard\nformed out of the concern for\neducation\nin\nAfrica.\nEstablished in 1952, the council has contributed to education in Anglophonic countries of West Afric\na\n(Ghana,\nLiberia,\nNigeria,\nSierra Leon\ne,\nand the Gambi\na)\n, with the number of examinations they have coordinated, and certificates they have issued. They also formed an endowment fund, to contribute to the education in West Africa, through lectures, and aid to those who cannot afford education.\n\nDr. Adeyegbe, HNO of WAEC Nigeria (2004) said \"the council has developed a team of well-trained and highly motivated staff, and has administered Examinations that are valid and relevant to the educational aspirations of member countries\". In a year, over three million candidates registered for the exams coordinated by WAEC. The council also helps other examination bodies (both local and international) in coordinating Examinations.\n\nThe University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate, University of\n\nLondon School Examinations Matriculation Council and West African Departments of Education met in 1948, concerning\neducation\nin\nWest Africa.\nThe meeting was called to discuss the future policy of\neducation\nin\nWest Africa.\nAt the meeting, they appointed Dr.\nGeorge Barker Jeffery\n(Director of the University Of London Institute Of Education) to visit some West African countries, so as to see the general\neducation\nlevel and requirements in\nWest Africa.\nAt the end of Jeffery's three month visit (December 1949- March 1950) to Ghana, the Gambi\na,\nSierra\nLeone,\nand\nNigeria,\nhe tendered a report (since known as Jeffery report) strongly supporting the need for a West African Examination Council, and making detailed recommendations on the composition and duties of the Council. Following this report, the groups met with the\ngovernments\nof these countries, and they agreed on establishing a West African Examination council, fully adopting Jeffery's recommendations.\n\nThe\nlegislative assemblies\nof Nigeria, Ghana,\nSierra Leone,\nand the Gambia passed an\nordinance\n(West African Examinations Council Ordinance NO. 40) approving the West African Examination Council in Dec 1951. The\nOrdinance\nagreed to the coordination of exams, and issuing of certificates to students in individual countries by the West African Examination Council. Liberia later issued their\nordinance\nin 1974, at the annual meeting held in\nLagos,\nNigeria. After the success of forming an examination council, the council called a first meeting in\nAccra,\nGhana on March 1953. In the meeting, the registrar briefed everybody about the progress of the council. In that same meeting, five committees were formed to assist the council. These committees are: Administrative and Finance Committee,\n\nSchool Examinations Committee, Public Service Examinations Committee, The\n\nProfessional, Technical and Commercial Examinations Committee, and the Local\n\nCommittee. The total number of people present for this meeting was 26.\n\nDATABASE\n\nADMINISTRATOR \n\nINVIGILATORS\n\nCHAIRMAN OF\n\nEDUCATIONAL SHCEME\n\nCHAIRMAN OF\n\nEDUCATIONAL SCHEDULLING\n\nORGANIZATIONAL DIAGRAM\n\nCHAIRMAN OF COUNCIL\n\nDIRECTOR OF BOARD\n\n1.2       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe objective of this study is as follows\n\n To create a system that is capable of tracking impersonators in the examination system using the methodology of finger print biometrics.\n\n      To reduce rate of corruption in the educational sector and increase the rate of self confidence on students.",

        "content": "ACCESS PROTOCOL FOR WEB SERVICES\n\nNEED URGENT HELP WITH THIS PROJECT?\n\nChapter one\n\n1.0            introduction\n\nSimple object Access protocol, is a protocol for exchanging structural information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. It relies on Extensible markup language (XML) for its massage format, and usually relies on other application layer protocols, most notably Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and simple mail. Transfer protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission. Web services are software components that communicate using pervasive, standard-based web technology including HTTP and XML- based messaging.\n\nWeb services are designed to be accessed by other applications and vary in complexity from simple operations, such as checking a banking account balance online, to complex processes running CRM (customer relationship management) or enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. Since they are based on open standards such as HTTP and XML-based protocols including SOAP and WSDL, Web services are hardware, programming language and operating system independent, this means that applications written in different programming language and running on different platforms can seamlessly exchange data over intranet or the internet using web services.\n\nWeb services are powered by XML and three other core technology: WSDL, SOAP and UDDI. Before building a web service, its developers create its definition in the form of a WSDL document that describes the service’s location on the web and the functionality the services provides. Information about the services may then be entered in a UDDI registry, which allows web services customer to search for and locate the services they need. This step is optional but is beneficial when a company want its web services to be discovered by internal and/or external service consumers. Based on the  information in the UDDI registry, the service client developer uses instructions in the WSDL to construct SOAP message for exchanging data with the service over HTTP.\n\n1.1            STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nSome of the problem identified in this project are.\n\n1.

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ON-LINE DRUG CONTROL INFORMATION SYSTEM\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0       INTRODUCTION\n\nThe National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) is a Nigerian Government Agency under the federal ministry of health that is responsible for regulatory and controlling the manufacture, importation, exportation, advertisement, distribution, sale and use of food, drug, cosmetics, medical devices, chemicals and prepackaged water. The current Director General of NAFDAC Dr. Paul Orhii, holds a PHD in Medicine.\n\nIn Nigeria today, there is an influx into the market of fake machine parts, fake motor spare part, take chemicals, fake adulterated food items, amongst others. It may appear that almost every existing product has a fake counterpart. The era 1985-2000 in Nigeria has heralded the regime of faking and quackery, counterfeit drugs, quack doctors, illegal chemist shops ad hospitals. Drugs are no exception (Ohuabunwa, 2002). The menace of fake drug became prevalent in the last decade and the present situation is alarming in the West African Sub-region, including Nigeria. Empirical observations have shown that there may be more fake than genuine drug in circulation (Osibo, 1998).\n\nA disturbing aspect of the counterfeit drug menace is that the effects of consuming such drugs go unnoticed most of the times except in such cases where it results in mass deaths. There are generally no reliable data on the mortality or morbidity arming from the consumption of counterfeit drugs in Nigeria. In 1947, 14 children were reported dead after being administered Chloroquine phosphate injections and in 1990, 1909 children died after being administered fake Paracetamol (Aluko, 1994). Usually such incidence stimulates governments into taking positive steps, principally arising from public outcry.\n\nThe trend in the last decade prompted the public and particularly the professional bodies notably pharmaceutical society of Nigeria, to pressure the government to take definite steps towards controlling the preponderance of fake drugs in Nigeria, the government responded by promulgating the counterfeit and fake drugs (miscellaneous provisions) decree No.21 of 1988. This decree prohibited the sale and distribution of counterfeit, adulterated, banned and fake drugs or poisons in open markets and without License of registration. It also created penalties for the breach of the responsibility of seizing any drug or poison illegally displayed unlicensed or unregistered premises. Shortcomings in the degree led to its being repealed by decree No.21 in 1989 and subsequent amendments.\n\nThe drug situation in Nigeria:\n\nThere is a large market for drugs in Nigeria. out of over 130 existing pharmaceutical manufacturers only 60 are in active manufacturing. This is despite the installed capacity of the industry to produce between 50% and 75% of the nation’s drug needs. Capacity utilization is below 30% and about 70% of the drugs are thus imported, (Okoli, 2002).\n\nDrug availability in the public and private health care delivery system in Nigeria is a poor state. Various reasons have been adducted for this trend (Ertun, 1996). These include:\n\na.       Inadequate funding of hospitals pharmacies and the “out of stock syndrome”.\n\nb.      Involvement of unqualified persons in the procurement and distribution of drugs.\n\nc.       Inadequate storage facilities, transportation and distribution.\n\nThe adoption of an essential drugs program through the promulgation of decree 43 of 1989 on essential drug was a step taken to ensure the availability of drugs. Ordinarily, banded drug prescribing is still quite common in much public health institution, contrary to specification of the essential drug Act. (Govt. of Nigeria). This has partially eroded the expected gains of the essentials drugs program.\n\nThe drug distribution network in Nigeria is in a state of chaos because it consists of markets patent medicine stores, community pharmacist, private and public hospitals, wholesalers/importers and pharmaceutical manufacturers. It is a common scene in Nigeria to see petty traders who sell kola nuts, cigarette and oranges among other items, in market kiosk, motor parks and road sides hawking drugs that range from over the counter items to antibiotics (popularly called Capsules) (Adelusi Adeluyi, 2000). The medicines are usually left under the sun in such conditions that could facilitate the deterioration of the active ingredients. Patent medicine stores are owned by the holders of patent and proprietary medicine vendor’s licenses ordinarily, the patent medicine should be sold in their original packs. Over the counter (OTC) drugs are the only drugs authorized to be sold by vendors but they generally sell all types of drugs as determined by their financial capability. Considering the knowledge base of these vendors, whose minimum academic requirement to obtain a license is the First School-Leaving-Certificate.\n\nCommunity pharmacies are statutorily registered with the pharmacist’s council of Nigeria. a superintending pharmacist, who is also registered and licensed overseas the pharmacy anytime it is opened for business with such pharmacies there should not be any serious problem of sale of fake drugs. Unfortunately however, there are many unregistered pharmacies thriving. And in such premises drugs are purchased from doubtful sources with its attendant danger to the health of the public (Erhun and Adeola, 1995).\n\n1.1       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe major problem encountered in this study was the initial reluctance of regulatory bodies to divulge vital information that will reveal their level of performance.\n\na.       Adequacy of the laws governing the eradication of counterfeit drugs in Nigeria\n\nb.      Why counterfeit drugs are common\n\nc.       The performance of the state task forces\n\nd.      Methods employed by the task forces in carrying out their duties and the major problem affecting performance.\n\ne.

        "content": "FORMALIZING GHC’S TYPE SYSTEM\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n6.0             INTRODUCTION\n\nHaskell is a purely functional  programming language, with a type system that supports algebraic data types, type inference, parametric (Highter-Kinded) polymorphism, and type class constraints (Marlow (Ed), 2012). In recent years, the developers of GHC, a prominent Haskell compiler, have implemented a variety of extensions to this type system, with the aim of providing greater expressiveness, ease of use, or static verification capabilities. Some are straight forward, such as generalizing type classes to type relations via milti-parameter types classes. Some require more significant extensions to the type system, such as type families (Kiselyov et al; 2012) and the earlier functional dependencies extension; some make types inference significantly more difficult and major extension, such as GADTS (Schrijvers et al; 2009), impredicative polymorphism and arbibrary-rank types (Peyton Jones et al; 2007). While GHC accommodates all of these extension simultaneously, the papers that introduce each one discuses type inference and types checking only in isolation, and sometimes quite informally. This is makes the properties of GHC’s types reconstruction algrittm difficult to determine when multiple extension are combined. As a first step towards solving this problem, the GHC team (specifically vytinidis, Peyton Jones, Schigvers and Surmann) published outdid inpxq, a modular type inference system that accommodates all of the extension (and possibly more), along with soundness and principality proofs (Vytinitis et al; 2011) our work aims to more ruinously formalize outsidelnpxq in the dependently-typed programming language cum proof assistant Agda 2 (Norell, 2008). The outsidelnpxq system itself is similar in presentation of ML’S type inference, first presented in (orderky et al; 1997) and more rigorously formalized in (Potter and Remy, 2005). It is the culmination of years of work and is the latest in a series of types inference system for GADTs in Haskell based on “Wobbly types” (Schrijvers et al; 2009) right up to the very similar LHMPXQ system presented in (Vytiniotis et al; 2012). Types inference in a proof assistant, and what litte5r work that has been done is primarily focused on types inference for Ml. Nipkow and Narachewski have formalized Milners’s original W algorithm for the HM calculus in lsabelle/HOL and proven soundness (Naraschewski and Nipkow, 1999), and Dubois et al; simultaneously performed a similar verification in coq (Dubois, Menissier-Morais, 1999 for the purposes of developing a certified ML compiler (Dubois, 2000), surprisingly, no types inference algorithm have been formalized in Agda before.\n\nEven more surprisingly, no algorithm which includes support for GADTs or other advanced types system features had ever been formalized in a proof assistant, to our knowledge. The techniques we use for term representation are drawn heavily from Bird’s observation of monadic structure in syntax  trees (Bird and Paterson, 1999), a concept first explored in (Bellegard and Hook, 1994). We also draw several representational ticks from work in generic  programming using dependent types (Morris et al; 2004) and Mc Bride’s works on structurally recursive unification (McBride, 2003), which is used directly in our simple in sanitation.\n\nWhy mechanize outsidelnpxq?\n\nAny handwritten formalization or proof will likely lack the amount of rigour necessary to be accepted by a proof assistant, much like a handwrite algorithm is unlikely to be accepted by a programming language compiler. Formalizing outsideinpxq in a proof assistant is therefore more difficult than it proof assistant requires use to redesign those parts of the system that are not amenable to automated checking, and to make rigorous all those parts of the originals intuition. By formalizing outsideinpxq in a proof assistant,, we achieve two main goals.\n\nFirstly, we make explicit that which was implicitly and to prove that which was assumed in the original outsideinpxq paper, ensuring that our formal work stands on solid ground’s and secondly, we encourage those developing extensions fro the types system formalization, along with the necessary practical implementation of the new  extension in GHC’s type checker. By making run formalization available as code, we hope to mitigate the social problem of formal work on a type system being publishing in a long paper and subsequently ignored.",

        "content": "MICROCONTROLLER BASED DIGITAL CLOCK AND TIMER\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1      Background\n\nA clock is an instrument used for indicating and maintaining the time and passage thereof. The word clock is derived ultimately (via Dutch, Northern French, and Medieval Latin) from the Celtic words clagan and clocca meaning \"bell\". For horologists and other specialists the term clock continues to mean exclusively a device with a striking mechanism for announcing intervals of time acoustically, by ringing a bell, a set of chimes, or a gong. A silent instrument lacking such a mechanism has traditionally been known as a timepiece. In general usage today, however, a \"clock\" refers to any device for measuring and displaying the time which, unlike a watch, is not worn on the person.\n\nIn this project, I shall be designing a 24 – Hours digital clock using MSI.\n\n1.7      Objectives\n\nThe objective of this project work is directed towards the following areas:\n\n1.  To design and implement a 24 – Hours Digital Clock using MSI\n\n2.  To be able to develop a complete clock that can be used for any other timing purposes.\n\n1.8      Justification\n\nIf this prototype is fully developed will be very useful in many areas such as:\n\na.       This system will serve as a prototype that will encourage local manufacturers to develop interest in microcontroller based designs\n\nb.      It can be a substitute for home and industrial use\n\nc.       It can be used by schools further research purposes.\n\n1.9      Scope of the Project\n\nThis project will feature the design of digital clock using AT89S52 and program written in basic language.  The output will be implemented using LCD.  Push buttons will be used to implement the input.\n\n1.10  Constraints\n\nOne the major constraint of this work was finance.  Another like it was in availability of the required information. \n\n1.6   Project Report Organization\n\nThis report is organized into six chapters.  The first chapter takes care of introduction.  Chapter two surveys the literature review of this work.  In chapter three, the project analysis was done.  The input, processing and output modules are critically analyzed.\n\nIn chapter four, system implementation was carefully done.  Chapter five takes care of Testing and Implementation.  Finally chapter six closes up with summary and conclusions.",

        "content": "A STUDY OF THE USE OF COMPUTER IN MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM IN FIRST BANK PLC, ENUGU\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nComputer has become a very powerful tool in the business world today because of its ability to store, process and disseminate large amount of information accurately, efficiently and effectively for quick decision.\n\nAccording to Ani (200:5A), computer can be defined as an electronic tool capable of accepting data, interpreting data, performing ordered operation on data and reporting on the outcome of these operation.  It is therefore a tool managers can use to assist them in the complicated and time consuming task of generating information.\n\nThe computer took many centuries to come to the age of four generation, reckoning from time, serious efforts began towards simplifying mathematical computations Quite a few people were involved in the development of the computer and several of the scientists who made those useful contributions did not really aim at developing a computer but their inventions turned out to be an important step towards the development of computer\n\nAccording to Alan Trunning (1937) showed that a computer can be built with a set of simple instruction while any problem having a logical solution can be reduced to a solution based upon a small set of simple instruction.  A few years later, John Von Neuman (1946) set out a summary of the design requirement far a modern computer as follows:-\n\n1.                 The processing of data instructions which include the use of modification of programs.\n\n2.                 Binary codes is used to represent data and instruction in a way that makes no distinction of the two and still allow them the storage space in the computer.\n\nBased on those contributions and innovations of these scientists and others, the modern computer came to be.  IT underwent series of improvement which gave rise to farth computer generation, before we have today, MODERN COMPUTER.\n\nHowever, the introduction of this general purpose device and machine and simple programming languages greatly increased the computer utility especially in management information system (MIS) which basically deals on how information is obtained, retrieved and utilized.  Computers are now indispensable tools in any business activities because electronic data processing is growing and meeting the expected need of people’s speed, accuracy and efficiency in handling of data and security.  IT also extended to other areas such as marketing, accounting, inventory management and production process.\n\n     According to Lutter Quick (1954) The concept of management information system (MIS) was formulated by Lutter Quick whole delivering a speech in October, 1960 at Ihe Rochester Institute of Technology, their are then it become obvious and necessary that information should play a vital role in the solution of business and management problems in a price-meal fashion thereby focusing almost entirely on the mechanization of all office chores.\n\n     Basically, Management Information System attempt to provide managers at all levels with the information they need to guide their enterprises.  It provides an organization with flexible integrated tool for the planning and control function of their endeavours, with the ability to planned and unplanned information requirement at all management levels.\n\n     According to Onuigbo (1990:487) Management information System (MIS) is he formal processing and dispersing of information in internal and external within the organization in an effective and efficient manner.\n\n     Primarily, the management information system (MIS) is set up of the purpose of providing, planning and controlling information to all levels of management to effect appropriate decision making.  Thus, it does this by gathering data, inputting and processing them into information and further dissemination these items of information, we can therefore, say that management information system can be sub-divided into functional information system such as marketing information system, Ihe financial information system and Ihe personnel information system and so on depending on the type of organization.\n\n     The management information system provides managements with varying information depending on the level, thereby making increased in the efficiency of the organization through better management decisions.\n\n          However, owing to the fact that organizations have grown in sizes, information flow has become so voluminous that face to face communication and even writing memoranda can no longer effect adequate communication or effective processing of data.  The management information system of these organizations have in recent times fond it difficult to meet with The increasing demand being made on information as a result, The manual means o operation is Jam-packet with scored of data to be processed.  Hence delay and inaccuracies in data collection and analysis.  Delay often makes decision making to be inaccurate.  Also, there is problem of misappropriation of important document of files or even cases of stolen files.",

Difficult and strenuous jobs that were carried out by humans in the past have today been easily and effectively carried out by computers.\n\n          In the development and maintenance of life, Agriculture plays an enormous role. As the population of human increases so also the requirement of food and their need for other agricultural products will be high in order to satisfy the huge population with food, shelter and raw materials for their industries.\n\n          Since human being have limit in all they do, it deems imperative therefore that services of this great and tireless machine be put into all of man’s activities including the Agricultural sector for mass production and provision of food and other agricultural benefits to man.\n\n          In the field of animals husbandry, whose services are also needed for further (addition) production to satisfy every aspect of man’s wants, because of the usefulness of this sector of Agriculture it is necessary that computer are introduced, in order that its activities be easily carried out for better results.\n\n          This projects is concerned with computerizing a poultry farm but our center of attraction is in general stock keeping and other activities that will be done easily and effectively by computers.

Introducing the computer system will greatly improve materials requirement planning in the following aspects.\n\n(a)  Reliability\n\n(b)  Validity\n\n(c)   Accuracy\n\n(d)  Appropriate storage of data\n\n(e)   Timeliness\n\nThe above factors are due to the fact that the computer possesses some great features, and advantages over traditional approach.\n\n1.2            STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS\n\nNo doubt that the use of traditional system has created a lot of problems in production of roofing sheets at EMENITE.  The quantity and amount of materials and sub-assembly needed to produce a product cannot be traceable because of glaring disadvantages stated below.\n\nØ Poor information storage method: The use of office files and file cabinets is not a good form of information storage.\n\nØ Insecurity of data because it is prone to vandalization and unauthroised accessibility\n\nØ Duplication of data in various departments because of the nature of work needed\n\nIt takes a long time in accessing records in the manual system (filing system) due to the nature of the job.  It is not always good for materials to finish unnoticed, so the re-ordering of materials are not made as and when due.\n\nThe introduction of the computer system will help eliminate these problems to an extent.\n\n1.3            PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis project is generally towards eradication of all the deformities and curb hookups of the manual method of bill-of-materials processing, thus developing a new system to handle the jobs involved in the processing of Bill-of-material electronically.\n\n1.4            AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nIn an organization whether manufacturing or not manufacturing where the competitors and the objectives of the organization are at the top of the scale of preference especially the meeting of the standard in the market, there is always a focus on the organizational goal which might not be the goals of the sub-system to avoid sub-optimality, working towards a divisional or individual benefits.\n\nThe aims of this work include the following;\n\n(1)      To work towards the elimination of ineffective modes of operation; it centers on the user having a good atmosphere for work thereby minimizing stress.\n\n(2)      The objective from the initiator of the proposal is generally towards combating al the aims and the problems being discovered on the existing system, which are listed under problem of study.\n\n(3)      Safeguarding of information through effective monitoring of access is the filing system (database).\n\n(4)      Knowing when materials are almost out of stock, in order to make an order so as not to show the production pace of the labourers.\n\n1.5            SCOPE OF STUDY\n\nThe scope of this project work covers all the areas of bill-of-materials processing systems, which include the cost of individual material responsible for production, the stock control or inventory areas, and every other necessary areas.  The storage of records, which have different fields that could be expanded a little to form files.  These file five rooms for editing, updating and retrieval of information when needed.  Some of these fields are item description, quality, total requirement, re-ordering point, labour cost, overhead cost, profit, lower cost, etc.\n\nThis project is focused on the entire information recorded on Bill-of-material processing for EMENITE NIGERIA LIMITED, EMENE, ENUGU STATE",

It is aimed at developing a computerized case filling information system , the developed system will provide  required information for quick and accurate prosecution of crime suspects in a court of competent jurisdiction. Those who require this information may include lawyers, NDLEA and judges etc.\n\nIt will also keep accurate record of those convicted of crimes to help the criminal justice system have accurate record for decision making. With this the government can always know when to grant pardon to repentant prisoners. The data collection of this project work is mainly interview from NDLEA officers. The implementation of this case filling information system project was carried out using C# programming language and C# database for the database platform. In conclusion, the work met all the objectives intended, it is thereby recommended for Central Registry of Criminal Identification department of  NDLEA.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n National Drug law Enforcement Agency was set up in the year 1984 during the regime of  Buhari the acting president of that year. It was established when caught on drug reaffixing called cocaine they are Bartholomew bologna Laval ojulope and Benard Obenegbe and were executed by then government Buhari. It was established to take care of the problem that Nigeria are facing due to the problem of hard drugs that existed in Nigeria  then.\n\nNDLEA act N30 laws of the federation in 2004 they state the practical operation in the year 1990 from airport commissioners when they saw some groups of boys carrying drugs and then want to stop them.\n\nFedelis Ojakilome was the first chairman of NDLEA and he handed over to kwajafa whose was an assistance inspector of police (AIG) and handed over to papa jamare who only lasted for 2 months and Bamaji took over from him in 1994 and lasted for five years. He was replaled by 1994 Onovo 1.0 from Enugu also a police personnel who remains in office till 2000 and handed over to lockdam also AIG and lasted for 3-4 months them Lafia gim took over who was an SSS boss before he came to Drug Ground October.\n\nIn 2006, Ahmadu ginelde a retimed police officer is as at now the preset boss in NDLEA company.\n\n1.2            AIM/OBJECTIVE\n\nThe Aim and objective of this company is to make sure that Nigeria’s partake in the habit of fighting against Dreg Anuse like other countries and it was established to present illicit cultivation production mainefactive of illicit trafficking of hard dugs which begins to take place in Nigeria.\n\n1.2.1           STATEMENT/PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\n          The statement of the study and some of the problem they face in their company is that they lack awareness of their members of their operation brandy by the public as such they do not like their search on the carport seaport and international air ports that which shows that they don’t know their privacy and the powers given to NSLEA. They also lack co-operation for general public that is they don’t volatile information on drugs offenders in the area because of Libras unstuck.\n\n          They encounter some undue interfere in their investigation by luring place individuals in the society. They poor remigration on their works because their workers are not well paid which now daises some of their workers not be active in work. They also encounter some logic problem including vehicles that are not regard enough to with stand the pressure of the day to day activities. The hostile attitude needed from the general public to the law enforcement Agents are not there.\n\n1.3            JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY\n\nWhen some investigation are being carried out there are many problem they encounter which at the end later become on their own behalf for instance when they lack awareness of the public are aware that they want to come and airiest anybody of groups of people it is believed that the public can’t keep quiet and allow them to come and arrest so the lack of awareness of the public helps them a lot.\n\nAgain no body known the secret of Drug Agents or the powers given to their officers which now encourage them to go ahead and arrest any body that go against their law. They have the right to  entire into any place whether forcible to entire so far they get the news that some changers addicts are staging inside the place.\n\n1.4            SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis is to enforce the trafficking and abuse of illicit drugs that are found  in all parts of Nigeria. This NDLEA people are found in all parts of Nigeria which hampers the operation of the traffickers. In international air ports, land boarders and other places there are may people that fight against Drug in all those places which help to radices the high rate of drugs abusers because they have branches in all conges of the world which help them to got information about any drug person ground so that they will went on for an arrest of that person.

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPUTER BASED BILL OF MATERIAL PROCESSING SYSTEM\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBill of material processing can be described the compilation of the raw materials required to produce any desired product.  This means billing the materials before processing so as to achieve a cost-effective production, avoiding less in buying the materials for production and also in the sale of products after production.\n\n          There are a lot of problems encountered in the manual bill of martial processing system.  It is difficult to maintain the relationship between raw materials at the lowest level and the in which this raw materials are combined to form final products are not shown in the manual bill of material processing.\n\n          Most raw materials are used for more than one product.  It becomes difficult to determine the final products in which a particular raw materials is used unless a separate record of the usage of raw materials is maintained.\n\n          In Nigeria, some companies are a manufacturing company that produces spare parts (ie motorcycle or motor spare parts).\n\n          Those companies are the producers of engine blocks, piston and Rings, brake shoes, Inner kick, Inner gear, con rod, clutch Fiber, Tyre and Tube etc.  the bill of material processing system is operated manually.\n\n          Those involved are the production manager who is in charge of production.  He lists all the raw materials that are needed for production.  The stores manager takes Inventory of available raw materials and notes those that are not available.  He then notifies the purchasing manager.\n\n          The purchasing manager who is the head of the purchasing department is also involved.  He is responsible for buying and bringing down the materials from the source.\n\n          The Head of Finance and Accounts who is responsible for releasing funds for the purchase of raw materials.\n\n          Those people co0operate with the marketing department.  This is because price of the raw materials may affect the price at which products are marketed.\n\n          This study involves an analysis of the manual system and the design of a new computer based system.\n\n1.1     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nA lot of problems have been encountered in the existing manual system of bill of material processing system.  The particular raw materials used in a product and the quantity used cannot be traced because of the following:-\n\n1.                 Inefficient processing and storage system for bill of materials information.\n\n2.                 Wrong transcriptions and mutilations by accident or on purpose.  The information is very insecure and can be accessed by wrong persons.\n\n3.                 Use of filling cabinets makes retrieval of information very difficult.  Also the filling cabinets are prone to termites and rats.\n\n4.                 Management decisions are often based on incomplete, incomprehensive, incorrect and unreliable information and as such planning and other management activities are affected.\n\n5.                 Duplication of tasks will be eliminated so that the staff will gear their talents towards more challenging and innovative tasks.\n\n1.2     AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe purpose of this study is to eliminate the problems that occur to improper billing of materials.\n\nThe steps involved are:-\n\n1.                 To produce an inventory of all the raw materials used in Nigeria.\n\n2.                 To critically examine the present trends in the billing system of the companies.\n\n3.                 To identify the causes and sources of the problems encountered in the billing of materials.\n\n4.                 To identify the effects of these problems and offer suggestions on how to solve them.\n\n5.                 To serve as a reference to other researchers in this and other related fields of study.\n\n1.3     PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\nThe objective of this project is to design a computer-base bill of materials processing system.\n\nAn in-depth analysis of the existing system is necessary so as to identify the problems and to justify the development of the new system.\n\nThe new system aims at access and retrieval to authorized person, security and control against abuse. Efficiency and effectiveness will be enhanced. Timely accurate and up – to – date reports will be generated.\n\nMost importantly, the staff will be free from boring and repetitive chores from which they drive no job satisfaction. They can then redirect their effort to more challenging and creative task. They will not be made redundant by the advent of a computer – based system.",

Major Banks are mainly guided by financial profit for their shareholders.  They are after minimization of financial risks.  Such strategies don’t leave much room to people on low income or even small organizations that strive for their survival.\n\n          This research studied the computer-based loan scheme management system-as was done in Harvard Trust Bank Enugu.  Loans are readily given to people who have an account (mostly current Account) in the Harvard Trust Bank.  Apart from being a customer to the necessary for giving him loan.  Such conditions may include: provision of collateral security, having at lest one guarantor and filling the bank loan management form.  The collateral security must be a landed property before the bank will accept it.  Also, the guarantor must have an account in that bank and must be a reportable person in the society.\n\n          The role of computer in loan scheme management can never be overemphasized.  The computerized bank loan management form enables bankers to work without stress.  Information can be updated as soon as a positive change occurs.\n\n          I therefore recommend this project to all who may like to have a look at what the topic is all about.  The research work will enable them know the importance of computer in loan scheme management which yield fruitful results as that of other fields of human endeavour.\n\n1.1            STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe events of loan scheme management system have been documented. This research will evaluate the perceived motion of computer-based loan scheme management system.\n\n          In doing so, attempts will be made to answer the following questions:\n\na.                 What steps are taken in designing a computer-base loan scheme management system?\n\nb.                 How can a computer-base loan scheme management be implemented?\n\nc.                  What are the implications of not meeting the above requirements?\n\nd.                 How far have the computer-base loan scheme management system gone in achieving the desired goals?\n\n1.2            PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\nThe purpose of this study is to bring to check the anomaly associated with the Harvard Trust computer-based loan scheme management system.\n\n          As the loan scheme management is done by man, irregularities are bound to be associated with it.\n\n          If these loan scheme management systems are effectively carried out in the computer, it will yield fruitful results.\n\n1.3            AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThis project will have the following aims and objectives:\n\na.                 To shed light on the issue of computer-based loan scheme management system.\n\nb.                 To create awareness of such management to other banks who may be interested.\n\nTo suggest the ways in which a computer-based loan scheme management can be enhanced.\n\n1.4            SCOPE OF STUDY\n\nThis research work will access the design and implementation of computer-based loan scheme management system in Harvard Trust Bank Enugu.  It will look into the operations of this bank in the aspect of loan management system.  The interest charged on loans as well as the updating of information as soon as they are received.\n\n1.5            CONSTRAINTS\n\nThis project will be limited to the data available at hand, data outside the researcher will not be made use of.\n\n          The limitations militating against this research are financial constraints, time factor and other circumstances.",

The activities of the Board are meant to generate revenue for the government.  The motor licensing department are located at each of the local government Area, head- quarters of the country. The motor driving licensing office at the local government areas of a state are under the state motor licensing office. The ministry by keeping rate of all necessary documents regarding each vehicle driving owner within the state. It is surprising that despite efforts to records of registered vehicle drivers owners by the state government, these records have been disappearance. This is the issue of comprehensive record keeping is yet to be effectively handled in the state.\n\n1.1            STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nSince the inception of the licensing office or motor driving license office. There have been constant request by the staff for an enhanced or sophisticated technology tools for the processing of motor licensing data.\n\nThese constant quest are necessitated and propelled by the simple need to address the challenges posed by the existing manual system of data processing. This challenges otherwise viewed by the staff as problems among which are inaccuracies in data processed, ineffective, inefficiency in identifying and improper keeping of records.\n\nUnnecessary delays in attending to customers due to the manual processing of information and delays in going through heap of file in their achieve to get necessary information that will aid in present information processing. Lack of space in packing of file and register sometime these files are destroyed in order to make space for new ones. This lead to the destruction of vital information. Misappropriation of public and by the staff because of lack adequate means of fund management. Those misappropriation are inched by the error prone manual handling of the charge and accounting systems of this system.\n\nAbove reasons gave room to touts to operate in the premises of the establishment. They change extra money from customers whom are fed up with wastage cause by snail pace of operation in the office.\n\n1.2            PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\nThe purpose of this study is to liap-frog chasm inherent in the existing manual system of processing through a computerized approach by designing and implementing a computerized motors vehicle drivers license system.\n\nHowever, other purposes are:\n\n-                     Explore the intricacies of the computer software.\n\n-                     Demonstrate the capabilities of computer technology.\n\n-                     To eradicate the inherent problem encountered by the motor vehicle driving license office.\n\n1.3            AIMS AND OBJECTIVE.\n\ni.                    The aim of this project is to develop a software that could checkmate these ill practice, thereby  improving the present operation (manual) and also helped in the creation of a common data based for driver’s licensing system.\n\nii.                  Computerization of motor vehicle driving license system in Enugu State and the country at large. That is by using computer system and develop led programmes to replace the manual and tedious method of motor driving license exercise.\n\niii.                To keep a good record of the driver’s licenses in their office so that any information desired from the record by the authority or from any other source like the police can be easily retrieved.\n\niv.               Improved the security of motor driver’s license records against unwarranted access or malicious handling by non-personnel.\n\nv.                 To render services to the public on behalf of the government in their vehicles, issue the driver’s licenses and renew them when it expired.\n\n1.4            SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nHaving stated the problem facing motor vehicle driving license vehicle registration. This also intends to provide a common data base of registered vehicles form which enquires can be made at anytime in case of identification, if there is a loss. Also if one breaks traffic rules and regulations and tries to escape, the registration number driver’s license will aid in tracing him/her out. There is need to elaborates on the system to be computerized and maintained.\n\n          Since it is an academic exercises, the project is designed to handle only some of the activities of the department namely:\n\n1.                 Change of ownership\n\n2.                 insurance and renewal of motor license\n\n3.                 report generation\n\n4.                 enquiry\n\n5.                 modification, display, deletion, addition of motor license records.\n\nAlthough the scope of the project is limited to only Enugu state and certain customer, it could be enhanced to take care of those other state by making little additions and modification.",

However little or no thought has been given to designing a complete and through intelligence test on a computer system in out immediate environment.  Although in advanced countries, where computerized games have been developed, computers have proved that they constitute of ways of indirectly testing intelligence.\n\nThis system is designed in order to implement intelligence test on a computer system.  It tries as much as possible to incorporate the important aspect of intelligence on a wide scale.  It is designed to test intelligence of secondary school leavers using the Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE) and the University Matriculation Examination (UME) as a standardized sample, and as such the Psychological implication of such a design is very important.\n\nThe design of the system is quite simple and easily understood.  Its flexibility makes it amenable for future changes and amendment to either incorporate other aspects of intelligence or to be designed for any other school age or class.\n\nThe question of the intelligence test are programmed and visually displayed on the systemâ€™s screen in an interactive form. The student answers the question on the computer system.\n\nThe results obtained from the test give an estimate on userâ€™s (student) intelligence quotient (IQ).  This is equally displayed and tells the student in what category he/she falls within.  The result of the test is also displayed of the end of the test which goes a long way to lesson the fears of students that they were marked down in the examination.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENT\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0Introduction\n\n1.1background of study\n\n1.2statement of problem\n\n1.3aims and objective\n\n1.4delimitation\n\n1.5scope\n\n1.6limitation\n\n1.7definition\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\n2.0review of the related literature\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\n3.0description and analysis of the existing system\n\n3.1facts finding method\n\n3.2objectives of the existing system\n\n3.3input, process and output specification\n\n3.4information flow diagram\n\n3.5problems of the existing system\n\n3.6justification for the new system\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\n4.0design for the new system\n\n4.1input specification and design\n\n4.2output specification and design\n\n4.3file design\n\n4.4procedure chart\n\n4.5system flowchart\n\n4.6system requirement\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\n5.0implementation\n\n5.1program design\n\n5.2program flowchart\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\n6.0documentation\n\n6.1loading computer based intelligence test system (cbits)37\n\n6.2executing the intelligence test system (cbits)\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\n7.0Recommendation\n\n7.1References.",

As students and other institutions and organizations beginning to use the Internet as a new method for awareness creation and information search, then there comes a need for a website that will provide them with the comprehensive list of all the research materials they need. This was what motivated us into embarking on this research work.Finally, this project was well arranged for Layman’s understanding and finally the website were design in pages but the book collection was limited to computer books and some others. \n\nTABLE OF CONTENT\n\nChapter One1.0 Introduction 1.1 Statement Of The Problem 1.2 Purpose Of The Study 1.3 Aims And Objectives Of The Study 1.4 Scope Of The Study 1.5 Limitations Of The Study 1.6 Assumption 1.7 Definition Of Terms\n\nChapter Two2.0 Literature Review\n\nChapter Three3.0 Description & Analysis Of The Existing System 3.1 Fact-Finding Methods Used 3.1.1 Interview Method 3.1.2 Observation Method 3.2 Objectives Of The Existing System 3.3 Input Process / Output Analysis 3.3.1 Input Process 3.3.2 Output Analysis 3.4 Information Flow Diagram 3.5 Problems Of The Existing System 3.6 Justification For The New System\n\nChapter Four4.0 Design Of The New System 4.1 Factors Considered In Designing The System 4.2 Output Specification And Design 4.3 Input Specification And Design 4.4 File Design 4.5 Feedback Page Design 4.6 Search Page Design 4.7 System Requirements 4.8 Hardware Requirement 4.9 Software Requirement\n\nChapter Five5.0 Implementation / Web – Site Design 5.1 Program Flow Chart 5.1.1 Sign – In – Page 5.1.2 Home Page 5.1.3 Feedback Page 5.1.4 Content Page 5.2 Pseudo Code 5.3 Source Program\n\nChapter Six6.0 Documentation\n\nChapter Seven\n\n7.0 Recommendation 7.1 Conclusion References \n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\nInformation Technology is able to facilitate the revolution of changes, which optimize performance and profitability to companies because it provides solution to one of the key business and communication barriers; distance and difficulties associated with crossing them. Emergence of Internet and its technologies has led to the death of distance and collapsed the entire world into a “Global Village”.\n\nThe word Virtual means many things to many people, but according to Encarta Encyclopedia: Virtual means being something in effect even if not in reality or not conforming to the general accepted definition of term. Again it can be seen as used to describe a particle whose existence is suggested to explain observed phenomena but is not proved or directly observable. Finally, it can be seen as simulated by a computer for reasons of economics, convenience, or performance.The term “Virtual Library” emanates from Virtual Reality; the virtual reality is a system that enables one or more users to look, more, and react in a computer-simulated world. Various types of interface devices allow users to have the illusory experiences of seeing, touching, picking up, and even manipulating virtual (simulated) objects. Virtual worlds and everything in them, (including computer images of the participants) are represented by mathematical models and computer programs.\n\nA library can be seen as a room, building or institution where a collection of books or other research materials is kept or a collection of books, newspapers, records, tapes, or other materials that are valuable for research or a collection of things for use on a computer, for example programs or diskettes, or a collection of routines or instructions used by a computer program.\n\nBut, may looking at all this our main aim on this project is to make a library look virtual; thereby making the collection of books and other research materials to be in electronics form, for global access across the globe term “Virtual Library”.\n\n1.1 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMIn Nigeria as a developing country, most institutions and large organization are not yet able to create or setup standard library for their organizations especially schools (higher school in the country), thereby making it difficult for their members to have access to research data and valuable materials.It also limits them from knowing what is happening in the globe. It is likely one of the major cause or out-dated knowledge that students suffer in institution of higher learning in Nigeria.To cope with high pace technology in this information age, the researcher is prompted to provide an effective channel or medium that will serve as a virtual library through which university students and organization of different kind can have access in any-part of the world for retrieving information and for their knowledge update.\n\n1.2 PURPOSE OF THE STUDYIn the context of technological advancement, computer is playing a leading and indispensable role. This is based on its ability to provide or perform a lot of tasks.\n\nBased on this, the purpose of this study is to discourage the manual and time wasted in the process of going through bookshelves in search of books or information or data(s) in the library and also to make research material available at a point.\n\n1.3 AIMS AND OBJECTIVESComputer being one of the newest development in technology, the populace fail to apprehend its multiples retrieving importance. This study will first• Aim at utterly clearing off the misconceptions and biases about computer and discouraging the boring method of creating awareness, which does not extend to a wide society.• To provide the globe with Virtual Library where they will go in need of vital and research information.• To create a Virtual Library that will be easily updated.• To minimize research time and make it more efficient.• To setup a Virtual Library where electronics books will be centralized\n\n1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY This research work is strictly based on SAMS Publishing, Macmillan Computer Publishing’s and other electronics based publishing company that make use of the Internet, for knowledge repository.\n\nThe research also looks into necessary items and information which schools need especial the computer science students of various level; and at the same time prepares a web-site where the Virtual Library will be published, for global access.\n\n1.5 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDYA lot of factors posed as problem to the development of this study:• Time: Because the project must be completed within a specified date, the researchers do not have enough time to get all required.• This project is limited to only computer textbooks and some news journals and magazines.• Resources: Lack of resources also contributed to the limitations of the project to this extends. Everybody knows the financial state of the country now.\n\n1.6 ASSUMPTIONThe only assumption made in this work is that the users of this Virtual Library must be On-Line and must run Microsoft Internet Explorer in other to have access to the Library; and the web-site is in conformity with all the rule based on site development and will not in any form cause windows illegal operation, or misdirects the user. Finally, it is users friendly.\n\n1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMSIt has become necessary to define some of the technical terms used in their work as this will help to make the work easily understood to many lay-people, in other professions.\n\n• HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): The formatting language that makes use of tags to specify how text and other item will be displayed in the browser.\n\n• HOME PAGE: The starting point for a web site, usually the first or main page displayed upon visiting a site.\n\n• FTP (File Transfer Protocol): A protocol and a program used to transfer files between computer on network or Internet.\n\n• PROTOCOL: The rule that govern communication devices on a communication environment.\n\n• SERVER: A device or process that responds to request from clients, (terminal).\n\n• TERMINAL: The end point of a network where data can be entered or outputted.\n\n• INTERNET: A global Network of interconnected computers and Networks.\n\n• INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER (ISP): A company that provide individual and companies with an account of accessing the Internet.\n\n• PUBLISH: To make a site available to other users of Internet. \n\n• WEB SITE: A collection of information-based pages published to the net for accessible by net users.\n\n• INTERNET EXPLORER: The software from Microsoft developed for net stuffing or browse ring or searching",

The personnel database is the comprehensive information update of employees under a particular employee at a particular time.  The maintenance and management of employee information has bee a big problem in the Nigerian society workers denied of their primary and secondary entitlements and the most sad aspect of inadequacy in the maintenance of employee information is the erupt of ghost workers syndrome, this has the greatest thing this laxity in personal database system has caused in the society.  The problem of promotion is also on offspring of inadequate personnel database management; who to promote when there is necessity for promotion is always the problem faced by personnel officers in change of promotion exercise.\n\n          Workers have suffered a lot under this error of ignorance and sheet wickedness in every activity work of life, the first thing to be observed is always information about the staff involved.  This helps to give out desired incentives for the works, to help them put in their best in their work the non-payment of salary or in some cases, the delay in payment of salary is always caused by the problems associated with personnel database.\n\nThis work researched into the operational activities of existing system of maintaining personnel database in Enugu state with a view to detecting and solving the problems making it not to work out smoothly.\n\n1.2            STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe problem caused by poor management and maintenance of personnel database in Enugu state is numerous.  Th procrastination in payment of workers salary is a work force badly.  Because of the fact that act information of worker s in the state is not known the state faces the problem of how to provide incentives for its worker.  A lot of public money is been diverted into private purses due to the problem of poor information management concerning personnel records.\n\n1.3            PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to provide ever lasting solution to the current problems facing the Enugu state personnel database maintenance system through a well computerized design.\n\n1.4            AIM/OBJECTIVES OF STUDY\n\nThe primary aim of this work is to make sure that personnel database management system of Enugu State is to serve the citizen better by producing a new computerized system that will tackle the problems currently facing it.\n\nThe objectives include:\n\n1.                 To create a system that will maintain workers records randomly and give easy and tidy access to the stored record for easy information retrieval.\n\n2.                 To maintain a database that will support sorting and searching of records automatically\n\n3.                 To maintain an internecine database.\n\n1.5            SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThis study is carried out covering the totality of personnel database system in Enugu state in the areas of quick information retrieval automatic promotion list generation, ghost workers control and timely salary payment\n\nASSUMPTIONS\n\nIf the new design is completely implemented the whole problems associated with the existing system will be all solved.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A NETWORK BASED SECURITY INFORMATION SYSTEM\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW\n\n1.0            SECURITY CONCEPT\n\nSecurity is defined in many ways due to the many contexts of its existence.  In other words, security generally has to do with protection.  It might be protection from undue access.  Some attributes security to safe guiding from that, which may or may not lead to destruction.  It might also be interesting to understand that security has to do with protection of the environment.  It also has to do with valuables; this means that anything has to be secured must have value.  Things of less importance to humanity and therefore anything that pose threat to life must also be prevented.  Security is a very important issue in any organizations (system), no wonder VINCENT .E. ASOR in his seminar presentation at the Nigerian computer society’s conference of 2002 stated that an organization with 98 percent security is actually 100 percent insecure.  This means that adequate security must be in place for a smooth running of an organizational affair or a system.  The police, who is the case study organization here defined security in the police training manual as the protection of lives and property coupled with the maintenance of law and order in a society.\n\n2.1     SECURITY THREATS\n\nThey are criminal acts, which have a particular harmful effects on peoples lives and property and do more than interfere with merely private rights.  They are simply crimes, Now the above brings us to the crime concept.  What is crime? According to the BLACKSTONE, crime is violation of public rights and duties due to the whole community considered as a community.  Williams defined crime as acts that is capable of being followed by a criminal proceedings having one of the types of outcome – Punishments.\n\nAlso Hulsbury’s Law (adopted by the House of Lord’s in Board of Trade V. Ower 1957 as correct) defined crime as an unlawful act or default which is an offence against the public and render the person guilty of the act liable to legal punishment.\n\nThe summary of the above crime definitions by the police manual defined crime as an unlawful act committed by a person or a group of persons.\n\n2.2            CHARACTERISTICS OF SECURITY THREATS\n\nThey are wrong doings which Judges have held, or the parliament has from time to time laid down which are sufficiently injurious to the public to warrant the application of a criminal procedure to deal with them, of course this does not enable us to recognize an act as a crime when we see one.  Some acts are obviously harmful to the public that anyone would say they should be criminal and such acts almost certainly are, but there are many others about which opinions may differ widely.  According to SIR CARLETON ALLEN, crime is crime because it  consists of wrongdoings which directly and in serious degree threatens the security or well being of the society.  This explains why acts have to be made crimes either by judicial decisions or by legislation.  A crime may remain a crime long after it has ceased to be a threat to the security or well being of the society.  This ALLEN’S proposition tells us what (as he thinks) ought to be crime rather than what is crime.  The public nature of crimes is evidenced by the contrast between the rulers of civil and criminal procedure.  Any citizen can, as a general rule and in the absence of some provision to the contrary bring a criminal prosecution, whether or not he has suffered any special harm over and above other members of the public.  As a member of the public he has an interest in the enforcement of the criminal law.\n\n2.3            CLASSFICATION OF CRIMES\n\nThere is a problem that exist in the crime reporting system in Nigeria and especially the B’OPS COMMUNICATION OF THE POLICY, ENUGU STATE BRANCH in particular.  This arises in the variations in definition of crimes among localities.  This obstacle, as far as uniformity in definitions is concerned was removed by the adoption of a standard set of crime classification generally connotes its content.  However in reading the explanation of each category, it is very important to keep in mind that because of the differences between the state codes, there is no possibility in a system such as ‘felony’ and ‘misdemeanor’.\n\nCrime classifications are in three categories.  Viz crime against persons, crimes against property and crime of violence or crime against local acts.\n\nCrime against persons include:\n\n-        Murder and non-negligent manslaughter\n\n-        Aggravates assault forcible rape\n\n-        Forcible rape\n\n-        Robbery\n\nCrime against property includes:\n\n-        Burglary\n\n-        Arson\n\n-        Stealing\n\n-        Forgery and counterfeiting\n\n-        Vandalism\n\nCrimes against local acts include;\n\n-        Narcotic\n\n-        Illegal possession, carrying of weapons\n\n-        Prostitution and commercialized vice.\n\n2.4            SECURITY AND INFORMATION\n\nThere is no known security system that works without an information technology system.  In fact security of a given society is to a high degree determined by the amount of information technology on ground.  Thus it might interest one the to know that security are of differing contexts.  An information system for a bankers dealing via an automatic teller machine differs from a network based information system for collecting, collating and analyzing statistical data for management use.  There is also a system of inbuilt detectors in doors on entries to check explosives and metals.  There is also a camera system on focus connected to a visual display unit for monitoring activities especially in banking halls and supermarkets.  Hence information technology has a vital role to play in the task of ensuring maximum security.  This work is based on an network based information system for collecting and collating as well as analyzing crime for the use of management at all levels of an organization in their task of decision taking, planning and control strategies based on security.

People who are separated by distances can effectively and conveniently reach one another to do business together through communication. This is therefore very necessary that every government provided enough and adequate communication for it’s citizens so that they will have a sense of belonging in the Global world.\n\nThe so-called western countries are where they are today because they realized the importance of communication and followed it up with better (good) approach. The major problems in the so-called under developed countries are their nonchalant effect on the economy.\n\nOur country Nigeria is still in the “dark” age because they have failed to appreciate and fully embrace communication in its fullness. The sole telephone line subscriber (NITEL) in Nigeria today had failed to provide enough lines for its citizenry and the available ones are not distributed equally so that every citizen will have a share of the “essential commodity”.\n\nThe mode of telephone lines allocation by NITEL is inconsistent and unreliable in the sense that NITEL has failed to strictly follow the criteria laid down by it’s management in telephone line allocation. Recently, NITEL has cut down it connection fees but problem of telephone line allocation still persists. This why I chose to write this topic with a view of the coming out with a lasting solution to the work on the neck of NITEL, which affects the country today and it decreased the rate of development.\n\n1.1     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM.\n\nLines that are available in the nation today is not enough to serve the teaming population and among the available line, many are faulty because of lack of maintenance. Our government is not given enough funds to NITEL management.\n\nNITEL is crying daily for insufficient line, but with all this more than one line are allocated to some individuals\n\nThe Network of NITEL cabinets are no longer useful and the under-ground cable system is no more serving the population currently in the society.\n\nNITEL is finding it difficult to maintain the identity and record of its subscribers, this makes it impossible for them to know the people line are allocated to and those people lines are not allocated to.",

To the ultimate consumers processing of any Nigerian company especially N.B.L 9th mile Enugu to be computerized to help save difficulties encountered during the distribution of the final product. In Nigerian Breweries PLC 9th mile Enugu, where drinks like Star Lager Beer, Guilder the Ultimate, Legend Stout Beer, Guinness Stout and Guinness Malt, Amstel Malt are produced, distribution is done manually. So the aim of this project is to computerized the distribution processing and monitor the company goods.       1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY Distribution as often said is a system by which products are transferred from the production area to the final consumer through different channels like wholesalers, retailers etc. distribution started when the idea of producing goods came up. If goods are produced without being sold, it becomes a waste of time, money and resources. Distribution takes different forms. There are goods produced that need to be distributed directly to the final consumer and there are some that will undergo certain processes. E.g. the distribution channels before it gets to the final consumer. There are some companies e.g. Nigeria Breweries 9th mile which are situated or sited at the urban area. Goods produced here cannot reach those that need them in the rural area and other urban area where the goods are not produced. This is the reason why distribution is necessary and through the help of distribution channels these products get to those that need them.\n\n    1.2     STATEMENT OF PROBLEM This has to do with the title of the project, which is the design, and implementation of a computerized product in distribution monitoring system in Nigeria Breweries PLC 9th mile. Due to the setback experienced in the distribution of drinks in Nigeria Breweries PLC using manual method, the company finds it difficult and useful to spread or disseminate information on distribution. The problem caused by the use of manual method can only be solved by computerizing the distribution processing.\n\n  1.3     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The main purposes of this project are 1.     To computerize the distribution product in monitoring system in Nigerian Breweries PLC 9th mile. 2.     To devise the effective efficient cost effective means of using automated or computerized method to disseminate or spread information 3.     To ensure adequate circulation of finished product. 4.     To facilitate the services of the company to its customer. 5.     To increase turn over.\n\n1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY The beneficiaries of this study are. i.         The manufacturers. ii.        The wholesaler iii.       The retailers iv.       The consumer.\n\ni)     THE MANUFACTURERS: Computerization of the distribution processing will help the manufacturer know the brand that has the highest demand and produced it more. ii)     THE WHOLESALER: There will be no market if the wholesalers carry goods, which the customers will reject. They know the taste of their customers and types of goods they like most. These are the one they will demand or request.iii)    THE RETAILER: The retailers sell direct to customers. They know that their customers like and dislike so this study help know the actual products they prefer. iv)    THE CUSTOMER:. Computerization of distribution processing will help the customers to always get their taste because the suppliers will now know the actual products they like most and supply it to them.   1.5   SCOPE OF THE STUDY Different Nigeria Bottling companies have different ways of distributing their product. Our concern is the distribution monitoring system of Nigeria Breweries Ama 9th mile PLC. Distribution here takes three forms. Depot Delivery Self collection Direct delivery In depot delivery the drinks are being transferred from the production area to the depots in different places.  People, institution, hotels, some establishments, go to these depots to buy.  Self-collection is a process by which the customers themselves go to the production area to buy.  Direct delivery needs salesman who will come to the production area, collect the products, sell them and bring back the money to the company.",

Defining the broad extent of privatization;\n\n2.                 Stating clearly the political, economic and social objective to be achieved;\n\n3.                 Establishing clear guidelines or criteria for evaluations\n\n4.                 Selecting techniques;\n\n5.                 Ensuring transparency and accountability in the privatization process and which competitive bidding to the fullest extent possible;\n\n6.                 Building marketing up frost in each privatization operation in order to stimulate potential interest among investors and their to enhance the value of the public enterprise to be privatized.\n\n7.                 Promoting employee participation in the privatization process through the allocation of a proportion of corporate shares;\n\n8.                 Establishing procedure for monitoring the progress all results of privatization etc;\n\nThe above strategies cannot be achieved manually; many privatization programs have suffered from poor design, in adequate preparation, and weak implementation.  This is clearly evidenced by the long average time its complete transaction.  It is based on these drawbacks that the need for computerization arise.\n\nThe study will focus on the application of computerized procedures for privatization of a corporate enterprise using the Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL LTD) as a case study.\n\nSTATEMENTS OF THE PROBLEMS\n\nAlthough the problems associated with the creation of corporate enterprise have not always been clearly stated.  In spite of the bug’s investment in public enterprise in Nigeria, their senses could not meet the demand aspiration of the populace; the report of Onosode Presidential commission (1984) reveals that corporate enterprises are infested with some problems.  In the case of NITEL LTD the following problems were obsessed in relation to the on going privatization exercise in the country.\n\ni.                   Defective capital structure resulting in heavy dependency burden on national treasuring:\n\nii.                 Mismanagement of funds and operations;\n\niii.              Misuse of monopoly power cumulating in corruption and lack of competition;\n\niv.              Bureaucratize bottle necks within the organization;\n\nv.                 Lack of transpierce in the on going privatization programme;\n\nvi.              Failure to entrench operational antonomy of the enterprise in such area as authority limit, tariff determination, procurement policy constitutes major areas of concern.\n\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\n          The aims and objectives of the project work are:\n\ni.                   To create a database for the storage of all information requirements for the privatization of the enterprise.\n\nii.                 To eliminate all the darn backs of manual techniques of data collection and record keeping into computerized system.\n\niii.              Assist in the planning, designing and implementation of education and training programs for corporate groups.\n\niv.              To provide organizational efficiency through computerization.",

Certain human resources functions even though information nature was performed wherever people come together for a common purpose.\n\nThe contemporary area of human resources management begins in the late (1920’s) it was characterized by an increase concern for human element in management. During the course of this century, however, the process of managing people has become more formalized and specialized and also a growing body of knowledge has been accumulated by practitioners and scholars.\n\nThe human resources management (HRM) is a relatively modern label for the ranges of themes and practices involved in managing people.\n\nIn organization “people” (Workers) are critical factors in its well-being. Since every organization is made up of people, hiring and maintaining good and qualified people critical to the effectiveness or success of organization. For the fact that every organization is human oriented, a factor without which the organization is reduced to nothing, the process of acquiring human services, developing skills, motivating them and ensuring their loyalty in the organization are vital instrument for achieving organization objectives be it public or private sector.\n\nHuman resources is simply defined as the supply of required staff of people with various qualitative skills which when applied, organizational or institutional objectives will be achieved.  The globalization process today dictates a need for continuous improvement in productivity and quantity necessary for an effective use of new technologies on organization that would like to survive these challenges of the present and future time anticipate its system reviews and change.\n\nToday things are changing very fast the world has become so much unpredictable and uncertain especially in areas of rapid and radical technological development which focus more on computerization.\n\nThis goal could only be achieved by organization engaging in proper utilization of its human resource elements.  Manages the implementation and delivery of human resources services and operations agency-wide; implements human resources policies and operating procedures in a consistent manner throughout the agency.  Employ technology to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations, including electronic recruitment and staffing systems.  This lad to this research and project work “Design and implementation system” using the Emenite Limited (EL) Enugu as a case study of stream line the conduct of company operation with the global demand of present the technological development.  Emenite limited has been a member of the Belgium group Etex started operation in 1963 under the name ‘Turners & Sbetos cement company Nigeria Limited and later change to turners building products (Emene) Limited.  Due to dividing fortunes of the company, in March 24, 1998, turners and Newall Ltd diverted its interest in the company and transferred 51% of its shareholding to Eteroutreme societe Anonyme of Belgium (now Etex group S.A) and balance went to Eastern Zones that change the name to Emenite Limited.\n\n          In the course of the work Emenite Limited (EL) the computer is used to compute the flow of data, production, quality control, and data processing.  This production appointment will properly kept and access information, retrieval of information, storage easy and simply to generate helps to make more reports available to the management and better handling of production, appropriate quality control, personnel data and information flow in other departments.\n\n1.1            STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nThe non-satisfaction of customers demand when needed (inadequate production); the time wastage in delivery of goods; the improvement on adequate payment of workers.\n\n1.2            OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe effectiveness of an organization firm or system is determined by its ability to allow certain goals maintain itself internally and adopt to it environment.  The main of this project is to improve in production and data flow during delivery within Emenite organization using a more feasible alternative that will eliminate some of the problems in the existing system.  The set objectives of the project can be summarized as follows:\n\n-                     Improvement in production\n\n-                     To avoid unnecessary delay in time delivery.\n\n-                     To improve on adequate payment of workers.",

These processes involve monitoring and analyzing public institutions financial conditions, general and special account, management budgetary procedures, financial statements and reports, payroll/income tax calculation and salary payments, and managing cash flow.\n\n          Price to the emergence and introduction of computer all these processes and activities were done manually. The expansion of the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital UNTH, Enugu just like any other public institution, will not only intensity but also diversify the financial operations thereby making the activities increasingly difficult and wearisome. The volume of transaction has already increased to a level that requires automation.\n\n          Convincingly, the field of data processing was not easy to get by and so over the years (in the field of data processing with utmost speed), mankind has searched for the extra-ordinary. At such time came the emergence of the computer which is widely used virtually in all areas of human endeavor.\n\n          The increase in the use of computer in both public and private institutions of the world economic is an undisputable conclusion for efficiency, speed and accuracy of its operations in achieving results.\n\n          However, the manual processes and procedures of financial resources allocation and utilization is our contemporary days has been confronted with consistent problems of errors and wastage of time which are traceable to human mistakes and shortcomings.\n\n          The establishment of a sustainable, manageable, reliable and flexible financial management system for UNTH to curb these problems  inherent in the existing system is the bases of this project work. Such a financial management system will support all operational accounting procedures as well as financial management.\n\n1.1     STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\n          The problems faced in the financial management activities includes\n\n1.                 The consistent prevalence of errors in calculations carried out on financial reports which are traceable to human mistakes and shortcoming.\n\n2.                 Improper handling of financial statement, reports and records as a result of the problem of space for storage and retrieval purposes which led to many files been misplaced.\n\n3.                 The interval or time consumed in analyzing and ascertaining the accuracy and approval of financial statements and accounts which in turn affects decision making and policy formulation.\n\nThis research work is prompted to these problem g\\for it is the basis of the above problems facing manual financial management procedures and activities today that instilled the researcher to look into the subject of curbing and controlling financial management activities manually.\n\n1.2     PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\nThis project work is very essential in various ways to a number of people including the business men, sole proprietors, firms, organization, companies etc. both private and public institution whose utmost desire is to ensure expansion of their institution through proper financial resources allocation and management. It will be enormous benefits to both accountants and auditors from time to time.\n\nAlso it is to remove repetitive, inefficient processes and unclear procedures and provides adequate information supporting financial decision making which enables the institution to secure its resources against dubious minded managers as well as unreliable information.\n\n          Finally, the project work is also to serve as a reference or guide for future research to be carried out for proper documentation.\n\n1.3     AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe aim and objectives of this study is to minimize and if possible eradicate the problems or errors made by human beings due to shortcomings. This will be achieved by the establishment of a sustainable, manageable and flexible financial management system.\n\n          Another aim is to ensure that financial records are properly stored thereby preventing them from getting lost since these records will be used in the future especially when making or planning for budget.

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPUTERIZED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING SYSTEM FOR A HOTEL INDUSTRY\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFinance is the life wire of any business organization.  It is required for the execution of production, sales and administration of a business operation.  As a discipline, finance is concerned with the acquisition and administration of the use of the firms’ funds as well as profit planning and control financial analysis is inevitable for the effective planning and control of any firm.\n\n          To effectively plan for the future, the financial manager should be able to assess the financial position of the firm and relates this to its confronting investment opportunities.  Since funds are scarce, financial analysis helps the financial manager to assess the returns on investment accruing from ploughing the firms’ assets and thereby efficiently allocating resources.\n\n          However, financial accounting is the employment of the firm’s balance sheet and income statement to establish some relationship between one figure and another in order to highlight the strengths and weakness of the concerned business.  The balance sheet of a firm is also called the financial position because it shows the position of the business in monetary term at a given point in time while the income statement show how the position depicted by the balance sheet has been attained.  The results of financial analysis are normally expressed as financial ratios, which could be broadly classified as liquidity, leverage, activity and profit ratio.  The suppliers of the firm’s funds and the investing public are usually interested in these ratios.  But the nature of interest expressed on the firm determines the ratios to be emphasized by each concerned parts.  This implies that different people emphasize on different ratios and as a result financial analysis means different thing to different people.\n\n          For instance, creditors are interested on those ratios, which measure the ability of the form to service their debts and pay the principal as and when due while the equity owners are interested on the profitability ratios.  The financial manager occupies a unique position in the firm as he should be able to computer interpret and explain these ratios to various interest groups in the firm when the firm requires funds from outside sources, the financial manager should be able to use the relevant ratio to convince investors to supply their funds.  Also the financial manager should be able to justify the reasonableness of some investment or project being under taken by management before the shareholders.\n\n          However, the cost involved in the employment of a financial manager makes it mandatory for small-scale companies to engage the services of a financial consultant. The increased use of high-speed computers in various facets of business should popularize the use of financial ratios in business decision.  This is because computer would provide the necessary equipment to handle problems associated with voluminous maze of financial data due to lack of time or more.\n\n          This study therefore, aims at the development of a database for financial statements and a set of programs to computer, store and retrieve various financial ratios for some companies.\n\nSTATEMENT OF PROBLEMS\n\nThe Nigeria Company Act of 1968 stipulate that all registered companies in Nigeria should file their audited annual balance sheet this will guide the investors in the development of the funds and to provide basis for company taxation.  But there are some problems facing the financial accounting of any hotel.  These problems includes:-\n\n1.                 Illegal use of money cards – some managers has taken the privilege of using both credit and debit cards to steal companies money and some do not know how to use this cards thereby causing problems to the hotels.\n\n2.                 One of the major loopholes of an un-computerized financial accounting system is its ability to fraud a company.  This poses a problem to the management of a hotel.\n\n3.                 Some companies employ inexperienced managers who are not professionals in the field of computing and this will restrict the objectives of the computerized system to a certain limit.\n\n4.                 Insufficient fund- to set up a complete computerized financial accounting system requires a huge amount of money.  Some hotels find it difficult to afford or cannot afford it.\n\nOBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\n1.                 The use of password and other security measures enable a company to prevent unauthorized user of the files.\n\n2.                 The use of money cards by some customers will act as a security measure against armed robbers and other inconveniences ca-use by the bulkiness of their money.\n\n3.                 Information can be stored for future use and can also be retrieved at an electronic speed.  This will prevent the time wasting while using the manual files.\n\n4.                 The computer has been proved without any doubt to be far more accurate than either any know person or any previous machine performing mechanical operation with data.\n\n5.                 Computer works at incredible high speed.  It performs millions of calculations, sort and combines information in different ways within a second.\n\nDELIMITATION OF STUDY\n\nThis study is focused on Modotel, one of the prominent hotels in Enugu, owned by private individual.  It has been chosen as case study because it is expected that given it size, modernity and its promoters.  It will satisfy our data need.  In examining the management of the hotel, this project is limited to the financial aspect of the management.",

It started official production in 1981, and has to date made an enviable mark on the nation’s industrial growth, adding over 20,000 vehicles to the nations transport sector, backed up effectively with a network of over 36 after-sales service points and spare parts supply depots.\n\nMB-ANAMMCO manufactures commercial vehicles and leads in the production of both private and commercial vehicles in Nigeria.   This plant which occupies a sprawling 300,000 square meters site at Emene, near Enugu is virtually a shining example of a profitable and viable economic and technological co-operation between the government and people of Nigeria and Germany.\n\nThe multi-million-naira plant was initially planned to produce trucks for the Nigerian market.   But today, the plant has diversified its production range to include the full range of commercial and private vehicles for the rapid industrialization of the country.  It not only produces trucks as originally planned but has gone a step further in fabrication, manufacturing, and production of buses and other utility vehicles.  Part of its product range today include; MB 0131, L 608 D, MB 1520, MB 230, MB 500 SEL, MB 1414, MB 911, MB 809, fire fighting vehicles, ambulances, mobile clinic collector and other various specialized types of vehicles.  The company has expanded its bus programme to start producing a new intercity bus (MB 1635).  It should also be noted that the MB-ANAMMCO has achieved over 657 local consent in some of these vehicles, especially in buses.\n\nAs a formidable representative of MB-A in Nigeria, MB-ANAMMCO brings mecedes-benz technology and know-how to Nigerians while at the same time create over 800 employment opportunity for Nigerians.  Indeed, the establishment of MB-ANNAMMCO marked the realization of a great dream of developing the country technologically and industrially.\n\nMB-ANNAMMCO has actively participated in the federal government assisted mass transit programme.  It has supplied over 800 units of different bus models to the federal urban mass transit agency and state and local government mass transit programme.  These buses are still strong and very capable as they are supported by the unbeatable after sale s services of the company and their renowned distributors and dealers.  Only recently, the company was invited to produce 700 additional mass transit vehicles for the country to oushion the effect of the increase in the price of petroleum products.\n\nTraining facilities/opportunities centre were commissioned in April 26, 1982, sales, services and spare parts training for their staff and staff of their distributors, dealers and fliet owners.\n\nMB-ANNAMMCO continues to live up to its social responsibilities in all ramifications.  It takes care of its 800 employees by offering them medical services, recreational facilities, etc.  In addition, it occasionally donates to charity organisations and identifies with the government in its socio-cultural endeavours and community development projects.\n\n1.2            JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT\n\nComputerization or computer-based in this concept means the introduction of the computer to the different aspects and levels of the company.  Rather than looking forward to handling information from, messenger – supervisor – maintenance- engineer- manager- expatiate manager –General manager – Board of Directors, this approach is necessary because computer is nearest to information systems.  Not only that, it yields better results because a better information system normally improves organizational result.\n\nSo system must change.  The purpose of this new trend is to outline orderly methods of design and effect the changes which is systematic in changing system.  The system of modifying and reviewing them is called the system development cycle. \n\n1.3                 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe project accept different sources of spare parts, different models of vehicle and keeps track of them in files and can act any given time when needed by anybody generate the organisations report.\n\n1.4            SCOPE OF STUDY\n\nThe scope of this study is mainly for the Anambra Motor Manufacturing Company (ANAMMCO) Nig.

The answer to this is the installation and maintenance of computer network.  Furthermore, installation and maintenance of computer network is the glue that holds all data in the exact form, the data is to be transfer from one place to another.  While the procedures for installation of computer methods are embodies in this project.\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLE\n\nComputer hardware may fail, telephone line may fail and more likely, the computer software may have bugs that make the network stop working.  How does the airlines clerk sell tickets when the computer is down?  How can the pilot send a message across if the network fails?  How do you get your electronic mail, pay bills, get news, if you become dependent on computer networks that sometimes fails.  If you put a shaved database, you want to be sure that it will not disappear or be tampered with.  It you can use home computer raid your account and toil will your money?\n\nA company that puts all its important data in line runs the risk to go out of business if that information is boss or incorrect.\n\nFurthermore, support the owners of a saved data based want only certain people to use it one way to limit use, is to give a password to those people alone, that will have access to it and before opening the data base, the computer will ask the user to enter a password.\n\nPassword protection is not parted, though if someone finds out your password and use it, the computer will not know that such password is been used illegally by such person.\n\nFinally, inability of the computer scientist to observe appropriate procedure in connection during installation poses treat to them, which however may lead to damage of the computer and cards.\n\nPURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe purpose of the study is to design a system which shall render an assistance to the computer scientist during the installation and maintenance of a compute network.  Moreover, proper installation of various components of the networks are achieved and the prevention and corrective maintenance are properly added.\n\nAIM AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe aim and objectives of the study are as follows:\n\n1.       To minimize cost:          With maintenance, there is reduction in cost, i.e. instead of spending more money in the purchasing of new equipment, the money can be used in the maintenance of the faulty equipment.\n\n2.       To reduce the staff:      With the introduction of the computer network (computerized) there is possibility that the number of staff will reduce.\n\n3.       To share file and resources at a given time:-      With the computer network or files and other peripherals can be shared at any given time as printer, scanner and files.\n\n4.       To increases output:-    With the computer network; jobs that are scheduled for 10 day can be done in 3 days and this will increase output. \n\n5.       The overall objectives of the local area network:-       Is to connect the computer system and devices in the same geographical area.\n\nSCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThere are different kinds of computer network system, such as Local Area Network (LAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN) etc.  But this project is limited to only Local Area Network (LAN) and using about 100 workstation.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n\nAll area of human endeavours are usually characterized by some limits factors.  But the peculiar constraint encountered in carrying out this project are as follows:\n\n1.       Constraint of time:       The study was carried out with a given terminal data for submission due to the shortness in the semester.\n\n2.       Unavailability of language complier for use such as the c language.  That would have enable the development of more sophisticated work.\n\n3.       Virus attack:-      During programming design.  There was virus attack, which indicated start from scratch.\n\nASSUMPTION\n\nIn the design of this project, it was assured that the computer scientist should have been conversant with the use of computer hardware system computer network system and the computer software system.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ON-LINE VOTING SYSTEM\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe advancement made in technology over the past few years are astounding.  The computer alone has progressed at a remarkable pace, and updates are continually occurring.  Along with the progress of the computer comes the transformation of the virtual world.  The Internet is a fairly recent concept that has profoundly affected our daily lives.  As with anything new the Internet possesses various mysteries.  Research is being conducted to determine the possibilities of an on-line voting.  Internet voting opens the door to all sorts of possibilities for our state voting future.\n\nTherefore, voting is a means of selecting or choosing leaders, it does not apply only to local government, states and federal government of Nigeria but also in different institutions and social organization.  The conduct of elections in a democratic society is very important not only because through it a change of government is effected but also because voting is the main form of political participation for most people.  For democracy to be sound, it should be anchored on election free from fraud.\n\nOver the years, the voting operation has been put under a manual system of operation which mostly results to inaccuracy and ineffective election.  It is gradually being realized that much faster accurate, effective and efficient system is needed to be adopted.  Here on-line is to be instituted to handle voting.\n\nThe on-line voting system ensures that each intended voter is checked whether he/she is registered or not, if he/she is not registered, the system refuses him voting.  Also it checks whether he/she has voted for that particular election.  This on-line voting system prevents a situation where a particular candidate seizes the voters’ cards, and uses them to vote for himself.  Hence the rigging associated with the manual voting systems has been completely handled.  The system also takes care of result calculation of each candidate in particular election and the percentage scored in that election.  This eliminates rigging associated with the calculation and counting of votes.\n\nA means of showing the various outputs is also adopted by the system the output can either be displayed on the screen or a hard copy of it can be produced depending on the choice of the user.  This prevents international and unintentional typographical errors in showing the results of the elections.\n\nWith an on-line voting, voters can be cast only once it will also afford people who are sick and unable to go to polling stations to cast their vote to do so.  It should be noted however that on-line voting will not replace the existing ballot forms, but is offered as a supplementary way of casting a ballot.\n\n1.1            STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe inefficiency of voting process in Enugu has resulted in a lot of problems.  These problems have continued to obstruct the peace of democracy in Enugu because the choice of a capable candidate is not encouraged by the current system.\n\nThese problems include\n\n(1)High rigging during election process\n\n(2)A single voters casting his vote multiple times\n\n(3)Inefficient and inaccurate counting of voters by officers concerned.\n\n(4)Long queues observed at polling stations\n\n(5)Illegible voters casting their vote\n\n(6)Loss of votes due to either wrong voting of the use case of any accident occurring during transportation of the statement of result and other electoral materials to the collection centers.\n\n1.2            PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\nThe purpose of this study is to design and implement an on-line voting system.  The study will activate democracy and ensure that the popular choice emerges victories in any local government election conducted in Enugu state.\n\n1.3            AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe main aim of this project work is to design an on-line voting system which among others be able to achieve the following targets;\n\n(i)         Each voter will be able to vote only once\n\n(ii)      Nobody will have access to the votes before the official opening of the electronic ballot box.\n\n(iii)    The votes cast cannot be intercepted, modified or diverted.\n\n(iv)    The on-line site will resist any attack\n\n(v)      Only registered voters will have access to the application\n\n(vi)    Voters will be protected against any attempt of identified theft.\n\n(vii)The secrecy of the vote will be guaranteed\n\n(viii)      Rigging of the election will be controlled\n\n(ix)    The system will not accept vote outside the voting period\n\n(x)      It put to an end the indiscriminate alteration of election result by any officer of the electoral commission of Enugu state.\n\n1.4              SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study covers voting processes as it is done at the ward councillorship election and local government chairmanship elections.  It also inculcates the voters’ personal records, candidates’ personal records and voting procedures.\n\n1.5              LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\nDue to the fact of non-availability of the vital components required for the design and implementation of an on-line voting system, work shall be limited.  However, the immediate availability of components will help the researcher to achieve his objectives fully.\n\n1.6              ASSUMPTIONS\n\nIt is assumed that the implementation of the new system will rapidly improve the economic and the socio-political lives of the people of Enugu state.  There will be no room for rigging and election malpractice\n",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF COMPUTER BASED MARKETING INFORMATION SYSTEM\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0            INTRODUCTION\n\nThe ultimate aim of manufacturers is to produce goods they can sell to users immediately at a profit. An interaction between the producer and the consumer tales place.  This interaction is initiated, developed, and managed by producer’s marketing staff.  The business function of marketing is concerned with the planning, promotion, and sale of existing products in the existing markets and development of new products and new markets to better serve present and potential customers.\n\n Today marketing performs a vital function in the operation of a business enterprises i.e. (as the primary interface between the manufacturer and the customer).  Performing the marketing function in business has become a much difficult assignment because of the dynamic environment of today’s activities which includes:\n\n-                     Rapidly changing market demands\n\n-                     Steadily increasing consumers pressure\n\n-                     Proliferation of new products\n\n-                     Intensified competition\n\n-                     Growing government regulations.\n\nBusiness firms have increasingly turned to the computer to help them perform the vital marketing functions in the face of the rapid changes of today’s environment.  Computer, therefore, because of its speed, memory capacity, versatility and accuracy, has been the catalyst in the development of marketing information system, which integrate the information flow required by the many marketing activities.  Computer is also used to make business decision involving millions of naira and so saves man from a tremendous amount of time consuming work.\n\nToday computer is used as a control system for controlling marketing costs, diagnosis of poor sales performance.  Nevertheless, computer is also used as research system for advertising strategy, pricing strategy and evaluation of advertising expenditure and continuous experiment.\n\nThis project work, computer based marketing information system is taken to critically analyse and fashion out ways of implementing computer in Guinness (Nig) Plc.  \n\nIn this chapter, the researcher established the aim, limitation and purpose of the study, scope, statement of the problems, assumption and definition of terms.\n\n1.1     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe Guinness (Nig) Plc produces and markets over four different brands of alcoholic drinks.  These products are sent to the various stored and other branches or deport with the country.  The large volume of stock coupled with the vast distribution not work creates some control and management problems.\n\nThe operation of the Enugu deport presently is completely manual and lacks some degree of information retrieval facilities.  So, obtaining, storing and updating information on each of the items is not an easy task.  It takes hours and at times, days, to locate any information acquired due to the volume of files involved.\n\n1.2            PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe purpose of the study is to design a computer based marketing information system for Guinness (Nig) Plc.\n\n1.3            AIMS OF OBJECTIVE\n\nThe aim of this research is geared towards finding the procedure employed by the management of Guinness (Nig) Plc in obtaining information from the marketing department and to keep track records of available items when needed, its re-order, and to indicate the product that are not selling in order not to waste money in keeping stock of the quantity of good purchases, sold, and produced.\n\nThe project objective is to find solution to the misinformation of the flow of data between the marketing procedure and the management decision, by introducing a computer based marketing information system which will reduce the misinformation, be faster, accurate, reliable and improve output report that will help the management in her plans and decision making.\n\nBecause of the above problem highlighted in the old system, it becomes necessary that a new computer based data base management system may be designed to handle the duties.\n\n1.4            SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study is attempted to analyse the marketing concept of the Guinness (Nig) Plc and the ways of improving its effectiveness with the aid of computer.\n\nThe study is limited to Guinness (Nig) Plc Enugu depot with research from the marketing department.\n\n1.5            LIMITATIONS\n\nSome problems crop up in the course of carrying out the research.  These are:\n\n1.                 Financial constraint\n\n2.                 Time factor\n\n3.                 Insufficient information from the marketing department",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF COMPUTERIZED CASE MANAGEMENT INFORMATION\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0            INTRODUCTION\n\nTo understand the management application system by Sam Igbokwe and Sons Enugu, it includes not merely the profession, which is practiced in courts but also covers law teaching, law research, administration in different branches where law plays a role and in fact, commercial and industrial employment and all other activities, which postulates and requires the use of legal knowledge and skill and which adopts legal process also fall within its scope.  The wed based case management comprises all those who use technical legal knowledge through net in performing their various occupational roles.  These will include such categories as practitioners of law and legal advisers, judges and magistrates, Area court Judges and Islamic Court Judges, academic lawyers and scholars, legal technicians (e.g. consultants) etc.\n\nA case management is a person entitled to practice as a barrister (advocate) or as a barrister and solicitor.  In Nigeria, every case management is a barrister and solicitors.  For exam plc, an advocate practicing in a country whose legal system is similar to that of Nigeria may be permitted by the chief justice of Nigeria to practice as a barrister.  The chief justice has no power to permit him to practices as a solicitor.  Further more, a senior Advocate of Nigeria is not entitled to practice as a solicitor.\n\n1.1     STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nThe problem statement is mainly centralised on the existing method of wed-based case management application system.  The information obtained on-line, shows that a case management is entitled to recover his charges by action in a court of competent jurisdiction.  In General, before a case management brings such action, a bill for the charges containing particulars of the principal items included in the bill and signed by him, or in the case of a firm by one of the partners or in the name of the firm, must have been served on the client personally or left for him at his last address as known to the practitioner or sent by post addressed to the client at that address.\n\nIn addition, the period of one month beginning with the date of delivery of the bill must have expired.  There are provisions in the legal practitioners for taxation of bills of charges delivered by case management to his clients.\n\nThe council is to be consulted by the Attorney-General  of the federation before making regulations for the enrolment as legal practitioners in Nigeria, Court of  Appeal Enugu as a case study, members of the legal profession in any other country on a reciprocal basis.\n\nThe Attorney – General of the federation is also required to hold consultations with the council before varying the rates of practicing fees specified.\n\n1.2            AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe web-based case management application system has an increasingly important role in a modern state not only in dispensation of justice but also in the formulation of a just legal order and in the preservation of an efficient juristic order.\n\nThe characteristics of the on-line case management such as independence, integrity, official administration of courts and administration of justice.\n\nThere is a roll of legal practitioners kept as a roll of court and maintained by the chief Registrar of the Supreme Court of Nigeria.   In general, a person is entitled to be enrolled if and only if:\n\n(a)  He has been called to the bar by the body of Benchers; and\n\n(b)  He produces a certificate of his call to the Bar to the Chief Registrar of Supreme Court.\n\nIn general, persons whose names are on the roll of legal practitioners kept as a roll of court and maintained by the chief Register of the Supreme Court are entitled to practice as barristers and solicitors.  However, the chief justice of Nigeria may, by warrant under his hand authorise a person, whose name is not on the roll, on payment to the Chief Registrar of the Supreme Court of such fee not exceeding 50 Naira as may be specified in the warrant, to practice as a barrister for the purpose of specified proceedings and of any appeal brought in connection with those proceedings.\n\nThe power of the chief justice to authorise a person to practise as a barrister under this provision is exercisable where:\n\n(a)   an application for permission to practise as a barrister is made to the chief justice by or on behalf of any person who is the opinion of the chief justice is entitled to practise as an advocate in any country where the legal system is similar to that of Nigeria; and\n\n(b)  the chief justice is of the opinion that it is expedient to permit the person to practice as a barrister for the purpose of proceedings with respect to which the application is brought.\n\nFurthermore, a person for the time being exercising the functions of any of the following offices is entitled to practise as a barrister and solicitor for the purposes of the office:\n\n(a)   The office of the Attorney-General, solicitor-General or Director of public prosecutions of the federation or of a state; and\n\n(b)   Such offices in the public service of the federation or a state as the Attorney-General of the federation or of the state, as the may be.\n\n1.3            SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nReference could be made from different parts of the world about a case on-line.  Considering the fact that information are displayed on the web because, some Judges and Lawyers could be able to make reference on how related cases are being handled.\n\nFor instance, somebody is having a case of murder in the court and you want to search, to know how the case was treated or how it was judged.  As a lawyer, you may go on net, to search for a related case to the case you are handling and how it was treated, in order to know or for easy decision on your own cases.",

This is look upon the view that the business organization must have that exchange market with each other. It is a sore fact that the most have been a contract of which, there is an obligatory task that stands the terms of agreement it could be a payment to their client or partners or from their client who pays into their own account. Another thing matters weather it will be cash without remark balance or install mental and how many installment it is going to be.\n\n          This is clearly stated in the organization activities and manner of operation. When ever there is payment, there is also the issuing of receipts this is centered on the writing of what each party has in stock.\n\n1.1     JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT\n\nFor there to be a computerized business operation, the business most be look upon in new way of existence. No only being concerned with customers, prices output and so forth one should also consider the fact that data forms, information flows, procedures etc. it is momentous on the basic fact that computers are used as a coexisting element to information systems. This application is effective and productive because it enhances to process a more better information system (Automated)\n\n          On this work, we shall basically lok upon the possibility of making the outline orderly model of designing effect changes. The process of changing system is systematic such that it is a repetitive process. It is a fact to say that every system has what is called life cycle especially information system. By reviewing and modifying them, we say. It is a system development cycle. The routine is always cyclical. It is on the system development that the familiar input processing output feedback pattern of all systems. The system development contains the output which consist of various organization information systems. The feedback components helps evaluate the effectiveness of the system in terms of changing requirements.\n\nIN THE PROCESSING COMPONENTS WE HAVE THREE PARTS\n\nSystem Analysis\n\nSystem Design\n\nSystem Implementation.\n\n          None of these parts can be considered apart from the other two. To be courtesy, I would say that the activities involved in system development is interlinked set.\n\n1.2     DEFINITION OF PURPOSE\n\nThe rate of accepting different sources of receipt by the topic of term paper into an organization keeping track of the files can at any time operates the organizations and clients financial report.\n\n1.3     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\n          Cash Receipt system of Rorban Stores LTD is to keep records of all receipts of purchases and sales made.\n\n          By so doing, they keep information concerning each transaction such as the name of client, address, data of transaction, description of goods. Quantity of goods, model number of the goods, the amount of the goods.\n\n          Inside this record the company can then know the financial reports of both the clients and the organization itself.\n\n1.4     SCOPE (DELIMITATION) OF THE PROJECT\n\nThis term paper is basically restricted to Rorban Stores LTD, as a case study for the term paper. Looking Rorban Stores, the cash receipt systems is restricted only to the\n\n1.     Purchase receipt and or invoices\n\n2.

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NETWORK-BASED SECURITY INFORMATION SYSTEM\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0            INTRODUCTION\n\nLaw enforcement administrations, Justice systems, legislators and the government functionaries often need information to efficiently disseminate and fulfill their official responsibilities of ensuring maximum security for their subjects.  To achieve this, a system of information technology network is needed to aid the management in decision taking about the security of lives and properties.  In this work “DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A NETWORK-BASED SECURITY INFORMATION SYSTEM” I will take a case study of “B’ OPS COMMUNICATION OF POLICE SHQ ENUGU” as an existing information network system in the police and analyze their process of data collection and hence design a new system which will enhance the output.\n\n1.1     OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe objective of this program is strictly for the production of a reliable system of nation wide crime statistical information from all works and craning for administrative and operational use of the executive and law enforcement management system.  Another objective of this work is to make an improvement in the existing data security system.  To create a way of speedy data collections for security analysis.  For a network of information technology for security purpose and create a standard management information system forecasting for security together with good decision taking, planning and control programs.\n\n1.2            JUSTIFICATION\n\nThe process of executing the task of information management has been manually executed; quite unfortunately manual procedure reduces the output quality and consumed time.\n\nThis work will examine a new system where th3e much needed human efforts are replaced with machines to achieve fast collection of data and easy processing to obtain healthy outputs.\n\nAlso the need for information and data in the knowledge base doest not only answer to the problem of information over load but also helps in a state of crime statistics request, wherefore the computerization of some of this areas is very necessary because its importance in making crime investigators imbibe new and modernized methods and create public awareness of the society security policy.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW\n\n2.0            SECURITY CONCEPT\n\nSecurity is defined in many ways due to the many contexts of its existence.  In otherwords, security generally has to do with protection.  It might be protection from undue access.  Some attributes security to safe guiding from that which may or may not lead to destruction.  It might also be interesting to understand that security has to do with protection of the environment.  It also has to do with valuables, this means that anything has to be secured must have value.  Things of less importance to humanity and therefore anything that pose threat to life must also be prevented.  Security is a very important issue in any organization (system), no wonder VINCENT.E.ASOR in his seminar presentation at the Nigerian computer society’s conference of 2002 stated that an organization with 98 percent security is actually 100 percent insecure.  This means that adequate security must be in place for a smooth running of an organizational affair or a system.  The police which is the case study organsiation here defined security in the police training manual as the protection of lives and property coupled with the maintainance of law and order in a society.\n\n2.1     SECURITY THREATS\n\nThey are criminal acts which have a particular harmful effects on peoples lives and property and do more than interfere with merely private rights.  They are simply crimes.  Now the above brings us to the crime concept.  What is crime? According to the BLACKSTONE, crime is violation of public rights and duties due to the whole community considered as a community.  Williams defined crime as acts that is capable of being followed by a criminal proceedings having one of the types of outcome – punishments.\n\n          Also Hulsbury’s law (adopted by the House of Lord’s in Board of Trade V. Owen 1957 as correct) defined crime as an unlawful act or default which is an offence against the public and render the person quilty of the act liable to legal punishment.\n\n          The summary of the above crime definitions by the police manual defined crime as an unlawful act committed by a person or a group of persons.\n\nCHARACTERISTICS OF SECURITY THREATS\n\nThey are wrong doings which Judges have held, or the parliament has from time to time laid down which are sufficiently injurious to the public to warrant the application of a criminal procedure to deal with them, of course this does not enable us to recognize an act as a crime when we see one.  Some acts are obviously harmful to the public that anyone would say they should be criminal and such acts almost certainly are, but there are many others about which opinions may differ widely.  According to SIR CARLETON ALLEN, crime is crime because it consists of wrongdoings which directly and in serios degree threatens the security or well being of the society.  This explains why acts have to be made crimes either by Judicial decisions or by legislation.  A crime may remain a crime long after it has ceased to be a threat to the security or well-being of the society.  THUS ALLEN’S proposition tells us what (as he thinks) ought to be crime rather than what is crime. The public nature of crimes is evidenced by the contrast between the rulers of civil and criminal procedure.  Any citizen can, as a general rule and in the absence of some provision to the contrary bring a criminal prosecution, whether or not he has suffered any special harm over and above other members of the public.  As a member of the public he has an interest in the enforcement of the criminal law.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF CRIMES\n\nThere is a problem that exist in the crime reporting system in Nigeria and especially the B’Ops communication of the police, Enugu State branch in particular.  This arises in the variations in definition of crimes among localities.  This obstacle, as far as uniformity in definitions is concerned was removed by the adoption of a standard set of crime classification. To some extent the title of each classification generally commotes its content.  However in reading the explanation of each category, it is very important to keep in mind that because of the differences between the state codes, there is no possibility in a system such as ‘felong’ and ‘misdemeamour’.\n\n          Crime classifications are in three categories.  Viz crime against persons, crimes against property and crime of violence or crime against local acts.\n\n          Crime against persons include:\n\n-                     Murder and non negligent manslaughter\n\n-                     Aggravates assault\n\n-                     Forcible rape\n\n-                     Robbery \n\nCrime against property includes:-\n\n-                     Burglary\n\n-                     Arson\n\n-                     Stealing\n\n-                     Forgery and counterfeiting\n\n-                     Vandalism ",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF DATABASE SYSTEM FOR PATIENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1            THEORETICAL BACKGROUND\n\nDatabase is a collection of logically related files, organized in a manner to satisfy the needs of an organization.  A database is a store of data structured so that access and update can be made by different people in different ways without needs to change its design or content for this to happen, it is essential that all data items are logically related.\n\n          Database is always necessary to store date items once, because of it, input cost are lower.  Duplicate letters are largely dominated thereby saving space and ensuring data consistency.  Data is defined as an unprocessed facts.  They are raw fact that are unprocessed.  Data does not have meaning.  Information are processed data through the computer, which process different type of information.  Information in the computer is stored in codes. File is the collection of related filed, field is the collection of data items.\n\n          Database management system are important, because important information requirement and non-specialist need easy ways of accessing this information.  Large amount of data with many types of records occurring many times in database management system.  Also in database management system, complex data structures including many relationships between data items.  Many organization will have many use requirement in data base management system.  Organizations will also have many frequent demand for changes to be made which only unflexible database management system can cope with.\n\n          Data is viewed as a source to be shared by as many process as possible.  As a result, data must be organized in a way that is flexible and adaptable to un anticipation requirements.  The data which they stored in anticipation of requests, and the requests themselves. Data may be stored as references to documents, microforms or computer coded text, graphics etc.  the service may be offered on a local basis or through a telecommunication network.  Database system may be operated by organizations for their own benefit or offered to the public on a subscription basic.  The output from database services is either a document or computer data presented, say, on a video display unit or a voice output.\n\n          The main purpose of database is to satisfy the user information needs.  The way in which these needs are expressed largely determined the principles of operation of a particular database system.\n\n          Rerhaps the most straight forward request for database is when the user supplies a complete reference for a document. The job of the service then is to locate a copy of the document and deliver it to the user.   This is usually referred to as document retrieved service.  It may be aided by computers in compelling the index to the documents in store, and in physically locating a required document as in a computerized warehouse.\n\n          More after then not, however, database need are expressed in terms of a request for data such as, how many patient are being admitted monthly in a hospital? Or what kind of sickness of a patient? To answer such questions reference must be made to records stored either in printed form or as computer coded data.  The first of there is often refered to as information retrieval, the later as database search, when the index to the printed record is computerized.\n\n          The database distribution system, with the added facility of storage at computer coded text, offer one approach to reducing, the physical size of records, and to mechanizing their search and  retrieval the records unfortunately, first have to be converted into computer compatible form, and can be consulted only after reconversion via some printing or display device.\n\n1.2            STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThere has been this problem of too much work for the nurses in the hospital.  Owing to the growing population of patient in the hospital, the nurses is faced with hips of file.  At times, sorting out a particular patient file takes most a month.\n\n          Also there has been cases of missing files. Due to lack of security in the office and the poor filling system in use, the patient files at times get lost and it then becomes difficult to access the concerned patient information.\n\n          This bitter complaints and the delay in the receiving of information for the management had been the major concern and therefore has intensified the need to design a software which will go a long way in tackling these problems and at the same time helps to quicken database processing.\n\n1.3            PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe purpose of the study is to design and implementation of database system for patient management system.\n\n\n",

This research is intended to highlight the role of a computerized Stock Marketing Report information system in NSEC Compare to the manual system of Stock Marketing Report. To identify the various problems involve in the existing Stock Marketing Report information system of NSEC is the purpose of this research and to the proffer solutions to them. Data were collected both by interview methods and observation method. Stock Marketing Report models had developed in this research as well as Stock Marketing Report system. Secondly, the study also investigates how NSEC manages the Stock Marketing Report information system. Finally computer based Stock Marketing Report information system is suggested as a solution to more structured, efficient and effective Stock Marketing Report control.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n 1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\nThe ultimate aim of manufacturers is to produce goods they can sell to users immediately at a profit. An interaction between the producer and the consumer tales place. This interaction is initiated, developed, and managed by producer’s Stock Marketing Report staff. The business function of Stock Marketing Report is concerned with the planning, promotion, and sale of existing products in the existing markets and development of new products and new markets to better serve present and potential customers.\n\nToday Stock Marketing Reports performs a vital function in the operation of a business enterprises i.e. (as the primary interface between the manufacturer and the customer). Performing the Stock Marketing Report function in business has become a much difficult assignment because of the dynamic environment of today’s activities which includes:\n\nRapidly changing market demands Steadily increasing consumers pressure Proliferation of new products Intensified competition Growing government regulations.\n\nBusiness firms have increasingly turned to the computer to help them perform the vital Stock Marketing Report functions in the face of the rapid changes of today’s environment. Computer, therefore, because of its speed, memory capacity, versatility and accuracy, has been the catalyst in the development of Stock Marketing Report information system, which integrate the information flow required by the many Stock Marketing Report activities. Computer is also used to make business decision involving millions of naira and so saves man from a tremendous amount of time consuming work.\n\nToday computer is used as a control system for controlling Stock Marketing Report costs, diagnosis of poor sales performance. Nevertheless, computer is also used as research system for advertising strategy, pricing strategy and evaluation of advertising expenditure and continuous experiment.\n\nThis project work, computer based Stock Marketing Reports information system is taken to critically analyse and fashion out ways of implementing computer in NSEC.\n\nIn this chapter, the researcher established the aim, limitation and purpose of the study, scope, statement of the problems, assumption and definition of terms.\n\n1.1     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe NSEC produces and markets over four different brands of alcoholic drinks. These products are sent to the various stored and other branches or deport with the country. The large volume of stock coupled with the vast distribution not work creates some control and management problems.\n\nThe operation of the Enugu deport presently is completely manual and lacks some degree of information retrieval facilities. So, obtaining, storing and updating information on each of the items is not an easy task. It takes hours and at times, days, to locate any information acquired due to the volume of files involved.\n\n1.2  PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe purpose of the study is to design a computer based Stock Marketing Report information system for NSEC.\n\n1.3 AIMS OF OBJECTIVE\n\nThe aim of this research is geared towards finding the procedure employed by the management of NSEC in obtaining information from the Stock Marketing Reports department and to keep track records of available items when needed, its re-order, and to indicate the product that are not selling in order not to waste money in keeping stock of the quantity of good purchases, sold, and produced.\n\nThe project objective is to find solution to the misinformation of the flow of data between the Stock Marketing Reports procedure and the management decision, by introducing a computer based Stock Marketing Report information system which will reduce the misinformation, be faster, accurate, reliable and improve output report that will help the management in her plans and decision making.\n\nBecause of the above problem highlighted in the old system, it becomes necessary that a new computer based data base management system may be designed to handle the duties.\n\n1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study is attempted to analyse the Stock Marketing Report concept of the NSEC and the ways of improving its effectiveness with the aid of computer.\n\nThe study is limited to NSEC Enugu depot with research from the Stock Marketing Report department.\n\n1.5 LIMITATIONS\n\nSome problems crop up in the course of carrying out the research.

This because the only reason for the setting up of a hotel is to maximize profit.  They do not take into account the welfare and condition of their customer.  This result in many of the customers not being satisfied after their stay in these hotel due to poor management and time wasting in the flow of information with and outside the hotel environment.  Using zodiac hotel lit examing the effect of computerization of hotel front office management information system in our hotels.\n\nZodiac hotel ltd is one of the well know hotel in Enugu and it is a private limited company.  It is located at 5/7 rangers Avenue, Enugu.\n\nIt was established in 1979 by late honorable MR.P.N. Okeke.  The administration of zodiac hotel is as follows:\n\nExecutive director, board of directors, managing director, head of department/supervisors and staff.\n\nMake up the firm are Admin. Dept., account dept., reception, cash office, business center telephone exchange, restaurant, bar house keeping laundry, gardeners, reception waiters, store dept, driver section, kitchen dept, car hire section and security dept.\n\n1.1     STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nThe present system of hotel front office management information system in Nigeria  has a lot of problem which are mentioned below.\n\nSPEED OF OPERATION:\n\nSpeed of operation is a measure of the time lapse from when a process starts to workers to when it end. Since the present system is manually operated, there is tendency for the workers of checking-in a guest, issuing of receipts checking-out a guest can take the receptionist (front officer) hour to finish.\n\nACCURACY\n\nIn term of accuracy, the  system is relatively slow and since it is dependent to human effort, so inevitable, it is also prone to human errors and omission. Example the issuing of receipts, most of the time is not accurate.  The bills prepared are sometime over charged or undercharge and this can be very embarrassing to both  guest and the management.  The overcharging or under charging could be due to the receptionist’s carelessness or the inefficiency of the part of the account section.\n\nDOCUMENT INTEGRITY\n\nThis is viewed in the context of the safety, invalidity of the records in the document files used in the report generation.  In terms of safety, the nature of the system (manual) makes it vulnerable to left, fire or accidental destruction.  This makes the system unsafe as the time needed to replace lost data or files in enormously large\n\nCOST:\n\nThis is the greatest problem of the hotel.  The hotel tends to loose a lot of money running the hotel manually.\n\nTIME:\n\nGoing by the present system of operation time is consumed in the handling of operation and management of information in the hotel.\n\nThese problem and many other not listed above due limitations, form the basis of this write-up",

Payroll is being prepared by organization, committees, governments and other business firms, it is also part of account department, in my organizational concern.  It is used for the preparation of worker’s salary daily, weekly or monthly.\n\nThe payroll module, which helps in data processing, processes monthly pays of all the employees in state civil services commission.  The module maintains staff loans, advances, tax and other deductions from staff pay.  It also performs annual increment on the salary of qualified staff each month.  The payroll lists every employee for whom the computer has produced a payroll cheque and shows for each employee what deduction are subtracted from gross earnings to arrive at net pay.  This report is reviewed by the manager of the payroll department before the cheques are released for distribution.\n\n1.2            PROBLEM DEFINITION\n\nOver the years, manual method of payroll has been used.  This method has its problems.  It has been proven to be very ineffective and inefficient. Some of the problems are\n\nØThe job of preparing salary payment in annually is tedious causes delay.\n\nØAs a result of the problem above, manual methods have a lot of discrepancies and raise doubts in the voucher.\n\nØThis method encourage fraud figures are easily manipulated and changed.\n\nØThe manual method requires people who are competent in mathematics related computation to do a reliable job.  As a result people of such are very scarce.\n\n1.3            OBJECTIVES OF STUDY\n\nThe study aims at designing a payroll accounting system that will help to eliminate instances, delay and frauds associated with manual calculation of workers salaries and entitlements.\n\n1.4            SCOPE OF STUDY\n\nThe study aims at designing and implementing a state civil service commission payroll accounting system Enugu.\n\n1.5            LIMITATIONS\n\nIn the process of carrying out this research work, some factors tried to hinder the free flow of work.  These factors include\n\nØTime:          Time factors in the sense that the semester was short and as a result combing this work with studies was tedious.\n\nØFinance:     Finances were rather on the lean side and as a result it affected the carrying out the research in that monetary commitment was needed for going to the case study, photocopying document, browsing e.t.c.\n\nØLukewarm attitude of the staff:      The staff of the payroll department were rather hostile and aggressive owing to the fact that the felt of this activity is computerized they might loose their jobs to the computer.\n\n1.6            ASSUMPTIONS\n\nIf the designed new system is implemented it may improve and to be a large extend enhanced the activities of processing staff salary payment in state civil commission Enugu office.\n\nThe worker will be relived by the tedious tasks facing them in the discharge of their duties.  They will have more time to themselves and also increase their standard of work.\n\n1.7            DEFINITIONS OF TERMS\n\nØComputer:Computer is management and business studies (1979), defined a computer as an electronic device that is capable of inputting and outputting, sorting, storing and retrieved of information stored in it.\n\nØPayroll:      List of employee and all their wages and salaries including their allowance and deductions.\n\nØSalary:       This is usually a monthly payment for regular employment on a yearly basis.\n\nØShift Allowance:  This is the allowance granted to an employee who works on shift basis.\n\nØArrears:     This represents the accumulation of staff entitlement.\n\nØRent Subsidy:      These represent the rent given to an employee for his or her house.\n\nØFlowchart:It is a pictorial representation of information in data processing by means of symbols and interconnecting linking the generations.\n\nØTransport Allowance:  This is the allowance given to a staff for his transportation to work.",

        "content": "MINIMIZING FILE DOWNLOADING TIME IN STOCHASTIC PEER TO PEER NETWORKS\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0     INTRODUCTION\n\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) technology is heavily used for content distribution applications. The early model for content distribution is a centralized one, in which the service provider simply sets up a serve and every user downloads files from it. In this type of network architecture (server-client), many users have to compete for limited resources in terms of bottleneck bandwidth or processing power of a single serve. As a result, each user may receive very poor performance. From a single user perspective, the duration of a download session, or the download time for that individual user is the most often used performance metric.\n\nP2P technology tries to solve the issue of scalability by making the system distributed. Each computer (peer) in the network can act as both a server and a client at the same time. When a peer complete downloading some files from the network, it can become a server to service other peers in the network. It is obvious that as time goes on, the service capacity of the entire network will increase die to the increase in the number of servicing peers. With this increasing service capacity, theoretical studies have shown that the average download time for each user in the network is much shorter than that of a centralized network architecture in ideal cases (2), (3). In other words, users of a P2P network should enjoy much faster download.\n\n1.1     STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS\n\nOwing to:\n\ni)            The difficulties people face in locating a web application workshop.\n\nii)          Urgent need to contact a web application workshop at emergency time.\n\niii)        Improper management of information/data in a web application workshop.\n\niv)         Difficulties people encountered when ordering for web application workshop tools/equipment.\n\nv)             Time wasted in contacting a web application workshop\n\nThe need arise for the development of download wizard for simultaneous download.\n\n1.2     PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to put to an end the difficulties people encountered in a minimizing file downloading time in stochastic peer to peer network workshop. This is actualized by download wizard for simultaneous downloads which is user friendly and interactive. By the time this software is  designed and implemented, the difficulties encountered. By the time this software is designed and implemented, the difficulties encountered with manual method of contacting and receiving information will be eliminated.\n\n1.3     AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe aims and objectives of this project are listed below:\n\n·        To develop software called download wizard for simultaneous download that will replace the manual method of processing information.\n\n·        To develop, promote, and provide adequate and efficiently coordinated web application workshop services at reasonable rates.\n\n·        To maintain an efficient system of collection, sorting and delivery of web application workshop fault and solution.\n\n·        To demonstrate increased motivation to the KIAMOTORS workers.\n\n·        To provide a means of contacting web application workshops at any given time.\n\n·        To eliminate the error involved with the manual method of processing data/information in a web application workshop.\n\n·        To save the time wasted with manual method of processing data/information and items.\n\n·        To establish and maintain minimizing file downloading time in stochastic peer to peer network workshop services.\n\n1.4     SCOPE OF STUDY\n\nThis project work s narrowed to KIAMOTORS Enugu.

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF REAL TIME CURRENT ACCOUNT TRANSACTION PROCESSING SYSTEM\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn the twentieth Century, the banking world has seen a continuing process towards fully computerized operations.  At the start of the century there were few mechanical aids with all ledgers, passbook and account statements being written by hand.  By 1920s the banks had graduated to mechanical accounting combined with an increase in business, this trend towards mechanization was continuous process, the staffing and expansion difficulties were tackled more forcibly on the 1950 with assistance from electronic data processing techniques.  It was on the period that banks ordered their first computers.\n\nThe early installations were of a batch processing nature of data that had to be sent for processing at the computer centre and reports produced.  Throughout the 1960s more of the clerical work was computerized and eventually by the end of 1960s all accounts were computerized.\n\nIn the middle of 1960s the utilization of branch terminal equipment which linked directly to computer centre was becoming a feasible proposition.  This culminated in the early 1970s with the introduction of a sophisticated real time system in current Account Transaction Department.\n\nThis project aim is to produce an indigenous software package, which will be used to improve the efficiency of the CURRENT ACCOUTN TRANSACTION PROCESSING SYSTEM for Nigeria Banking Industry.  Although banks have developed packages, however, because of the following reasons they have failed to meet the need of the Nigerian Banking Industry.  Firstly, guidelines and policies for banks in Nigeria are controlled by central banks of which they revise annually thereby resulting in unsteady policies as a result; there is no standard whatsoever set for the banking industry thus banking policies are flexible.\n\nMost of these banks use packages without modification hence the result is not what they desire.  The modification of these packages to suit the Nigeria Banking Industry will cost expenditure to be wasted.\n\nEfficiency in the banks has always been the foundation underlining the effectiveness of banks operation.  Quick and accurate settlement of customers withdrawals, fast depositing system and procedures and the over acknowledged information process with which customers usually regard are also problems which computerized current transaction processes wishes to address by introducing Nigeria software packages.\n\nThis package will help Nigerian banks to obtain the efficiency in their current accounting transaction hence draw more customers and more money.  It is menu driven and features top-down and structured programming techniques.\n\nReal mode of operation provides an instantaneous transaction and processing of data, which gives immediate availability of result for decision-making.  It has improved the efficiency of banks by:\n\n(i)           Customers; henceforth spent much less time in collecting their money.\n\n(ii)        There were seldom any mistakes because computer handled almost all operations.  If there is any mistake, the computer can always easily pick it.\n\n(iii)      There was customer’s satisfaction and bank recorded substantial increase in their profits.\n\n1.1            STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS\n\nThere are many methods that are being used in current account transaction processing system.  Unfortunately, these methods are not always real in practice, to the day society.  Even when they are real, they are not as efficient as expected.  Some of the problems encountered by UBN are:\n\n(i)                Lack of computer for storage, there is tendency of the UBN to loose customer’s file which will bring distrust to them;\n\n(ii)             Due to lack of computer for accessing the file, there is tendency for them to be shown in retrieval of customer’s files, and updating of files.\n\n(iii)           Customers spend much time due to the delay of the bank.\n\n(iv)           Once there is not computer for calculation, there is tendency for their calculation to be inaccurate.\n\nHowever, the researcher shall by the end of this work provide a suitable solution to these pressing problems of Current Account Transaction processing system.\n\n1.2            PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nAll effects of the researchers are pearled towards the gathering of sufficient information that would help in making suggestions as to how the current accounts transaction will be alleviated in the banks using real time mode of operation.  The study attempted:\n\n(i)                To reduce staff pressure: With the increased utilization of banking services, branch staff have been placed on a pressure situation in which they are expected to deal with increasing volumes of business with computer, there is relief of clerical boredom.\n\n(ii)             Improve customer service: It has been felt for some time that the high standards of customer service are deteriorating largely due to the fact that branch staff is under continuing pressure to deal with more transactions rate.\n\n(iii)           To increase the efficiency and productivity of bank services.\n\n(iv)           Care at immediate response to account inquiries, information will be provided more quickly than under a manual or batch system.  It is possible for example to monitor the cash flow into and out of the branches as the movement occurs.\n\n(v)             Reliability: The information provided by computer system is more accurate and reliable than that produced under a manual system subjective judgments and human inaccuracies are to a great extent eliminated.  It could be urged, however, that middle management is being by-assed and the responsibility of the branch manager’s role is being diminished.  The interpretation of branch statistics and the resultant decisions can now be made centrally and they will not be subject to possible personal considerations.\n\n(vi)           Variety: The real-time system allows a greater variety of management information to be produced.  Furthermore, this information is of greater quantity that can be envisaged under a manual system.",

        "content": "IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES FOR THE DETECTION AND REMOVAL OF CRACKS IN DIGITIZED PAINTINGS.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMany paintings, especially old ones, suffer from breaks in the substrate, the paint, or the varnish. These patterns are usually called cracks or craquelure and can be caused by aging, drying, and mechanical factors. Age cracks can result from non-uniform contraction in the canvas or wood-panel support of the painting, which stresses the layers of the painting. Drying cracks are usually caused by the evaporation of volatile paint components and the consequent shrinkage of the paint. Finally, mechanical cracks result from painting deformations due to external causes, e.g. vibrations and impacts.\n\nThe appearance of cracks on paintings deteriorates the perceived image quality. However, one can use digital image processing techniques to detect and eliminate the cracks on digitized paintings. Such a ”virtual” restoration can provide clues to art historians, museum curators and the general public on how the painting would look like in its initial state, i.e., without the cracks. Furthermore, it can be used as a non-destructive tool for the planning of the actual restoration. A system that is capable of tracking and interpolating cracks is presented in [1] . The user should manually select a point on each crack to be restored. A method for the detection of cracks using multi-oriented\n\nNovember 30, 2005 DRAFT Gabor filters is presented in [2] . Crack detection and removal bears certain similarities with methods propose for the detection and removal of scratches and other artifacts from motion picture films [3] , [4] , [5] . However, such methods rely on information obtained over several adjacent frames for both artifact detection and filling and thus are not directly applicable in the case of painting cracks. Otherresearchareas that are closely related to crack removal include image inpainting which deals with the reconstruction of missing or damaged image areas by filling-in information from the neighboring areas, and disocclusion, i.e., recovery of object parts that are hidden behind other objects within an image. Methods developed in these areas assume that the regions where information has to be filled-in are known. Different approaches for interpolating information in structured [6] , [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] and textured image areas [11] have been developed. The former are usually based on partial differential equations (PDE) and on the calculus of variations whereas the latter rely on texture synthesis principles. A technique that decomposes the image to textured and structured areas and uses appropriate interpolation techniques depending on theareawhere the missing information lies has also been proposed [12] . The results obtained by these techniques are very good. A methodology for the restoration of cracks on digitized paintings, which adapts and integrates a number of image processing andanalysis tools is proposed in this paper. The methodology is an extension of the crack removal framework presentedin [13] . The technique consists of the following stages:\n\n§  Crack detection.\n\n§  Separation of the thin dark brush strokes, which have been misidentified as cracks.\n\n§  Crack filling (interpolation).\n\nA certain degree of user interaction, most notably in the crack detection stage, is required for optimal results. User interaction is rather unavoidable since the large variations observed in the typology of cracks would lead any fully automatic algorithm to failure. However, all processing steps can be executed in real time and thus the user can instantly observe the effect of parameter tuning on the image under study and select in an intuitive way the values that achieve the optimal visual result. Needless to say that only subjective optimality criteria can be used in this case since no ground truth data are available. The opinion of restoration experts that inspected the virtually restored images was very positive.\n\nDigital image processing techniques can be used in the restoration of digitized paintings which contains cracks. Old Paintings suffer from breaks in the paint, or the varnish. These patterns are usually called cracks and can be caused by aging, drying, and other mechanical factors. This cracks can be rectangular, circular, spider-web, unidirectional, tree branches and random. Cracks also depend on the materials used for the painting, the painting technique of the artist, the atmospheric variations and storage conditions. The appearance of cracks on paintings deteriorates the legibility of image.\n\nA virtual restoration can provide clues to art historians, museum curators and the general public on how the painting would look like in its initial state.\n\nPROBLEM STATEMENT:\n\nAmong many proposed system crack were detected manually where user needs to specify the initial crack location for filling of cracks. The Crack filling algorithm gives the blurring effect on image.\n\nProposed system will detect crack automatically. It will find low luminance intensity point and apply top hat transformation. And then fill these crack pixels using order statistics filter.\n\n                    MOTIVATION:\n\nPaintings which are made by paint or other material suffer from break due to some factor; it makes some pattern like structure is called cracks. Because of this cracks paintings are damaged. Original effect of painting is lost. Craquelure is the fine pattern of dense \"cracking\" formed on the surface of materials, either as part of the process of ageing or of their original formation or production. The term is most often used to refer to tempera or oil paintings, where it is a sign of age that is also sometimes induced in forgeries and ceramics. It can also develop in old ivory carvings, and painted miniatures on an ivory backing are prone to craquelure.\n\nSo in our project we are trying to restore paintings virtually so that people can get idea of that painting i.e. how the paintings usually look like.Our proposed system is automated to detect and remove the cracks from the cracked images.It can be used in museums in case of expensive paintings.\n\n                    SCOPE\n\nOld cracked painting will be scanned and converted to digital image by converting it to jpeg or jpg format.Proposed system will detect only low luminance pixel by Top Hat Transform and it will not detect high intensity pixel values.The Top Hat transformation generates a grayscale output image with no background. Threshold is applied to generate crack map. Crack Filling is done by order statistic Filters.",

        "content": "PREDICTIVE JOB SCHEDULING IN A CONNECTION LIMITED SYSTEM USING PARALLEL GENETIC ALGORITHM.CHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n§ \n\n         Background of the study\n\nPredictive job scheduling system is a model of the scheduling algorithm. The scheduler can learn from the previous experiences. Selection and crossover are considered in the entire population; each individual may compete and mate. A binary encoding is used to convert the scheduling problem to chromosomes. Each chromosome has genes. The efficiency may be high if the same jobs have to be scheduled. The scheduler starts with no prior information about the jobs at first. After each allocation the information is stored to the history base. The job of specific requirement comes again a different combination is tried according to the resource availability if the execution time is lower then it is recorded. This is called the learning phase. If a new job which has not yet scheduled by the scheduler, then the system is put to a brief learning phase again. The encoding process is done by assuming that a chromosome has the following gene structure. Chromosome {gene1, gene2, gene3}; Gene1 is the job identifier; Gene2 is the resource identifier and Gene3 is the node identifier.\n\nThe fitness function f is the execution time of that job at the node. The population generation is done by assigning binary set values for each of the genes. Job A may be encoded as 00 and job B may be encoded as 01 and so on. The same method can be used to represent all genes. The sample population may have individuals such as 00 01 10. After the population is built in the learning phase, the fitness of the individual is recorded as the execution time of the job at the node. The next time the same job is to be scheduled the history information is checked. a new gene combination is found and job  scheduled and the fitness recorded.  After time T the genetic operator of crossover is applied and the individuals of the same job type are selected for crossover.\n\nThe proposed algorithm procedure for the learning phase is by creating the population by encoding the problem.  Add chromosome to the history if it does not exist in the history, else, try a different combination of genes} If job details available in history.  Then, if the resource is available, then send the job to the node; else try a different resource if it is available. Initiate the learning procedure after time T apply the Genetic Operators on the history information. The Genetic Algorithm Scheduling increase execution time at first and then, improved as time progressed. The future work may involve the different and more efficient methods of encoding a problem and different genetic operators and methods.\n\nThe Genetic algorithm (GA) is a stochastic search algorithm based on the principle of natural selection and recombination [1] . It is a kind of evolutionary algorithm and has been successfully applied to solve many optimization problems, e.g., knapsack problems, shop scheduling problems or travelling salesman problems [2] [3] [4] . Nevertheless, when GAs are applied to more complex and larger problems, the required time to find adequate solutions is increased. Particularly, repeated fitness function evaluation is often the most prohibitive and limiting segment when GAs are hired to find an optimal solution for high-dimensional or multimodal implementations. Meanwhile, GAs also suffers from the problem of a tendency to converge towards local optima rather than the global optimum. Previous works in this area suggest enlarging population size, increasing mutation rate or hiring niche penalty in selection to keep the diversity of GAs. However, any of them may raise the complexity of the algorithm and lead to more time consumption.\n\nNo doubt, parallel implementation is considered as one of the most promising choices to make GAs work faster. There are different ways of exploiting parallelism in GAs [5] : master-slave models, fine-grained models, island models and hybrid models. The master-slave model is the only one that does not affect the behavior of the algorithm by distributing the evaluation of fitness function to slaves. The fine-grained model works with a large spatially population. The evolution operations are restricted to a small neighborhood with some interactions by overlap structure. The island model divides populations into subpopulations. Subpopulations on the islands are free to converge towards different sub-optima and a migration operator can help mix good features that emerge from the local island. The hybrid model combines any two of the above methods.\n\nPowerful search technique based on mechanics of biological evolution is used to solve a difficult problem in many disciplines can provide efficient and effectives techniques for optimization and machine leaning applications. In GA, It is necessary to select a specific number of inputs.  For instance, x1, x2 ... xn which belong to the input space X. Each input in the GA terminology called an organism or chromosome. The set of chromosomes is designated as a colony or population. Computation is done over epochs. In each epoch the colony will evolve according to specific rules reminiscent of biological evolution. G.A phases include: Initial Population; Evaluation of fitness function; Parent selection; Crossover operation and Mutation. G.A begins with a set of k randomly generated states. These states are satisfactory to the problem. The representation of solutions should be encoded as; Real numbers   (1,2,….9); Binary encoding    (0s,1s) and List of rules    (R1,R2,R3). Evaluation of fitness function, to each chromosome xi, we assign a fitness value that is the function of xi (f (xi); Fitness: string value; Properties: best string highest fitness function, if s1 is better than s2, then f (s1)> f (s2).   Stronger individual chromosomes with fitness values closer to the colony optimal will have greater chance to survive across epochs and to reproduce than weaker individuals which will tend to die. The important step in the algorithm is reproduction or breeding which happens once per epoch. The content of the two chromosomes participating in reproduction are literally merged together to form a new chromosome that a child. This heuristic allows us to possibly combine the best of both individuals to yield a better one. On mutation, perform exploitation on the current best strings (performs random local search). Let e an element of the string\n\ne\n\n10011010\n\nThe value of e, ᵾ e € string is changed with some probability p (usually low)\n\n10001010\n\nGenetic Algorithm application level scheduling algorithm generates the initial population, evaluates each individual’s fitness, and performs genetic operations on the Individuals with high fitness such copying, crossover and mutation, to generate a new population. The genetic process continues with the new population until a nearly optimal jobs assignment strategy is obtained. Finally, the jobs are assigned to each node based on the strategy. Total execution time is the time between the beginning of execution of the first job of a series and completion of the last job. Average turnaround time is the average, for each job from when the job arrives to when the job finished. Parallel implementation of GA provides considerable gains in terms of performance and scalability. It can easily implemented on network of heterogeneous computers or in parallel mainframes.\n\n1.2              Statement of the Problem\n\nThe predictive job shop scheduling problem is one of the best known combinatorial optimization problems where jobs are assigned to machines at particular times. The use of evolutionary algorithms for shop scheduling problems started around 1980 [6] . There have been a huge number of publications dealing with GAs for shop scheduling problems. Due to the NP hardness, the time cost to obtain an adequate solution by the serial GA is always heavy. With the development of high performance computing (HPC) in last decades, the implementation of parallel GAs to shop scheduling problems has been extensively studied. The purpose of this paper is to give a tutorial survey of recent works on solvingscheduling problemsin manufacturing systems using parallel GAs. There are three ways to classify the scheduling problem in manufacturing systems by the machine environment, the job characteristics and the optimization criterion [7] . Most of the works concern on the three basic types: a flow-shop, a job-shop and an open-shop. In a flow-shop, each job passes through the machines with the same order whereas a job-shop enables specified jobs have possibly different machine orderings. In an open-shop, there is no particular route imposed on jobs. In addition to theses three types, flexible shops also catch a lot of attentions. It is a combination of a shop scheduling problem and a parallel machine scheduling problem, in which at least one stage consists of several parallel machines [6] . Most of the works considered are the flexible flow shop or the flexible job shop.\n\n1.3     Objectives of the study\n\nThe general objective of this study is to design and implement predictive job scheduling in a connection limited system using parallel genetic algorithm. The scheduling system will analyze load situation of each node and choose one node to run the task.  The scheduling system has to realize the load balancing and increase the throughput and resource utilization under restricted condition, when the system is heavily loaded.\n\n§     \n\n Si   Significance of the study\n\nThe significant of this study includes the following: If multiple tasks arrive during a unit scheduling time slot, then scheduling system will be responsible to allocate an appropriate number of jobs to each node in order to finish these jobs under a defined intent. The benefit is usually the minimal average execution time. This scheduling policy is application- oriented. So, this schedule is called application level scheduling.",

        "content": "THE UTILIATION OF FLIGHT PLAN IN PROMOTING AIR TRANSPORTATION SAFETY IN NIGERIA (PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBackground of the study\n\nFlight planning is the process of producing a flight plan that will ensure that aircraft can safely reach the destination; and comply with air traffic control requirements, to minimize the risk of mid-air collision. Safety regulations require aircraft to carry fuel beyond the minimum needed to fly from origin to destination, allowing for unforeseen circumstances or for diversion to another airport if the planned destination becomes unavailable. Furthermore, under the supervision of air traffic control, aircraft flying in controlled airspace must follow predetermined routes known as airways, even if such route are not as economical as more direct flight. All the above requirements are necessary to ensure safety of flights in our airspace. The fact that air transport generally carries influential and important people across the world makes it mandatory to take all necessary measures that will ensure security and safety of lives and properties. In developing countries such as Nigeria, it is only the rich and high class people that can afford the cost of air transport, and as such any air disaster will attract more attention and calls for higher safety standards. Traditionally, air traffic services across the globe have been provided by governments, on a national and sovereign basis so as to oversee and continuously monitor the development Some air navigations services can trace their, origins back to the earliest days of civil flying; others have evolved from strictly military roots. However, due to increasing demand for funding, air navigation service providers are\n\nincreasing being asked to adopt business practices as means of funding crucial investment in aviation infrastructure, since they are being assigned to authorities with administrative and often with administrative and often with financial autonomy .\n\nSuch is the change that air traffic service providers now even have an official body representing their interests at international forums, where for many years they have simply being considered as part of the government process and represented by their individual government, if at all.\n\nSeveral factors have stimulated the swing to commercialization. For example, as the population of economically mature states ages, government finances are becoming increasingly stretched. Growing demands on treasury resources to finance service and program for which states have traditionally been responsible –such as health.\n\nWelfare and social security –mean that services such as air traffic control, find themselves in an unequal competition for scarce public funds.\n\nBut if sole responsibility for funding air navigation systems rests in the hands of national governments, political expediency or public sector borrowing limits can affect the funding available to the creation of a safe, efficiency and evolving infrastructure. In essence, the provision of flight plan for navigation safety must continue to be done without limitation for reliability and efficiency either by the government or private agency.\n\nStatement of the Problem\n\nThe air transport industry has growth enormouslyhigh recent decades and is projected to continue growing strongly into the next century, particularly internationally. Over the past thirty years, the number of passengers worldwide grew from 117 million in 1965 to an estimated 1.26 billion in 1995. United State airline passengersfor the same period grew from 103 million in 1965 to an estimated 548 million in 1995. Also common carrier offer scheduled and charter flight to international, regional and local destinations. Depending on the length of the trip and the amount of cargo ornumber of people to be carried, the airplane with varying sizes would be engaged. In addition, general aviation has become part of the air transport industry in the mid 1920‟s. This includes all flying in corporate-owned or leased aircraft and in air taxis, which provide on-demand services from fixed locations. While much of general aviation is commercial, the companies that offer these services are not legally defines as common carriers. Their services are provided to select clients at negotiated rates rather than to the public at large, and they do not have the same carrier certification requirements as the airlines. However, with the availability of common carriers and general aviation everywhere in the world, it is pertinentto state that many people especially in the developing countries do not have access to aviation services. The locational effect of the airports negatively.\n\nThough airline prices have declines, when adjusted for inflation globally, and the new competitive climatehas fastened numerous innovations of benefit to travelers/including frequent-flyer program, many people could not still afford it in developing countries such as Nigeria. It is in an attempt to examine this phenomenon and offer possible explanations that this important topic on utilization of flight plans in air transport was chosen.\n\nAim and Objectives\n\nThe study aims at examining the utilization of flight plan in promoting air safety in Nigeria. The aim will be accomplished through the following objectives:\n\ni.To examine the need and purpose of flight planning in Nigeria.\n\nii.To evaluate the importance of flight plan to air navigation safety.\n\niii.To identify the key requirements for efficient and reliable flight plan in Nigeria aviation industry.\n\niv.To examine the effect of changing technology on the preparation and utilization of flight plan.\n\nHypothesis\n\nto be Tested That accurate and reliable flight plan determines the transportation safety in Nigeria.\n\nJustification of the Study\n\nThe problems of Nigeria aviation industry are many and varied. These problems have given rise to the emergence of air crashes that will witness today. The situation has also exposed the air transport industry to stagnation and underdevelopment. Furthermore, the socio-political situation in the country which makes the Nigeria aviation to be under the control of Federal Government, with exception of airline, does not help matter.\n\nThe appointments at the top management level are made by the government. These appointments/positions are seeing by many as national cake and means of getting one‟s share.\n\nInvariably, no matter the allocation of fund to this sector by the government, the impact will not be felt.\n\nHowever, the provision of reliable air navigation services, such as the preparation of flight plan, requires adequate funding, trained personnel, among others. Flight panning requires accurate weather forecasts so that fuel consumption calculation can account for the final consumption effect of head or tail wind and air temperature. Thus, there is need to have accurate and up to date weather information and other enroute facilities to prepare reliable and effective flight plan. Producing an accurate optimized flight plan, requires a large number of calculations and precautions, so commercial flight planning systems make extensive use of computers. These computers must be available to the concerned personnel to enhance their operations. This is because any short-coming in its preparation will jeopardize safety.\n\nThe airspace has continued to be congested with several thousands of aero planes flying and the information must be made available to them to prevent air collision and other form of accidents and incidents. The study will critically examined the effect of flight plan or air safety and the need for provision of modern facilities at Nigeria airport to enhance this operation.\n\n Scopeof the Study\n\nThe aviation industry comprises three independent entities, which include the aircraft manufactures, the airline operators; and the airport authority/management performing various different function. An arm of the last, which is now an in independent agency, is responsible for the provision of air navigation services, such as air traffic control and fight planning.This project will focus on the activities and operations of flight planning unit and the effect of their operations on safety of flights in Nigeria.\n\nGiven that there is no parking space in the air, adequate precautions must be taken on ground before taking up; as it is usually said, safety in the air starts from the ground. The need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of flight planning system will be critically considered. The factors affecting its utilization will also be examined.",

Mercedes Benz AG Germany, MBBRAS.  Mercedes – Benz \n\nAll these are logical yet, stocks accumulate due to the Less promise worthy reasons which are:-\n\n(a)   Obsolete items are retained in stock\n\n(b)   Poor or non-existing inventory control resulting in over targe orders, replacement orders being out of phase with production etc.\n\n(c)   Inadequate or non-existing stock records\n\n(d)   Marketing departments.\n\nWhether as a deliberate policy or not, sticks, represents an investment by the organization.  Thus, as with any other investment, the cost of holding stock most be related to the benefit to benefit to be gains.  To do this effectively the cost must be identified and this can be done in the three categories:-\n\n(a)   Cost of obtaining stock\n\n(b)   Stock out costs. \n\nAll these spare parts which may how similar menu by description varies greatly among themselves depending on the type or model of vehicle using them.  Thus, the management and operation of stories function and the control of stock on only be performed in on efficient manner when there is an appropriate means of up turning and storing information and a facility for the analysis and use of this information.\n\nIn the light of the above, ANAMMCO Ltd Enugu maintains a visible record system returned to as KARDEX, a manual form of inventory control system.\n\nAs a prerequisite in any quality control system, ANAMMCO Ltd maintains a peculiar but unique coding system such that all the numerous spare parts are each uniquely coded and identified for accurate and specific information on them.\n\nThe operation of the KARDX was often prove to redundancy or duplication of items whenever there is instilling; it requires a lot of paper work with their possible variations or discrepancies during documentation; it involves, so many people thereby investing a lot of man hours; increased cost of procure storage of non-moving or obsolete items leads to customer dissatisfaction due to time wasting and unavailability of information.  Thus, the efficiency of the system is greatly dependent on human factor and as such accuracy.\n\nSo, it is an attempt to rectify and modify the above inadequacies that we have decided to develop and implement on integrated computerized stock control system so as to maximize the operation efficiency, ensure customer satisfaction based on quick. \n\nServices, minimize the non-hour requirement involved, reduce the running costs, guarantee accuracy and at the same time generate reports that assist management in her decision making as it concerns planning, organizing and controlling.   \n\n1.2   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY (MB-ANAMMCO LTD) ENUGU.\n\nAfter the recommendation of the fourth (4th) National Development plan in 1975 to increase the number of automobile plants in Nigeria in order to address the problem of transportation, a Mercedes Benz Plant was chosen.  Other reasons for establishing the plant being to:\n\n(a)    Diversification and Rapid industrialization of the Nigeria Economy\n\n(b)    Modernization of industrial workers\n\n(c)    Indigenous man-power training\n\n(d)    Technology transfer and\n\n(e)    Manufacture and Assembly of Mercedes Benz commenced vehicles and trucks in Nigeria.\n\nMB-ANAMMCO LTD, as it is famious by known and called means Mercedes-Benz Anambra motor manufacturing company limited Enugu.  This company is strategically located along IBB A port link Road Enugu Industrial Layout Enugu.\n\nThe plant is a joint owned by the Government and people of the federal Republic of Nigeria and Daimier-Benz AG of Germany.  Their share equity is in the ratio 60% to Nigeria and 40% to Daimier, Benz AG Germany.\n\nTherefore Mercedes-Benz ANAMMCO LTD, Enugu was Licensed to manufacture Mercedes Benz commercial vehicles in Nigeria.\n\nThe company was incorporated in Nigeria as a private limited liability company on the 17th the day of January 1977.  On the 12th day of May 1978, it’s foundation store was laid by colonel John Atom Kpera the then military Governor of ANAMBRA States (Now, ENUGU and ANAMBRA STATE).  Later on the 8th day of June 1980, Mercedes-Benz ANAMMCO LTD, was commissioned by Alhaji Shehu Usman Aliyu Shagard, the them president Head of state and commander in client of the Nigeria Armed forces; ANAMMCO LTD, commenced production officially on January 1981.  Ever since them her services network is speed throughout Nigeria.  The company uses foreign and local contents in the manufacture of the Mercedes Benz commercial vehicles.\n\n1.3   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nIt is a common knowledge that decision makers in any organization require information to perform the great functions of planning, producing and controlling.  Therefore, it is necessary to discover and adequate means of making the information available to every on concerned.  This is because, for decisions to be made correctly, the information must be consistent, accurate, timely and reliable.\n\nThus, this work is aimed at developing and implementing an integrated computerized quality control system in production of an automobile firm (case study ANAMMCO LTD ENUGU NIGERIA). \n\n1.4    PROBLEMS OF THE STUDY\n\n1.  The encountered when carrying out this study are that obtaining necessary information from staff of Anammco was not easy because some of their information are regarded as company secret.\n\n2.  Production of spare parts on manual approaches has been very difficult.\n\n3.  There may be inadequate or non-existent stock records.\n\n4.  Obsolete items are retained in stock, which makes it difficult for one to know the overall items in stock.\n\n5.  Finally, problem of fund, the economy is bed, so to get money now is difficult.\n\n1.5   THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe objectives of this work inadequate the following:\n\n1.

        "content": "DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN ELECTRONIC DICE DISPLAY WITH AUDIO UNIT\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis work deals extensively with the design and construction of an electronic dice display (EOD) with audio unit. The device displays the of a hudo dice in numberical form and also produces sound as it displays the number. The device works with principle of chance employee by ludo game players. The output of the display is usually very rapid that the player does actually sex the number when the device is switched on so that it will purely be a game of chance. When the off key is pressed, a patellar number is displayed and this number is the number, the player got. The operation of the device starts by the generation of a pulse frequency. The pulse frequency (square wave signal) generated by times (555 times) by connecting in an instable multibibrator. The output from this timer is used in clocking the binary counter (mod to counter) but this counter is biased to count just from zero through six (0-6) as we have in a lodo game dice. To achieve this bias in the mod 10 counter, the output from Qo, Q1 and Q2 were connected to the riset prins so that once the counter finishes the count of six or goes back to zero. The result from the binary counter is then fed to the decoder driver before connecting it to seven segment so that the decoder will be able to covert the binary values to the decinal values that are being used in the ludo game dice. The seven segment then displays the numbers by lighting the diodes that make up that particular value. This device is being regulated by a latch (4-edge triggered flipflope) which has two switches, one is used for putting the power supply and the other two push switches for the working of the dice display.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nInstrumentation engineering has advanced widely with the introduction of medium scale integration (MSI), large scale integration (LSI) and very large scale intergration (VLSI).  For purpose of accuracy and reliability, analogue instruments are being replaced by  the digital ones.  The electronic dice display (DD) with audio unit is among this new bread of instruments.\n\nSTATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nThe design of an electronic dice display is invented because of the quest for reducing strenuous activities encountered by man, especially in the area of its recreational activities.  This device is used in indo game.  The indo game in its manual operation can be manipulated by the experts so that it can no longer be a game of chance.  Sometimes players can employ tricks on their opponents when playing the game, for example, of the both players are not vigilant, one of them can  event thoart the dice and claimed that nothing happened.  The players too may get tired after playing two or three times because of the stress in shaking and playing the dice, the frequent hitting of the dice’s can on the ludo board can even give cracks in the glass covering the ludo board.  One can even experience the dice getting cost in the game because the dice is very small so if care is not taken it can fall out from the board.  All these problems were taken into consideration before constructing the electronic dice display.\n\nPURPOSE OF STUDY\n\nAs stated earlier, the design of this device is to help man conguer his environment with the advent of medium scale integration (MSI), integrated circuits (IC) can be used to design devices.  That can help man perform his work effectively, with little or no stress and even sometimes at a cheaper into.  The devices too will eradieated all the stress, tricks and pranks encounted when playing ludo game. \n\n1.2     AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe device will in crease the fun derived in play the game, even little kids can now join since they only need to press buttons for the device to work.  The game will now be prvely based on chance because all bias will be eradicted no expert can manipulate the device no mater how many times you use it.  The normal phenomenon of playing tricks will be in thing of the past.\n\nSCOPE\n\nThe work covered the playing and displaying of the number got.  This means that the device when switched on and start button is pressed it will be rapidly displaying the numbers, that is, all the numbers of a ludo dice but when the stop button is dressed a particular number will be shown and this is the number the player got.  This means that the player still needs to get a ludo board and the seeds for the game.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n\nIt will be an unfair treatment to this project of the discussion of limitations that handicapped this important research work is overlooked.  Hence it is considered necessary for it will be a stepping stone for the improvement in further work.\n\nThe work is limited to just playing and displaying of the number got and the generation of sound though enyshasis was not laid on the sound system.  Part of the limitations in this project is as a result of their non-inclusion in the scope while others are due to constraints.  The design specification was to achieve an electronic dice display that can display from 1-6.  also the system is not protected from wrong voltage supplies.  Voltage polarities wrongly connected or supplies greater than the specified supply voltage will damage the system.\n\nMost of the constraints were due to lack of tests with detailed information on the theory and the practice of electronic dice display (EDD).  As 90% of the components are povety digital, they are not readily available on the market, some of the components especially the transistors used in sound display were not found in the market so I was forced to use the equivalents as specified in the data book and when some of these components are found they are usually very expensive.\n\nAnother problem was lack of equipment in to departmental laboratory for the execution and monitoring of the project, some of the equipment used in the other department market were bad and gave false result.  The oscilloscope used was not supplicated enough to display very low frequency outputs of about 1Hz.  Also lack of textbooks was another major problem.  The few books seen treated components of dice display so shallowly.  This calls for designing and redesigning till a working circuit was realized.",

        "content": "SIMULATION OF A QUEUING SYSTEM\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe project looked into the concept of simulation system that provides method of handling problems, which are difficult or costly to solve analytically. It is also allows the study or learning the behavior of the system. To text hypothesis and design a system that may be available for direct observation or experiment and by applying digital simulation to help find the solutions to problems relating to resources allocations to production of efficiency. The programming language to be used is visual basic become of its visual interface and familiarity of the language.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.0     Introduction\n\nAs the size of the world’s population increased so the number of queues and their queue length. In the business world, more customers mean more business transactions. Out of the many ways to attract customers, an efficient queuing system plays an important role as it reduces a customers waiting time. As a result, the shorter waiting time makes customer happy, and one thing for sure is that a happy customer will come back for business again. Queuing as the mathematical study of waiting times or queues. They study endless mathematical analysis of several related processes, including the arrival of the queue, waiting in the queue and being served by servers at the front of the queue.\n\n          Due to the advent of computer system over the years, has brought considerable changes to many areas of human endeavor. This technology has led to speed and accuracy of information that are processed with it. With the introduction of computer in almost all spheres of life, cumbersome jobs are now done with a little time and energy. Our present day computers can be used in airlines reservation, transportation, and patient diagnosis, as an aid to the handicapped and in providing hospital information systems effectively.\n\nComputer system described as an electronic device that accepts data as input, process the data and brings, output as information.. Its uses are not overlooked in the area of simulation. Simulation, which is the process of experimenting or using a model and noting the results, which occur, It is used in a technique referred to as the computer assisted instructions. This has made computers to be continuously ground with scientists, engineers, medical expert, and businessmen and in transportation, industries, science and education. Developing a simulation is often a highly complex mathematical process. Initially a set of rules, relationship and operating procedures are specified along with other variables, Example identifying the objectives of the simulation, identifying the input variables. Distinguish between controlled and non-controlled variables etc. the interactions of these event new rules, which further evolved as the simulation procedures. Simulation implementation ranges from paper and pencil and board game production of situations to complex computer aided interactive systems. As a technique for instructions, simulation allows students to deal in realistic way with vital concern. The use of computers can be employed in simulation of queuing system. Simulation involves representing aspect of business that can be manipulated by a computer by trying various alternatives on the simulation model. With the computer results in the real world can be accurately determined. For instance if a simulation model for investment practices has been developed various investment strategies can be tried to ascertain, which has the likelihood of success.\n\nThe term queue as line up of individual, waiting to be served is found in transport like people waiting to purchase tickets for their journey, in banks, supermarkets, hospitals, offices, restaurants etc. this constitutes one important and particular application of the queuing theory. By analyzing these situations to find average waiting-times, arrival rates etc. help can be obtained for making decisions available at particular times of day in order to process customers faster or whether more queuing spaces are needed.\n\nImo Transport Company (ITC) has several terminals; their processes are not computerized. Tickets are issued to customers on payment, job are done manually. Their queuing system can be stimulated; this is with the help of models that are computerized. This will go a long way to facilitating efficiency and aid at proper satisfaction to its customers.\n\n1.1         Statement Of The Problem\n\nThere are many factors that lead to the investigation or study of this system, queuing is an important issue that need to be resolved in Imo state transport company’s operation. Some of the problems that motivate the research to study of this system include:\n\n1.             Time wasting\n\n2.             Idle time at service facility\n\n3.             Dissatisfaction encounter in the company as a result of queue\n\n4.             To allocate resources according to encourage customers satisfaction\n\n1.2         Objective Of The Study\n\nBasically simulation is the imitation representation of the behavior of a dynamic system (capture expostulation) by that of another system namely a computer base mode.\n\n          Therefore the objective of this study include amongst others:\n\na.             To test hypothesis and to design or experiment with system that may not yet be available for direct observation or experiment\n\nb.             By applying digital simulation to help find solutions to problems relating resources allocations to production schedule.\n\nc.             To achieve an economic balance between the cost of service and the cost associated with the wait required for the service.\n\nd.             To provide adequate but not excessive service facility. This is because if too much facility is provided, the service facility will be often idle. And if too little service is provided, it will lead to excessive waiting cost. Which shall lead to customer’s frustration and loss of goodwill. \n\n1.3         Significance Of The Study\n\nThe significance of this study cannot be overemphasized owing to the various areas in which it is applied. The study of stimulation by the use of model in getting results in the world, which can be more accurately determined, Its significance can also be seen in the following reasons:\n\ni.              The study will go a long way to understand complex interaction of physical or social environmental factors.\n\nii.             The flexibility of the study is provided because it is easier, less costly and safer to change a representative of a system than to change the system itself.\n\niii.            One of the major significance of this study is to provide an adequate but not excessive service faculty. This is because if too service facility is provided, the service facility will often be idle and if too little service is provided it will lead to excessive waiting costs in terms of customers frustration and less of good will\n\niv.            This study will save cost in terms of time and money\n\nv.             With the use of simulation model, the risk involved in working on the real system is avoided.\n\nvi.            The complexity of the real life system demands a representative model will ease the understanding of the model\n\n1.4    Scope And Limitation \n\nThe research is basically limited to the case study of Imo state transport company. The simulation of queuing system in this aspect is limited to queuing in transportation. Manipulation of a simulation system concerns the acceptance of input and generation of output.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A BIOMETRIC STUDENTS’ TIME AND ATTENDANCE LOGGING SYSTEM\n\nABSTRACT\n\n In recent time, there has been high level of impersonation experienced on a daily basis in both private and public sectors, the ghost worker syndrome which has become a menace across all tiers of government, employers concerns over the levels of employee absence in their workforce and the difficulty in managing student attendance during lecture periods. Fingerprints are a form of biometric identification which is unique and does not change in one’s entire lifetime. This paper presents the biometric attendance logging system using fingerprint technology for Students in a university environment. It consists of two processes namely; enrolment and authentication. During enrolment, the fingerprint of the user is captured and its unique features extracted and stored in a database along with the users identity as a template for the subject. During authentication, the fingerprint of the user is captured again and the extracted features compared with the template in the database to determine a match before attendance is made. The fingerprint-based attendance management system was implemented with Arduino Framework for the Hardware and Firmware while Microsoft’s C# on the. NET framework was used for the User Interface and Microsoft’s Structured Query Language (SQL) Server 2005 as the backend database. The experimental result shows that the developed system is highly efficient in the verification of users fingerprint with an accuracy level of 97.4%. The average execution time for the developed system was 4.29 seconds as against 18.48 seconds for the existing system. Moreover, the result shows a well secured and reliable system capable of preventing impersonation.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCOVER PAGE i\n\nDEDICATION

ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1  BACKGROUND STUDY.\n\nEvery Nigerian university has the obligation to record and take student attendance during lecture periods every semester. The accuracy of this record of attendance have been marred by many challenging problems which ranges from the cumbersome nature of the paper sheets used in recording, manipulation of the attendance record by fraudulent students, emplacement of the attendance records after taking them and so on. It therefore becomes very difficult for the regular management and update of such records. Also the calculation of the percentage of attendance to ascertain the qualification of student to write a particular examination may not be achieved.\n\nFor the stated reasons, a biometric based attendance logging system is developed and designed to overcome the problems associated with the attendance system.\n\n1.2  PROBLEM STATEMENT\n\nAs already stated, in most tertiary institutions, there is usually an outstanding rule that a student must achieve at least 70% class attendance before he or she is allowed to write semester examinations for the courses registered by the student.\n\nThe usual method employed by the lecturers is to capture the students’ attendance manually. This manual method of capturing students’ attendance is not accurate as most of the absentee students are usually covered up by their colleagues who normally sign attendance register on their behalf.\n\nIn order to have a more accurate record of students’ attendance, a system that can reduce or eliminate the problems associated with manual capturing is needed. In this project, the Fingerprint technology is to be deployed to capture students’ attendance in the class. The fingerprint device developed will be used to clock in the students at the beginning of lectures.\n\n1.3  AIM AND OBJECTIVES",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ONLINE OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE:  INTRODUCTION 1.0 HOSPITAL\n\nA Hospital is an institution with an organized medical and nursing staff provide a range       of medical service, like surgery, for people requiring intensive treatment or observation. It may also include facilities for childbirth as well as various out-patient departments. A Hospital make up of various departments where various cases and handled.\n\nFor example\n\n1.                  The surgery department where patients are operated on in the theaters.\n\n2.                  Obstetrics and gynecology unit where pregnant women are taken care of.\n\n3.                  Pediatric department where you treat children.\n\nAn outpatient is a patient who does not reside in the clinic where he/she is being treated. The registers of the outpatients are used for documentation of the outpatients. The documentation of the outpatients. The data for outpatient registers are registration number, name of patient, age, sex, registration address etc. The outpatient unit is made up of casuality section, records, outpatient, theaters, various clinics etc. The treatment of the outpatients ends in the outpatient department which that of the inpatients ends in their various wards.\n\n1.1     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nIt could be very burdensome for someone who is seriously ill. It wounded or weak to queue on hospital line waiting for the doctor to attend to him or to pay for service and also get drugs. But when the designing and implementation of a computerize outpatient information system is achieved, a lot of problems will be documented for the outpatient.\n\nThese problems include:\n\n-                      Time wastage\n\n-                      Absence of doctors involved\n\n-                      File sorting  \n\n1.2     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nHospital organization today is an essential part of the medical care scheme, owing to the increasing complexity of\nmedical problem\n. It is very necessary that medical practitioners and specialists have an up to data and automated services.This study will examine the problem arising from manual operations of the outpatient information system and how these can be conquered by introducing the computer. This research work also aims at designing a statement that can replace the manual operations of the outpatient information system\n\n1.3     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe significance of this study is that it eliminates:-\n\n(i)                 Time Wastage: - When this study is practiced the time an outpatient wastes in registering seeing the doctor, buying drugs will be eliminated. Because it will no longer be handled manually rather it is going to be computer based.\n\n(ii)               It also eliminates inconveniency: - In a situation whereby a patient registered in the clinic for the past three and later came back in the fourth year for the check up, the information of that out-patient can be accessed convenient using the computer, rather than searching for the outpatient information or records manually\n\n1.4     SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe scope of this study is limited to the design and implementation of a computerize outpatient\ninformation system\nfor the Specialist Hospital Sokoto.\n\n1.5     ASSUMPTIONS\n\nIt is assumed that all the data located are true valid.

Computer is a fast and accurate electronic machine, which is capable of accepting data as input, processes data and produces outputs under the influence of a stored instruction. The survey research design were used to carry out the research, 5 schools were selected, 16 students were picked from each school at random and their teachers were automatically selected making the total sample to be 100. Data were collected using four point likert scale and analysis using mean and standard deviation. In my findings i discovered that the use of learning team, training teachers at different skill level, establishing cooperative and peer tutoring groups, reviewing and re-writing secondary school technology curriculum are most suitable strategies for improving computer instruction. The researcher thereby recommended that teachers should avail themselves of any opportunity for academic advancement, government should supply computer system, and its accessories to schools to bridge the gap between theory and practical and conclusion were drawn\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBackground to the Study\n\nThe world has witnessed in the past, two major socio-economic Revolutions; the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution. Presently, there is another socio-economic shift, which is the arrival of computer is being witnessed. This stage of revolution in the society emphasized the production, storage and distribution of information in various forms.\n\n     According to Alo (2006); computer is an electronic devices or machine that is capable of accepting inputs or data through input devices, processes the inputs and generates appropriate results which are displayed through the output devices.\n\n    Computer is an electronic machine used to record, store process and recall data or information (Ezeliora, 2000). According to Mbam (2000); computer is a fast and accurate electronic machine, which is capable of accepting data as input, processes data and produces outputs under the influence of a stored program or instruction.\n\n     Computer Education can be seen as learning experiences with computer for the aim of achieving the set objectives of computer education (Nwaibe, 2010). consequently, computer education is aimed at making the learner computer literate.\n\n      Mbam (2000) defined computer as a machine which processes intelligent results.\n\nHe stresses that computer is a machine capable of accepting data according to a predefine instruction and produce report as results.\n\n     Umeh (2004) defined computer as a kind of electronic machine that enables man to solve diverse kind of problems.\n\nHe further emphasis that computer is a device capable of accepting data, processing data and displaying the results in mans understandable format.\n\nEzeliora (2005), defined computer as “an electro-mechanical device used to aid calculations with little mental and manual effort. He explained that computer is an electronic device or machine that is capable of performing calculations and other kind of data manipulation.\n\n   Computer can further be defined as an electronic machine that is capable of carrying out services of arithmetic and logical operations with a well structured instruction. It is a machine capable of presenting information (lesson) to its users when programmed for this purpose. The importance of web and distant learning speaks for the many instructional provision that can be acquired with the use of computer in improving instructions.\n\n    In Ebonyi state, computer education is a welcomed development whereby the teaching of computer is being administered to all students regardless of the class they belong to in secondary schools but the problems faced here is that, they do not have all the necessary requirements needed for effective and successful teaching and learning of computer. This requirements include; computer Laboratories and Libraries; enough computer systems, Electricity supply and instructional materials for computer education.\n\nTo this end according to Oduma (2004) are ways (strategies) for improving computer instruction thus:\n\n-     Conducting teacher in service training in different aspects of technology and its application to different concepts on computer instruction\n\n-     Ensuring the accessibility and appropriate software to the students and teachers.\n\n-     Citing the schools computer laboratory to a more accessible area.\n\n-     Review and re-write middle school technology curriculum.\n\n-     Establish cooperative and peer tutoring groups, workshops and seminars for both the students and teachers.\n\nHence, improving computer instructional strategies, topics in the school syllabus should be encoded in the computer programme in a self-instructional mode, which should be easy for students to use with minimal assistance.\n\nStatement of the Problem\n\nDuring my research work in Ezza Boys High school, Onueke in Ebonyi state, the researcher observed that their classrooms for the junior secondary classes are highly populated. The researcher taught the J.S.S.11A class that was populated with eighty-five students. More so, one (1) computer system was provided by the school to undergo the teaching and learning process of computer. Consequently, student’s performance in their previous years exams was very poor. This is in line with Igbe (2008) when he said that computer Education cannot be effectively taught and learnt without the use of relevant instructional materials. The teaching task the researcher experienced there was a tedious and enormous one because the researcher made sure that each of the student experienced the computer in order for the specific objectives to be achieved which made me to use more than the required time to teach the students.\n\nThus; it is in the realization of these problems above that prompt me to emerge with this research to present strategies of improving computer instruction in Ezza South Local Government Area Secondary Schools.\n\nPurpose of the Study\n\nThe purpose of this study is to present the strategies of improving computer instructions in Ezza South Local Government Area Secondary Schools.\n\nSpecifically, the research is designed to;\n\ni.    Determine the strategies for improving computer instruction in secondary schools in Ezza south Local Government Area.\n\nii.   Determine the most suitable strategies for improving computer instruction in secondary schools.\n\niii. Determine whether there are differences in the opinions of teachers and principals on the strategies for in improving computer instructions in Ezza South Local Government Area secondary schools.\n\nSignificance of the Study\n\nIt is hoped that the findings of this research will be beneficial to the Ebonyi state government, the teachers, the curriculum planners, the students and the parent.\n\n  The findings of this research will be useful to the teachers by making the teachers to know the strategies to use in administering their class for effective and successful computer Education.\n\n       The findings of this research will expose the most important strategies to the curriculum planners in the area of evaluation technique.\n\nThe findings of this research will be useful to the Ebonyi state Government by way of getting result from their investment in Education.\n\nMore so, the parents will benefit because their wards when they are effectively taught with improved method of teaching, this new system of teaching computer studies will make their wards prosper and succeed in their computer study. Thereby reducing financial wastage on their parent.\n\nIn addition, the findings of this research will make the government of Ebonyi state to organize seminars, workshops, conferences on the improved method of teaching computer instruction to make the teachers resourceful and more embraced with the current development in the field of computer science.\n\nScope of the Study\n\nThe research focuses on the strategies of improving computer instruction in Ezza South Local Government Area secondary schools.\n\nResearch Questions.\n\nThe following research questions are constructed to guide the study;\n\n1.   What are the strategies for improving computer instruction in secondary schools in Ezza south Local Government Area?\n\n2.   Which of the strategies for improving computer instruction in secondary schools in Ezza Local Government Area are most suitable? \n\n3.   To what extent are there difference in the opinions of teachers and principals on the strategies for improving computer instruction in Ezza South Local Government Area secondary school?",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SALES RECORD SYSTEM\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\n Record Keeping is the process of collecting, inputting, storing, classifying, summarizing and interpreting data.\n\nRecord keeping has two facets – financial record keeping and managerial record keeping. The basic purpose of financial record is to assist decision makers in evaluating the financial strength, profitability and future prospects of a business. Managerial record keeping in contrast is tailored to the needs of a particular company. It helps the executives to measure success in carrying out their plans, to identify problems requiring executive attention and to attain company objectives. The purpose of record keeping is to produce financial statement about a business entity. Therefore in this study, we narrowed down to the record keeping system as been practiced by the business centre of Caritas University Enugu. Nearly all the tasks manually performed by man some years back can now be done in matter of seconds with computer technology. Since the invention of the “wonder machine”, there has been a change from the manual way of carrying out certain tasks to a faster and more reliable computerized method.\n\n 1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nThe business centre of Caritas University Amorji Nike Enugu was established with the institution in January 21, 2005. Justifiably, the business centre of Caritas University have the problem of keeping adequate record of financial transactions, workers file and managerial documents accrued by the purpose of planning, accuracy, timely data processing and security. They do this in manual means with its associated problems of insecurity, high cost of operation and long period of time used for processing data. The design and development of computerized record keeping system in the business centre will no doubt bring about immeasurable relief from the problems associated with manual system of record keeping. Therefore, the study is aimed at producing an efficient computer software package that can handle the record keeping system of the business centre.\n\n1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\n            Business centre of Caritas University is to an extent manually operated. The recording of sales of tickets and cash received are done manually in a book, which looks/appears rough. Thus, the books or files are exposed to physical damage by ants and pests, accumulation of dust particles; this makes the contents to be lost, misplaced or even altered. The long queue of students waiting to be attended to, on daily basis, the fatigue, time wasting in daily reports of accounts to the management can be reduced or even eliminated with the introduction of the proposed system.\n\n1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\n             The purpose of this study is to develop software that can be used in keeping records of sales and cash received or spent. Also to promote efficient and quality services to customers.   \n\n1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\n             This study is primarily aimed at computerizing the manual system of accounting and record keeping as used in the business division of Caritas University Enugu. It will help in a good number of ways to ease the queuing method in the business centre.\n\n1.5 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\n             The major objectives of this study is aimed at developing an automated record keeping system others include\n\ni.                   To save time (fast inputting and accessing of records)\n\nii.                 To enable the management to plan ahead\n\niii.              To reduce fatigue of the staff\n\niv.              To ensure accuracy in the records\n\nv.                 To ensure safety of the documents/records, because the system will be passworded to reduce access.\n\nvi.

It is important to note that no aspect should be left behind. An event is a happening that celebrates some unique aspect of a community. The event management and booking system in Nigeria is still not completely straightforward. It is noticeable that most restaurants and event centers in Nigeria still have manual ways of booking tables, meals and events. Such methods are good but slow and sub-standard, costly to maintain and energy draining (excess bureaucracy). It is in the light of these impending difficulties that this project is born. It is designed to automate the booking of tables and events at event centers.\n\n1.1 Statement of the problem\n\nThe problems observed during research were as follows;\n\n•         Event Centers often entertain intending consumers manually.\n\n•         Record keeping at event centers is usually cumbersome, there are always a lot of physical files to be carried around and updated. At times when demand for events is high (e.g. Christmas, New Year, Valentine’s Day, Easter etc), there often has to be extra-hands on the job of buying new files and sorting out old ones.\n\n•         The cost of buying physical files and constructing storage facilities as well as maintaining them is often high.\n\n1.2 Objectives of the Study\n\nThis project aims at;\n\n•         Replacing manual storage of files with more efficient, faster and cleaner storage methods for customer information.\n\n•         Relieving the bureaucracy undertaken by the consumers in having to travel from their various destinations to the business arena just to book their events or get information.\n\n•         To reduce the cost of managing information for the event centre managers and staff.\n\n1.3 Significance of the Study\n\nThis study is significant in the sense that it aims at making useful the advent of\ninformation and communication technology\nin the entertainment industry. It seeks to automate the handling of information and service of customers in order to ease the cost of running a business or the cost of patronizing a running one.\n\n1.4 Scope of the Study\n\nThis project is limited to the design and implementation of a web application that allows customers to book events online. This web application is meant to be owned and managed by an event center that also runs a restaurant. Hence, customers can book for spaces at the restaurant and also book to have events space without going to the event center physically.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPUTER BASED AUTOMOBILE FAULT DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0    INTRODUCTION\n\nIn present time most households own at least one car. This figure shows that a car is very important to people’s lives as it completes the cycle of living. Having that we are in the  era of computer age and\ninternet application\n, it would be nice if a web-based expert system can be developed to diagnose mechanical and other related faults in our vehicles.\n\nSoftware for car faults diagnosis is a system that detects information about car faults and provides possible solutions to fixing the problem. It works by entering the type of fault your car is giving you, and then it will retrieve the information of the possible fault and also display the result of how you can solve the problem without the presence of an expert.\n\nSo, this\nweb-based software\nis hoped to help those who are in need of guides to deal with their cars problems. Although it might not give a complete guide and help as a human expert, namely mechanics, at least it can give temporary assistance to those who are in need of instant help, as a result of the limitation of time and distance.\n\nFaults occur in vehicles or automobiles very often than not. This can be due to several reasons. The ability to detect and isolate these faults in complex technical systems such automobile is important in order to fulfill dependability requirements.  Fault detection and isolation in automobiles is very important because it helps to maintain high vehicle operational efficiency, low exhaust emissions, high vehicle uptime, fuel consumption reduction or fuel economy, high vehicle safety and it guarantees efficient repair. These factors are very important because they help to reduce overall life-cycle cost of a  vehicle.\n\n1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nWith the help of a car, movement from one place to another has been made easy especially for those who are always mobile in their jobs. Cars simplify our lives and make time to be more valuable as we can save more time using the car. But at the same time, people who own cars definitely don’t want to have a problem with their cars as the troubleshooting of a car can be a nightmare to them, especially women[2]. Some of those own a car individually don’t know how to deal with their cars whenever it has a problem. All they know is to start the engine, drag the clutch if it is not automatic, press the paddle and break when they need to. An even the worse situation is that they don’t even know how to fill the fuel tank, and that is not good. They won’t know what to do when something happens to their cars. All they can do at best is, call the automobile repairer for help.\n\nSo, this web-based software is hoped to help those who are in need of guides to deal with their cars problems. Although it might not give a complete guide and help as a human expert, namely mechanics, at least the expert system can give temporary assistance to those who are in need of instant help, as a result of the limitation of time and distance.\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\n          In dealing with problems of a car and troubleshooting, automobile repairers are those who can help to solve them. The use of a computer expert system is beneficial in different ways. It gives a temporary and instant guide to car owners in different situations like:\n\n·        Assistance in the absence of automobile repairers.\n\n·        Being an alternative considering the distance of automobile repairers.\n\n·        Situations where automobile repairers diagnosis wrongly, etc.\n\n1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\n·        Developing a system for car maintenance and troubleshooting that is capable of assisting car owners in dealing with their cars problems and troubleshooting them whenever time is limited and the human experts, also known as mechanics is not available at that very time.\n\n·        Providing recommendations in cases of automobile break down.\n\n·        Providing maintenance advice to users in order to avoid future fault from occurring.\n\n·        Testing and validating the system’s performance.\n\n·        Helping automobile repairers diagnose serious faults and repair vehicles at a faster rate through the pre-diagnosis and advice a web-based software.\n\n·        Developing appropriate representation architecture to the proposed car failure and malfunction diagnosis assistance system.\n\n1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe proposed system can help inexperienced automobile repairers or drivers in diagnosing the fault of the car.\n\n In addition, the system has the following benefits:\n\n·        Improvement of productivity: Having this system will enable mechanics to do more work in less time.\n\n·        Reduces the need for skilled mechanics: The repairs of a car require a high level of expertise. With this system, inexperienced mechanics can be guided to find the fault.\n\n·        Places expert knowledge into machine readable form, where it can be summoned at any time.\n\n1.5    SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\n          This software may contain certain limits and flaws, as it is only a prototype. We commonly know that a car has many parts on its body and even in the body itself. However, the system will only deal with problems that are commonly found in the engine part of the car as the system is just a prototype, which means the function will be expanded through time. The system will also deal with only cars produced from the year 2000 till date.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A VISITOR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.0     BACKGROUND OF STUDY\n\nA\nVisitor Management System\n(VMS) is an evolving concept defined as a systematic collection of visitor’s information. It is a record in digital format that is theoretically capable of keeping track of list of visitors and their personal details for effective service from both clients and the company.\n\nThis system tracks the usage of a public office by gathering increasing amounts of information. A visitor management system can record the usage of the facilities by specific visitors and provide documentation of visitor’s whereabouts. Since a visitor management system provides a record of office used and the person visited, these systems are frequently used to complement office security systems and access control systems.\n\nAs electronic visitor management systems become more common and more powerful, these systems are taking over many of the functions of office security and access control like gathering information manually.\n\nManaging visitors is an essential access control activity traditionally handled through paper logs or guest books, where visitors sign in at the front desk. Synergis’ Visitor Management module allows you to modernize your approach, go paperless, and become more efficient. Enroll visitors, assign physical access rights, and track their movements with ease. A digital visitor management system does the core job of checking in visitors. But it also does many things pen and paper cants which include:\n\nØ Maintain a cloud-based visitor log.\n\nØ Take photos of your visitors to help you identify them.\n\nAnd so on.\n\n1.1            STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nAfter carefully analysis of the project the researcher observed that the following problems are mainly encountered by\ndifferent organization\n\n1.     The present method of visitors management system is mainly based   on manual recording,\n\n2.     The present system makes use of small or no database for recording of visitor’s information.\n\n3.     Due to lack of comprehensive database, accountability is usually very difficult,\n\n4.     The present system is time consuming,\n\n5.     Owing to the paper and pen  method of  recording information visitors may not give out its full information needed at a particular time,\n\n6.     Queuing may occur at the cause of entering information needed.\n\n1.2     OBJECTIVE OF STUDY\n\nThe aim of this project is to design and implement an online visitors management system.\n\nThe objectives include:\n\n1.     To build a web database for storing visitor’s information: to setup a strong relational database for storing visitor’s information for easy retrieval and annual report analysis.\n\n2.     To develop a web base which helps to insert and retrieve visitors information: retrieval of information stored in a database is vital and must be ready to get back from the database when needed so that the purpose of storing the data must be accomplished.\n\n3.     To give account of visitors that visited the organization: the system that is setup must be ready to give total number of visitors that visited the organization per day, week, yearly etc.\n\n4.     To ascertain the reasons why the visitor visited: the system will also track the reasons why the visitors visited, whether the message is relevant or not.\n\n5.     To provide easy access of searching and navigation for time saving: the system have a special way of retrieving data from the database like search the visitor using its identification number.\n\n6.     To provide adequate assessment of staff base on the amount of visitor (Client) and their reason.\n\n1.3     SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY\n\nWith growth of information technology, the study offers numerous values in business premises and revenue payment:\n\n1.     Visitors get high quality service: since the recording requires human information, with use of computer more concrete information will be provided.\n\n2.     It will be easier to generate overall report: comprehensive and relational database will make the report generation easy and faster.\n\n3.     High Security Environments: Assign and print credentials for your visitors like any other employee, define detailed access rights, specify visitor escorts, and give your staff full control over access to your facilities.\n\n4.     It will provide efficient, effective and timely services,\n\n5.     It will reduce corruption,\n\n6.     It contributes to the entire organization security.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A CRIME RECORD INFORMATION SYSTEM\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0  INTRODUCTION\n\n In view of Karl Marx theory, human being are intrinsically, necessarily and by definition social beings that (beyond being “gregarious creatures”) cannot survive and meet their needs other than through\nsocial co-operation\nand association. It is very vital maintain peace and unity in multi-ethnic and multi-religious country of Nigeria. In order to maintain peace and harmony, man has to fashion out constitution that will govern the conduct of the member of the society. When people appreciate this code of conduct and laws, protection of lives and properties are guaranteed.\n\nNational security\nhas been a source of concern to all and sundry in Nigeria. There is the issue of religious crisis in some states of the Northern part of Nigeria, ritual killings and kidnappings in some states of the South-East and South-South, sectarian clashes in some states of the South-West, bombings in Abuja and some states of the federation. In order to reinforce Security and Justice in Nigeria, and to ensure the security of citizens, it is important to establish at all levels a concrete and user-friendly system which will enable an efficient exchange of information on previous convictions of criminals. Information about previous convictions shall circulate between judges  and prosecutors as well as police authorities. This is essential in order to provide adequate responses to crime and also to prevent new crimes from being committed.\n\n It should not be forgotten that prior to the arrival of the British, criminal laws were existing in this part of the world now known as Nigeria, wherever there was political entity requiring the enforcement of standards of behavior and imposing punishment for their breach. \n\nPeter (2010) describes the computerized crime record system as one that will enable the police to have accurate statistics to draw analysis from, on information of a case, the year a crime was committed, who investigated it, etc.”\n\nThe police may decide that an offence is not serious enough to warrant recording. It is important to observe that in Nigeria with, the high level of illiteracy amongst both the public and the police and the high level of corruption, it is not unlikely that it is only very few cases that will ever get recorded. In recent times, with the economic hardship the country is going through it is not uncommon for the police to complain about lack of stationeries in cases which they may wish to record James N. (2010).\n\nIn most of the North were highly systematic and sophisticated Islamic laws. The laws were so systematic that there were several schools of jurists, and even differences within them. Nigeria is one of the limited members of the countries in the world that has death penalty, however according to figures in 2007 the Nigerian police annual reports have no records of crimes according to regions, states or cities. However, it is generally known in Nigeria that property crimes are perpetrated more in the Southern states than in the Northern states. This may be due to greater business activity in the South (Nigeria Annual Police Report, 1986 – 1989).\n\nAlthough the police record of crime is generally acclaimed as being closest to the criminal happenings, it is plagued by the following problems:\n\nThe victim may not be aware that an offence has been committed. This frequently happens when employees are dishonest over deliveries of goods, receiving money and thefts by employees within the store or business. Such losses are often written off during stock taking as shortages or breakages. There is an enormous amount of internal dishonesty which is never discovered or which is condoned.\n\nThe 'victim' may have been a willing partner to the crime and so it 'is unlikely to be discovered unless a third reports it. This is the case for many sexual offences against children, and criminal abortion and homosexual offences.\n\nEven where the victim knows an offence has been committed and has not consented to it or partaken in it, he or she may decide not to report the offence to the police for a variety of reasons. It may be regarded as too trivial to warrant such a report.\n\nA criminal record is a record of a person’s criminal history, generally used by potential employers and lenders to access his or her trustworthiness.\n\n1.1              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nManual crime records in Enugu State Crime Investigation Department, were maintained on paper, and were created and updated manually ( typewriter or hand-written).\n\n1.1.1        Problems of Manual Crime Record\n\nUntil 1960’s criminal history records were maintained on paper, and were created and updated manually ( typewriter or hand-written). That is to say that the process of daily task and activities are done manually. Quite unfortunately, manual procedures for job execution delays and reduces ones output quality.\n\n            Manual crime record keeping has resulted in many setbacks to the expected standard.  The bottleneck encountered includes: \n\n·                     Time wastage.\n\n·                     Partial or total loss of file or documents\n\n·                     Under recording of criminal analysis\n\n·                     Exposures of confidential information\n\n·                     Inefficiency of some members of staff due to laziness in searching for.\n\nAs a result of these problems, the manual system of crime record system of information storage, input and retrieval is very clumsy, inefficient and time consuming.\n\n1.2              OBJECTIVE\n\nThe aim of this project is to develop a computerized crime record information systemthat will perform this objective:\n\n·         Provides required information or quick and accurate prosecution of crime suspects in a court of competent jurisdiction. Those who would require this information may include lawyers, police , judges etc\n\n·         Keep record of those convicted of crimes to help the criminal justice system have accurate information for decision making.\n\n·         To use computerized crime record system to replace some of human roles in cases of prosecution of crimes.\n\n1.3              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis project on computerized crime record system is developed to carryout tedious work and activities performed by human beings, in which they end up misplacing and discarding some important files and case records.  But if this (computerized crime record) is installed it will render remedy to this case.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A WEB BASED SHOPPING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nCHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 1.0     Background of Study\n\nE-commerce (electronic commerce) is the buying and selling of goods and services, or the transmitting of funds or data, over an electronic network, primarily the internet. In this area of technology,\ne-commerce\nis fast gaining ground as an accepted and used business paradigm. These business transactions occur either as business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C), consumer-to-consumer (C2C) or consumer-to-business (C2B). The terms e-commerce and e-business are often used interchangeably. The term e-tail is also sometimes used in reference to \ntransactional processes\n for online shopping. More and more business houses are implementing web sites providing functionality for performing commercial transactions over the web. It is reasonable to say that the process of shopping on the web is becoming the common place.\n\n   Since the emergence of World Wide Web (WWW), vendors can easily sell their products to the different kinds of people over the internet. Many people prefer online shopping because of its different kinds of convenience. They can find a specific product by searching various online stores which is less time consuming and tedious process rather than searching this product in various stores in the market.\n\nThe largest of these online retailing corporations are Alibaba, Amazon.com, and eBay. Retail success is no longer all about physical stores. This is evident because of the increase in retailers now offering online store interfaces for consumers.\n\n1.1     Statement of the Problem\n\nThere are many online businesses on the internet. People have many choices to buy products through the internet. These products include household equipment, electronics, clothing products and many more. Now a day's people are so busy that they have no time to go to\nshopping malls\nand buy the things they want and this was the problem primarily intended for online shopping to solve. That's why importance of online shopping is increasing with the passage of time and one cannot deny this fact. Online shops gives you lot of discounts that you may not find by shopping at the physical stores. Moreover many online shops not only give you huge discounts on different products but at the same time they provide free shipping to whatever destination provided it’s in the shop’s agreed location’s. Online shopping not only save your time but it saves lots of your money by not going to visit each shop and spend money on gas and patrol. The issue of wasting time and petrol and not seeing that project you wish to purchase is another problem intended to be tackled by inventing online shopping. Online shopping gives you benefit of comparing same products at different online shops at the same time which you can't do in a physical store. So you cannot only compare the quality of products but also their prices as well. You can order anything from the whole world and it will be delivered at your home. There are more than 90% chances that you will find your desired product whether you shop from auction online websites like eBay or a specialty store. When you go to any department store for shopping, you cannot know about customer feedback about any product but with online shopping you can read customer feedback about any product. Customer feedback can help you to buy a product with more ease. \n\n1.2     Objectives\n\nThe main objective of this study is to design and see the implementation of an online shopping management system.\n\nSpecifically the study intends to:\n\n·        Display goods and services in the store.\n\n·        Automate every sale effectively without mixing product prizes.\n\n·        Store product detail using a secure database\n\n·        Manage every user’s information of the system.\n\n1.3     Significance of the Study\n\n·        This research work is to develop a system capable of handling sales by automating a cart system that stores details prior to when the user requests a sales service. This research work is a cost effective and conducive method for buying and selling and easier method for a customer to get their desired goods easily\n\n·        This study is important to sellers and buyers because it saves time energy rather than going to the open market, It is a more dynamic way of buying and selling also because it reduces the chances of shoplifting.\n\n·        It is important to students especially those in computer science as a reference material when designing their project\n\n·        Lecturers who teach system analysis and design can also benefit from it as a guide to what they teach students\n\n·        Workshop and conference paper presenters will make use of this especially those presenting design and implementing of e-commerce\n\nManufacturers of industries that produce goods will make use of this work in marketing their products especially online. Therefore this provides a new avenue for product marketing by managers of industries",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A WEB-BASED LIBRARY INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION\n\n1.0     Background of Study\n\nLibrary Management\nSystem refers to an application that is specifically designed to manage generally small and medium size libraries and to help mainly those in charge of the library at that particular time to help maintain and keep tracks of library users and books.\n\nLibrary Management System as an application is mainly used by librarian to manage the library using a computerized system where he/she can record various transactions like issue of books, return of books, addition of new books, addition of new students etc.\n\nBooks and student maintenance modules are also included in this system which would keep track of the students using the library and also a detailed description about the books a library contains. With this computerized system there will be no loss of book record or member record which generally happens when a non-computerized system is used.\n\nIn addition, report module is also included in Library Management System. If user’s position is admin, the user is able to generate different kinds of reports like lists of students registered, list of books, issue and return reports.\n\nAll these modules are able to help librarian to manage the library with more convenience and in a more efficient way as compared to library systems which are not computerized.\n\nA majority of libraries in Nigeria are found in research centers, private and\npublic institutions\nof learning. Public universities have the highest volumes of books, journals, research papers, and other collections. The libraries are set up with the main aim of been used by both the students, teachers, lecturers and staff members within the institution. There is a collected effort by the library management to restructure their services so as to extend them to other outsiders other than the normal users. Many of the libraries are coming up with information resource centers in the spirit of embracing technology.\n\nLibrary Management System supports the general requirement of the library such as the acquisition, cataloguing, circulation and other sections. Before the advent of computer in modern age there were different methods of keeping records in the library. Records were kept in the library on shelves and each shelf was labeled in an alphabetical or numerical order, in which the categories of books available were arranged on different position on the shelves and as well were recorded on the library manuscript and when any book is to be referenced the manuscript is being referred to, to know the position of such required book by the person that requested for the book. After the invention of computer different researchers carried out various approaches on an automated library management system in which this project is as well all about.\n\n1.1     Statement of the Problem\n\nThis online library management system was developed to solve the major drawbacks that faced people responsible for the general managing of small or large libraries who were using the existing systems.\n\nThe problem occurred before having computerized system includes:\n\n·        File loss\n\nWhen computerized system is not implemented files could get missing, sometimes due to some human error there may be a loss of records.\n\n·        File damaged\n\nOnline library will save us a great deal since physical interference is greatly reduced due to the nature of the digital world and thus files in the library is safer than ever before.\n\n·        Difficult to search record\n\nWhen there is no computerized system there is always a difficulty in searching of records, especially if the records are large in number.\n\n·        Space consuming\n\nAfter the number of records become large the space for physical storage of file and records also increases if no computerized system is implemented.\n\n·        Cost consuming\n\nAs there is no computerized system to add each record paper will be needed which will increase the cost for the management of library.\n\n·        Time consuming\n\nComputerized system has the ability to work at a faster rate than a non computerized system. As such more time is needed to record where there is no computerized system.\n\n1.2     Objectives\n\nThe aims and objectives are as follows:\n\n1.     Developing a system that ensures the privacy of its users and enable them access it remotely.\n\n2.     Designing a system that respond in a timely manner.\n\n3.     To enable easy maintenance of students and book details.\n\n4.     Easy retrieval of books by simply searching the system.\n\n5.     To enable easy borrowing and returning of books.\n\n6.     Automated fine calculation and reports generation.\n\n7.     Enabling a secure and portable database system that eliminates duplicate data.\n\n  1.3     Significance of the Project\n\nThis system improves services delivered to end users. Data is saved in the most appropriate manner eliminating duplication and redundancy. Multiple users can access the system at the same time. The system operates electronically hence ensures less space is occupied and also presents a paperless working environment. Library staff members are motivated by the system since it makes work easier. The system has a friendly user interface which is attractive and easy to use. \n\nThis study will be beneficial to the following:\n\n1.       Students: The study would increase efficiency of students in using the library, as they  easily know the books available in the library and also borrow available books with the aid of the system. This is more convenient as it is not time-consuming.\n\n2.       Librarian: The system would improve the monitoring capacities of those who maintain the library. It would aid easy cataloging and and keeping record of books issued, reissued and not returned.\n\n3.       Lecturers: They would use the study to teach student on how to use the system and as users, use it to easily access library and borrow them.\n\n4.       The University: The use of the system would reduce the cost of management of the library . The system eliminates the need to employ many workers and keep many manual files, thereby reducing cost . It would also enhance the look of the library\n\nOther Library Staffs: The study would increase the productivity of theses staff,as they would spend time doing important things and with ease.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ONLINE BARCODE ATTENDANCE SYSTEM\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.0     Background of study\n\nIn most\neducational institutions\nthe attendance is taken manually. It is not only time consuming, but it is also insecure and unreliable and it can be lost. Some institutions are using punch card for attendance while this will be difficult for teachers to keep track of the large number of students because by using punch card, a student can help the other students or his/her friend to punch their card even the other student may be absent or come late in class, so it is not reliable.\n\nTo overcome these problems, I have developed a better system which is Web based; it is fully responsive where a user can use in mobile, tablets and different computer systems. In this system, records are kept safe and secure and the attendance information of particular or all students of particular class can be accessed easily and without time consuming, the report is generated automatically.\n\nAttendance is very important in every student. a single absent make a big difference in performance in the school. Most students of high school are prone to absence from classes claiming that the class is boring. Others due to laziness fail to attend classes, having preference of going to computer shops or playing games while some students cannot refuse the prospect of a friend asking them out during class period. Some of these actions are not reported to parents or guardians because the possible way of informing them is the traditional way which is by inviting the parents over through the students. With this, the authority would communicate the parents on the attendance level of the student. This process takes a long time and sometimes parents are not able to come because of their engagements, occupation or location. These are the reasons why parents/guardians are not informed about the absenteeism of the\n\nstudents.\n\nIn this manner, I proposed an Online Barcode Attendance System with Short Message Service (SMS). Its function is to send a notification to parents that their student is absent. Attendance Monitoring System with SMS provide a fast way of informing the parent anytime anywhere.\n\n1.1     Statement of the problem\n\n1.     Attendance is taken with student id card embedded with barcode containing full details about the student.\n\n2.     The daily attendance of students is taken automatically by scanning the student ID card with a barcode scanner.\n\n3.     The attendance report will be generated automatically without time consuming which is reliable and there will be not any mistakes.\n\n4.     It is fully responsive and flexible; it can be accessed from any computer no matter where you are.\n\n1.2     Objectives\n\nThe study aims to:\n\n1.     Eliminate duplicate data entry and errors in time and attendance entries.\n\n2.     Eliminate paperwork and save time.\n\n3.     Automatic calculation of attendance\n\n4.     To Increase security.\n\n5.     To involve parents in student attendance performance.\n\n1.3     Significance of the problem\n\nEconomic Significance\n\nThe system being developed is economic with respect to School or Collage’s point of view. It is cost effective in the sense that has eliminated the paper work completely. The system is also time effective because the calculations are automated which are made at the end of the month or as per the user requirement. The result obtained contains minimum errors and are highly accurate as the data is required.\n\nBehavioral Significance\n\nThe system working is quite easy to use and learn due to its simple but attractive interface. User requires no special training for operating the system.\n\nParent Involvement\n\nThe system engages parents in the attendance performance of the student by notifying them through\nShort Message Service\n(SMS) on attendance report every weekend.",

        "content": "Design And Implementation Of An Online Recruitment System\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nChapter1:\n\nA survey carried out recently revealed that finding good employees is one of the major business challenges entrepreneurs face when starting a business from the scratch (1). As a matter of fact one of the business processes entrepreneurs dread most is the process of recruiting employees.\n\nRecruiting employees who have the specific knowledge, skills, abilities and behaviors needed to support missions and goals enable the organization to achieve high performance, and enhance their competitive ability. In order to be complete, organizational success depends heavily upon the considerable imagination and initiative that is needed in developing recruitment and retention programs (2). Traditional, recruitment of officers into a vacant position is a difficult task in terms of collection and processing of data since a lot of applicant will apply for a particular job. In the cause of processing applicant data, this causes a lot of errors, inaccuracy, favoritism, nepotism and unreliability, which lead to the organization’s failure of recruiting the right caliber of persons to fill the available vacant positions.\n\nProcessing manually makes the organization to waste a lot of resources since there are many applicant data which allow recruiting more people to handle these tasks. Entrepreneurs are therefore often faced with fear when hiring their first employee because it is difficult to discover a good employee.        \n\nOn the other hand, most job seekers complain that it is difficult to find the right job, that is, the one which would suit them. Job seekers resort to searching the Internet for job vacancies. This means that job vacancy adverts would get to a large number of potential employees, which also has its advantages and disadvantages. For the recruiters, one job vacancy may attract thousands of job applicants. This makes the process of job recruitment tedious both to the recruiters and job seekers in other to find the perfect fit to the job. Most large organizations even resort to employing the services of recruiting agencies. These are firms that specialized in finding employment opportunities based on a set of criteria provided by the job seeker. They keep record of all job vacancies and try to match it up with prospective employees. To some extent, this system has eased up the recruitment process. This project is therefore, aimed at solving problems related job recruitment. This project can be applied to any organization both public and private that are virtually concerned with productivity and cost effectiveness in managing resources.\n\n1.1 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nCurrently, recruitment exercises are fraught with peril. This is partly due to several factors, of which unemployment has the highest rate in the country. Any job advert would definitely attract applicants. The recruiters would then go through tons of CV’S in a bid to find qualified candidates. A good example of the problems associated with this method of recruitment is IMMIGRATION RECRUITMENT EXCERSISE which occurred in 2014. Over six million Nigerians left their homes to sit for a recruitment test- for four thousand vacant positions. Some of these people lost their lives as a result of the stampede that occurred. Several sustained injuries.\n\nThis would have been avoided if an online recruitment platform had been put in place to conduct whatever form of screening that was required.                                                                                                  \n\n1.2 AIM AND OBJECTIVES              \n\nThe main aim of the project work is to develop an online job recruitment system. Specific objectives are as follows:\n\n       I.            Determines the potentials of each applicant and retain the applicant whose performance could meet the organizational goals.\n\n     II.            Establishes a better way of recruitment and means of selecting the best performed candidate who is fit for the available vacancy.\n\n  III.            Capture data into a secure database which allow applicant data to be easily accessed anytime.\n\n  IV.            Develops a user- friendly application that will achieve these objectives\n\n1.3 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT\n\nThe proposed system would simplify the process of recruitment for both employers and the employees. Moreover, the use of software in recruitment would allow job seekers to be screened for interviews without having to be physically present. Those who then meet up with the criteria would be invited over.  ",

Record keeping has two facets – financial record keeping and managerial record keeping such as date, address, number of goods purchased, unit price of goods, description of the goods, total amount of specified goods and ground total of all the goods (items) listed in the invoice. The basic purpose of financial record is to assist decision makers in evaluating the financial strength, profitability and future prospects of a business.\n\nThe purpose of financial record keeping is to produce\nfinancial statement\nabout a business entity. Therefore, this study has been narrowed down to the record keeping system that has been practiced by different companies in Nigeria.\n\nAutomatic invoice generation system uses a sequential order of list of items that are entered in an invoice platform, to generate an invoice with items and its price per unit from the relational data base. The system automatically summarizes the listed items due for transactions in the ordered goods document and stores them in the invoice table.\n\nBut when invoice information is created manually, the system does not adhere to any sequence/summarization rules you have defined. Rather you manually control the sequence/summarization logic in the way you manually create the pay items.\n\n1.1            STATEMENT  OF THE PROBLEM\n\n1.     Lack of comprehensive database for recording the invoicing,\n\n2.     Time wasted when many customers are waiting to collect manual invoice,\n\n3.     Manually written invoice are subjected to physical damage,\n\n4.     Embezzlement of fund due to poor accountability.\n\n1.2            AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF STUDY\n\nThe objectives include to develop a system that can:\n\n1.     Store and record all the goods sold with an invoice id number.\n\n2.     Manage and record payments.\n\n3.      Provide a unique identification number.\n\n4.     Give account of income generated within a specified period of time,\n\n1.3            SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY\n\nWith growth of information technology, the study offers numerous values in sales invoice recording system.\n\n1.     Customers get good services, which include assurance of goods purchased: with this system the company knows that the customer can easy track them down if any of the goods sold to him/ her substandard goods or refurbished and with this the company will make it as a law to abide with the selling of original goods.\n\n2.     It will provide efficient, effective and timely services: there is no much time wasted when someone is using this system to run his/her business.\n\n3.      Corruption will be reduced: the apprentice hired to assist to attend to customers will not have access to the admin dashboard so that there won’t temper with the price of the goods sold.\n\n4.     There will be no conflict between the company and the customers since terms and conditions are clearly stated.\n\n5.     To make report and company audition easy and accountable: annual report writing will be easy since the system have a way of searching all the invoice produced with the customers’ business name and identification number of the invoice which make the invoice more authenticity in the labour market",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF TRAFFIC OFFENCE TRACKING SYSTEM\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.0 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nPrior to the establishment of\nFederal Road Safety Commission\nin 1988, there was no concrete and sustained policy action to address the carnage on Nigerian roads. Earlier attempts in this direction were limited to discrete and isolated attempts by some states of the Federation and individuals. The unpleasant trend in the nation’s road traffic system which resulted in upsurge in road traffic accidents made the Federal Government initiate a search for a credible and effective response to the challenge. In February 1988, the Federal Government established the Federal Road Safety Commission through Decree No .45 of the 1988 as amended by Decree 35 of 1992 referred to in the statue books as the FRSC Act cap 141 laws of the Federation of Nigeria (LFN) passed by the National Assembly as Federal Road Safety Commission (establishment) Act 200. Around the world road traffic injuries are a major public health challenges that requires concerted efforts for effective and sustained prevention. An estimated 1 .2rnillion people are killed in road crashes every year and as many as 50million puffer injuries. The world health organization believes that these figures could increase by more than half over the next 20years unless there is a firm commitment to road safety and accident prevention, especially in Nigeria, most adults will know of someone who has been killed or injured in a road traffic accident. It is a dead fact that many of these accidents and their consequences would have been avoided. Therefore the Computerized Traffic Offence System will help to keep records of all traffic offences committed by road users and also maintain the databases of the commission (FRSC).\n\n1.1 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe present system of traffic offence system which is the manual system known as (Notice of Offence Sheet) has a lot of problems which are mentioned below:\n\nTIME: Going by the present system of operation, time is consumed in the manual handling of operation involved in road traffic documentation.\n\nCOST: This is the reatest problem of the Federal Road Safety Commission. The commission tends to lose a lot of money running the agency manually. DOCUMENT INTEGRITY: This is viewed in the contest of safety, in validity of the records in document files used in report generation. In terms of safety, the nature of the system makes it vulnerable to theft, fire or accidental destruction.\n\nThis makes the system unsafe as the time needed to replace lost data or files is enormously large.\n\n1.2 OBJECJES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe objectives of the study are as follows:\n\nProvide better services to the public and users making the highway safe for motorists and other road users.\n\n·              To keep records that are complete, integrated and up to date, also recommending works and devices designed to eliminate or minimize accidents on the highways and advising the Federal and State Government including the Federal Capital Territory Administration and relevant governmental agencies on the localities where such works and devices are required.\n\n·              To produce a system where information and output report will be produced or made available much faster, more accurately and more detailed to the commission and the public by educating motorist and members of the public on the importance of discipline on the highway.\n\n·              Maintaining the validity period for\ndrivers’ licenses\nwhich shall be three years subject to renewal at the expiration of the validity period as well as designing, registering and producing vehicle plate number.\n\n·              Conducting researches on the standardization of highway traffic codes.\n\n1.3 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nWith the growth in information technology, the study offers numerous values to the Federal Road Safety Commission and any organization that deals with office documentation data/information. Huge files kept through the manual method in offices will no longer be there again because information will be stored on the computer with the help of the Computerized. Traffic Offence System. It will help to keep a comprehensive record of traffic offence documented.",

As an information medium, the internet offers different information service that has been developed over the time. The services are e.g. electronic mail, file transfer protocol and the\nworldwide web\n(www). The internet has no central owner, but the connected networks are owned and administrated by different universities, companies, authorities and other organizations, in future the customer will be able to buy the goods and services on the internet from all over the world and over the internet with the minimal risk. Recent trends show that most brick and mortar banks are shifting from a product-centric model to a customer-centric model as they develop their new internet banking capabilities. They have, over a long time, being using electronic and telecommunication networks for delivering a wide range of value added products and services. The delivery channels include direct dial up connections, private networks, public networks etc and the devices include telephone, personal computers including the automated teller machines etc. With the popularity of PCs, easy access to internet and worldwide web (www), banks increasingly use internet as a channel for receiving instructions and delivering their products and services to their customers. This form of banking is generally referred to as internet banking, although the range of products and services offered by different banks vary widely both in their content and sophistication.   \n\n1.1     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe advantages offered by these toll calls for a review of an existing\nautomated system\nand subsequent design and implementation of interactive web-site to improve the existing system.\n\n·        In banking industries today, queuing has become the order of the day, customers’ line up for hours waiting to withdraw or deposit money. This creates a lot of problem to both customers as they waste their useful time in the banking hall. The management also wastes their time as they run around to find solution to their problems.\n\n·        It is observed that customers cannot withdraw money any time they want as banks has their working hours. This is a big problem as needs can arise at any time and human beings will always like to have those needs solved.\n\n·        Money deposited into accounts at times takes some hours to reflect in the persons account balance hence making banking operations slow and unhealthy for business growth.\n\n1.2 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nIn a nut shell is to design and implementation of an interactive website for internet banking therefore, the following are the major objective of this work:\n\n1.     Provide fast services, this reduces the queue in the banking hall and permits on-line time data storage and information retrieval.\n\n2.     Build a one- time entry for customer details in the system and provide the use of account ID and password for the customer.\n\n3.     Generate consistent, accurate, timely and pie liable reports or information for effective control in internet banking and to Improve in current automated system that support internet banking service.\n\n1.3 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe study and subsequent design and implementation of this program will be of immense use to the organization, the administration and the customers in realizing the long south goal of speed, efficiency, effectiveness and convenience the program take care of those factors that militated against the smooth running operation of the organization using the on-line services provided by the web.\n\nBetter still scholars who intend to carry out subsequent research could have this as base from where improvement could be made.

This project is developed for use by the public for the sole purpose of\nbooking space\nfor sporting activities. Although many stadiums built in the early 20th century were constructed for a narrowly defined use, the design of stadium evolved so that many modern structures can easily be used for a variety of events, also involving the seating capacity of stadiums which depends on event. Stadiums can be either multi-use for designated for one of several types of sporting events, including track, soccer and football. Washington State’s Qwest Field & Event Center, which is home to the Seattle Seahawks, provides a venue for job fairs, soccer games, trade shows and concerts.  For example Rogers center, (formerly referred to as Sky Dome), in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, holds 50,600 spectators for baseball games, 53,000 for football games, and 67,000  for concerts, which had entertained manual manner of booking, and then the online in the recent times.\n\nThe project is hence, designed to speak volume on the assistance of the stadium managers for managerial and supervisory council skills on the  stadium facilities like football court, basketball court, volleyball court, etc.\n\nThis project has been in use in some other developed countries like the United kingdom, United States of America, etc.,. Who have over the years shown strong\nsporting involvement.\nFor example, siting Wembley stadium in the United Kingdom of which, their stadium resources/facilities for the past ten years has been greatly managed, and it has been of real help to the management team.\n\nThis software will help/provide solution in the clashes in booking of stadium arena and redundancy.\n\n1.1 Statement of the Problem\n\n1.     Stadium managers allocate stadium arena/space for more than one person.\n\n2.     Users travel from a long distance to visit the stadium, only to find out that all the space has already been booked.\n\n3.     Poor file management is on the high side.\n\n4.     Fraud is encouraged.\n\n1.2 Objectives of Study\n\n1.     To login to the website or register to book a space.\n\n2.     To view the available spaces, both the space in use and unused.\n\n3.     To enable users book a space for an event without stress.\n\n4.     To help stadium managers approve or decline orders.\n\n5.     To reduce the work load of stadium operators, managers and individuals.\n\n6.     To enable users complete the transaction by making payment.\n\n1.3 Significant of the Problem\n\n1.     Booking of space in stadium will have central database.\n\n2.     It will be easy and convenient for the officials in charge of booking and space allocation.\n\n3.     It will also give room for easy accountability of events that take place in a particular stadium.\n\n4.     It will also help to eliminate the clashing of two events.\n\n5.     It will control fraud or deception rate on the stadium property and resource.",

        "content": "THE UNITED NATIONS CHEMICAL WEAPON INSPECTION PROGRAMME AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY\n\nIt is often said that conflict is a major characteristic of human daily activities. It is an innate feature, one that cannot be avoided but can be mitigated to prevent violence and grave consequences. According to Rambotham et al (2011), conflict takes its origins from economic differentiation, social change, cultural formation, psychological development and political organization – all of which are inherently conflictual – and becomes overt through the formation of conflict parties, which come to have, or are perceived to have, mutually incompatible goals. Conflict can be constructive or destructive depending on how it is addressed. Constructive conflict can have valuable outcome on human society while destructive conflict can result to damages and loss. Fisher et al(2011) opined that conflict can be addressed through different approaches-given the different dimensions of conflict-which are sometimes linked; conflict prevention, conflict settlement, conflict management, conflict resolution and\nconflict management.\n\nConflict resolution, as stated above is one of the approaches to dealing with conflict and a comprehensive one. Wallenstein (2011) defined conflict resolution as a situation where the conflicting parties enter into an agreement that solves their central incompatibilities, accept each other‘s continued existence as parties and cease all violent action against each other. This means, of course, that conflict resolution is something that necessarily comes after conflict. Fisher et al (2011) opined that conflict resolution addresses the causes of conflict and seeks to build new and lasting relationships between hostile groups. This means a conflict resolution process is often towards putting an end to armed struggle, it also means that conflicts are resolved and transformed to workable peace among the conflicting parties.\n\nSaving generations from the scourge of war is the mantra upon which the United Nations (UN) operates, and as a result of this it is a central organization in peacekeeping and conflict resolution operations within the\ninternational system\n. Following the events of 9/11, it has committed itself to fighting against terrorism while taking steps towards reducing the stockpile and use of chemical weapons. This is based on its affirmation that the proliferation of chemical weapons, as well as their means of delivery, constitutes a threat to international peace and security (S/Res/2118/2013). Given this submission, a violation of this act of international law would warrant great penalty on the state(s) involved, and such is the case of Syria. \n\nIn order to take a grasp of activities of states with large stockpile of weapons and use of such, the UN establishes a mission for each state to investigate presence and use of chemical weapons. An understanding of these weapons inspections missions can be drawn by referring to what Condoleezza Rice (former U.S national security advisor) said in an interview as regards Iraq in March 2002,\n\n―We need to be very clear on the purpose of weapons inspections. These are not inspections for inspections’ sake, they are instrumental to make sure that Iraq is not trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction and so when we focus on weapons inspections in Iraq, we are to focus on weapons inspections that would be effective… ultimately, U.S believed that regime change is going to be best for the Iraq people and for the region. But clearly weapons inspections that are tough, weapons inspections that cannot be challenged, weapons inspections in which Saddam\n\nHussein is not trying to soften the edges of them would be a helpful step forward”. (PBS Newshour, March 11, 2002)\n\nIn this regard, the establishment of a UN mission in Syria was to identify the presence of chemical weapons as well as to verify with adequate information and resources the allegations of the use of such weapons against citizens. \n\nThe immediate trigger of the Syrian uprising was the power shift that occurred as a result of the\n\nArab Spring, the first of which occurred in Tunisia, then Egypt, weeks later Libya, Yemen and Syria had their own crisis (Chatham House, 2012). The Syrian demonstrators had strong motives for their discontent with the regime. After five decades of the rule of the Baath Party, the Syrians were fed up with the rampant corruption and nepotism, and the lack of civil and political liberties.  After a decade in power, Bashar al-Assad attempted to reform the regime, but the turnout was limited.  He introduced a set of economic liberal reforms that benefited the upper class, and mainly those who were close to the regime (Wakim, 2012). The Syrian civil war was caused by many factors, whether local, regional, or international, which interacted to destabilize the Syrian regime. This rebellion was caused by the need of the Syrian people for economic, civic, and political rights, and it happened at a time when the whole Arab region was subject to drastic changes. The conflict in Syria therefore gradually transitioned from an insurgency to a civil war during the summer of 2012. During the first year of the conflict, Bashar al-Assad relied on his father‘s counterinsurgency approach, developed in response to the Muslim Brotherhood uprising in the early 1980s. Counterinsurgency describes a government‘s campaign to restore order and ensure its own reach throughout the geographical confines of the state against armed opponents who aim at the government‘s overthrow. In this case, counterinsurgency describes the Assad regime‘s attempts to regain control over the whole of its territory, an objective it abandoned by the fall of 2012. By contrast, civil war implies that controlling the entire territory within the state is no longer feasible because armed opposition has become strong enough to stop government advances consistently (Holliday, 2013).\n\nWhile the war was on, officials from other governments had expressed concern about Syria‘s chemical weapons security and the Syrian government had in early 2012 assured that ―chemical or biological weapons will never be used … in the Syrian crisis, no matter what the internal developments in this crisis are‖. That all varieties of these weapons are stored and secured by the Syrian armed forces and under its direct supervision, and will not be used unless Syria is subjected to external aggression.‖  But then, the events between March and August 2013 was a departure from the assurance given by the Syrian government, as within the space of these months, 16 cases of alleged use of chemical weapon in Syria were reported to the UN by member-states. The UN Secretary-General (Ban Ki-Moon) decided to establish the United Nations Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic (―UN Mission‖). The purpose of this Mission was to ascertain the facts related to the allegations of use of chemical weapons, to gather relevant data, to undertake the necessary analyses for this purpose, and to deliver a report to the Secretary-General. Upon the completion of the assignment of the mission on 30th September, 2013, the derived conclusion was that chemical weapon had been used in Syria in all the incidents reported with the use of precursor like Sarin and rocket-induced chemicals. The conclusions rest on multiple types of samples, victim interviews, investigation of munitions remnants and lab analyses. \n\nSubsequently, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S Secretary of State John Kerry greed on a Framework on the elimination of Syria‘s chemical warfare capacity, stating that production equipment should be destroyed by November 2013 and complete elimination of chemical weapon materials and equipment in the first half of 2014 (30th June, 2014) (The Newyorktimes,September,14,2013). Furthermore, Syria announced its accession to the Chemical Weapon Convention (CWC). Syria has been disarmed of it chemical weapon now but fighting is still on due to insurgent activities which are been suppressed by airstrikes. The process of disarmament of Syrian chemical weapons stockpile was not in itself a method of resolving the conflict but can rather be perceived as one step out of many other steps.\n\n 1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM             \n\nDespite the apparent successful decommissioning of Syria‘s chemical weapons, the country is still in conflict. Although decommissioning was not aimed at putting an end to the civil war but to limit the occasions of violence in the course of it, this is not to say that it does not affect resolution of the conflict. According to the UN, 191,369 persons have died between March 2011April 2014. The UN refugee Agency identified that about 2,563,434 Syrians have registered as refugees and 6.5 million displaced people with Syria, most of which are children. With this large humanitarian catastrophe and no feasible approach to combat the crisis yet, insurgent groups continue to thrive in Syria and other part of Middle East and the attendant incapability of international institutions have created another dimension on its own; an insecure world and an almost permanent War Zone. If this should continue, the next vulnerable place could be (some parts of)Africa, where authoritarian leaders still hold the reins of power. There is therefore need to understand the extent to which UN and other international institutions as well as states have been involved in the Syrian crisis both positively and negatively, and derive from critical analysis the effect of weapons inspections and possible impact on conflict resolution.\n\n     \n\nSource; (Congressional research service)\n\n1.3 OBJECTIVES OF STUDY\n\n-          To examine the impact of United Nations in  resolving Syrian crisis\n\n-          To ascertain the effect of weapon inspections in the Syrian crisis\n\n-          To identify the relationship between chemical weapons inspection and conflict resolution in one instance\n\n1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1.      What was the impact the United Nations had on Syria crisis?\n\n2.      What are the effects of chemical weapons inspections on resolving the Syrian crisis?\n\n3.      Are weapons inspections important to conflict resolution?\n\n1.5. SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY\n\nBased on the large humanitarian catastrophe posed by the Syrian crisis and the perceived incapability of the international organizations to combat it, it is important to examine the effects of UN roles in the crisis as a universal organization responsible for the maintenance of peace and security, and to also identify the effect of the chemical weapon inspection on the crisis so as to create workable framework for future conflict resolution.\n\n1.6 SCOPE \n\nThe project covers the impact of the United Nations in Syria, looking critically at the loopholes within the space of 2011-2014\n\n1.7 LIMITATIONS\n\n Its limitation derives from the fact that there is a dearth of scholarly work on the crisis as it is still un-folding. Heavy reliance is thus placed on journals and media reports to help shed light on some of the old archives on the country\n\n1.8 ORGANIZATION OF STUDY \n\nThis project will be divided into five chapters. The first chapter contains the background to the study, statement of problem, objective of study, research questions, scope and limitation, and organization of study. The second chapter is the literature review, which is made up of the conceptual clarifications and theoretical frameworks. The research methodology is also espoused upon in the second chapter. Chapter three includes the examination of the impact of the United Nations Mission in Syria. Chapter four examines the disarmament approach used in Syria, focusing on the effect of weapons inspections on the crisis as well as an evaluation of the importance of weapons inspection to conflict resolution. Chapter five encompasses the summary, conclusion and recommendations\n\n 1.9 DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nIt is important to briefly examine some terms pertinent to the proposed project, and they include; conflict resolution, disarmament, and chemical weapons\n\nConflict resolution \n\nConflict resolution is a comprehensive term, which implies that the deep- rooted sources of conflict are addressed and transformed. Thus, we can preliminarily define conflict resolution as a situation where the conflicting parties enter into an agreement that solves their central incompatibilities, accept each other‘s continued existence as parties and cease all violent action against each other. This means, of course, that conflict resolution is something that necessarily comes after conflict. It means that we first need to have concepts and tools for the analysis of conflict. (Wallensteen, 2011)  \n\nDisarmament\n\nDisarmament refers to giving up or reducing armed forces. Disarmament is a subject of national and international laws and policy. Disarmament is the collection, control and disposal of small arms, ammunition, explosives and light and heavy weapons of combatant and often also of the civilian population. Disarmament also includes the development of responsible arms management programs. It is also about preventing the outbreak of war because particular weapons technologies are considered to be destabilizing to international relations, many therefore view their elimination as a contribution to peace and security.\n\nChemical weapons \n\nThe general and traditional definition of chemical weapon is a toxic chemical contained in a delivery system, such as a bomb or shell. The Chemical Weapon Convention(CWC) defines chemical weapons much more generally. The term chemical weapon is applied to any toxic chemical or its precursors (any chemical reactant which takes part at any stage of production, of a toxic chemical) that can cause death, injury, temporary incapacitation or sensory irritation through its chemical action. Munitions or other delivery devices designed to deliver chemical weapons, whether filled or unfilled are also considered weapons themselves. The toxic chemical that have been used as chemical weapons, or have been developed for use as chemical weapons, can be categorized as choking, blister, blood, or nerve agents.  The most well known agents are as follows; chlorine agents–chlorine and phosgene, blister agents (or vesicants) –mustard and lewisite, blood agents-hydrogen cyanide, nerve agents- sarin ,soman, VX. Choking agents like chlorine gas can cause severe skin and eye irritation. Arsenic or cyanide- based blood agents are often fast-acting and lethal. Nerve agents like sarin or VX disrupt the nervous system. The taboo against chemical weapons is more than a century old. The primary idea is that they are indiscriminate and an inherent threat to civilian populations.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATON OF A UNIVERSITY-BASED SOCIAL NETWORK MEDIA SOLUTION\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSocial networks have become very popular in recent years because of the increasing proliferation and affordability of internet enabled devices such as personal computers, mobile devices and other more recent hardware innovations such as internet tablets. This is evidenced by the burgeoning popularity of many online social networks such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. Such social networks have led to a tremendous explosion of network-centric data in a wide variety of scenarios. \n\nSocial networks\nmay be defined either in the context of systems such as Facebook which are explicitly designed for social interactions, or in terms of other sites such as Flickr which are designed for a different service such as content sharing, but which also allow an extensive level of social interaction. Charu (2016) has defined a Social network “as a network of interactions or relationships, where the nodes consist of actors and the edges consist of the relationships or interactions between these actors”. A generalization of the idea of social networks is that of information networks, in which the nodes could comprise either actors or entities, and the edges, denote the relationships between them. Clearly, the concept of social networks is not restricted to the specific case of an internet-based social network such as Facebook; the problem of social networking has been studied often in the field of sociology in terms of generic interactions between any group of actors. Such interactions may be in any conventional or non-conventional form, whether they be face-to-face interactions,\ntelecommunication\ninteractions, email interactions or postal mail interactions.\n\nOne of the first online forms of social networking was Usenet, created by Duke University graduate students, Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis. Usenet was similar to a discussion forum where students can share their opinions and suggestions. In 1984, similar method of online interaction called Bulletin Board System (BBS) was introduced. Later, the emergence of social networks rocketed with the invention of World Wide Web by a British scientist, Tim Berners-Lee, in 1991 \n\nOne of the most dominant social networks in history, Friendster, was founded by Jonathan Abrams and launched in 2003. Along with Friendster, LinkedIn and MySpace also become popular in their respective fields. After 2003, the social networks become so popular that, by the time Facebook was launched in 2006, the Internet users had more than two hundred social networks to choose from. Nowadays, Facebook is regarded as the most successful social network with over 1.06 billion monthly active users, 680 million mobile users, more than 50 million pages and 10 million apps.\n\n1.1       BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n\nFounded in 2009, Wellspring University is a private higher institution located in the large city of Benin City with population ranging between 1,000,000 and 5,000,000. The University is officially accredited by the National Universities Commission, the regulatory agency for Universities in Nigeria. Wellspring University (WU) is a co-educational higher education institution. The University offers courses and programs leading to officially recognized higher education degrees in several areas of study.\n\nAs regards the University’s interface with the outside world, Wellspring University has an official website (wellspringuni.edu.ng) whichupdates the public with latest news and events in the school and serves as a portal where prospective students can apply for admission online\n\n(Wellspring University, 2014).\n\n1.2        STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nApart from its online presence in generally used social networking platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter; Wellspring University does not have a social network tailored for its private use. The University does have an official website but the website does not incorporate a social network media platform. Hence, there is a need to develop and implement a social networking media platform for the University.\n\n1.3       AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe aim of this study is to design and implement a Social network media platform for Wellspring University. The objectives are:\n\ni.

To develop and implement a system which improves upon the current system. iii. To make recommendations that will benefit other institutions\n\n1.4       SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study is centered on designing an automated and web-based social network platform for Wellspring University. The social network platform in question is personalized in that only the staff and students of the University albeit prospective students are permitted on the platform. Every user of the platform must be identified using verifiable authentication and authorization measures.\n\n1.5        LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\nThe limitations of this study are summarized as follows:\n\ni.              Limited time. Further study on other communications problems in Universities especially as it affects the subject matter would have been made but owing to the limited time, the problem domain was tailored to a particular University.\n\nii.            The frequent power failure affected the programming phase of the project.\n\n1.6        FEASIBILITY STUDY\n\nFeasibility study is a study that enables a project team or researcher to establish whether or not conditions are right to conduct an conclude a particular project. Feasibility study is done for many reasons, and is sometimes done in Information Technology Projects in order to evaluate the suitability of the project as it affects concerns in technology, technical expertise, economy,\n\netc. \n\n1.7.1    Technical Feasibility\n\nThis component focuses on the technical resources available to the organization. It helps organizations or project leaders determine whether the technical resources meet capacity and whether the technical team is capable of translating the ideas into functional system. \n\n1.7.2    Economical Feasibility This component typically involves a cost/benefit analysis of the project. This section documents the viability, cost, and benefits associated with a project before financial resources are allocated. As regards this study, Technology and Software costs were minimal as open source Technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL, etc. were employed in the creation of the proposed solution. Hosting of the system was offered for free through free hosting providers such as 000WebHost. \n\n1.7.3    Operational Feasibility\n\n \n\nThese components usually specify how well the organization’s needs could be met by completing the project. It is used to analyze how a project plan satisfies the requirements identified in the requirements analysis phase of the system development. \n\n1.8       TERMINOLOGY\n\ni.

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPUTERIZED HELPDESK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.0       BACKGROUND OF STUDY\n\nHelpdesk provide the end user with information and support related to a company or institution's products and services. The purpose of a help desk is usually to troubleshoot problems or provide guidance about products such as computers, electronic equipment, food, apparel, or software. Corporations usually provide help desk support to their customers through various channels such as toll-free numbers, websites, instant messaging, or email. There are also in-house help desks designed to provide assistance to employees.\n\nThis Computerised helpdesk management system is a platform were users within Wellspring University report any issue encountered during daily operation they can also check if any a solution to such problem which they have encountered exist from a log frequently reported issues and its solution. This report can be sent to the administrator via a telephone call, an existing chat system, or any other format so desired by the administrator. Helpdesk management is central to many organisations that utilise\nInformation Technology\n. They ensure that incidents that Users encounter are dealt with by the relevant people as quickly as possible.\n\nThe history of help desk software dates back to the 20th century when businesses relied mostly on face-to-face interaction to resolve customer issues. Customers had to visit a company’s store or office with the product to get their problems solved. With the invention of the telephone in 1876, and the telephone switchboard in the 1890s, help desk assumed a better approach. Customers were able to reach their company and voice out their problem over the phone system. During the 20th century era, companies used mainly equipment like dictation machines, typewriters, and dumb terminals with access to a mainframe computer, to address customer issues. The earliest use of computers for customer service was done through the use of mainframe software. Customers would submit paper forms or communicate their issue by phone to customer service agents who would seek for avenues to handle the issues.\n\nIn the 1960s, companies began to set up call centers and also train staff to receive and handle customer enquiries in an organized and efficient manner. This was the era of Interactive voice response (IVR) which became a big boost to telephone customer service system. Later on, Desktop PCs and email significantly improved help desk systems. Customers could communicate their problems by email, bypassing paper forms. Help desk agents could provide status updates and resolutions by email as well.\n\nMeanwhile, the actual introduction of help desk systems began in the 1980 when the internet was officially made available for public use. Many companies started outsourcing their customer service department. This led to massive use of email and live chat systems in the 1990s. This new development enabled several US companies to outsource their help desk to low-cost countries like India and the Philippines.\n\nIn any case the real invention of help desk software came in the 2000s when companies began to use diverse kind of software packages to deal with customer-care issues. This led to the massive production of different kinds of help desk software programs across the internet and the world at large. In recent times, the internet and networked systems make help desk software more interactive and participatory for customers and the agents. Customer can now submit and track their issues more easily.(Haslam et al, 2016).\n\n1.1       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nUsers often complain about the lag in communication between them and the administrators of the system who were supposed to resolve any IT (information technology) related issue. There is always delay in communication, because staff have to walk to the ICT unit to lodge their complains verbally, which is overwhelming for the administrator and as a result, issues remain unresolved.\n\n1.2       AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe aim of this study is to design a system that would ensure appropriate and speedy resolution of user issues and thereby saving work time.\n\nThe objectives are:\n\na.                   To get complaint resolved as soon as possible\n\nb.                  To bridge the gap between the users of the system and the administrator.\n\nc.                   To save work time, i.e. the time which the staff uses to walk from his/her office to the ICT department\n\n1.3       SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study will cover data and information exchange within clients or users and the administrator in an academic environment such as Wellspring University effectively.\n\n1.4        SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study examines the existing problem in an organisation that results in issues reported to the administrator been left unresolved and those resolved takes ample time before it is finally resolved and gives necessary solution by introducing a computerised helpdesk management system as a tool in ensuring effective communication between the administrator and users of the system.\n\nImplementing the computerised helpdesk management system ensures efficient\ntroubleshooting\nof IT related issues and it brings about necessary and positive change in the work environment, hence result in speedy completion of work in the organisation.\n\n1.5         LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\na.

        "content": "IMPLEMENTATION OF A CAMPUS SECURITY SYSTEM\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.0      GENERAL OVERVIEW\n\nNational security threat has been a major issue for the government of Nigeria in recent years. Recently, Nigeria has been characterized with different turmoil ranging from human abduction, political mayhem, terrorism and bomb attacks, examination malpractice, etc. Governments have tried several methods in order to curb these menaces but all of them have been proved abortive. Due to this, the government has resolved to adopt the use of computer based video surveillance cameras in public places to monitor and record events that takes place in a particular location. Monitoring is the regular observation and recording of activities taking place in a project or event. Hence the introduction of campus security camera system popularly known as CCTV system.\n\n1.1      BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\n \n\nSur·veil·lance „sər váylənss‟ is French for to “watch from above “. Although the word surveillance literally means (in French) “to watch from above” (i.e. a God‟s-eye view looking down from on high) the term is often used for all forms of observation, not just visual observation. However, the all-seeing eye-in-the-sky is still an icon of surveillance in general. It is commonly used to describe observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment or other technological means. Surveillance is the art of watching over the activities of persons or groups from a position of higher authority. Modern electronic and computer have given surveillance a whole new means of operation. Surveillance can be automated using computers, and people leave extensive records that describe their activities.\n\nCounter surveillance is the practice of avoiding surveillance or making it difficult, before computer networks, counter surveillance involved avoiding agents and communicating secretly. With recent development of the internet and computer databases counter surveillance has grown. Now counter surveillance involves everything from knowing how to delete a file on a computer to avoiding becoming the target of direct surveillance. \n\nInverse surveillance is the practice of reversals on surveillance. E.g. citizens photographing police, shoppers photographing shopkeepers, and passengers photographing cab drivers. \n\nSurveillance camera are often connected to a recording device, IP network, and /or watched by a security personnel/law enforcement officer. These cameras may include features like pan, tilt and zoom; may be placed in indoor or outdoor locations; and may include infrared recording options. Most cameras are used with recording systems, either VCR‟S or digital recorders. Using a digital recorder is the preferred option for easy storage, easy recall, and easy viewing over different monitors.\n\nCollege campuses pose many unique challenges when it comes to security. A video surveillance system must be carefully planned out in order to keep watch over the diverse assortment of facilities that comprise a typical campus community. From hostels and libraries to sports complexes and general campus layout, there's a lot to look after. A system of properly installed campus security cameras will go a long way in ensuring the safety of students, faculty, and facilities on campus.\n\n 1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\n \n\nThe present system used to check for\nexamination malpractice\nin Wellspring university could be referred to as the manual or traditional system  where students are called into their halls respectively according to their registration numbers and departments and are allocated supervisors or invigilators to watch over them as they write. In this system, many deficiencies occur where;\n\n•      A student is wrongly accused due to supervisor‟s intuition.\n\n•      A single supervisor fails to oversee the whole activities of the students.\n\n•      There is the case of\ninadequate facilities\nto contain a large number of students.\n\n•      There is no proper check for forgery and impersonation.\n\nThe problem intended to solve here is Examination monitoring lapses in Wellspring University using CCTV.\n\n1.3       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\n \n\nThe objectives of this study are to enhance the idea and conception of using computerized surveillance systems on campus. In a situation where the examination halls are well equipped with CCTV cameras and full conduction of biometric mechanism, examination malpractice if not fully eliminated, it can be controlled to a great rate.\n\nAlso this study will help provide a platform for the university security to have enough background knowledge on events worth investigating.\n\nHaving this mechanism in operation in Wellspring, objectives to be achieved will be;\n\n•      Exploring to the fullest the different activities of examination malpractice.\n\n•      Investigating crimes strictly with seen proofs or evidences rather than personal\n\nintuition.\n\n•      Extending security to the classroom reach and maintaining student‟s integrity.\n\n•      Catching culprits immediately and tendering appropriate judgments.\n\n1.4      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\n \n\nWith the increase in crime in the nation and diverse sectors of life, it is necessary that stronghold strategies be applied to curb them. If the use of surveillance systems is implemented in examination halls, hostels, gates, stores and other campus facilities.\n\n•      Integrity of certificates will be restored.\n\n•      True test of knowledge will be achieved.\n\n•      Students will take caution to avoid expulsion.\n\n•      Hard work of students will be sufficed in terms of the outcome of their results.\n\n•      Malpractice will be greatly minimized.\n\n•      This will also promote technology literacy of all students involved.\n\n•      Appropriate investigation of crimes and decisive judgments will be achieved.\n\n•      Usage of surveillance systems is necessary in project to study further, different behavioral patterns of students under examination conditions.\n\n•      More job opportunities will be created.\n\n•      Wellspring University will be much safer.\n\n1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\n•      This work is focused on the security, examination monitoring, attendance and behavior of the staffs and students in the department by having a monitoring system using video surveillance.\n\n•      It is not intended for exposing privacy.\n\n•      Installation and implementation of system is centered on Computer Science department.\n\n•      The major focus is on examination monitoring.\n\n1.6      LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\n \n\nThis project has the interest of implementing a monitoring system on every aspect of the university student‟s, staff‟s and facilities. However, the constraints such as financial, time and difficulty in getting relevant information etc. are barriers. Hence the project covers only the Examination Hall in the department of computer science, ICT center, University entrances, and library.\n\n1.7     DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nRemote Access – A video surveillance system operating with IP network technology enables video streams to be sent over the internet for remote monitoring. Footage from cameras throughout the campus can be viewed online from any computer with an internet connection and access to the network.\n\nCCTV (Closed Circuit Television) is a valuable management and security tool generally intended to prevent or detect crime. CCTV can be very effective in maintaining security.  \n\nIP – internet protocol\n\nHTTP – Hyper Text Transfer Protocol",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN AUTO COMPUTERIZED EXAMINATION SYSTEM\n\n CHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTIONS:\n\nA computerized examination system   is an accessing platform that is used to give relaxed examination scenario where every act of misconduct by the student or lecturer over the manual method of paper and pen for examination is eradicated.\n\nThis document will propose all features and procedures to develop the system.  Specially containing details about objectives, scope limitation, process model, primary requirements, team development, possible project risks, project schedule, and finally monitoring and reporting mechanisms. Computerized examination system is very useful for Educational Institute to prepare an exam, safe the time that will take to check the paper and prepare mark sheets. It will help the Institute to examining the students and develop their skills. But the disadvantages for this system, it takes a lot of time when you prepare the exam at the first time for usage.\n\nAnd we are needs number of computers with the same number of students. The effective use of \"Computerized examination  system\", any Educational Institute or training centers can be use to develop their strategy for putting the exams, and for getting better results in less time.\n\nHowever the formulation of question for examination is often treated with consciousness. With the developing of\ncomputer application\ntechnology, more and more computer application software is coming up.\n\nThis application software‟s   associated to every part of   people‟s daily life, and so does the examinations.\n\nJust like other application system, examination systems develop very fast, from simple stand-alone system to C/S based system, and now some WEB based system. Although there are a lot of examination systems, but there also have blanks in some special fields. Examination Evaluation System integrated into the Multimedia Emulation Training System of certain type equipment is designed and will be introduced. This system can be used to help people familiar with the equipment usage quickly which can save money and time. Now the following will analysis and contrast the existing examination systems, and shoveling out the improvement of our examination system. Then we will introduce some characteristics of our system in chapter 3. And in chapter 4 we will introduce the key technology that applied in our system. At last we make a summary on our system and make a brief prospect on the future of the examination system.\n\n1.1     DEFINITION OF PROBLEM\n\nThe problem currently faced in the manual method includes, the unsecure database questions, the costly effect of printing paper for the exams the psychological effect of student suffered due to lecturers favoritism, the constant exposure of student answer sheet leading missing scripts and too much work load on lecturers manually marking thousands of script and this might cause a delay in the publishing of student result. As regards to this problem stated I am making a proposal that serve as a solution to this problem stated and this solution is the\n\nDesign and implementation of a computerized examination system. This system allows candidates to register and take an examination in the system. The teachers of this system are allowed to login for contributing questions and viewing profile of candidates. Administrators will be able to access the system to sign up to a new examination, manage questions, accounts and view profile of the candidates and also change questions at will.\n\n1.2    OBJECTIVE OF STUDY\n\n•      To reduce the expense incurred in manual method of printing question paper and answer sheet since every information is displayed on the monitor screen and marked and saved in the database.\n\n•      To provide question integrity by Create strong and secrete data base that allow for any connection in a secret way, to prevent any outside or inside attacks or question leakage.\n\n•      To specify authorization privileges to administrators to be able to change their question at will before the computerized examination date.\n\n•      Prevention of exam malpractices by applying strict timing possibility for each question and marking of questions immediately, The student fear of been marked down is eradicated and sorting practice is reduced.\n\n1.3    JUSTIFICATION FOR THE SYSTEM\n\nDue to the inconsistency which have persisted in examination system through the university administration system and\nneighboring institutions\n \n\nThe justification for this work is as follows:\n\n•      To do away with manual method of paper and pen for examination which have posed serious threat to the standard of student ability during exams.\n\n•      The manual method could not handle the problem of sorting, and exam malpractice during exams as result an efficient method has to be put in place to eradicate the possibility of reoccurrence.\n\n•      To reduce the fears of student thinking they where mark down during the examination and eradicate any form of missing script since it has always being a major issue in the school.\n\n•      To save cost of constant purchase of answer booklets and also save time and human labor of strolling round the exams checking for student irregular act in the exam hall, malpractices etc.  \n\n1.4            SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis Supplementary Specification applies to the computerized examination, which will be developed by me using all the necessary material within my reach to ensure a successful project result.\n\nThis specification defines the non-functional requirements of the system; such as reliability, usability, performance, and supportability, as well as functional requirements that are common across a number of use cases. (The functional requirements are defined in the system design and implementation)\n\n1.5            LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study was limited to a suitable programming language to used after which I resolved into learning how to use c# and sql server because of the database capacity of sql and c # has good procedural structuring method.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A UNIVERSITY-BASED SOCIAL NETWORK MEDIA SOLUTION\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSocial networks have become very popular in recent years because of the increasing proliferation and affordability of internet enabled devices such as personal computers, mobile devices and other more recent hardware innovations such as internet tablets. This is evidenced by the burgeoning popularity of many online social networks such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. Such social networks have led to a tremendous explosion of network-centric data in a wide variety of scenarios. \n\nSocial networks may be defined either in the context of systems such as Facebook which are explicitly designed for social interactions, or in terms of other sites such as Flickr which are designed for a different service such as content sharing, but which also allow an extensive level of social interaction. Charu (2016) has defined a Social network “as a network of interactions or relationships, where the nodes consist of actors and the edges consist of the relationships or interactions between these actors”. A generalization of the idea of social networks is that of information networks, in which the nodes could comprise either actors or entities, and the edges, denote the relationships between them. Clearly, the concept of social networks is not restricted to the specific case of an internet-based social network such as Facebook; the problem of social networking has been studied often in the field of sociology in terms of generic interactions between any group of actors. Such interactions may be in any conventional or non-conventional form, whether they be face-to-face interactions, telecommunication interactions, email interactions or postal mail interactions.\n\nOne of the first online forms of social networking was Usenet, created by Duke University graduate students, Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis. Usenet was similar to a discussion forum where students can share their opinions and suggestions. In 1984, similar method of online interaction called Bulletin Board System (BBS) was introduced. Later, the emergence of social networks rocketed with the invention of World Wide Web by a British scientist, Tim Berners-Lee, in 1991 \n\nOne of the most dominant social networks in history, Friendster, was founded by Jonathan Abrams and launched in 2003. Along with Friendster, LinkedIn and MySpace also become popular in their respective fields. After 2003, the social networks become so popular that, by the time Facebook was launched in 2006, the\nInternet users\nhad more than two hundred social networks to choose from. Nowadays, Facebook is regarded as the most successful social network with over 1.06 billion monthly active users, 680 million mobile users, more than 50 million pages and 10 million apps.\n\n1.1       BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n\nFounded in 2009, Wellspring University is a private higher institution located in the large city of Benin City with population ranging between 1,000,000 and 5,000,000. The University is officially accredited by the National Universities Commission, the regulatory agency for Universities in Nigeria. Wellspring University (WU) is a co-educational higher education institution. The University offers courses and programs leading to officially recognized higher education degrees in several areas of study.\n\nAs regards the University’s interface with the outside world, Wellspring University has an official website (wellspringuni.edu.ng) whichupdates the public with latest news and events in the school and serves as a portal where prospective students can apply for admission online (Wellspring University, 2014).\n\n1.2        STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\n \n\nApart from its online presence in generally used social networking platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter; Wellspring University does not have a social network tailored for its private use. The University does have an official website but the website does not incorporate a social network media platform. Hence, there is a need to develop and implement a social networking media platform for the University.\n\n1.3       AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe aim of this study is to design and implement a Social network media platform for Wellspring University. The objectives are:\n\ni.        To evaluate the current communications and social network platforms used by the Wellspring University Community, identify its strengths and drawbacks as well as propose an improved solution.\n\nii.      To develop and implement a system which improves upon the current system. iii. To make recommendations that will benefit other institutions\n\n1.4       SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study is centered on designing an automated and web-based social network platform for Wellspring University. The social network platform in question is personalized in that only the staff and students of the University albeit prospective students are permitted on the platform. Every user of the platform must be identified using verifiable authentication and authorization measures.\n\n1.5        LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\nThe limitations of this study are summarized as follows:\n\ni.              Limited time. Further study on other communications problems in Universities especially as it affects the subject matter would have been made but owing to the limited time, the problem domain was tailored to a particular University.\n\nii.            The frequent power failure affected the programming phase of the project.\n\n1.6        FEASIBILITY STUDY\n\nFeasibility study is a study that enables a project team or researcher to establish whether or not conditions are right to conduct an conclude a particular project. Feasibility study is done for many reasons, and is sometimes done in Information Technology Projects in order to evaluate the suitability of the project as it affects concerns in technology, technical expertise, economy,\n\netc. \n\n1.7.1    Technical Feasibility\n\nThis component focuses on the technical resources available to the organization. It helps organizations or project leaders determine whether the technical resources meet capacity and whether the technical team is capable of translating the ideas into functional system. \n\n1.7.2    Economical Feasibility\n\nThis component typically involves a cost/benefit analysis of the project. This section documents the viability, cost, and benefits associated with a project before financial resources are allocated. As regards this study, Technology and Software costs were minimal as open source Technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL, etc. were employed in the creation of the proposed solution. Hosting of the system was offered for free through free hosting providers such as 000WebHost. \n\n1.7.3    Operational Feasibility\n\nThese components usually specify how well the organization’s needs could be met by completing the project. It is used to analyze how a project plan satisfies the requirements identified in the requirements analysis phase of the system development. \n\n1.8       TERMINOLOGY\n\ni.

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SMS BASED WATER BILLING SYSTEM\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.1    INTRODUCTION\n\nIt is obvious that without technology there is no modernization, and modernization in turn brings about improvement in the quality of our lives. The invention of computer and some other related devices has no doubt brought improvement in the quality of life. With the introduction of computer many software were invented and has made those things, which seem not to be\n\npossible, a reality.\n\nSMS Based Water Billing Software is a special program designed to store and manages the records of all the billing activities of the Bagudo water board. It helps to save the record of consumers, cashiers and monthly bills. It also helps to send consumers monthly bills via SMS.\n\n1.2    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nThe importance of computer cannot be over emphasized since the ancient times, computer has proven itself capable of accepting data, storing, processing and producing an accurate result or output. Since computer has partially taken most of the responsibilities of human being, i intend to embed the use of computer in the billing exercise.\n\nWater Board is an organization that deals with several paper works and ledger cards in saving records. These records increase every day as transaction is always going on in the organization. As the record increases, information saving, retrieval and maintenance is becoming tedious every day. There is lack of security because the data can be altered by any individual.\n\nAnother important thing with most of this water boards is that they deal with many of consumers, the notification of consumers on their monthly bills which is very difficult using the paper system of keeping records of billing, where the cashiers has to go round to distribute bills.\n\nMonthly report is also very important in order to allow the organization to make further decisions based on the success or failure recorded in a month.\n\n1.3    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nProper record management is of very important to every organization or company. Most organizations have poor record management which leads them to having many problems during auditing.\n\nWater Board is an organization that deals with every day transaction. The record of bills is what is used to determine success or failure and is what will be used for further decision as to continue with the present pattern of business or change to a new style.\n\nThe manual record keeping and billing is very slow and is error prone. No proper security is usually provided to the record and so can be tempered with by any individual either intentional or accidental. Another problem with the manual system of record keeping and billing is the\nnatural disaster\n. Disasters like fire outbreak etc can cause damages or even total vanish of all records.\n\n1.4    AIM and OBJECTIVES\n\nAim\n\nTo design and implement an SMS based\nWater Billing System\n\nProject Objectives\n\n1.4.1        To study and investigate on the current system\n\n1.4.2        To conduct a literature review on SMS based Water Billing System\n\n1.4.3        To investigate the most appropriate tool for the development of a web-based System\n\n1.4.4        To design and implement a database for SMS based Water Billing System\n\n1.4.5        To design and implement a front-end tool\n\n1.4.6 To evaluate the tools, techniques and methods used to design and implement the propose system.\n\n1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis project work is of benefit to the management of Bagudo Water Board for simplicity of their work and to help improve their activities more efficiently. The research also served as academic bedrock upon which student and researchers would build their research on similar or other academic work of their choice.\n\n1.6    SCOPE AND LIMITATION\n\nThis project is useful for the Bagudo Water Board, Branch of Kebbi State Water Board, but has extended capabilities to accommodate more additional Water Boards. It does not suffice for Kebbi State Water Board as a whole.\n\n1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\n1.7.1 Internet\n\nIt is a “network of networks” that consists of millions of smaller domestic, academic, business, and government networks, etc. which together carry various information and services, such as electronic mail, online chat, file transfer, and the interlinked web pages and other resources of the World Wide Web (www).\n\n1.7.2 Web\n\nThe World Wide Web (commonly shortened to the Web) is a system of interlinked hypertext document accessed via the internet.\n\n1.7.3 Web browser\n\nA web browser is a software application which enables a user to display and interact with text, images, video, music and other information typically located on a Web page at a website on the World Wide Web or a local area network.\n\n1.7.4 Website\n\nA website (alternatively, web site ) is a collection of web pages, images, video or other digital assists that is hosted on one or more web servers, usually accessible via the internet.\n\n1.7.5 Web page\n\nA web page or webpage is a resource of information that is suitable for the World Wide Web and can be accessed through a web browser. This information is usually in HTML or XHTML format, and may provide navigation to other web pages via hypertext links.\n\n1.7.6 Localhost\n\nLocalhost is a software program that facilitates access to peer-to-peer virtual file system via Bit Torrent protocol.\n\nDefault name describing the local computer address also known as the loopback address. For example, typing: ping localhost would ping the local IP address of 127.0.0.1 (the loopback address). When setting up a web server or software on a web server, 127.0.0.1 is used to point the software to the local machine.\n\nThis IP address is the local IP address and is not the IP address used by your computer to communicate with other computers on your network or the Internet.\n\n1.7.7 Web server\n\nA web server is essentially a computer program which is responsible for handling HTTP requests. A browser request to view a page the server then accepts the request and displays the page. From a general point of view, we consider web servers as the storage area for files which are available on the web. So in order for any page to be viewable on the web it must be loaded on to the web server. A web server is usually a dedicated piece of hardware and software used to allow a website to be displayed on the net.",

The guidelines presented forces on two areas of particular concern for policy-makers data collection and system  monitoring. To accommodate the needs of boths developing and developed Nations we offer a number of different approaches  to data collection and monitoring. Provide practical example of data collection methods that can be used t examine courage and quality two areas that are especially important for policy-making decisions. Finally the unique demands of collecting data to be used in cross- national research.\n\n    The major type of early childhood services in both developed and developing countries the general information about early childhood policies, indicators, and methods of data collection. The two specific example of early childhood policies, with suggest indicators for these policies and recommended methods of data collection. The next program discusses the special requirements of National data collection  if the findings are to be reported cross-nationally.\n\n1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nthe factors that influences the course of development with organization and its accomplishment is good to be embraced so as to ensure that adequate majors are taken to monitor birth rate the united Nation children fund (UNICEE) Enugu, till now can not keep track of its registered new born babies accurately but gets its data nod information through National.\n\n    Population commission due to the fact that they don’t take birth rate monitoring as a particular sector to monitor, but also emphasis  on other aspect concerning children such as  their right Education. Lack of sophisticated machine for the purpose rather it uses the old system to monitor work, the negligence has made report to parents and the National population commission.\n\n    Although the National Populating commission being represented at the hospital by one of its staff to be manually taking  record of event so as to enable the National population commission have on to up-to data records of every newly born baby.\n\n    Thus, its necessary for the health institution to introduce on information system that would be used for the recording of event regarding and complication related to pregnancy. \n\n1.3 PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\nthe purpose of the study is to design an on line information system that would help to solve all the problems encountered in this health institution while monitoring pregnant parents and development of effective child labour intentions and prisons of important tools of study  birthrate.\n\n1.4 OBJECTIVE OF STUDY\n\n    the study will be of immense importance health institution through the united Nation children fund (UNICEF) Enugu not only them but other health institution that would want to embank of online birth rate information monitoring system.\n\nThe objective can be as follows:-\n\na)  Generation of valid and reliable quantitative data on child     labour.\n\nb). serving as a monitor and regulatory on line information system to check the mistake associated with adulterated birth registration.\n\nc). for the development of effective child-labour interventions  and provision of important for designing, implementing and monitoring effective policies and programmes on child-labour\n\nd). Increases the scope of the computer application in our health institution.\n\ne). Assist the national population commission in the provision of numbers of newly born babies into the nation.\n\nf). Increases importance to the nation with the objective of keeping track of newly born babies so as to avoid poverty.\n\ng). Making birth registration easy and cheap for the beneficiaries as regards to its manual method.\n\n1.5 SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM\n\nthe study of this project was suppose to include birth and death rate of child, that is the registration of death of citizen and that of birth of citizen but for obvious reason, the scope is limited to birthrate monitoring information online system with a case  study of united Nation children fund (UNICEF) Enugu.\n\n    The survey which had a national coverage, including the 36 states of the federation including the federal capital territory it was design to investigate all aspect of work carried out by children and pregnant mothers.\n\n1.6   DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nData:    A collection of unorganized facts\n\nDe bugging: The process of eliminating error in software or in     the system.   \n\nDiskette:    A small plastic disk coated with a magnetizerable     substance and encased in plastic jacket of ten referred to   as floppy disk.\n\n  End-user: Any person who uses information technology to perform his/her sub.\n\nField:   A basic unit of data usually put of the record located on input output or storage medium\n\n File:   collection of related records.\n\nHard were:   physical equipment or trice in a computer   system\n\nInformation: meanful data or processed data\n\nInput: To access data from an external device and place them     into a computer memory\n\n Management: processes by which artain   basic function in     organization is performed \n\nMenu:    display presented by a section of a program that     permits the user to control the order of execution of other     modules in the program.\n\nModule: In programming a solution component representing a     processing function  will  be carried out by a computer.\n\nOn-lines:    computer support equipment is currently set up so     that it can transmit data to communicate mediation\n\n Surgeon:    This is a person that is qualified to be called but     specializes on operation of the womb etc.\n\nAssistance:  He helps the surgeon in the theater\n\nBook of like:    this is a very big book contain information      about birth",

I hope you find it helpful.\n\n            UK visas is the overseas arm of Britain’s integrated border management.  We have visa offices in 160 locations throughout the world.  The largest handles 300,000 applications a year; the smallest less than 10.  we issue visas to 80% of those who apply and stop only those who are a significant immigration risk to the UK.  We process over 90% of straightforward applications within 24 hours.  This is a record of which we are proud,  but we aim to do even better.\n\n            Our new mission statement explains how UK visas will deliver the border objectives set by our parent department, the home office and foreign and common wealth office; to achieve a balance between managing travel and migration and preventing illegal immigration\n\n            Our goals are\n\n·                     to bring communities together\n\n·                     to improve Britain’s competitiveness as a destination for travel, trade, migration and investment\n\n·                     to prevent immigration abuse\n\n·                     to deliver for money\n\n·                     to earn public confidence\n\n1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\n            in British visa processing information system the problems we are facing are (i)      Bankruptcy Attorney e.g. consumer present their case at legal match by through extensive client acquisition and market outreach efforts our legal match will assists thousands of visitors every day seeking help with their legal issues.  In some areas consumers can also reach us by phone so new bankruptcy legislation may make it harder to find an attorney.  (ii)       Another problem in visa processing into system is the privacy and security problems ie using illegal or fraud visa to go to overseas. (iii) Health (tuberculosis) screening is another problem in visa processing system since it valid for larger than six months in certain countries now require a certificate to show that they are free from infections tuberculosis (TB) before that person will travel to overseas.  The Government announced on 21 July 2005 its intention is to implement the first phase of an overseas screening programme for TB for people applying to enter the UK for more than 6 months in four year strategy earlier this year.  The benefit of the programme is that successful applicants will benefit on arrival in the UK as they will not need to be referred to the port medical inspector before being allowed to enter the country.\n\n1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\n            The UK purpose of study in visa processing system is to achieve the following Diplomatic mission.\n\n·                     A Diplomatic Mission is the office of a country’s diplomatic representative in the capital city of another country.\n\n·                     Diplomatic Mission are established in accordance with the erovisions of the Vienna convention on Diplomatic relations 1961.\n\n·                     Diplomatic Mission of a common wealth country in another common wealth country is called a “High commission”\n\n·                     The head of mission is called “High commissioner”.\n\n·                     A diplomatic mission in any foreign (i.e. non-common wealth) country is called an Embassy and the head of mission is called Ambassador’\n\n·                     High commissions and Embassies perform the same functions and have the same status.\n\nThe good management of our diplomatic mission is essential to the success of their work.\n\n1.4       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\n            UK visas began life as the joint entry clearance unit (JECU) in June 2000.  it was established jointly by the foreign and common wealth officer and the home office to manage the UK’s entry clearance (visa) operation.\n\n            Visa or entry clearance applications are processed by entry clearance officers in UK embassies, high commissions and consulates abroad, collectively known as UK missions.  UK visas work closely with the immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) of the Home office, the Government department responsible for immigration policy and dealing with applications from people already in the UK to extend their stay; or to change their immigration status.  UK visas reports to a joint management board of senior foreign and common wealth (FCD) and Home office officials and to ministers in both departments.\n\n1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\n            The scope of the study is concerned with the review to improve.  Britain’s competitiveness as a destination for travel, trade, immigration and investment and to bring communities together.  Specifically the study covers such areas like how UK visas will deliver the border objectives set by our parent department, such as the home office and the foreign common wealth office in order to achieve a balance between managing people’s travel and migration, and also preventing illegal immigration.  In this study new computerized system is produced / designed after the critical analysis of the existing system of British embassy and visa processing information system.",

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EXPERT SYSTEM ON TROUBLESHOOTING AND MAINTENANCE OF PRINTER.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nThe impact of engineering age is tremendous and its arrears of application are increasing geometrically.  It is believed that the information revolution will radically change the nature and quality of engineering work in the near future.\n\nSome of the most exiting arrear of the information technology includes.\n\n- Office automation and computer publishing \n\n- Just-in-time (J.I.T) production techniques to reduce cost and improve quality.\n\n- Electronic shopping and electronic funds transfer\n\n- Computer controlled commuter train system\n\n- Decision support system (DSS) that facilitate real time control of making under battle field condition typically characterized by uncertainty\n\n- Computer aids to the handicapped including intelligent implants and experts for medical diagnosis.\n\n- Computer aids instruction (CAI) and aided manufacturing.\n\nDue to all these mentioned arrears of computer application and more, computer has now been accepted and used by so many organizations, by individuals for various purposes.  It is believed that computer is an agent, which improves productivity, enhances competition.\n\nIt is however worthy to not that 75% of all computer application generate documented information.  This is why it is said that had copy is the spice of information. \n\nComputer generates printed report for adequate circulation and communication.  This underlines the importance of printers in computerized operations and environments.\n\nConsidering the increasing number of which malfunction ‘vis a vis’ while the scanty availability of maintenance experts, these is no doubt that may important and urgent reports are either frustrated permanent or produced too late to serve their purpose.  ItS therefore become very imperative to develop this EPSON printer troubleshooting and maintenance expert system which will guide a non-expert through step by step approach to troubleshoot and maintain his EPSON printer.\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nWhen printers malfunction, it is often difficult tracing the causes of such malfunctions with respect to identified symptoms.  Often, some of these faults are so minor that virtually every user is supposed to be able to handle them effectively without having to undergo the rigours of finding maintenance experts.  In many occasions, the defects are perfectly eliminated by clearing the edge connectors and resisting the plugs and printer interface cards.  Some diagnostic software such as Qapuls could also help in locating the causes of the problem.\n\nHowever, the need for a reliable maintenance service cannot be over emphasized.\n\nSince it is necessary for effective performance of any printer.  Also it is pertinent to observe that there are many other preventive maintenance procedures that can be duly appreciate by the user which could minimize printer failure.  This project has been designed and preventive maintenance in a “DO IT YOURSELF FASHION.  It as well provides most of the salient information necessary to troubleshoot Epson printers.\n\nPURPOSE OF STUDY\n\nThe purpose of this project or study is to give expert knowledge or guide on the rectification of several known faults commonly developed by Epson printer and then develop an expert software system which will give any user the expertise knowledge to rectify the problem of his/her Epson printer. \n\nThis project will, therefore, briefly, look at the superficial culture of maintaining and trouble shooting printers with a view providing a number of analytical diagnostic steps that an operator could easily implement to enable him/her forge ahead when his/her printer suddenly develops a fault in the make of a printer job.\n\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe aims and objectives of this project are:-\n\nTo assemble a knowledge base that is common to the trouble shooting and maintenance Epson printers of diverse models.  To prevent this knowledge in a diagnostic format such that will enable even non-expert identify and rectify minor problems of the printers especially.  When the maintenance experts are not handy.  To provide a printer maintenance teaching aid on the basis of DO IT YOURSELF.  To emphasize the concept of preventive maintenance, especially as it effects fragile electronic of the ink of computer and printers.\n\nSCOPE OR DELIMITATION\n\nEven though there are several types – laser, dot – matrix, inkjet – and makes of printer Epson, OK1, NEC, CITIZEN, IBM, STAR, PANASONIC, etc,. for the purpose of this project, it has been designed to focus on the most commonly found (the Epson dot – matrix printer).  This option was chosen with the respect to the fact that this could be regarded as the (economy class) hence need as much guide as possible both in preventive and guide as possible both in preventive and corrective maintenance.\n\nIt is worth being mentioned that the project has been designed and mainly flow on the Epson and similar.  The area of coverage is not very wide, however, since volume of books and journals are regularly on the issue.  Hence this work shall not attempt to be exhaustive.\n\n1.6 LIMITATION \n\nThe research work cannot contain all it suppose because of the following reasons or limitations.\n\nTIME FACTOR:- The aim that is given for the research on this study is very limited making it impossible to go further into the research.\n\nUNAVAILABILITY OF THE NEEDED INFORMATION:- Seeing that only a few engineering firms exist in this country, it was difficult for me to get much informant for the work.\n\nTIMITED RESOURCES: Because of the cost in transportation and other financial demands, it was not possible to get all the information needed for an elaborate work.\n\n1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nArtificial intelligence result when machines are made to thick.  Artificial intelligence is a general term, which expert systems and robotics lie.  The expert system technology has been necessitated by the fact that some human domain experts delay some wonderful skill, which is lost whenever they die thereby leaving the future generation with little or nothing to inherit from their wonderful skill.  Hence they need the expert knowledge of a human being in a domain of activity to be stored in the computer such that computer mimic the reasoning of the expert in some way reaching the same decisions or conclusion as the expert himself and effectively replacing him.\n\nBecause of the reposition of an expert knowledge in the computer memory to enable it think like the expert.\n\nEXPERT SYSTEM (ES)\n\nThe title of this work “expert system on trouble shooting and maintenance of Epson printer” presents a lot of computer words or term or jargon which need detailed explanation or definition for absolute comprehensive of this and topic and the intention of this work.  I shall therefore proceed to highlight the meanings of the terms.\n\nWHAT IS EXPERT SYSTEM?\n\nAccording to Daniel L. Stotink and his friends in a book “computer and applications an introduction to data processing” expert system is also a knowledge based system.  It is a complex software (program), designed to imitate the thought processes and decision making patterns of human experts in a given field.  The expert system is an off-spring of artificial intelligence (AI) and it is developed using the programming techniques of A1.  when the expert knowledge of human being in a domain of activity is stored in the computer.  Such that the computer repository of this expert knowledge in some way, reaching the same conclusion as the expect himself and efficiently replacing him, an expert system or knowledge based system results.\n\nKNOWLEDGE – BASED\n\nThe repository in a computer of an experts knowledge in a given domain as a knowledge base.\n\nDOMAIN EXPERT\n\nIt is not easy to effectively replace the human being with just one expert system rather, a piece meal approach is used in which an expert system is instrumental for a narrow domain to mimic the human being in one activity at a time.\n\nREASONING BY INDUCTION\n\nIf in an expert system past conditions and corresponding decisions reached are stored such that where a new condition arises.\n\nThe computer tries to march it with one of the previous condition, the approach is known as reasoning by induction.\n\nHEURISTIC\n\nIn general, the experience a human being acquires in any are of human endeavour are often in the form of rules of thumb which the human experts falls upon when confronted with a new but related situation.  Such rules of thumb are known as heuristic in artificial intelligence terminology. \n\nINFERENCE ENGINE\n\nThe knowledge of an expert can be represented as a set of rules that allows the computer to make human like decisions on the subject.  In other words, a knowledge – base can actually be in the form of rules and not only in the form of tables of information which can also be used as alternative approach.   The computer program written to shift through the set of rules representing human expert knowledge so as to reach a decision on the current situation can be referred to as inference mechanism or inference engine. \n\nTROUBLE – SHOOTING\n\nTrouble – shooting is the ac of detecting and mending faults be it a hardware or software facility.  To be good trouble shooter one needed to understand a system better than the average person.\n\nMAINTENANCE\n\nMaintenance is the performance of “prevention or remedial maintenance in order to prevent incipient hardware faults or to correct a hardware fault that has occurred”.  We therefore define computer and printer maintenance as the prevention and correction of faults in the system or as knowing fault that has occurred or as knowing fault that has occurred or that fault can occur.  And taking steps to ensure that the fault is eliminated.\n\nDefinition in this ways two kinds of maintenance can be identified.\n\ni. PREVENTIVE:- Knowing that a fault can occur and taking steps to prevent occurrence.\n\nii. CORRECTIVE:- When the faults has already occurred and it has to be corrected.  Also a definition of exactly what is (fault) or what constitute a fault must be known.  In essence, for maintenance to take place a description of the normal fault (its cause) and its remedy must be known.  It should be clear that maintenance to take place, a large information based about the fault to be diagnose has to available to service personnel.  Also needed would be the tool, both of these items are discussed in this project.  When take within the context of computer, maintenance and hardware maintenance.  The terms “hardware” in the brain, respectively to the brain while a software fault might be equivalent to mis information.\n\nKnowledge engineer is a specialist who works with experts to capture the knowledge they possess in order to develop a knowledge base for expert system and other knowledge from experts and then builds the knowledge base using an iterative, prototyping process until the expert system is acceptable.",

        "content": "ASSESSMENT OF THE UTILIZATION OF INTERNET SERVICES AMONG STUDENTS IN FEDERAL INSTITUTIONS IN KADUNA STATE\n\nCHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION The convergence of information and communication technologies as typified by the Internet is increasingly having more influence on all aspects of the society as it has become an integral part of the daily lives of many people. It has had a transformative impact on the mode of information sharing and access globally. Information and knowledge disseminated through the slow process of oral communications or with paper materials can now be transferred rapidly from an individual to an infinite number of users through a number of media and formats. The Internet is the fastest growing communication technology and has emerged as a major source of information that connects people, data and other computers, reducing the world to the much talked-about global village. Bane and Milhemi (1995) described the Internet as the premier networks, everyone connected or as unmanaged web of computer plasma. Technically and functionally, Hargittai (1999) defined the Internet as a worldwide network of computers, and a network of people using computers that make vast amounts of information available. Amichai-Hamburger and Hayat (2010) described the Internet as the creation of a continuous stream of computers linked together to form one grid, which enables interaction among hundreds of millions of people browsing the net.   Whereas the television revolution reached 50 million viewers in 13 years, the same feat was attained in only four years by the Internet (Molosi, 2001). Yunus and Khayal (2000) posited that if there is only one force that is transforming people’s lives and that holds promise to deliver tumultuos impact in the future, it is Internet. To underscore the increasing reliance on the Internet, Huttner (2007) posited that without the Internet, planes would not fly, financial markets would not operate, supermarkets would not restock, taxes would not get paid and the power grid would not balance the supply and demand for electricity. Aqil and Ahmad (2011) averred that the Internet places information on our finger tips and that it is everywhere, knocking at our door, making our life easy and smooth.  \n\n1.1   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY The education sector was among those that first embraced the use of Internet, and it has continued to broaden the breadth and depth of opportunities within institutions of higher learning worldwide. The Internet serves as a useful tool in support of the various educational activities that ranged from research to teaching. Anderson and Reed (1998) noted that the Internet technology and computers has made it possible for students to be active learners and allowed instructors to be facilitators. Jackson, et al. (2011) remarked that the Internet will level the educational playing field due to its availability to everyone, everywhere, and any time, irrespective of gender, race/ethnicity, income or other socio-demographic characteristics. Thus, the Internet is a vital tool that will propel University education to greater heights as the world move further into the knowledge-based economy. Universities worldwide now invest a lot on intenet access because it reduces the time between the production and utilization of knowledge; improves co-operation and exchange of ideas with fellow researchers in other institutions, regions or countries, furthers the sharing of information; and promotes multidisciplinary research. Bon (2007) states that the Internet can substitute for expensive hardcopy libraries, by availing students’ access to scholarly information resources. Today, survival in academics without the Internet is hardly imaginable. The Internet has found useful applications in online data repositories, library catalogues, journals, news services, student and financial administration systems, online supported or solely online conducted teaching, as well as in digital communication with fellow students and lecturers. Other contemporary uses of Internet by students include purchasing, entertainment, and even dating. The investigation of how the Internet fits into the daily life of staff and students at educational institutions is worthwhile when one considers the ubiquitous and all pervasive communications tool features of the Internet. Consequently, studies have been carried out in many places to understand how University students use the Internet, the purposes for which the students use the Internet, the search engines used, their Internet skills as well as problems that hinder efficient Internet use.   The Internet is very useful to university students and staff in Nigeria because it enables them to have access to timely, accurate and relevant information that cannot be obtained from library shelves. Chan and Fu (2009) noted that Internet searching helps university students to boost their intellectual development and job preparation. Due to the endless nature of information resources on the Internet, libraries are increasingly investing in provision of Internet services and resources to enable their clients have better access to the information.   Lyon (1998) states that Internet connections now constitute a highly visible service in every library and that the librarians and their clients have embraced it in their daily work. Academic libraries now run information literacy courses to educate faculty members and students on skills to access, retrieve and evaluate information resources from the Internet. Qunqing (2004) referred to the Internet as ‘a large encyclopedia’ or ‘a library without walls’ for its abundant information. The research intends to assess the utilization of internet services among students of federal institution in kaduna state.  \n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM The problem confronting this research is to provide an assessment of the utilization of internet services among students in federal institution in Kaduna State. In view of the growing significance of internet services for academic research and learning, it is important to appraise the level of awareness and patronage of students of higher institution of the usage of internet services. The study  focuses on the students of federal institution in Kaduna State\n\n 1.3   RESEARCH QUESTIONS 1       What is the nature of internet services 2       What is the relevance and significance of internet services in higher institution of learning 3      What are the challenges of internet usage among students of higher institution 4      What is the level of usage of internet services among students in federal institution in kaduna state.\n\n1.4   OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY 1      To determine the nature of internet services 2      To appraise the relevance of  internet services in academic  higher institution 3      To determine the challenges in internet usage among students of higher institution 4      To provide an assessment of internet utilization among students of federal institution in kaduna state\n\n1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY The study shall provide an analysis of the nature of   internet services.

        "content": "THE USE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY IN TEACHING OF VOCATIONAL SUBJECTS IN NIGERIA POLYTECHNICS\n\nABSTRACT\n\nStudents’ learning in tertiary institutions all over the world has undergone tremendous transformations, especially since the advent of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). There is a shift from the traditional approach of teacher directed/didactic to modern method where computer technology plays a significant role. ICT has promoted learning and made it more meaningful where students can stay even in their homes or classrooms and receive lecturers without seeing the lecturer. The aspect of ICT that has brought about this revolution in students’ learning is e-learning.\n\nE-learning as explained by Open Learning Centre (2007) is an educational resource that helps in effective teaching and learning process created through combining e-digital content with local community and tutor support along with global community engagement. It is also an effective and efficient system of self-paced personal training available over the internet. The Commission of Technology and Adult (2001) defined e-learning as instructional content or learning experiences delivered or enabled by electronic technology. Also, Erah (2006) stated that the term e-learning refers to computer-enhanced training as opposed to the computer-based training of the 1980s. It is usually delivered through personal computers and includes learning delivered by other communication technologies.\n\nThe devices often used for this purpose include:- laptops or personal computers, CD ROMs. Television, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). MP3 players and mobile phones. Communication technologies enable the use of internet e-mail, discussion forms, collaborative software, classroom management software, team learning systems, intranet, extranet, Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), audio and videotapes, satellite down links, computerized diagnostic assessment, competency certification and electronic portfolios (Asogwa, 2006).\n\nE-learning is based on electronic formats (Bodys, 2005). It can benefit any students or teacher irrespective of the background. E-learning is a major issue in pedagogy of individualized instruction, self pace study etc, which is; adapting the teaching to the needs of various learners. E-learning provides this by making available the required learning materials for teaching of these vocational subjects which eventually leads to increased graduation rates and lower failure rates of students.\n\nFinally, it promotes equity by providing students with access to courses which may not ordinarily be available and providing teachers with materials for teaching (Asogwa, 2006).\n\n2.2   Concept of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) \n\nInitially in business and other organizations, internal reporting was produced manually and only periodically, as by-product of the accounting system and with some additional statistic(s) and gave limited and delayed information on management performance. Data was organized manually according to the requirements and necessity of the organization. As computational technology developed, information began to be distinguished from data and systems were developed to produce and organize abstractions, summaries, relationships and generalizations based on the data.\n\nEarly business computers were used for simple operations such as tracking sales or payroll data, with little detail or structure. Over time, those computer applications became more complex, hardware storage capacities grew, and technologies improved for connecting previously isolated applications. As more and more data was stored and linked, managers sought greater detail as well as greater abstraction with the aim of creating entire management reports from the raw, stored data. The term “MIS” arose to describe such applications providing managers with information about sales, inventories, and other data that would help in managing the enterprise. Today, the term is used broadly in a number of contexts and includes (but is not limited to): decision support system resource and people management applications, enterprise resource planning (ERP), enterprise performance management (EPM), supply chain management (SCM), customer relationship management (CRM), project management and database retrieval applications.\n\nVarious authors had define ICT differently, among them is Onuma (2007), he define ICT as the aspect of managing and processing information through the use of electronic computers and computers software to convert, store, protect, process, transmit and retrieve information. It can also been seen as computer-based tools used by people to work with information and communication processing needs of an individual or organization. It encompasses the computer, computer hardware and software, the network and several other devices (video, audio, macro-electronic devices, software etc.) that convert information (text), image, sounds and motion into common form (Akubuilo, 2007). It is the handling and processing of information for use by means of electronic and communication gadgets such as computers such as computers, cameras, telephones etc.\n\nInformation is a term with many meanings depending on the context; it is seen as organized data which is understood to have significance and meaning or data that have been processed and presented in a form suitable for human interpretation, often with the purpose of revealing trends or patterns or an organized data that has been arranged for better comprehension and understanding. However, communication takes place when information is shared interchangeably between two or more individual is a major component of ICT is a process by which people exchange information or express their thoughts and feelings.\n\nTechnology simply implies the application of knowledge to meet the goals, goods and services desired by the people. It is the innovation, change or modification of the natural environment to satisfy perceived human needs and wants ICT is the scientific tool and techniques for developing, documenting and communicating information when especially as they concern solving problems, providing need services in the various areas of human endeavours. ICT can also be described as a whole range of technologies involved in information processing. It is a term used to described technologies, which receives, record, processes, transmit and retrieves information. It is the handling and processing of information by means of electronic and communication devices such as computers, cameras, telephones etc. It is therefore, a scientific method of sharing, exchanging and sending or moving such information from one place to another.",

        "content": "THE ROLE OF INFORMATION GATHERING IN THE RAPID SOCIAL-ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION OF NIGERIA\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY\n\nRapid economic development and social well-being constitute the transformation imperative of developing countries of the world and indeed, remain the normative goal of the international community (Ehi, 2009). This involves the attainment of sufficient levels of economic growth to allow for a progressive improvement in the material standard of living of the populace. However, for Nigeria and most African countries, the economies are in an abysmal state. The worsening economic conditions have been generating a mix of domestic, social and political tension. We have had series of development plans in Nigeria. Nigeria is permanently hunted by the spectre of development. Its fifty three years of independence actually are rolling by daily in search of development. The myth of growth and development is so entrenched that the country’s history passes for the history of development strategies and growth models from colonial times up to date. No term has been in constant flux as development. This seems the only country where virtually all notions and models of development have been experimented (Aremu, 2003).\n\nInformation gathering refers to gathering information about the issue been faced and the ways other organizations and communities have addressed it. The more information one have about the issue itself and the ways it has been approached, the more likely one is able to devise an effective program or intervention of to address the situation (Bala, 2007). There are obviously many sources of information, and they vary depending on what is been looked for. In general, information can be gathered from only 2 sources, existing sources or natural example.Existing sources refers to published material of various kinds that might shed light either on the issue or on attempts to deal with it.  These can be conveniently divided into scholarly publications, aimed primarily at researchers and the academic community, mass-market sources, written in a popular style and aimed at the general public and statistical and demographic information published by various research organizations and government agencies (Iwe, 2000). Natural example includes programs or interventions developed and tried in communities that have addressed similar issue. Studying them can tell can indicate what worked for them and what didn’t, and why. By giving the insight into how issues play the other communities, they can provide nuts-and-bolts ideas about how to (or how not to) conduct a successful program or intervention. For the most part, information sources here are the people who are involved in efforts to address issues similar to the one been faced (Iwe, 2000). Additionally, there are a number of natural examples (such as single case studies) that have been written about descriptively in the literature of community psychology or public health that may be relevant to your work.\n\nSecurity involves freedom from danger or threat to a nation’s ability to protect and develop itself, promote its cherished values and well-being of its people. This takes into account the need for information gathering and significance of human well-being in the security considerations of a country especially in a developing country like Nigeria. In this connection, it is easy to establish a nexus between information gathering, national security and development. Accordingly, it is meaningless to talk of social economic transformation in the absence of national security. In other words, insecurity in a nation is a threat to social economic transformation. National security is a sine qua non for political stability and socio-economic development of any nation\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThere has been no previous research on role of information gathering in the rapid socio economic transformation of Nigeria but however gathering the information that already exists about the issues hindering development and attempts to address it is one of the most important aspects of planning a program or evaluation that can bring about the needed socio economic transformation in Nigeria. By putting together what’s known about the issue and the history of the successes and failures of various approaches to it, the nation can build a program structure that includes new innovations and elements that have worked for others in similar situations. However, the researcher is examining the role of information gathering in the rapid socio economic transformation of Nigeria.\n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the objectives of this study:\n\n1.  To examine the role of information gathering in the rapid socio economic transformation of Nigeria.\n\n2.  To identify the approaches to reliable information gathering for the purpose of socio economic development.\n\n3.  To identify factors that influences rapid socio economic transformation of Nigeria.\n\n1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\n1.  What is the role of information gathering in the rapid socio economic transformation of Nigeria?\n\n2.  What are the approaches to reliable information gathering for the purpose of socio economic development?\n\n3.  What are the factors that influenced rapid socio economic transformation of Nigeria?\n\n1.5   HYPOTHESIS\n\nHO: Information gathering cannot be used as a tool for rapid socio economic transformation of Nigeria.\n\nHA: Information gathering can be used as a tool for rapid socio economic transformation of Nigeria.\n\n1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the significance of this study:\n\n1.  The outcome of this study will be very useful to policy makers and government of Nigeria on how information gathering can be used as a tool for rapid socio economic transformation of Nigeria with a view of using this information to address the problems ravaging the country.\n\n2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.\n\n1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study on the role of information gathering in the rapid socio economic transformation of Nigeria will cover the approaches to information gathering and how it can be used as a tool for socio economic development and transformation of Nigeria.\n\nLIMITATION OF STUDY\n\n1.  Financial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).\n\n2.  Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work. This consequently will cut down on the time devoted for the research work.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAremu, I. (2003). Development and Political Stability in Kwanashie (ed.)

        "content": "PREDICTING STUDENTS ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE USING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY\n\nPredicting student academic performance has long been an important research topic. Among the issues of education system, questions concerning admissions into academic institutions (secondary and tertiary level) remain important (Ting, 2008). The main objective of the admission system is to determine the candidates who would likely perform well after being accepted into the school. The quality of admitted students has a great influence on the level of academic performance, research and training within the institution. The failure to perform an accurate admission decision may result in an unsuitable student being admitted to the program. Hence, admission officers want to know more about the academic potential of each student. Accurate predictions help admission officers to distinguish between suitable and unsuitable candidates for an academic program, and identify candidates who would likely do well in the school (Ayan and Garcia, 2013). The results obtained from the prediction of academic performance may be used for classifying students, which enables educational managers to offer them additional support, such as customized assistance and tutoring resources.\n\nThe results of this prediction can also be used by instructors to specify the most suitable teaching actions for each group of students, and provide them with further assistance tailored to their needs. In addition, the prediction results may help students develop a good understanding of how well or how poorly they would perform, and then develop a suitable learning strategy. Accurate prediction of student achievement is one way to enhance the quality of education and provide better educational services (Romero and Ventura, 2007). Different approaches have been applied to predicting student academic performance, including traditional mathematical models and modern data mining techniques. In these approaches, a set of mathematical formulas was used to describe the quantitative relationships between outputs and inputs (i.e., predictor variables). The prediction is accurate if the error between the predicted and actual values is within a small range.\n\nIn machine learning and cognitive science, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a family of statistical learning models inspired by biological neural networks (the central nervous systems of animals, in particular the brain) and are used to estimate or approximate functions that can depend on a large number of inputs and are generally unknown. Artificial neural networks are generally presented as systems of interconnected \"neurons\" which exchange messages between each other. The connections have numeric weights that can be tuned based on experience, making neural nets adaptive to inputs and capable of learning. For example, a neural network for handwriting recognition is defined by a set of input neurons which may be activated by the pixels of an input image. After being weighted and transformed by a function (determined by the network's designer), the activations of these neurons are then passed on to other neurons. This process is repeated until finally, an output neuron is activated. This determines which character was read.\n\nThe artificial neural network (ANN), a soft computing technique, has been successfully applied in different fields of science, such as pattern recognition, fault diagnosis, forecasting and prediction. However, as far as we are aware, not much research on predicting student academic performance takes advantage of artificial neural network. Kanakana and Olanrewaju (2001) utilized a multilayer perception neural network to predict student performance. They used the average point scores of grade 12 students as inputs and the first year college results as output. The research showed that an artificial neural network based model is able to predict student performance in the first semester with high accuracy. A multiple feed-forward neural network was proposed to predict the students’ final achievement and to classify them into two groups. In their work, a student achievement prediction method was applied to a 10-week course. The results showed that accurate prediction is possible at an early stage, and more specifically at the third week of the 10-week course.\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe observed poor academic performance of some Nigerian students (tertiary and secondary) in recent times has been partly traced to inadequacies of the National University Admission Examination System. It has become obvious that the present process is not adequate for selecting potentially good students. Hence there is the need to improve on the sophistication of the entire system in order to preserve the high integrity and quality. It should be noted that this feeling of uneasiness of stakeholders about the traditional admission system, which is not peculiar to Nigeria, has been an age long and global problem. Kenneth Mellamby (1956) observed that universities worldwide are not really satisfied by the methods used for selecting undergraduates. While admission processes in many developed countries has benefited from, and has been enhanced by, various advances in information science and technology, the Nigerian system has yet to take full advantage of these new tools and technology. Hence this study takes an scientific approach to tackling the problem of admissions by seeking ways to make the process more effective and efficient. Specifically the study seeks to explore the possibility of using an Artificial Neural Network model to predict the performance of a student before admitting the student.\n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the objectives of this study:\n\n1.  To examine the use of Artificial Neural Network in predicting students academic performance.\n\n2.  To examine the mode of operation of Artificial Neural Network.\n\n3.  To identify other approaches of predicting students academic performance.\n\n1.4   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study will educate on the design and implementation of Artificial Neural Network. It will also educate on how Artificial Neural Network can be used in predicting students academic performance.\n\nThis research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic\n\n1.6   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\n\nThis study will cover the mode of operation of Artificial Neural Network and how it can be used to predict student academic performance.\n\nLIMITATION OF STUDY\n\nFinancial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).\n\n Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work. This consequently will cut down on the time devoted for the research work.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAyan, M.N.R.; Garcia, M.T.C. 2013.

The term ICT refers to Information and communication technology which consist of   electronic technologies which facilitate access to information such as the Internet, wireless networks, and cellular phones (WEF, 2012). The effective adoptions of ICT enable the governments to propel rapid productivity gains through different economic sectors in the nation. The government now view Information and communication technologies as a strategy to enhance rapid national development through ICT-driven productivity gains (Masanet & Matthews, 2010).Consequently the coordinated effort of government is required in this direction to adopt and implement a more robust and integrated ICT platform for an effective system of service delivery. (IDB, 2009).  It is important to note that sirrea-lone requires an integrated ICT agenda to sustain its national developmental expectations (WEF, 2012). The benefit of ICT adoption permeates public sector workplace productivity (Masanet & Matthews, 2010).  Public sector workplace productivity therefore impacts on business efficiencies resulting in resource efficiency, enhanced customer interface and revenue collection, cost control mechanisms, energy savings, and reducing negative environmental effects through using ICT applications (Masanet & Matthews, 2010).Borisov and Barbulescu (2012) postulated the adoption of  the term electronic government which he stated consist of   ICT tools and systems which is       used to access and efficiently deliver public services to all stakeholders .  (Bannister & Wilson, 2011).The adoption of ICT has facilitated easy access and interaction between government and its citizens .Also the development of mobile technologies, new web browsers, social media applications and sites, has provided the government with new tools to enhance the needs of e-government, which facilitate the development of an efficient system to manage public services geared at improving public’s confidence in government services (Borisov & Barbulescu, 2012).\n\n1.2  Statement of the ProblemThe need for the adoption of ICT and the planned implementation of national ICT strategy as a significant component in the success of ICT efforts to foster rapid national development through greater productivity in revenue collection cannot be over emphasized. Borisov and Barbulescu (2012) postulated the adoption of  the term electronic government which he stated consist of   ICT tools and systems which is       used to access and efficiently deliver public services to all stakeholders .

        "content": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ONLINE VEHICLE REGISTRATION\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\nVehicle Registration in Nigeria began over 100 years ago and the records have been essentially manual which in turn has not help to raise the efficiency of general automotive services in recent years. Today, computer has been discovered as a very efficient instrument, which has played a very significant role in adequate management of information. Besides, it has played more roles in country. However, computerization has helped in many areas of life and due to vehicle owners, the thought of computerization of this operation becomes of great important in order to wipe out the manual data processing system from which many problem have originated. The problems, which have engulfed the objectives of motor vehicles registration, are extensively discussed in this project together with the new method that was innovated. This work is conducted towards the computerization of the various problems in processing data in order to identify the various problems that are been encountered in the registration of vehicles manually. This theory also compares the existing system with the new system, which is exact, and a faster way of processing data and the problem faced by customers when they are registering their vehicles. There are different programs that can be written to develop such programs, PASCAL, JAVA. VISUAL BASIC, and C++ etc. But I will be making use of PHP, Database (MySQL) they are both working with Apache server (Xamp). The Software design used Macromedia Dreamweaver, firework, flash, and switchmax. \n\nThe World is experiencing an information knowledge revolution that is fundamentally transforming the way in which human activities are carried out. Government’s worldwide are adopting e -government as a means of improving their services to businesses and citizens, promoting economic and social development, and enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of government operations.\n\nComputer plays vital role in the development of any company it also saves some of its complex problem that is been faced by man and processes voluminous data within a short period of time or at an incredible speed. Recent emphasis on information and data processing in most of our business has grown adversely as in the case of motor vehicle license and plate registration. In as much as motor vehicle registration has been in existent for ages now, the old system of registration has been in adoption which did not play a significant role on highway safety until the development of the new system of vehicle registration where a reflective sheeting which is more visible to read even in the dark. This new system of motor vehicle and plate number registration, which is the main focus of this project, came into existent on the 19th March 1997 and handled by the motor licensing officer. It was introduced to enforce strict compliance to traffic rules and regulation as well as providing a proper data as to the behavior of road users. The roles, which the introduction of computer system will play in this function, will about more efficiency, effectiveness and improve competence.\n\n1.1      BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nVehicle Registration in Nigeria began over 100 years ago and the records have been essentially manual which in turn has not help to raise the efficiency of general automotive services in recent years. Motor licensing office Abuja only focuses on vehicle registration and inspection, and not on other supporting services such as vehicle tracking, learner’s driving permission, and drivers’ license management, monitoring of drivers and vehicles operations and documentation of both accident and crime report.\n\nVehicle registration in the city, state, and district offices burdened applicants by requiring them to personally deliver the certified copy of resident’s registration and other documents.\n\nVehicle Registration used to involve manual recording of vehicle’s information which ranges from cars to buses and later to trucks and heavy duty equipment on ledgers and tracking other related information such as registration, road worthiness test certificates, change of ownership, engine and chassis numbers; and expiration of road license. This process has been extremely inefficient and the recovery of the information was not possible once ledgers were damaged or lost as it frequently occurs.\n\n1.2      STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM \n\nThese are the problems that are being encountered in the manual system of assigning a plate number to newly acquired vehicle in the department of vehicle licensing and registration, (Licensing office Abuja). The limited factors listed below have slowed realization of the good intention: \n\n(i)                Participation of Unauthorized Officers: Unauthorized offices according to my observation are involved in this work especially in the registration of illegal vehicles which can encourage fraud.\n\n(ii)              Wrong Charging of Fees: The officer in-charge is bound to charge a wrong bill to vehicle owners, which may be as a result of underassessment or over assessment of vehicles. This could be with motive to commit fraud or as a result of mistake on the part of the officer at work.\n\n(iii)            Wrong Sales Allocation: Staff under a particular state motor vehicle licensing office indulges in registering of vehicles that does not belong to their state.\n\n(iv)            Improper Accounting: There is the tendency of the cashier involved in the handling of income generated to make mistake during this process, thus having some measures of inaccuracy in the work.\n\n(v)              There is difficulty at times in tracing a record/information cautioning a vehicle owner due to improper information keeping as a result of carelessness or volume in the size of record kept.\n\n(vi)            Mental/Manual Labor: This involves the use of strength and Brain and the body. The officer in-charge goes through mental labor because he has to sort the records of the entire vehicle in his domain of jurisdiction.\n\nHe suffers from Manual labor because he has to write all the way.\n\n(vii)          Excess Time Consumption: There is excessive time consumption because the motor licensing officer has to write and enter the information of the vehicle after the person whose vehicle is to be registered has paid a prescribed amount of money to the licensing authority accompanied with duly completed application, depending on the type of vehicle, write personal information about the person whose vehicle is to be registered and the category of vehicle whether commercial, privates, special purpose and so on, then your plate\n\nnumber and vehicle license is prepared after a given period of time.\n\nWhen put together, the time spent on all of these is much.\n\n1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nAs we have seen from the statement of the problems, the things that stand’s as puzzle in the manual system of motor vehicle registration aims at introducing a better system which is the computerized system which will contribute in providing solution to the problems.\n\ni.                    To reduce the amount of time spent in registration of motor vehicle and information for all the vehicle owners.\n\nii.                  To ensure a very high level of accuracy during registration of certain vehicle or category of vehicles that are prone to errors in the manual system. iii.      To develop a system that will allow for the generation and assignment of an infinite identification mark or number (that is, the vehicle plate number). iv.         To replace the manual system of registration with a computerized system that will make registration simple and easy for registration officer and vehicle owner.\n\nv.                 To provide restriction of illegal access of this program will be limited therefore password will be created for the application software. This password will just be limited to the officer in charge of the work.\n\nvi.               This also aims at giving an up-to-date report of the revenue generates from vehicle registration within a defined period.\n\n1.4 SCOPE OF STUDY\n\nThe application of this study is a must for any country that wants to be Information and Communication Technology inclined and ready to reduce the vehicle crime rate and corruption in her system. The scope of this study should be for Liaison Offices and organizations like (Motor licensing office Abuja) that issue vehicle licenses and other vehicle registration documents. \n\n1.5 LIMITATONS OF THE   STUDY\n\nIn as much as I have so many areas where one could have covered for a wider generalization of result. Some factors have posed as an obstacle to this, and some of these constraints are as follows:\n\ni.                   Finance: This contributed in my project research since there was much money exhausted in moving to and fro to gather facts for this work.\n\nii.                 Time: As students where probably involved in schoolwork like writing of assignment quizzes and other engagement, thus there isn’t enough time to attend classes.\n\n1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nDue to the constant rise in technology, it is necessary to use computer to\n\nProcess voluminous data within a short period of time or at an incredible speed. This project is to help provide efficiency, effectiveness and improve competence issuance of vehicle license, plate number and other related activities. The importance of this study includes:\n\ni.                 To expedite the efficiency of principal licensing officer in the processing of vehicle registration documents.",

This is currently made possible by the introduction of the digital computers which has been observed in the field of communication to be increasingly inseparable from communications.  These linkages often referred to as convergence is driven by technology and amplified by business trends.  Faster growth in network systems that use communication links to connect subsidiary system (nodes) which may send and receives, direct and redirect information.\n\n Talking of the internet a couple of years ago would have sound like a fairytale but today the internet is pervasive in almost every field of human Endeavour changing the fundamentals of how we conduct national as well as international businesses.  Few years of its existence, the internet has shown that it can deliver the long sought after goal of electronic commerce.\n\n It is worth that companies in the developed countries world-wide have recognized the business potential of the internet and are getting connected to the network of networks in their millions.\n\n The financial institution (Bank) is one of such organizations. Banking constitutes one of the most prominent life wire for Socio-Economic grow and development in any given nation, it supports and assists in the supply of long and short term loan, accepts both current sowing and fixed deposits, both foreign transactions, advice and facilitates transactions between client, workers, agents, firm, buyers and seller by providing payment services, not excluding the issue of undertaking risk on behalf of their clients, only to mention but a few.\n\n The internet having found its application and acceptance in the banking procession has particularly put the banking industry on an accelerating pace of development.  The technological highway (the internet) has become an enabler for Banks in achieving high level productivity and in handling volumes of transaction which would have been impossible without the use of on-line banking (E-commerce).\n\n The technology facilitates linkages with clients both through the provision of information and quality service delivery, as well as in reducing barriers to entry into payment systems retail banking.  Internet banking allows clients to engage in informal transaction relationship which would have taken long distance travels or movement of documents with the attendant risk of loss.  With the online banking (internet) you can at your convenience, at home and at any time review account balances and transactions, transfer funds, receive and pay bills, down-load transaction services and contact customer services just to mention but a few.\n\n An over view of the benefits and prospects of the on-line banking suggest that for banks to be relevant to their customers in term of the services they provide in the twenty-first century and in the future, must append this services provided by E-commerce in the banking system in order to stay in competition.  Now the on-line banking is the one thing bank should get up and invest in internet technology to reap bounteously the benefit accruing from internet banking.\n\nWhile Internet continues growing and gaining popularity among crowd, mobility represents new challenges to web designers. Wireless access is a new challenging mission in the current Internet era, with different demand for information by using less efficient terminals and networks. What really motivated our choice of topic was the fact that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is not yet fully applied in May fresh Bank and in our economy as a whole. We felt that May fresh Bank Caritas University Branch should also exploit the use and application of this wireless system in order to enhance their operations effectively and efficiently.\n\n1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nIn banking industries today, queuing has become the order of the day, customers‟ line up for hours waiting to withdraw or deposit money. This creates a lot of problem to both customers as they waste their useful time in the banking hall. The management also wastes their time as they run around to find solution to those problems. Also it is observed that customers cannot withdraw money any time they want as banks has their working hours. This is a big problem as needs can arise at any time and human beings will always like to have those needs solved. Also money deposited into accounts at times takes some hours to reflect in the persons account balance hence making banking operations slow and unhealthy for business growth. \n\nInformation and Communication Technology is still underutilized in May fresh Bank Caritas University Branch and in our society as a whole. May fresh Bank Caritas University Branch lacks effective ICT capacity for dynamic wireless operations. On analyzing the existing system of branch, the following problems were identified:\n\na.       May fresh Bank Caritas University Branch lacks the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) capability to wirelessly operate and interact with their database in order to:\n\n•              Verify whether an account is credited or debited, wirelessly using GSM handset or internet.\n\n•              To verify the status of a Customer‟s transactions.\n\nb.                 May fresh Bank, can verify the validity of their customers only through one source in a whole Branch through on central database online.  \n\nc.                  Presently, customers cannot access their May fresh Bank account Information online or with their GSM handsets, either to check or verify the status of a transaction without much official steps.\n\nMay fresh Bank cannot automatically contact their customer whose account number has been credited or debited as a result of lack of automated system.\n\n1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT\n\n•      To improve in the speed, effectiveness, efficiency and convenience in business transaction.\n\n•      To design and implement a computer software to solve this problem and rendering the services.\n\n•      To design a friendly web-site that graphically advertises goods and services provided by the institute on web pages.\n\n•      To provide an On-line banking database for May fresh Bank using MySQL database.\n\n•      To interface the client and server side in a cost effective and efficient manner.\n\n•      To generally enhance the operational capacity of May fresh Bank via ICT.\n\n•      To design an interface that could be used to input transactions details for customer, and the bank staff information, able to store them in the database for further use and investigations of any bank transactions.\n\n1.4 SCOPE OF THE PROJECT\n\nThis project will provide an online banking database using MySQL database for May fresh Bank that can be accessed wirelessly from any branch area at any time. It features both GSM based wireless database access and Internet based wireless access for WAP enabled cell phones. Other features include ability to receive feedback wirelessly from any stakeholder and also the ability to provide answers wirelessly to frequently asked questions and other enquiries. It is hoped that its wireless database access feature would greatly enhance the operational capacity of May fresh Bank in a cost effective manner.\n\n1.5 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\n Hard time is not a new phenomenon to an ordinary Nigerian but to the student researcher, it is even worse.  Time and finance posed a lot of constraints to the work.\n\n Consequently, difficulties were encountered during the collection of primary data.  Most of the administrators, system engineers and clerks visited reluctantly refused interview for one reason or the other and being referred to, the organization from one personnel to the other not excluding even security men.\n\nBooks related to this topic are relatively scarce and could only be gotten from the internet, which took a lot of time and money.\n\nHowever, with persistence and perseverance reasonable facts were finally obtained.\n\n1.6 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE USED\n\nProgramming language used are HTML, JAVA script, PHP.

Issues of theft and illegal connection pose major challenges in the energy distribution. This has greatly worsened the current electricity supply in the country; hence, the need for the design of a robust system for identifying or detecting illegal electricity consumption.\n\nIn this study, an Automated Remote Power Management System (ARPMS) was developed for detection of meter bypassing, tampering and illegal load shedding. ARPMS consisted of embedded microcontroller, Current and Voltage Sensors (CVS), and Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) module for effective detection of meter tempering. The microcontroller was embedded with microprograms for task regulation and control functions. The CVSs were used to monitor and report deviations from the normal signals. The GSM module was used for remote communication and control. The microcontroller was programmed using embedded C. A user-study experiment, which involved fifty (50) purposively selected electrical engineers, was carried out to evaluate the proposed system. The engineers subjected the system to different scenarios of bypass. A structured questionnaire guide was used to capture responses from the engineers. Descriptive analysis was conducted on the performance data of the ARPMS from the engineers.\n\nThe result showed that ARPMS had 100% efficiency, 96% acceptance and a remote communication index of 0.99. This showed that ARPMS had high capability for detecting meter tempering. The result also showed that the real time ARPMS was able to evaluate the amount of consumed energy by a building through remote monitoring and control of domestic energy meter, and gave the information about the meter reading to the utility company through Short Message Services (SMS). ARPMS provided regular status of the meter on a predefined interval, and displayed user’s account update in real time. This system also detected electricity power bypass by consumers. The ARPMS controlled technology demonstrated the capability of providing a better mechanism for collecting power consumption bills in advance.\n\nIn conclusion, an efficient ARPMS for preventing power theft has been developed. It also used GSM based technology to perform billing related processes at all times. The system is therefore recommended for electricity Distribution Companies (DISCOs) for efficient management of energy consumption and prepaid billing.\n\nKeywords:      Automated Remote, Monitoring, Microcontroller, GSM Communication, Embedded C\n\nWord Count: 376",
