[{"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Mental health is a health issue that is in circulation, specifically among Nigerian youths. The information on the abnormal behavior has been given as one of the biggest issues facing every country, of which Nigeria and the young people are not an exception of both the challenges and the risks. It has been reported that the issue of mental health are now common in youths, with an estimate of one in five facing some form of emotional disorder. Previous research works showed that 50% of all lifelong mental health problems start from the age 14 and 75% by age 24. Irrespective of the development evidence of the need of mental health to make sure economic, social and human capital, negative perceptions proceed to be linked with mental health disorders and the related mental health services and professionals. In our society, we see the mentally disordered people as the people that cannot be employed by any organization, as people who cannot maintain any job, depend on themselves and as those who have no hope of survival. This is a misconception, and it can have influence on individuals living with the disorders which can result in poor follow-up care and recovery, and further worsens the stigma and discrimination. It has been proven that medical forecast of doctor’s judgment for mental health disorders can enhance through early detection and treatment. Resolving the problem of discrimination and stigma needs to occur both formally and informally, especially among children and young adults, some of whom will one day require making use of such services. Okeke opined that orienting or informing young people in and out of secondary schools about mental health disorders and ways to prevent it, not only affects their understanding of mental health but that their family, friends and neighbors. Furthermore, schemes introduced for the purpose of increasing young people’s knowledge of mental health through contact and education have given positive outcomes in minimizing negative attitudes towards people with such challenges. Previous studies showed that unfair feelings about mental health disorders or its victims was majorly because of ignorance, and that people who are well informed about such disorders are less likely to endorse negative attitude. Another study also showed that members of the public who have contact with a victim of mental disorder are less likely to endorse stigmatizing attitudes. For this reason, education is a powerful tool for growing and solidifying knowledge and minimizing unwanted or displeasing attitudes towards mental health disorders and the victims. Research on youth perceptions of mental health disorders show positive changes after exposure to educational programs. Studies on awareness and education about mental health disorders in teenagers showed that there is a significant reduction of stigma after gaining new information about such conditions. Another study on changing attitude of high school students towards peer with mental health disorders showed positive changes in their attitudes, and also that discrimination and the tendency towards social restriction were minimized six months after an attitudinal change program was introduced. Also, short educational workshops gave rise to a positive change in youths perceptions of mental health disorders. For this reason, there is an inadequacy of research in some regions of Nigeria considering creating awareness and attitudes of youths towards mental health disorders. This study aims to find out the impact mental health challenge has on youth development in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE GENERAL PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The poor development of the Nigerian youth physically, educationally, socially and mentally has been a source of concern for the nation considering the fact that these youths are the leaders of tomorrow. The mental state of most youths has precipitated to poor educational development and has also been muted to be the fundamental challenge to youth development and advancement in all areas of life. The major implication of the problem on the Nigerian youth is propensity of making disastrous decisions as a result of poor mental health which would naturally making counseling efforts by guardian and teachers futile.</p> <p><strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The major objectives of the study are to examine mental health as a challenge to youth development and its implications on counseling. Other specific objectives of the study include;</p> <ol><li>To examine the state of mental health of youths.</li> <li>To determine the importance of youth development on nation building.</li> <li>To assess the benefit of counseling to youth development.</li> <li>To examine the factors affecting mental health of youths in Nigeria.</li> <li>To determine the impact of mental health on youth development and counseling.</li> </ol> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <ol><li>What is the state of mental health of youths?</li> <li>What is the importance of youth development on nation building?</li> <li>What are the benefits of counseling to youth development?</li> <li>What are the factors affecting mental health of youths in Nigeria?</li> <li>What is the impact of mental health on youth development and counseling?</li> </ol> <p><strong>RESERCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>H0: Mental health does not have a significant impact on youth development and counseling.</p> <p>H1: Mental health has a significant impact on youth development and counseling.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study would be of immense benefit to educational sector, the Nigerian public and the general public as it attempts to unravel the impact of mental health on youth development and counseling. The study would also benefit students, researchers and scholars who are interested in developing further study on the subject matter.</p> <p><strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is restricted to mental health as a challenge to youth development and its implication on counseling using ….. as a case study.</p> <p><strong>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>Financial constraint</strong>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).</p> <p><strong>Time constraint</strong>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work. This consequently will cut down on the time devoted for the research work.</p>\n\nA PHENOMENON ON MENTAL HEALTH AS A CHALLENGE TO YOUTH DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA AND IT'S COUNSELLING IMPLICATIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A PHENOMENON ON MENTAL HEALTH AS A CHALLENGE TO YOUTH DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA AND IT'S COUNSELLING IMPLICATIONS", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The field of school based guidance and counseling programs have been designed to help students gain career awareness within the educational system. Over the years the field has been confronted with great challenges that make it more difficult to provide students with strong career guidance.  Guidance professional in many public schools are often assigned large work loads. The average US studentscounselor ratio is 479 to 1and it grows to more than 1000 to 1 in some schools (American school counselor association, 2010). This contrasts greatly with what is necessary to ensure adequate students services. The American school counselor association recommends a student counselor ratio of 250 to 1. In order to implement comprehensive developmental school counseling program designed to meet the needs of all students. (American School Counseling Association, 2010).</p> <p>Further complicating these high ratios, guidance professionals are at times redirected to assignments that do not match or need their professional counseling skills. Responsibilities may include such diverse activities as conducting testing programs, registering students for courses, filling out college application, handling disciplinary issues and monitoring student’s records. Some of these activities such as coordinating and administering cognitive, aptitude and achievement tests have been declared inappropriate by the American School Counselor Association, while others merely stretch the limit of any individual professional, leaving less time to focus on direct student services such as career guidance. A survey of high schools counselor in Florida found that more than 30% reported that “actual career counseling” occupied very little of their time (Osborn, Debra and Baggerly, 2004)</p> <p>There is also a dichotomy between what counselor need to know about helping students make good educational and career decision and what counselors learn in their counselor preparatory programs. Many counselor preparatory programs focus predominantly on mental health models rather than academic and career development models (Martin 2002). Thus some guidance professionals lack current and accurate knowledge concerning career guidance and emerging career opportunities and may have outdated perceptions about post secondary options that impact the information they share with students (Mitkos, et. al. 2008).</p> <p>The term “school counseling” broadly refers to the process of meeting the needs of students in several areas of development, such as academic career and personal. Experts agree that professional school counseling program should be “comprehensive in scope, preventive in design and developmental in nature”.</p> <p>The term “Guidance” refers to a more specific trajectory within the field of counseling a pathway to helping students choose a vocational or career path “guidance is the processes of helping people make important choices that affect their lives such as choosing a preferred life style.” One distinction between guidance and counseling is that while guidance focuses on helping individual choose what they value most, counseling focuses on helping them make changes</p> <p>Several changes have taken place in the evolution of counseling and guidance program in schools around the world. Counseling and guidance appeared to have moved from a single vocational counselor in schools to an organized program that focuses on;</p> <ol><li>content (core competencies that all students can acquire)</li> <li>Organizational framework (structural component and program component) and resources (human and political). Gysbers and Henderson, 2000.</li> </ol> <p>As such Counseling and guidance experts are increasingly emphasizing the need for program planning and evaluation and improving effectiveness of programs and accountability of counselors.</p> <p> In establishing carefully planned counseling and guidance programs in post primary education, the idea of gender responsiveness is critical.</p> <p>The term “gender responsiveness” refers to the practice of active and engaged strategies and responses to issues relating to gender in educational planning and policies. Gender responsive programming promotes greater equity by;</p> <ol><li>Ensuring that the overall need and interest of both boys and girls in post primary schools are met.</li> <li>Effectively incorporating life skills-based strategies for preparing the nest generations to make life career decisions.</li> <li>Ensuring access to programs for upper level education /college/university readiness.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Lack of preparation to navigate the changing workplace can be tied specifically to a lack of career knowledge and awareness. More than half of high school students say no one in their school has been helpful in advising on career options or option to further their education. (Hurley et.al, 2002). Without structured guidance activities, young people tend to drift through their high school education without gaining knowledge of all the career opportunities available to them or the skills that are required. Some will become discouraged and drop out of high school; others may miss the connections between high school, post-secondary education and the workplace and make career decision based on inaccurate or incomplete information.</p> <p>In a survey carried out by the state of our nation’s youth, the top career choices among students in an open ended question were doctor or surgeon (10%), teacher of professor (8%), engineer (6%), nurse/medical assistant (6%), arts or entertainment (5%), lawyer or attorney (5%). (Horatio Agler Association of Distinguished American, Inc 2008-2009}. Most of these choices require a number of years of post secondary education. Yet only 70% of students graduate from school on time and only 34% graduate ready for college. (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2000). This disconnects between aspiration and educational performance set students up for personal or financial disappointment as they are faced with the realities of the job market.</p> <p>Many other students enter college without a clear career goal. resulting in indecision and the costly prospect of excessive time spent in post- high school institution as they drift from one program to another or pursue courses of study that do not align with employer need. Students over the age of 25 are now one of the fastest growing populations in community colleges. (Gateway Community College, 2006). They often enroll to get additional skills to be competitive in the workplace. Many of these students have already completed some college or even a 4-year degree, but have found it inadequate or inappropriate for the career opportunities that are available to them. Engaging in post secondary education without a clear purpose does not use public or private resources as effectively as possible and these students would have greatly benefited from stronger career guidance early in their educational experience.</p> <p><strong>1.3   PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study among other things is to find out;</p> <ol><li>How students view the role of counselors in secondary schools.</li> <li>If students sex and age has effect on their perception of the role of counselors in the choice of a career.</li> <li>The role of counselors towards students’ choice of career in secondary schools in esan west local government area of Edo state.</li> <li>The perception of students on the need for counselors in their choice if career in secondary schools.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>This research will attempt to answer the following questions:</p> <ol><li>What are students’ perceptions of counselor’s role in secondary schools in Esan west local government area of Edo state?</li> <li>Does the student’s age have effect on their perception of the need for counselors in secondary schools?</li> <li>Does the students’ sex have effect on their perception of the need for counselors in secondary schools?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The findings of this research will reveal to students, teachers administrators, parents, government and employer of labour the importance of school counselors in secondary schools as regards students choice of career. Students would benefit by understanding how important and indispensable the counselor is in their choice of a career.</p> <p>It will make parents and teachers understand the essence of early grooming of their children and ward regarding career choices and the role of the counselor towards achieving success and satisfaction for their children/students professionally.</p> <p>The administrator would be able to provide materials that would facilitate positive counselor/student relationship in order to be more productive.</p> <p>Government and employer of labour on their part will enjoy a better well prepared and packaged work force with necessary orientation and experience that will help in nation building and greater efficiency.</p> <p><strong>1.6   SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study covered secondary school students that reside in Esan West Local Government Area of Edo State. Five secondary schools were randomly selected with from the 17 secondary schools in the area. This research looked at Students perception of the role of the school counselor in the choice of career and how they can be improved. The effect of counselor’s advice on the choice and decisions of students in the area will be taken into account during the course of this research.</p> <p><strong>1.7   LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>A study of this nature would not be complete without discussing some of the problems encountered by the researcher. The various problems that limit the outcome of this research work are therefore discussed below;</p> <p>This research depends mainly on the responds of the students and teacher/counselors. The time set aside for this study was too short; as a result, the researcher had no opportunity to make all intensive and extensive study on the topic.</p> <p>Again there was period of long holiday for teachers and students in the local government area used as a case study of this research work.</p> <p>Finally teachers, students and counselors could not return all the questionnaires distributed to the researcher. And this would only make him to only work with the ones that got to him.</p>\n\nSTUDENT'S PERCEPTION OF THE ROLE OF SCHOOL COUNSELLORS IN THE CHOICE OF A CAREER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STUDENT'S PERCEPTION OF THE ROLE OF SCHOOL COUNSELLORS IN THE CHOICE OF A CAREER", "id": 2}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This research is carried out to critically review the causes of drug abuse among secondary school students in Oredo Local Government Area, Benin City as a case study.

A sample of 49 children was selected for the study. These children were basic six pupils and the scores for the pupils for three years were used. A simple questionnaire was designed to elicit this information. Five hypotheses were raised to guide the study and hypotheses were tested using analyses of variance CANOVA) and regression technique at 0.05 level of significance.</p> <p>The study showed that children educational development have high correlation with the working status of the mother and the children moral development does not have any relationship with working status of the mother. <strong>In </strong>addition, works of mothers do not have any impact on whether the children are male or female and works of mothers do not have impact on children involving in extra curricular activities. Lastly, works of mothers have long run effect on children performance in examination.</p> <p>The study therefore recommends working mothers should be given some consideration in places of work to have time in attending to their children school and also, government should establish a policy that will allow mothers who are rearing children to leave office early during their children daycare period for proper upbringing.   </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The need to make all children have access to quality education has made the Federal Government to re-introduce the universal basic education which provides free and compulsory education for all children to Nigeria from basis one to basic mine. This need has made the various tiers of governments to come out with series of incentives, which would encourage children enrolment in schools (Fagbemi, 2006). The effort of the Federal Government has not yielded any positive results, owing to the fact that the standard of education in Nigeria has been falling rapidly over the years in terms of achievement in writing and oral examinations.</p> <p>The Nigerian students perform poorly in public examinations such as National Examination Council(NECO), West Africa Examination Council (WAEC,)Joint Admission And Matriculation Board(JAMB) and National Business and Technical Council (NABTEC), and the rate of participation of students in examination malpractices has reached an alarming rate. The scenario that has been painted is that Nigerian students are having interest in malpractices than being studious. This development in the educational system has become an issue in which the stakeholders are searching for what might have been responsible for this. The parents have been seen as one of the main reasons for the lost of virtue in the Nigerian educational system.</p> <p>The high cost of living has led many women to leave their traditional duties of child upbringing to seek for paid employment. In the traditional African settings, women stay at home and nurture the children (Parker, 2010). Through them, the children learn at first contract the norms and obligations of the society. At this period, the children grow up to be morally competent and hardworking. Today, the need to provide for the well-being of the family as well as for their children has thrown many women into the labour market. Equal access to education has made women to reach highs level in educational and career pursuit. Women are lawyers, accountants, engineers, architects, medical doctors, pilots and so on.</p> <p>Many of these employments do not give them time to carryout their traditional roles as women in the homes. Thus, they are to depend on the service of the third-party for the well-being of their children. What happen to the children of these working women? Are they able to reach the expected limit in their educational development? Is it possible for working women to have competent children in academics? It is on this note that this study wants to examine the impact of working mothers on their children educational development.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Many have believed that working mothers exert negative influence on their children educational development. Children of women who work are believed to be slow in learning at their early years of growth. These children do not have the privilege to have motherly care and they have less support from their mothers' in terms of being assisted with their home works. Being at home, they are left unsupervised and they are released into the hands of the mass media that do not have positive norms to show to these children.</p> <p>These children have no help when they need their help of a trustworthy and reliable person who is nothing but their parents. Thus, they engage in every form of social vices because these are what they have learnt from mass media that have become their \"foster parents.\" They smoke, fight, commit sexual immorality, and cheat in examination and many of them are dying of drug, cigarette, sexual abuse, homosexual, drinks, cultism, and street fighting to examine the impact of working mothers on their children educational development.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objectives of this study is to examine the impact of working mothers on the educational development of the children. Specifically, the Sub-objectives of the study include:</p> <p>     i.        To determine the effect of working mothers on children educational attainment</p> <p>   ii.        To identify to extent at which mothers' work affect their children moral development</p> <p>  iii.        To identify whether there is difference in working mothers' impact based on the sex of the children</p> <p>  iv.        To examine whether mothers' frequent visits to their children's school have effect on the children educational attainment</p> <p>    v.        To examine whether the children of working mothers involve actively in school activities.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>OI</strong>:   Working mothers do not have any significant impact on their children's educational attainment</p> <p><strong>Ho2</strong>:   Working mothers do not have any significant impact on their children's moral development</p> <p><strong>H0</strong><strong>3</strong>: There is no significant difference between working mothers' effect on their children education and the sex of their children</p> <p><strong>H0</strong><strong>4</strong>: Working mothers frequent visit to their children's schools do not have any impact on their children educational development</p> <p><strong>H0</strong><strong>5</strong>: Children of working mothers will be actively involved school extra curriculum activities</p> <p><strong>H0</strong><strong>6</strong>: Children whose mothers are working and highly educated do not do well in their studies like these whose mothers are less educated and are working.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The rate of low academic achievement and lack of moral among the school children in Nigeria are calling for concerted effort to examine the impact of working mothers on their children. These problems have attracted the concerns of the stakeholders in education, family and society. Therefore, this study will provide some insights to all stakeholders in education, family and society by bringing to limelight some basis but unclarified issue regarding the working mothers and their children educational development to that extent, it may hopefully serve as a basis for government in among out with good policy on women who are working and rearing children.  </p> <p><strong>1.6   Delimitation of Study</strong></p> <p>This study is delimited to the working mothers  who resides within the Alimosho local government area of Lagos State. This will include various categories of working mothers. Alimosho local government  is one of the 20 local government area of Lagos state as recognized by the Federal Government of Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.7  Limitation of the  Study</strong></p> <p>The limitation of  study were as  a  result  of reluctant on the side of the respondents to fill the questionnaire, ignorant of some the respondents.

Mental disorders, including depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse—including alcoholism and the use of benzodiazepines—are risk factors. Some suicides are impulsive acts due to stress, such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at a higher risk for future attempts. Close to 800 000 people die due to suicide every year, which is one person every 40 seconds. Suicide is a global phenomenon and occurs throughout the lifespan. Effective and evidence-based interventions can be implemented at population, sub-population and individual levels to prevent suicide and suicide attempts. There are indications that for each adult who died by suicide there may have been more than 20 others attempting suicide. Suicide occurs throughout the lifespan and is the second leading cause of death among 15-29 year old globally.</p> <p>According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), while the link between suicide and mental disorders (in particular, depression and alcohol use disorders) is well established in high-income countries, many suicides happen impulsively in moments of crisis with a breakdown in the ability to deal with life stresses, such as financial problems, relationship break-up or chronic pain and illness. In addition, experiencing conflict, disaster, violence, abuse, or loss and a sense of isolation are strongly associated with suicidal behaviour. Suicide rates are also high amongst vulnerable groups who experience discrimination, such as refugees and migrants; indigenous peoples; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex (LGBTI) persons; and prisoners. By far the strongest risk factor for suicide is a previous suicide attempt. It is estimated that around 20 per cent of global suicides are due to pesticide self-poisoning, most of which occur in rural agricultural areas in low- and middle-income countries. Other common methods of suicide are hanging and firearms. However, In any learning institution, counselors form an essential part of the organization since they serve as key persons to whom students can turn to for help on matters related to general challenges facing a teenager both in school and out of school. With the too academic oriented education system characterized with exam cheating and results irregularities, students are likely to find themselves faced with difficult decisions to make concerning career choices. Pressure from parents, lack of proper guidance and scarcity of jobs in preferred sectors can be quite overwhelming for a child unless guided appropriately. Apart from career choice, the students are also faced with other adolescent challenges such as relationships, rapid growth and physical changes, peer pressure, addiction to drugs and alcohol, and the need for identity or to “belong”. therefore, the guidance and counselling role can be useful in ameliorating the increase of suicide in our tertiary institutions.</p> <p>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>The year 2019 has recorded a significant number of death through suicidal actions. The trend is one that cannot be quickly disputed as it is ongoing. The demeaning aspect of suicide attempt in the contemporary Nigeria is that it is carried out by youths. The youths are supposed to be the least affected by suicide but reverse is the case. In the tertiary institutions, the rate of suicide actions is on the increase as records show that nothing has been done to curb this action. Suicide is associated with a lot of negativity as it traditionally depicts a bad omen and signifies weakness on the part of the victim. The continuous increase of suicide by young people has propelled this study to be considered as it examines the role of guidance and counseling in curbing suicide.</p> <p>1. 3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The primary aim of this study is to examine the role of guidance and counseling in obviating suicide in the Nigeria Tertiary institutions. Specifically the study will focus on:</p> <p>1. To determine the cause of suicide in Tertiary institutions.</p> <p>2. To determine the role of guidance and counseling in obviating suicide in the Nigeria Tertiary institutions.</p> <p>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>The study seeks to provide answers to the following research questions:</p> <p>1. What are the causes of suicide in Nigeria Tertiary institutions?</p> <p>2. What is the role of guidance and counseling in obviating suicide in Nigeria Tertiary institutions?</p> <p>1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</p> <p>The study formulated and developed for testing the following Null hypotheses:</p> <p>H0: There are no identifiable causes of suicide in Nigeria Tertiary institutions.</p> <p>H0²: Guidance and Counseling do not play any significant role in obviating suicide in Nigeria Tertiary institutions.</p> <p>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Nigeria has witnessed an unusual phenomenon among young people especially young people in the tertiary institutions. This study is quite significant as it exposes in factual terms the causes of suicide among young people. The study will also assist guidance and counseling department in understanding what needs to be tackled as it provides insight the need to obviate suicide. The reverse is that this study brings to bare the role of guidance and counseling in obviating suicide,which implies that guidance and counseling can be relied upon to provide assistance to suicidal issues.</p> <p>1.7 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This study examines the current appalling trend of suicide in Nigeria, especially in the tertiary institutions. However the study is limited to only Nigeria institutions. The study sampled opinions from respondents across four states (Enugu, Lagos, Jos and Delta states).</p> <p>1.8 ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This research is organized into five distinct but related chapters, the first chapter gives an overview of the study as well as highlighting the problem and clearly the objectives. In the second chapter, we reviewed related and relevant literature. In the third chapter, we describe the method adopted and employed in the study. The fourth chapter presents and analyzes the data collected from the respondents, while the fifth chapter includes, summary, conclusion and recommendations</p>                                                          \n\nTHE ROLE OF GUIDANCE AND COUNSELLING IN OBVIATING SUICIDE IN NIGERIA TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF GUIDANCE AND COUNSELLING IN OBVIATING SUICIDE IN NIGERIA TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS", "id": 5}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE ROLE OF GUIDANCE AND COUNSELLING IN SUICIDE PREVENTION IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <ol><li><ol><li> <p><strong>background of the study</strong></p> </li> </ol></li></ol> <p>Suicide (Latin: Suicidium). It is the act of intentionally ending one's life. Suicide is a common phenomenon in the western world, but it is becoming a major public health problem, even in Nigeria. He is often engaged in despair. In the United States, about 80 suicides are committed per day, with more than 32,000 suicides per year and 1,500 unsuccessful suicide attempts per day. It is the fourth leading cause of death for people ages 18 to 65 in the United States. Suicide risk factors include, but are not limited to, family history of suicide, access to firearms, romantic breakdown, a history of negligence or abuse, and a history of intentional injury. A person can often manifest certain symptoms or behaviors before suicide occurs, regardless of age or origin, but some groups of people have a higher risk of suicide attempts. Suicides and suicide attempts often occur in people with mental disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder, depression and drug and alcohol abuse. Stressful life problems, such as financial difficulties or relationship problems, also play an important role in suicidal behavior. Suicide attempts are often motivated by the search for relief from guilt, shame, rejection, loneliness or loss. Suicide offers some people a way to escape misery in certain circumstances where life becomes unbearable. Some inmates of the infamous Nazi camps would have deliberately committed suicide by touching the electrified fences. In India, it was known that some indebted farmers had committed suicide to escape their unbearable debt.</p> <p>The role of guidance and counselling (G/C) services among youths cannot be overemphasized. G/C services have always played a leading role in terms of child‘s development and improvement. For this reason, G/C services are sine qua non to child‘s development. Okobiah and Okorodudu (2006) highlighted that Guidance and Counselling is encompassed by activities of relevant services and also processes of helping persons within and outside the school, to achieve their full potentialities in their emotional, moral, social, academic and vocational developments. Esen (1998) says that guidance and counselling is aimed primarily at assisting the receiver to discover his own hidden strengths and ultimately grow in independence and ability to take his own decisions, make choices or adjustments unaided. </p> <p><br/></p> <p><br/></p> <p>When all the above listed has been resolved, then G/C could effectively be utilized as coping strategy for inculcating the consciousness of peace, conflict resolution and national security among secondary school youths‘ in Anambra State. Thus, the present study tried to examine the relevance of utilizing effective G/C services as coping strategy for inculcating the consciousness of peace, conflict resolution and national security among secondary school youths‘ in Anambra State through effective utilization of guidance and</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>Statement of the problem </strong></p> <p>Recent events in Nigerian society regarding different cases of youth suicide have drawn the attention of government agencies, NGOs, international agencies and society in general to the sad truth that young people no longer receive all the information they need. Support they need emotionally. and especially psychologically.</p> <p>Because each individual is unique, there is no single reason for someone to have suicidal thoughts or attempt suicide. Factors that may contribute to having suicidal thoughts are:</p> <ul><li> <p>A major life transition that is very upsetting or disappointing</p> </li> <li> <p>A loss of an important relationship or the death of a loved one</p> </li> <li> <p>Depression, anxiety or other serious emotional troubles</p> </li> <li> <p>Feelings of hopelessness or despair</p> </li> <li> <p>Low self-esteem or shame</p> </li> <li> <p>Failure to live up to one's own or others' expectations</p> </li> <li> <p>Extreme loneliness</p> </li> <li> <p>News of a major medical illness</p> </li> <li> <p>Severe physical or emotional pain</p> </li> <li> <p>Alcohol or drug problems</p> </li> </ul> <p>Guidance and Counselling amongst youths today can aid in the prevention of suicide cases in Nigeria. It is believed that when we talk to people who are depressed and give them all the adequate support then these cases of suicide that is on the rise will gradually become a thing of the past.</p> <p>It is in the light of this that this study seeks to find out the role of guidance and counseling in suicide prevention in Nigeria. </p> <p><strong>Purpose of the study </strong></p> <p>The main purpose of this study was to examine the role of guidance and counseling in Nigeria. The specific objectives are to;</p> <ol><li> <p>Have a general overview on the role of guidance and counseling.</p> </li> <li> <p>Find out if guidance and counseling can help to prevent suicide in Nigeria.</p> </li> <li> <p>Identify challenges that deter the effectiveness of guidance and counseling services among youths in Nigeria.</p> </li> </ol> <p><strong>Significance of the study </strong></p> <p>Suicide is a serious issue that many people prefer not to discuss, but it is something that affects many people at some point in their life. Suicide can be a very difficult thing to understand. If someone you know may be suicidal, it’s important to recognize the signs beforehand so they can get the help and counseling they need. With proper education, everyone can be made more aware of the possible risks for suicide as well as the underlying causes. There are many different reasons someone may want to commit suicide, and in many cases, they can be saved if they get the help they need in time.</p> <p><strong>1.6   Scope and delimitation of the study</strong></p> <p>The scope of this study is focused on the role of guidance and counseling in suicide prevention in Nigeria.</p> <p>The researcher encountered some constraints, which limited the scope of the study. These constraints include but are not limited to the following.</p> <p><strong>a) AVAILABILITY OF RESEARCH MATERIAL:</strong> The research material available to the researcher is insufficient, thereby limiting the study </p> <p><strong>b) TIME:</strong> The time frame allocated to the study does not enhance wider coverage as the researcher has to combine other academic activities and examinations with the study.</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>The following terms were used in the course of this study:</p> <p><strong>Guidance and counseling: </strong>Guidance refers to an advice or a relevant piece of information provided by a superior, to resolve a problem or overcome from difficulty. Counseling refers to a professional advice given by a counselor to an individual to help him in overcoming from personal or psychological problems.</p> <p><strong>Suicide: </strong> the act or an instance of taking one's own life voluntarily and intentionally.</p> <p><strong>Youth: </strong>Youth is the time of life when one is young, and often means the time between childhood and adulthood (maturity). It is also defined as \"the appearance, freshness, vigor, spirit, etc., characteristic of one who is young.</p> <p><strong>1.8 ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work is organized in five chapters, for easy understanding, as follows Chapter one is concerned with the introduction, which consist of the (overview, of the study), historical background, statement of problem, objectives of the study, research hypotheses, significance of the study, scope and limitation of the study, definition of terms and historical background of the study. Chapter two highlights the theoretical framework on which the study is based, thus the review of related literature. Chapter three deals on the research design and methodology adopted in the study.

According to Weiler (1997) “Successful career seldom happen by chance” with very few exception, people who really get what they want in a career do so because they define their objective plans and schedules for achieving their objectives, and assume personal responsibility for implementing and following these plans.<br/>These people monitor their progress regularly, improve their plans when they are not getting the desired result and persevere in the face of frequent set back until objectives are achieved.<br/>Many scholars have given their own different meaning to choice and career and some have further stressed their importance and objectives of selecting a better career.<br/>The dictionary meaning of Career is a way of making a living profession amongst career of opportunities.<br/>Many find it difficult to make choice in the sense that they lack guidance and counseling, making their choice without the help of any person. Several works have been done based on the determinant factors affecting career by students. <br/>There are opinions expressed on this issue that are as varied as the factor which have been included in the first chapter. In the same view, there is no doubt however that there are many factors responsible for the progress of a child backwardness or retardation VIZ; genetic factors (that are inherent in the child himself) and environmental factor (from the environment where the child grew up).</p> <p><strong>2.2     NEED FOR PARENTS’ GUIDANCE </strong><br/>Michael (2001) stated that the home provides many things for the child, like protection, guidance, shelter and encouragement. Again the home tries by all means to educate the child with the outside world by interpreting what is happening to / around him. He went further to say that the child as he/she is not yet informed of the factors and realities of life but with the help of the parents he will be very much aware of the tracks or steps to follow if he is to be useful in life. <br/>He still maintains that the homes are marked by the persistent conflicts and divergent aims between the parents and the child who seldom gain a sense of family of unity and hence his personal security is much more precarious. This child feels poor about the background and fumbles.<br/>“The inability of some parents and guidance to provide good background and show interest in the education of their children has a vital role to play in the performance of some learners”<br/>Unless the necessary materials are provided for the learners, all efforts made towards his/her improvement will not work out effectively. The child without learning materials would certainly loose his sense of direction. The influence of parents has been one of the strongest and the most persistent factor that determine the child attitude towards studying different school subjects and hence his choice of career.</p>\n\nA SURVEY OF CAREER CHOICE DETERMINANTS AMONG SECONDARY SCHOOLS STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A SURVEY OF CAREER CHOICE DETERMINANTS AMONG SECONDARY SCHOOLS STUDENTS", "id": 7}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong> </p> <p>The issue of family planning all over the world has attracted attention due to it important in decision making about population growth and development issues. Uncontrolled birth is a major contributing factor of an increase in the world’s population, particularly in Nigeria. Statistics shows that the population of the world was about one billion in 1859 in 1930, the population had doubled (two billion) in 1976, the total population was said to be four billion. Today, it is more than six billion, with Nigeria having a population of over 162 million, thus being the largest country in Africa and the 7th in the world map (United States Census Buxau, 2010). Life is a precious gift that every individual hunger for and in an attempt to grab this gift, our health must be maintained. There are so many problems that have been found to result from poor family planning method. Some of these problems include: Over population, criminal abortion, child dumping, increased child morbidity and mortality, as well as increases material morbidity and mortality rates. Over population as one of the consequences of poor family planning has succeeded in causing a lot of harm to individuals, families, society and the nation at large. Maternal mortality and child mortality have been found to occur due to poor family planning practice, according to the statement of the WHO (World Health Organization) and United Nation Education, Scientific Children’s Organization (UNESCO) in 1991) that over three million children and two hundred thousand women die each year and also women’s health and action research (2004) had showed rates of child and maternal mortality and morbidity rate in the world due to poor altitude towards Ante-natal care in which family planning is one of the objectives. The President of Nigeria, his Excellency, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan was quoted in Vanguard newspaper on June 28, 2012saying “Nigeria families should have only the children they can afford. To ensure this order was followed , a new planned Parenthood Federation of Nigeria (PPFN) was created. He said it may be time for birth control legislation. Family planning, until recently, a very sensitive subject in Africa, is now very increasingly accepted as a necessary ingredient of socio-economic development. It is now thought to be an important health measure that contributes to the health of parents, children and the entire nation. Because of the great effect over population has on socio-economic status, education and health in general, a full understanding of this phenomenon and the major factors governing it are essential, thus the need to adopt family as a means of checking the escalating birthrate cannot be over emphasized. Unfortunately, this idea is not adequately emphasized on, especially in the rural areas, where it was observed that they g=have a high regard for large families and children are seen as a blessing from God. They believed that the more children a man has, the more hands to help with work especially on the farm. It is also believed that children give status to a women and security in old age. In Oghara-efe Community in Delta State, it was observed that husband often make sexual demands with little or no consideration for material health and the children’s survival. They compound their wives potential mortality rate by either not allowing her to seek family planning, advice or will not seek it as a collection responsibility. This present mentality in Oghara-efe community and its consequent socio-economic, educational and health effect on the villagers makes it important for this study to be carried out.</p>\n\nATTITUDE OF MEN TOWARDS FAMILY PLANNING AND IMPLICATION FOR THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN OGHARA-EFE COMMUNITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ATTITUDE OF MEN TOWARDS FAMILY PLANNING AND IMPLICATION FOR THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN OGHARA-EFE COMMUNITY", "id": 8}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  </p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The study was predicated on the need to provide empirical evidences to the influence of organizational climate and teacher’s job satisfaction on the teacher’s job performance in Imo state. This was as a result of the need to see how the organization climate and the satisfaction the teachers get from their job can influence their job performance. To guide the study five research questions were formulated and four null hypotheses  tested at 0.01 and 0.05 level of significance. The literature related to the study was also received on under the conception framework, theoretical frame work, empirical and summary of the literature review. The literature revealed that organizational climate and the teachers job satisfaction and its influences on the teacher’s job performance is a work that has not been given serious attention, hence it becomes necessary to fill this gap by carrying out a study on the influence of the school organizational climate and teacher’s job satisfaction on the teacher’s job performance. The study was carried out in Abia State. The study adopted the description research survey design. The sample of the study was 480 which comprised 30 principals and 450 teachers who were selected from 30 schools that make up the sampled schools. 1 principal each and 15 teachers each were selected from 30 school selected for the study. </p> <p>The instrument was validated by three exerts from the department of Educational Administration and Measurement and Evaluation. The reliability of the instrument was 0.83 which was obtained through the test-retest method and computed using the Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient (PPMCC) statistic. The Procedure for data collection was the distribution of 480 research questionnaires to the 480 respondents and also 450 teacher’s job performance check list was used to collect performance of the teachers from their principals. The mean and standard deviations were used to answer the research questions 1, 2, 4 and 5 while percentage and frequency was to analyze the</p> <p>research question The result of the analyzed data revealed that there was a positive correlation which was significant between the organizational climate and teacher’s job performance, and there was also a positive correlationship, which was significant between the organizational climate and the teacher’s job performances and there was also a positive correlationship, which was significant between the teacher’s job satisfaction and the teacher’s job performance. Similarly findings also revealed that organizational climate predicts the teacher’s job performance and also the teacher’s jobs satisfaction predicts the teacher’s job performance.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1 Background to the study</p> <p>1.2 Statement of the problem</p> <p>1.3 Research questions</p> <p>1.4     Hypothesis</p> <p>1.4 Purpose of the study</p> <p>1.5 Significance of the study</p> <p>1.6 Scope of the study</p> <p>1.7 Limitation of the study                                                                                                                                                                                                         </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO: REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE</strong></p> <p>2.1 Conceptual framework </p> <p>2.2 Theoretical framework </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>3.1 Research Design</p> <p>3.2 Population of the study</p> <p>3.3 Sample and sampling techniques</p> <p>3.4 Instrument for data collection</p> <p>3.5 Validity and reliability</p> <p>3.6 Administration of instrument</p> <p>3.7 Method of data analysis</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR:</strong> </p> <p>DATA ANALYSIS, INTERPRETATION AND DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FI VE:</strong> </p> <p>SUMMARY, CONCLUSION &amp; RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>5.1 Summary of findings</p> <p>5.2 Conclusion</p> <p>5.3 Recommendation</p> <p>5.5 Suggestions for further research</p> <p>5.6 Contribution to Knowledge</p> <p>References</p> <p>Questionnaires.</p>\n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF ORGANIZATIONAL CLIMATE AND TEACHERS JOB SATISFACTION ON THE TEACHERS JOB PERFORMANCE IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE INFLUENCE OF ORGANIZATIONAL CLIMATE AND TEACHERS JOB SATISFACTION ON THE TEACHERS JOB PERFORMANCE IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS", "id": 9}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0</strong>   <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Baldwin (1950) viewed teenage stage, as a period where reactivation of the `sexual drives that has been inactive during the latency period. He said teenagers are on the boundary between childhood and adulthood and they are faced with the choice of a whole way of life in terms of their job, their ethics and so forth. He further said that to find this in the face of many alternative roles, individuals must decide what they want to do and whether they are able to do it, they must take responsibility for decisions that may shape the rest of their life or destroy it. And to take this independent step, persons need a real sense of identity of their own worth as individuals and their esteem and he said our culture does not make it easy for our teenagers to take this step in life.</p> <p>Watson and Lindgren (1979) gave the definition of a teenager simply as the period or stage of development that separates childhood from adulthood. They said it is also difficult to indicate the limits of a teenager; at what point does it begins and what point does it end, they said the characteristics of a teenager first shows themselves about 10, 11, or 12 years of age with the subtle changes In behaviour and appearance, then it becomes most obvious at puberty with the start of the menstrual cycle in girls.</p> <p>Longman dictionary of contemporary English (1995) gave a definition of pregnancy as the period of time when a woman is pregnant while pregnant on the other hand having an unborn baby growing inside an individuals body. So therefore, teenage pregnancy is a period of time by which a girl is carrying or having an unborn baby growing inside her womb.</p> <p>World Health Organization (2004) opined that a teenager is a person between 15-19 years of age, they said it is a period where an individual is shaped and prepared for adulthood responsibilities they said also that there are advantages and disadvantages of teenage pregnancy or having a baby at ones teenage stage, they went ahead to say that when you are younger the benefits are usually associated with greater fertility a more healthy pregnancy and a quicker recovery after birth. But the down side is that your social life, education and training can be severely disrupted just when it might be taking off into an interesting direction. Moreso, they said some teenagers are much more capable of looking  after a child than the older women because late motherhood or late pregnancy has a greater risk of complications in the pregnancy and reduce fertility. Being older, they said can also be more exhausting looking after growing children.</p> <p>1.1   <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>This study was concerned with the advantages and disadvantages of teenage pregnancy in Kaura Local Government Area of Kaduna State. For clarity of purposes:-</p> <ul><li>Teenage girls do not have adequate knowledge of protecting themselves from unwanted pregnancy.</li> <li>Given them out in marriage early and then using the benefits they get from the girls husband to train their male children in school.</li> <li> Their male counterparts taken advantage of them by abusing them sexually.</li> <li>Leaving school because of unwanted pregnancy.</li> <li>Giving them out in marriage early to prevent them from prostituting.</li> <li>Getting pregnant even when their reproductive organs have not fully developed.</li> </ul> <p>1.2   <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Teenage pregnancy has continued to be a major concern not to Kaduna teenage girls only but also to Nigeria at large. This study may then serve as a pioneer efforts towards the understanding of teenage pregnancy to Kaura Local Government  Area. The result of the study may help policy makers particularly, educational planners in Kaduna State to design more appropriate instructional Programmes on teenage pregnancy.</p> <p>The result of the study may also help to highlight some of the diseases that are associated with teenage pregnancy like Vesico Virgina Fistular (VVF) and Rector Virgina fistular (RVF). The study may also provide the basis for further research on teenage pregnancy.</p> <p>1.3   <strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <ul><li>Teenage pregnancies occur as a result of relationship with older male counterparts.</li> <li>Free assess to pornographic films without the presence of adult guidance on sex education.</li> <li>Are there adequate knowledge and proper guidance on teenage pregnancy.</li> <li>Are there any benefits and dangers of teenage pregnancy to teenage girls and the society at large.</li> <li>Does cultural upbringing and religious inclination affect teenage pregnancy.</li> <li>Does teenage pregnancy affect young girls performance in school.</li> </ul> <p>1.4   <strong>DELIMITATION</strong></p> <p>At the time of the study there were a thousand staff working with Kaura local government area.

This stresses the fact that modern African children and youths need guidance and counseling. But to be effective, guidance practices must be based on philosophies that reflect African thinking (Esen, 1977). </p> <p>The National Policy on Education (NPE). In this document the need for the integration of the individual into a sound and effective citizens, and provision of equal educational opportunities for all citizens' of the nation at primary, secondary and tertiary levels of education, both inside, and outside the formal school system, are clearly stated Contained also in <em>The National Policy </em>on education is the change from 6-5-2-3 system of education to the new 6-3-3-4 system of education. This change was the aftermath of the Curriculum Conference of 1969. Based on the philosophical assumption that although intellectual cultivation is a primary function of education, educational objectives cannot be conceived of in solely intellectual terms, but must rather be conceived in terms of a far broader realization of the many facets of human personality. This is because it is the function of the school to develop in each individual the habits and powers whereby he will find his place and use that place to positively shape both himself and society. Educational goals should transcend the narrowly circumscribed limits of intellectual cultivation. It must include the training of the individual in the optimum use of the head, the heart, and hand. (Okafor, 2004).</p> <p>It was at this backdrop that the national policy on education was re-designed/harmonized be geared towards self-realization, better human relationship, individual and national efficiency, effective citizenship national consciousness, national unity, as well as towards social, cultural, economic, political, scientific and technology progress (NPE, 1981; Okafor 1988).</p> <p>In addition to the change in the school system the nation has witnessed a number of economical, technological, political and social changes in recent times, which tend to rock all spheres. The result is that the machine invented today becomes obsolete tomorrow. The solutions adopted today become out-dated tomorrow. The courses popular today become replaced with new ones tomorrow. In situation such as this effective guidance services become an indispensable factor of an equation which will result in making students acquire better knowledge of themselves and their environment. The understanding of self and environment can facilitate technological progress.</p> <p>Furthermore, the wind of change and innovation so evident in modern times and which has brought with it the multiplicity of occupations or careers make it mandatory that information be provided for students in all levels of our education system.  To do this effectively, sincere efforts needed to be made to survey and inform students about the available occupations. This need to supply students with information in different areas of life is even more urgent now. This is because some students in the Junior Secondary School (J.S.S) who cannot continue with academic work therefore must branch off to other areas other than “in-school-training” need information as to how to fit into the out-of-school vocational training. Information is equally needed for the senior secondary school (SSS) students who most also have information as to how to enter into disciplines where they are better fitted and the requirement for any given discipline. Adequate information service is necessary as its presence helps to strengthen individuals is not only realizing his potentials but also in fulfilling his dream.</p> <p>The introduction of the 6-3-3-4 system of education therefore addresses the apparent ignorance of many young people about career and the emphasis on “the training of the mind in the understanding of the world introducing guidance and counseling in schools. The acquisition of appropriate skills, abilities and competences, both mental and physical, as equipment for the individual to live in and contribute to the development of the individual and society”, became mandatory for government to employ the services of professionals for effective implementation. This is because the business of guidance and counseling include assisting students to understand themselves better in terms of intellectual, potentialities, aptitudes, talents, educational and vocational interests as well as helping students to become psychological well adjusted, emotionally healthy, morally sound and capable of making wise decisions.</p> <p>In view of the cited values/transformation of our educational system  there is need to assess the effectiveness of guidance and Counseling programme in the secondary schools in Toto Local; Government Area of Nasarawa State.</p> <p><strong>1.2                  </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The school guidance programme is undoubtedly be set by problems especially in an assessment of guidance programme on the academic achievement of students. For this reason, the need to assess guidance and counseling programme has been stressed. Lewis (1983) clearly points out that (if a counselor can prove through a thorough assessment that counselor’s programme is having a positive effect he has made a counseling less vulnerable to attacks by critics and will have more evidence in his own professional ability” Shertzer and Stone (1981) state “assessment of the programme will make it possible for the school personnel to judge how effective the services are and the nature of decisions needed.” It is generally agreed that one of the primary reasons for assessing the guidance programme is the need to prove its services.</p> <p>The implication of this is that counselors should provide information in the three major traditional areas of guidance and counseling in the senior secondary schools to help students to develop positive self concept, proper understanding of self and environment.</p> <p><strong>1.3             </strong><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The research work is designed to assess the effect of guidance and counselling programme on academic achievement of students in Toto Local Government Area.</p> <p>The specific objectives include to;</p> <p>1.      Identify how guidance and counselling improves the academic achievement of secondary school students in Toto Local Government Area.</p> <p>2.      Identify the various guidance services available in senior secondary schools in Toto Local Government Area.</p> <p>3.      Identify challenges to full integration of guidance and counselling programme into senior secondary school system.</p> <p>4.      To examine the influence of guidance and counselling on the academic performance of SS II students.</p> <p>5.      To compare the opinions of students and teaching regarding guidance services in schools.</p> <p><strong>1.4        RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1.           What are the assessments of the effect of guidance and counseling on the academic achievement of secondary schools students in Toto Local Government Area?</p> <p>2.           What are the guidance and counseling services available in Toto senior secondary schools to help students achieve their academic performance?</p> <p>3.           What   are   the challenges   of   full   integration of guidance   and counseling programme in the schools system?          </p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong>       HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>            The following hypotheses which were tested at 0.05 level of significance were formulated for the study.</p> <p>1.      There is no significant effect of guidance and counselling programme on the academic performance of secondary school students.</p> <p>2.      There is no significant difference between the opinions of students and teachers regarding the effects of guidance and counselling programme on students’ academic performance.</p> <p><strong>1.6       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>            The findings of the research are expected to benefit the students, teachers, counselors, parents and school administrators.</p> <p>            After the completion of this study, the finding would benefit the structures to acquire the true image of self-actualization. To acquire skills in decision making, problem solving. To help the teachers and parents understand and appreciate the needs and problems of students. To assist the school provides suitable learning-activities and healthy atmosphere for learning.  For proper placement in academic pursuits in tertiary institutions.</p> <p><strong>1.7     THEORETICAL/CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK</strong></p> <p>            This research work adopts the trait and factor theory.  Trait and factor theory was propounded by Freudian Gordon Allport (1960). It also called dispositional theory. Which is an approach to the study of human personality or mature.  This theory addresses the individuals trait (aptitudes, interest, personal abilities) and the knowledge capacity of students academic performance. The theory is much concerned of the individuals rational and objectives judgement about the relationship of academic achievement of students. The trait theorist is also primarily interested in the measurement of traits which can be defined as habitual pattern of behavior though and emotion.</p> <p>            According to this theory, trait this perspective traits are relatively stable overtime, differ across individual for example. Some people are outgoing whereas others are shy and influence behaviours.</p> <p>            Freudian Gordon Allport was an early pioneer in the study of trait which he sometimes referred to a dispositions. It is also a theory that include intelligence and aptitudes tests vocational tests and personality inventories. The researcher intends to use this theory to help assess the guidance programme on the academic achievement of students. This is based on the capacity of the individual’s trait aptitudes, interests, personal abilities and the knowledge capacity of students’ academic performance or achievements.</p> <p>            This involves the collection of data from different sources to gain understanding of the student’s aptitudes, abilities, interest and other personality traits on the academic achievement.</p> <p>The researcher will obtained these data and other relevant information by administering different categories of psychological tests through the uses of questionnaires as a techniques.</p> <p><strong>1.8       DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>            The conduct of this study will not be without some minor or shortcomings. The study is delimited to Toto Local Government Area of Nasarawa State. The scope of the study will be de-limited to only to survey of the assessment of guidance and counseling programme on the academic achievement of secondary school in Toto Local Government Area.  </p> <p><strong>1.9       OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>To facilitate the comprehension of this work, definitions have been provided for the following within the context they were used.</p> <p><strong>Guidance Service</strong>:                             Refers to all the activities and assistance rendered</p> <p>                                                            by guidance and counseling programme in the</p> <p>                                                            school.

This decision will impact them throughout their lives because; the essence of who the student is revolves around what the student wants to do with their life-long work. Super, Savicks, and Super (1996) maintains that initial career decision-making is a cultural developmental task that students are expected to have accomplished by the end of their high school year. Career selection has become a complex science with the advent of information technology, the emergence of post industrial revolution and job competition. At secondary school level, a student is expected to have knowledge of what he or she intends to do in the future, this in turn guides the choice of subjects the West African Certificate (WACE). <br/>This decision – making is very important and students must be allowed to choose their careers because it will create awareness in the students mind for the challenges ahead (Joans, 1986). The younger generation is the future of any society. Therefore, their career choices should help them develop the knowledge, skills and attitude needed to successfully examine their lives, while exploring and evaluating a wide range of career options to attain goals in the future. <br/>Ini Local Government Area came into existence in September 23, 1991. Ini people are known for their rich cultural heritage which bears strict similarities with those of other Ibibio communities in the state. They are predominantly farmers who cultivate their products in commercial quantities. Their specialization in mat making has introduced them into trading, which not only takes them to the width and breath of Akwa Ibom but beyond causing them to interact with people from other countries. In this modern and computer age, Ini people have adjusted to other occupations like nursing, teaching, engineering etc. This has given rise to multiple careers and choices from which the students in the Local Government can make. <br/>Participation in activities at home, school, community, gives room for interaction among the students and this opens their minds to possibilities, placing factors or determinants to their choices of career. These factors guides them to choose careers they can excel in, because in the future, a career choice a student had made must be able to sustain him or her through times of financial, emotional family, political and educational needs etc. Clearly, career choice is purposeful or necessary and must be carefully done to avoid regrets. Students forced into any career find it difficult to embrace and adjust to the challenges that come, thereby leaving the student at a choice of being stagnant or retreating as the case may be. <br/>This also discourages the student and puts him or her in a position of not wanting to try anything new or different in a case where the student cannot excel to maximum expectation. Indeed, career choice is for development and the choice of a career must satisfy the expectations of the student(s) to attain higher heights as he or she strives to succeed. This work is hinged on the determinants of career choice among secondary school students in Ini Local Government Area.</p>\n\nCAREER CHOICE AND ITS EFFECTS ON SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CAREER CHOICE AND ITS EFFECTS ON SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS", "id": 12}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>C<strong>HAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong> The issue of family planning all over the world has attracted attention due to it important in decision making about population growth and development issues. Uncontrolled birth is a major contributing factor of an increase in the world’s population, particularly in Nigeria. Statistics shows that the population of the world was about one billion in 1859 in 1930, the population had doubled (two billion) in 1976, the total population was said to be four billion. Today, it is more than six billion, with Nigeria having a population of over 162 million, thus being the largest country in Africa and the 7th in the world map (United States Census Buxau, 2010). Life is a precious gift that every individual hunger for and in an attempt to grab this gift, our health must be maintained. There are so many problems that have been found to result from poor family planning method. Some of these problems include: Over population, criminal abortion, child dumping, increased child morbidity and mortality, as well as increases material morbidity and mortality rates. Over population as one of the consequences of poor family planning has succeeded in causing a lot of harm to individuals, families, society and the nation at large. Maternal mortality and child mortality have been found to occur due to poor family planning practice, according to the statement of the WHO (World Health Organization) and United Nation Education, Scientific Children’s Organization (UNESCO) in 1991) that over three million children and two hundred thousand women die each year and also women’s health and action research (2004) had showed rates of child and maternal mortality and morbidity rate in the world due to poor altitude towards Ante-natal care in which family planning is one of the objectives. The President of Nigeria, his Excellency, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan was quoted in Vanguard newspaper on June 28, 2012saying “Nigeria families should have only the children they can afford. To ensure this order was followed , a new planned Parenthood Federation of Nigeria (PPFN) was created. He said it may be time for birth control legislation. Family planning, until recently, a very sensitive subject in Africa, is now very increasingly accepted as a necessary ingredient of socio-economic development. It is now thought to be an important health measure that contributes to the health of parents, children and the entire nation. Because of the great effect over population has on socio-economic status, education and health in general, a full understanding of this phenomenon and the major factors governing it are essential, thus the need to adopt family as a means of checking the escalating birthrate cannot be over emphasized. Unfortunately, this idea is not adequately emphasized on, especially in the rural areas, where it was observed that they g=have a high regard for large families and children are seen as a blessing from God. They believed that the more children a man has, the more hands to help with work especially on the farm. It is also believed that children give status to a women and security in old age. In Oghara-efe Community in Delta State, it was observed that husband often make sexual demands with little or no consideration for material health and the children’s survival. They compound their wives potential mortality rate by either not allowing her to seek family planning, advice or will not seek it as a collection responsibility. This present mentality in Oghara-efe community and its consequent socio-economic, educational and health effect on the villagers makes it important for this study to be carried out.</p>\n\nATTITUDE OF MEN TOWARDS FAMILY PLANNING AND IMPLICATION FOR THEIR INVOLVEMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ATTITUDE OF MEN TOWARDS FAMILY PLANNING AND IMPLICATION FOR THEIR INVOLVEMENT", "id": 13}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>A<strong>BSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The presence of evil in a world said to be created by a “Being” who is not only omnipotent, omniscience and perfectly good is problematic. It is a problem that has perturbed man for ages and coupled with various natural disaster still make the concept problematic one. How can there be a loving God, all-powerful and all-knowing God and still face the problem of evil, if really he is perfectly good and created everything then where does evil originated from?</p> <p>Atheist or agnostics base their case on the lack of evidence for God existence, however atheist have at least one very powerful positive argument for their position that there cannot be a living, all-loving, all-powerful God because there is so much evil and suffering in the world. Atheist raise questions like this: If you were a parent wouldn’t you do everything in your power to prevent your children from needless suffering? Many innocent children suffer from painful diseases, with this kind of problem how can we affirm for a loving and all-powerful God in the world.</p> <p>In this study, we are going to look through the lenses of philosopher who talk about the problem of evil and God’s existence. Our main focus on this work is theism and the problem of evil which will be dwell on chapter four of this work. Before going to the main work, we will first look at the problem which is evil, the different types of evil and different explanation (philosophical and religious explanation) of evil.</p> <p>We will talk more on chapter four that deal with the problem Theism and the problem of Evil.</p> <p>According to Augustine, evil is not a being, it is a result of privation of good, so it was not and cannot be created, evil cannot exist on it’s own. John Hick on his analysis gave some point why there is evil in the world. On his Greater Good Defence: God himself could not achieve certain result without allowing us to struggle against evil and to endure suffering some evil are necessary in achieving certain good end. The good that is achieved outweighs the evil and the same or a greater amount of good could not have been attained by any means that did not involve the presence of those evils.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0       </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The idea of God and the problem of evil is one of the most controversial themes in philosophy. Various arguments have been advanced down the ages by philosophers and theologians on this very problem of Evil and God and there has been no definite answer to this problem. The theist gave reasons why evil persist in the world created by a loving God, who they also believed that he is omnipotent, omniscience and all-merciful. There seems to be conflict between the theist and atheist on this very problem of God and Evil. The atheist used this as a fertile ground to prove that there is no God as claimed by the theist.</p> <p>John Hick on “Gender Good Defence” is of the view that when God initially created humanity, there was still some work to be done in making us a completed product. However, this remaining work could not be accomplished by God alone, we have to contribute to the process. Using the Greater Good Defence, Hick argues that even God himself could not achieve certain results without allowing us to struggle against evil and to endure suffering.</p> <p>Furthermore, the first chapter will concentrate on the statement of the problem, theism and the problem of evil. A method of research, purpose and the significant of this work will be discussed.</p> <p>The second chapter will dwell on the meaning of theism, the idea of God and the various argument for the existence of God (prove of God’s existence).</p> <p>The third chapter will be on the concept of evil as the problem, the meaning of evil and the different philosophical explanation of evil and finally the different types of evil in the world.</p> <p>Chapter four will dwell on the problem (Theism and the problem of evil). We will first look and examine evil as the problem and different ways of explanation given by theist concerning this very problem of evil and God.</p> <p>Finally, chapter five will be the summary of this work, reflecting what has been infer from chapter four then evaluate and conclude the work.</p> <p><strong>1.1   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The existence of God and the problem of evil has been a problem for long that men have searched for the reason why evil persist in a world claimed to be created by God who is omnipotent, omniscience and all-merciful. Man has tried to find out the causes of evil, why man created by God involved in bad action or why man carry out bad action on their fellow man and why there is so much evil in the world especially natural evil.</p> <p>Theist are faced with the problem of evil and this lead to their search of what is evil and causes of it, if it is a thing and also what and who is responsible for evil in the world. Different theists have given different views of evil. The Manicheans claimed to have the answer to the problem of evil, according to them, there are two ultimate principles and all sources of all things namely, Ormued (The Principle of Good) and Ahriman (The Principle of Evil). The Ahriman is the source of evil, darkness and all material things.</p> <p>Men soul came from Ormuzd (the principle of good) while the body from Ahriman. These two ultimate principle according to them, are eternal and in perpetual conflict with each other and this conflict is reflected in the things that come from them.</p> <p>Hence light and darkness, spirit and matter, good and evil are also in perpetual conflict. Christian theologians believe that evil is the wrath of God meted out on disobedient children. Augustine hold that evil is the negation or a privation of being. Evil is not a thing according to Augustine and therefore was not and cannot be created. Everything that is created is good and everything that is substance is good, but evil the origin of which I was trying find out is not a substance and was not created, therefore the question or the problem of evil should not arise because it does not make sense to ask about what is not a thing (substance). Evil cannot exist on it’s own but Good can exist on it’s own.</p> <p><strong>1.2   PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this work is to bring out the work of different theist and their different explanation on the problem of evil and the existence of God and most importantly on how they tried to find solution or answers to this very problem of evil and existence of God.</p> <p>Before showing why evil persist in this world created by God who is omnipotent, omniscience and all-loving (which is the major aim of this work), if it is a thing or not, then if it is a thing, who created it? What causes it?</p> <p>Why evil persist in this world created by God who is omnipotent, omniscience and all-loving. And also a critical study of different theist who try to solve or who gave their explanation and meaning to the very problem (Theism and the problem of evil) at hand.</p> <p><strong>1.3   SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The importance of this study is to show why evil exist in the world created by God who is all-loving, omnipotent and omniscience. The important of this work is to bring out the different explanation of the very problem at hand, the different meaning of evil and different ways theist try in solving the problem. Most atheists or agnostics based their case on the lack of evidence for God’s existence, they argue that we cannot claimed to have a loving God, all-powerful and all-merciful and still allow evil in the world, why a loving-God will allow suffering in this world.</p> <p>The most importance of the study is the explanation by theist why evil persist in the world. Some theist claimed that evil exist because of what is known as Greater Good Defence, it explains that some evil are necessary in achieving certain good end. The good that is achieved out-weighs the evil and the same or a greater amount of good could not have been attained by any means that did not involved the presence of those evils.</p> <p><strong>1.4   SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of this work is such that it would further strengthen on the fact that evil is opposed to good, which is the integrity or perfection of being. The problem of evil is sometimes abstracted to designate the ill affecting subject. The existence of evil in the world would all times be the greater of all the problems which the mind encounter when it reflects on God and its relation to the world.</p> <p>The problem of evil does not disprove the existence of God, evil exist, yes, according to some theist, evil exist but because man misuse his free will, according to Telhard De Chardin a Jesuit intellectual, consider the universe as an imperfect mechanism that is undergoing constant changes in terms of development, the universe we inhabit has not yet attain it’s perfect goal which it is gradually moving towards. According to him, the world is still in process of formation, therefore a world or the process of evolution is a world, which suffers labour and sins at every degree of evolution we find evil always and everywhere.</p> <p><strong>1.5   METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>As would be expected of a research work of this nature, much of the information for this study shall be gathered from the primary sources such as book and other library materials. This work will be centred on a philosophical exposition of theism and the problem of evil.</p> <p>This work will be done by analyzing the concept of theism, and the various arguments for the existence of God. And generally proceeds by looking at the concept of evil, the various kind of evil.</p> <p>In comparism to the nature of evil, different philosophers have taken different views of the problems of evil and our evaluation of this work will be value of the entire work that is theism and the view of evil.</p> <p><strong>1.6   LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p>Some material used in this study will be summarized as follow:</p> <p>Greater Good Defence: John Hick: The Philosophical Journey New York Mc Graw-Hill 2003.</p> <p>Greater Good Defence: The view that when God initially created humanity there was still some work to be done in making us a complete product. However, this remaining work could not be accomplished by God alone, we have to contribute to the process using the Greater Good Defence that argues that even God himself could not achieve certain result without allowing us to struggle against evil and to endure suffering.</p> <p>St. Augustine, The Confessions Chicago: William Peston, Britannica Great Book; 1944.</p> <p>Augustine was born in August, in Northern Africa, the son of a pagan father and a Christian mother by name, Monica; after receiving a good education in Tahie Rhetoric, Augustine a young man a dissipated habit at that time taught in cartage and Rome.</p> <p>He was baptized at the age of 37 in 387 A.D. and died as a Bishop of Hippo. Before his conversion, he lived a very bad life.</p> <p>However, Augustine’s confession was centred on the problem of evil for him, he still has difficulty in thinking of God as a spiritual being and also could not find a clear explanation without complication of the cause of evil. Evil the origin of which he was trying to find is not a substance, because if it were a substance, it would be good. For either it would be an incorruptible substance of the supreme order of goodness, or it would be corruptible unless it was good. From this nothing can be completely or absolutely be evil since evil is a privation of being and no being can be completely deprived of being in all aspect and still exist.</p> <p>To Augustine, all that God have made is good, and there are no substance whatsoever that were not made by God. And because God did not make them all equal, each single thing is good and collectively they are very good, for God made the whole creation very good. In finding an explanation of the problem of evil with the Platonist books Augustine realized that evil is a perversion of the will not. A substance as the Manicheans claimed that God was a substance that could suffer evil.</p> <p><strong>Readings in Religion and Philosophy Teradia Press, Benin City 2006</strong></p> <p><strong>TALHARD DE CHARDIN</strong></p> <p>A Jesulf intellectual approached the problem of evil from evolutionary perspective as an evolution St. Jesulf philosopher. Tellhard de Chardin considers the universe as an imperfect mechanism that is undergoing constant changes in terms of development. The universe we inhabit has not yet attain it’s perfect goal which it is gradually moving towards. As a result of this, constant changes and gradual development, once in a while there is disorderliness, catastrophy and cataclysm. For him, the world is still in process of evolution is a world:</p> <p>which suffers, which labours which sins ………………. Statistically, at every degree of evolution, we find evil always and everywhere forming and reforming implacably in and around us……….The many failures have there been far one success? How many for one solitary saint?</p> <p>Formally Tellhard de Chardin expose, the world would remain imperfect, while evil triumphs until the world gets to the omega point, which is the targeted goal of the creator.</p> <p><strong>In St. Anselm’s Prologian II M. Charlesorth (ed), Oxford 1965.</strong></p> <p>This even the fool is convinced that something that which nothing greater can be conceived is in the understanding, since when he hears this, he understood at and whatever is understood is the understanding. And certainly that then which a greater cannot be convinced cannot be in the understanding alone, it can be conceived to exist in reality also, which is greater. Thus, if that than which a greater can be conceived. But surely this cannot be. This without doubt something that which a greater cannot be conceived exist both in the understanding and in reality.</p> <p><strong>REFERENCES</strong></p> <ol><li>Joseph Omeregbe      A Simplified History of Western Philosophy (Lagos: Joja Educational Research and Published Ltd. 1994) pg. 118.</li> <li>Joseph Omoregbe      Knowing Philosophy 2003).

Divorce is a recurrent event in Nigeria which has impacted more than one-third negative effect on most children (Owusu-Bempah, 2007). For many children, the effects of divorce can have instantaneous and long-lasting results on their educational achievement. Divorce is one of the many problems facing the family unit today. People have different views on the effect of divorce on children but not a few analysts opine that when a couple opt for divorce, the resultant effects on them and their children are most times negative. The term ‘divorce’ came from the Latin word “Divortere” meaning to turn different ways or separate. This implies that Divorce is the final termination of marital union which cancels the legal duties and responsibilities of marriage and dissolve the bonds of matrimony between the parties. This could happen after a husband and wife decide not to live together anymore and that they are no longer interested in their marriage.</p>\n\nCOUNSELLORS’ PERCEPTION ON THE CAUSES OF DIVORCE AND ITS IMPACT ON ADOLESCENTS IN EDUCATIONAL ZONE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COUNSELLORS’ PERCEPTION ON THE CAUSES OF DIVORCE AND ITS IMPACT ON ADOLESCENTS IN EDUCATIONAL ZONE", "id": 15}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT<br/><br/></strong></p> <p>This study focuses on the “Perception of premarital sex among students in higher education The challenges of sex before marriage have drawn concern; This is due to different social problems it generates. understanding is that, sex before marriage comes with its own dangers and if not treated properly can lead to more social problems. To achieve the stated objectives of the research, data were collected through the questionnaire as a tool. The data were analyzed using the Likert scale method to achieve clarity. According to research findings, it was concluded that sex before marriage among students has reached alarming proportions and that sex before marriage is now part of the social life of students and as such, students see nothing wrong with it. Therefore, it was recommended that, early sex education should be given to children, regular campaign and public awareness on sex before marriage should be carried out and that parents, government and the general public need take it upon themselves to bring their own quota to the education and the reduction of sex before marriage.</p>\n\nPERCEPTION OF STUDENTS ON PRE-MARITAL SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP AMONG TERTIARY STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PERCEPTION OF STUDENTS ON PRE-MARITAL SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP AMONG TERTIARY STUDENTS", "id": 16}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> </div> <div> <p>Therefore this study was designed to evaluate the teaching and learning of guidance and counseling in Colleges of Education.

Education is aimed at inducing a change in individuals in some desirable way and add to the knowledge they already posses (Onwuka, 1981).</p> <p>The arrival of missionaries in Nigeria brought formal Teacher Education in the country. The need for evangelization encouraged the training of personnel for the purpose of teaching. Initially, these personnel functioned as catechists who teach religious doctrines in the churches but later realize the need to train them to provide manpower for other services. This continued until 19thcentury when the formal institution for the training of teachers was established in the country (Akuyimu, 1991). The Ashby commission in 1959 came with the revolution of Teacher Education. The Ashby commission reportedthat the country’s (Nigeria) manpower development depend on the number of qualified teachers and recommended teacher Education programme upon which the whole system of education depended.</p> <p>From the recommendations, two schemes of Teacher Education were introduced. One of these schemes was teacher certification programme which was established with the assistance of UNESCO. Later both the Federal and the</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>2</p> <p>then Regional governments established in all five Advance Teaching Training Colleges (ATTC) in 1962 following the Ashby commission recommendations. This was later changed to Colleges of Education (COE).</p> <p>The Colleges of Education are charged to train teachers in various teaching subjects and methods, who will teach in the senior section of the nation’s primarySschools and in the junior section of the secondary schools. Specifically, the National policy on Education (2004) stipulates that the aims of teacher education are to:</p> <p>xProduce highly motivated, conscientious and efficient classroom teachers for all levels of our educational system.</p> <p>xEncourage further the spirit of enquiry and creativity in teachers.</p> <p>xHelp teachers to fit into the social life of the community and society at large and to enhance their commitment to national objectives.</p> <p>xProvide teachers with the intellectual and professional background</p> <p>adequate for their assignment and to make them adaptable to any changing</p> <p>situation not only in the life of their country but in the wider world.xEnhance teachers commitment to the teaching profession.</p> <p>The above objectives indicate that teaching in tertiary institutions, which deals with teacher education programme, is more than instructing; more widely and provides a framework in which students acquire potent knowledge about subject matter. Above all, the objectives require teacher development in solid</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>3</p> <p>self-understanding and effectiveness that depends on their professionalism, experience and commitment. In the same way, Shuaibu (1991) states the important role teacher education programme plays in our educational system as follows:</p> <p>xIt preserves the system. A teacher education programme should be concerned the teacher on how to select what to teach and to identified group effectively.</p> <p>xIt should be evaluative. A teacher education programme should be evaluative of not only what is learnt but what has been considered worth while and how these matters have been taught.</p> <p>xIt should be generative. The programme should be able to predict the future and work out the skills and attitudes that would be required to stand the test of time.</p> <p>xIt should serve as a maintenance system. The teacher education programme should make up the short fall resulting from expansion in the education system.</p> <p>xA research-based teacher education programme should identify obsolesce in knowledge and methodology and substitute for these in the school curriculum.</p> <p>The implication of the above roles stated that, the products of teacher education programme are expected to personify the educated Nigerian, to be a</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>4</p> <p>nationalist and a patriot irrespective of the circumstances of the environment and personal deprivations.</p> <p>Among the various courses in the colleges of Education is guidance and counselling. The philosophy of guidance and counselling programme in Colleges of Education as stipulated by the National Commission for colleges of Education (NCCE, 1996) is inspired by the desire to help students become potentially and intellectually informed in guidance and counselling skills for logical reasoning, ideas, understand their capability, and to make useful decisions in education.</p> <p>The objectives of guidance and counselling programme among other things are as follows; according to National Commission for Colleges of Education (NCCE):</p> <p>·          To find out and make individual aware of their basic personal pre­requisites, abilities, assests, liabilities and potentialities.</p> <p>·          To provide usable information correctly or clarify misinformation</p> <p>·          Assess an individuals chances to succeed in the labour market.</p> <p>·          To create awareness of client in the available jobs and how to progress in</p> <p>them.</p> <p>·          To make available opportunities for further training and advancement in occupation.</p> <p>·          To suggest alternative careers and realization of priorities.</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>5</p> <p>xAssists individual to use appropriate tools and techniques necessary for self-direction, personal understanding, self-confidence and mental maturation for healthy growth adjustments</p> <p>x To mobilize all the available resources of the school or home for satisfaction of vocational, academic and social-personal needs of the student.</p> <p>In order to achieve these laudable objectives as well as to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the Colleges of Education, there is need to constantly evaluate the guidance and counselling programme of our schools for rapid changes in educational, vocational and socio-personal development. Some evaluation studies have been carried out in the Colleges of Education in Nigeria are as followed Dienye (2005) defines evaluation as a process of finding out how far the learning experiences in relation to the content that have been developed and organized, actually produce the desired results. The process of evaluation will also involve the identification of strengths and weaknesses of the curriculum plan.</p> <p>Evaluation involves a systematic process, it is controlled observation of pupils change in behaviour. Agbaegbu, Ezendu and Agwagah (2000) defines evaluation as a process of ascertaining the functionality of education programme and practices in a systematic manner. The learners are exposed to</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>some content before evaluating or determining the extent of learning or behavioural change that has take place.</p> <p>Teaching is a common term we use in three distinct ways: as a profession/occupation, as a doctrine/body of knowledge, and as a formal school activity, Keziah and Lawrence (2003). Teaching as a formal school activity is the major one that concerns us because it is the process of getting a learner become educated. Teaching influencing the thoughts, feelings and behaviour of other admittedly, teaching is concerned with education or behaviour change, it is a system of activity by a formerly knowledge, working with one or more learners to achieve certain learning outcomes.</p> <p>Attempts to explain the concept of teaching and learning has introduced the issue of selling and buying. There is no double to the fact that but concepts involves some sort of interaction. In other words, some level of interaction is necessary before there can be teaching-learning or selling buying. But where as the seller-buyer relationship has an action of giving something to someone in consideration for money as the most important predictable behaviour, teacher – learner relationship has no one major event. Rather, it involves series of actions like marking of papers, discussing and demonstration, explaining and illustration or writing of something on the chalkboard.</p> <p>Experience is the knowledge and skill that is gained through something for a period of time Oxford Advanced Learners dictionary (2000). For instance</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>7</p> <p>a teacher with ten years teaching experience influence the way he/she thinks and behaves in a more acceptable way from accumulated knowledge gained through the skills he acquire from a particular job.</p> <p>The use of instructional facilities enhances learning experience and leads to interaction within the learning environment. Consequently the interaction culminates in increased interest and acquisition of competences needed for the occupational world. In this age of educational technology, the process of learning requires systematic application of scientific knowledge to practical tasks, identifying and analyzing learning problems. Learning occurs at three levels Olumba (1996) mention as follows; (a) Direct experience level (b) iconic experience level and (c) symbolic experience.</p> <p>Direct experience level deals with the real life experience involving the interaction of the student with his environment through seeing, learning, touching and manipulation of what is learned. The iconic level of learning has to do with teaching students by means of pictorial. This kind of learning leads to vicarious experience. The symbolic level of learning is merely learning in abstraction as in mathematics. Learning experience is interaction between the learner and his external conditions in their environments to which he can react (Olaitan and Ali 1997). Learning environment is the collective social and technical setting in which teachers and students interact with instructional</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>objects for purposes of acquiring skills, knowledge and attitude which is known as experience.</p> <p>However, there are inadequate number of non-academic staff, no Mathematic workshop, no departmental library and lecture method is popularly used by the lecturers against discovering, demonstration and problem solving methods. Studies above revealed that most of the programmes introduced by Colleges of Education in Nigeria were inadequate to meet the need of the learners and society. Since guidance and counselling is part of the programme in Colleges of Education, the aims and objectives need to be attainable to ensure that they are consistently being achieved. For effective teaching to occur there is need for the teachers to posses the skills, the knowledge of the subject matter as well as the ability to select appropriate methods for delivery instructions to students. Certain facilities need to be provided to ensure the smooth running of the programme. Such facilities are classroom blocks, staff offices, provision of adequate staff personnel, counselling laboratory, seminar, sensitization campaigns, workshop etc. Akale (1991) observed that in some Colleges of Education, some of these facilities are grossly inadequate. Against this background, this work is geared towards evaluating guidance and counselling programme in Colleges of Education in Cross River State with a view to determining its strengths and weaknesses and proffering solution to the identified problems.</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <strong>Statement of Problem</strong> <p>Despite programmes mounted by Colleges of Education in Nigeria to meet the needs of the learners and society both human and material resources are inadequate. Since guidance and counselling is part of the programme in Colleges of education, it become imperative to evaluate the guidance and counselling teacher education in the Colleges of Education in order to determine its effectiveness and efficiency in meeting the needs of learner and society. An evaluation of guidance and counselling programme should not only be on1 Rstudent’s performance but also on all theEfacilities both❑physical and human resources that are necessary for a successful implementation of any education programme. Programme evaluation of this nature is useful for programme improvement, decision-making, personnel, accountability and availability of facilities. Therefore knowledge of guidance and counselling programme is critical in the improvement of teaching and learning of guidance and counselling, improvement of the personnel and taking useful and worthwhile decision concerning the development of Colleges of Education.</p> <p>Since the inception of guidance and counselling in colleges of education evaluation research work has been carried out in biology, Introductory Technology, Business Education, Integrated Science, Physic, Social Studies etc. But no effort has been made to evaluate guidance and counselling inspite of it imperative impact to ascertain the achievement of its aims and objectives in the</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div>     school system. The problem of this study is that teaching and learning of guidance and counselling have not been evaluated since the inception of the course in school. Therefore these study evaluate guidance and counselling programme in Colleges of Education and to determine the extent of which the objectives of the course have been achieved in Cross River State.  <p><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to evaluate guidance and counselling programme in colleges of education in Cross River State.

To parent, it will enable them to identify their weaknesses on part of failure their responsibility to provide for their wards necessary materials needed for a successful school work and learning.</p> <p>Lecturers will know the damaging effect of guidance and counselling on students’ academic achievement. Hence they will look for ways of manipulating the school environment to provide conducive learning situation that will discourage poor performance among the students. They would exploit instructional approaches in teaching guidance in counselling with the necessary needed facilities to enhance effective teaching and learning.</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p><strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study was carried out in Cross River State be limited to Colleges of Education. The study was restricted specifically to evaluation of guidance and counselling programme in Colleges of Education. The CIPP (Context, input, process, product) model of evaluation is used with particular emphasis on the context, input, process and product (CIPP) aspect of model.</p> <p>The programme is evaluated in terms of the extent of the achievement of the objectives of guidance and counselling contexts, availability and utilization of instructional materials and facilities.

Evaluation according to</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>Agbaegbu, Ezeudu and Agwagah (2000) is the process of ascertaining the functionality of educational programmes and practices in a systematic manner.</p> <p>Similarly Olaitan (1996) observed that evaluation gives support to action taken as well as suggests changes to be made if instructional /programme goals must be achieved. Evaluation is a continuous comprehensive process which utilizes a variety of procedures and which inescapably are related to the objectives of the instructional programme.</p> <p>It is in line with this that Gronlund, cited in (Harbour – Peters 1999) while relating evaluation procedures to instructional objectives, says that evaluation is an integral part of the teaching and learning process. According to Harbour-Peters (1999) Evaluation is not something tacked on at the end of a course; it is not limited to the measurement of the amount of the factoral material retained.</p> <p>Therefore, the following procedures should be adopted to accomplished meaningful instructional evaluation.</p> <p>xDecide on the purpose the evaluation result should serve.</p> <p>xDecide on the content, evaluation should be base on.</p> <p>xDecide on the format of evaluation instrument.</p> <p>xDecide on the administrative conditions of the instrument.</p> <p>xFormulate the procedure for grading and interpreting the result.</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>Proper use of evaluation procedure according to Gronlund, will help improve students learning by.</p> <p>1.                       Clarifying the intending learning outcome.</p> <p>2.                       Providing short-term goals to work</p> <p>3.                       Offering feed back concerning learning programme</p> <p>4.                       Providing information for over coming learning difficulties and selecting future learning experience.</p> <p>According to Okoro (2005) noted that evaluation is a methodological activity which consists of gathering and combining performance data to yield rating and in justifying the data collection procedure weighting of data and the goals themselves.</p> <p>In another dimension, Patton cited in Ali, Ezeadi and Ogbazi (1986) viewed evaluation as:</p> <p>1.            A problem solving strategy</p> <p>2.            A strategy that identifies the need for a decision through data collection, analysis and information use</p> <p>3.          One which entails situation that involves choice on data collection and the worth of option.</p> <p>4.            One which involves making judgment and appraisals</p> <p>Gronlund (1985) suggested five basic operational principles by which evaluation should be based for effectiveness. These include:</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>xDetermining and classifying what is to be evaluated always as priority in the evaluation process.</p> <p>xEvaluation technique should be selected in terms of the purpose to be served.</p> <p>x</p></div>\n\nEVALUATING TEACHING AND LEARNING OF GUIDANCE AND COUNSELING IN COLLEGES OF EDUCATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EVALUATING TEACHING AND LEARNING OF GUIDANCE AND COUNSELING IN COLLEGES OF EDUCATION", "id": 17}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> </div> <div> <p>Therefore this study was designed to evaluate the teaching and learning of guidance and counseling in Colleges of Education.

The philosophy of guidance and counselling programme in Colleges of Education as stipulated by the National Commission for colleges of Education (NCCE, 1996) is inspired by the desire to help students become potentially and intellectually informed in guidance and counselling skills for logical reasoning, ideas, understand their capability, and to make useful decisions in education.</p> <p>The objectives of guidance and counselling programme among other things are as follows; according to National Commission for Colleges of Education (NCCE):</p> <p>·          To find out and make individual aware of their basic personal pre­requisites, abilities, assests, liabilities and potentialities.</p> <p>·          To provide usable information correctly or clarify misinformation</p> <p>·          Assess an individuals chances to succeed in the labour market.</p> <p>·          To create awareness of client in the available jobs and how to progress in</p> <p>them.</p> <p>·          To make available opportunities for further training and advancement in occupation.</p> <p>·          To suggest alternative careers and realization of priorities.</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>5</p> <p>xAssists individual to use appropriate tools and techniques necessary for self-direction, personal understanding, self-confidence and mental maturation for healthy growth adjustments</p> <p>x To mobilize all the available resources of the school or home for satisfaction of vocational, academic and social-personal needs of the student.</p> <p>In order to achieve these laudable objectives as well as to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the Colleges of Education, there is need to constantly evaluate the guidance and counselling programme of our schools for rapid changes in educational, vocational and socio-personal development. Some evaluation studies have been carried out in the Colleges of Education in Nigeria are as followed Dienye (2005) defines evaluation as a process of finding out how far the learning experiences in relation to the content that have been developed and organized, actually produce the desired results. The process of evaluation will also involve the identification of strengths and weaknesses of the curriculum plan.</p> <p>Evaluation involves a systematic process, it is controlled observation of pupils change in behaviour. Agbaegbu, Ezendu and Agwagah (2000) defines evaluation as a process of ascertaining the functionality of education programme and practices in a systematic manner. The learners are exposed to</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>some content before evaluating or determining the extent of learning or behavioural change that has take place.</p> <p>Teaching is a common term we use in three distinct ways: as a profession/occupation, as a doctrine/body of knowledge, and as a formal school activity, Keziah and Lawrence (2003). Teaching as a formal school activity is the major one that concerns us because it is the process of getting a learner become educated. Teaching influencing the thoughts, feelings and behaviour of other admittedly, teaching is concerned with education or behaviour change, it is a system of activity by a formerly knowledge, working with one or more learners to achieve certain learning outcomes.</p> <p>Attempts to explain the concept of teaching and learning has introduced the issue of selling and buying. There is no double to the fact that but concepts involves some sort of interaction. In other words, some level of interaction is necessary before there can be teaching-learning or selling buying. But where as the seller-buyer relationship has an action of giving something to someone in consideration for money as the most important predictable behaviour, teacher – learner relationship has no one major event. Rather, it involves series of actions like marking of papers, discussing and demonstration, explaining and illustration or writing of something on the chalkboard.</p> <p>Experience is the knowledge and skill that is gained through something for a period of time Oxford Advanced Learners dictionary (2000). For instance</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>7</p> <p>a teacher with ten years teaching experience influence the way he/she thinks and behaves in a more acceptable way from accumulated knowledge gained through the skills he acquire from a particular job.</p> <p>The use of instructional facilities enhances learning experience and leads to interaction within the learning environment. Consequently the interaction culminates in increased interest and acquisition of competences needed for the occupational world. In this age of educational technology, the process of learning requires systematic application of scientific knowledge to practical tasks, identifying and analyzing learning problems. Learning occurs at three levels Olumba (1996) mention as follows; (a) Direct experience level (b) iconic experience level and (c) symbolic experience.</p> <p>Direct experience level deals with the real life experience involving the interaction of the student with his environment through seeing, learning, touching and manipulation of what is learned. The iconic level of learning has to do with teaching students by means of pictorial. This kind of learning leads to vicarious experience. The symbolic level of learning is merely learning in abstraction as in mathematics. Learning experience is interaction between the learner and his external conditions in their environments to which he can react (Olaitan and Ali 1997). Learning environment is the collective social and technical setting in which teachers and students interact with instructional</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>objects for purposes of acquiring skills, knowledge and attitude which is known as experience.</p> <p>However, there are inadequate number of non-academic staff, no Mathematic workshop, no departmental library and lecture method is popularly used by the lecturers against discovering, demonstration and problem solving methods. Studies above revealed that most of the programmes introduced by Colleges of Education in Nigeria were inadequate to meet the need of the learners and society. Since guidance and counselling is part of the programme in Colleges of Education, the aims and objectives need to be attainable to ensure that they are consistently being achieved. For effective teaching to occur there is need for the teachers to posses the skills, the knowledge of the subject matter as well as the ability to select appropriate methods for delivery instructions to students. Certain facilities need to be provided to ensure the smooth running of the programme. Such facilities are classroom blocks, staff offices, provision of adequate staff personnel, counselling laboratory, seminar, sensitization campaigns, workshop etc. Akale (1991) observed that in some Colleges of Education, some of these facilities are grossly inadequate. Against this background, this work is geared towards evaluating guidance and counselling programme in Colleges of Education in Cross River State with a view to determining its strengths and weaknesses and proffering solution to the identified problems.</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <strong>Statement of Problem</strong> <p>Despite programmes mounted by Colleges of Education in Nigeria to meet the needs of the learners and society both human and material resources are inadequate. Since guidance and counselling is part of the programme in Colleges of education, it become imperative to evaluate the guidance and counselling teacher education in the Colleges of Education in order to determine its effectiveness and efficiency in meeting the needs of learner and society. An evaluation of guidance and counselling programme should not only be on1 Rstudent’s performance but also on all theEfacilities both❑physical and human resources that are necessary for a successful implementation of any education programme. Programme evaluation of this nature is useful for programme improvement, decision-making, personnel, accountability and availability of facilities. Therefore knowledge of guidance and counselling programme is critical in the improvement of teaching and learning of guidance and counselling, improvement of the personnel and taking useful and worthwhile decision concerning the development of Colleges of Education.</p> <p>Since the inception of guidance and counselling in colleges of education evaluation research work has been carried out in biology, Introductory Technology, Business Education, Integrated Science, Physic, Social Studies etc. But no effort has been made to evaluate guidance and counselling inspite of it imperative impact to ascertain the achievement of its aims and objectives in the</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div>     school system. The problem of this study is that teaching and learning of guidance and counselling have not been evaluated since the inception of the course in school. Therefore these study evaluate guidance and counselling programme in Colleges of Education and to determine the extent of which the objectives of the course have been achieved in Cross River State.  <p><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to evaluate guidance and counselling programme in colleges of education in Cross River State.

Five research questions were formulated to guide the study. Through the process of simple random sampling, a total of two hundred (200) students from five (5) senior secondary schools were selected to participate in the study. The major instrument used for collecting data was a questionnaire tagged EPRAP. The data collected were analyzed. Chi square was used to test the hypotheses. Findings showed that punishment has significant effect on the academic performance of students. It was also discovered that intrinsic reward has no effect on the academic performance of students. Research also showed that extrinsic reward has a significant effect on the academic performance of students. From results findings, it was recommended that students should focus more on self motivators rather than on gifts and awards. Also, teachers, and parents should use all forms of punishment and reward systems appropriately as over use frequent reliance on any of them may reduce the effectiveness.</p> <p>Motivation itself is a hodge-podge- a term of very complex dimensions. It is known to include the rewards and punishments among many other interacting drives, forces and incentives which affect or influence student’s learning. ‘Extrinsic’ forms of motivation like rewards and punishments have always been used by lectures/ teachers educators to correct or stimulate certain forms of behaviors. Yet, what their effects and consequences are, whether they facilitate or hinder learning and to what extent, how they operate to increase, if at all, the efficiency of learning and many such allied questions have remained largely unanswered. Or, their answers have generally been improvised, for the most part, from intuition, conjecture or just intelligent guess- work rather than on research findings. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to examine these questions in order to discover (uncover, to be more specific) the effect of punishment and reward on the academic performance of students. For purposes of analysis, rewards will include intrinsic and extrinsic rewards.  Also, punishment will include corporal punishments, Expulsion and suspension.</p> <p><br/><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Students are priceless assets and most essential elements in education. It is absolutely necessary to direct students to exhibit acceptable attitude and behavior within and outside the school. In an attempt to achieve an organized and peaceful school environment and maintain law and order, school management specifies rules and regulations to guide the activities of members of the educational organization.  Student’s discipline is a prerequisite to almost everything a school has to offer students (Selfert and Vornberg, 2002). Seifert and Vornberg further linked discipline with both the culture and climate of the school thus. In schools where discipline is a serious problem, for example, where students bully others, parents tend to transfer their children to ‘better’ schools, and because the well behaved usually perform well (Rigby, 2000), their transfer can affect the overall performance of that school. Troublesome students can sometimes make teachers react emotionally to the extent of using punishment. But punishment, instead of curbing behavior, can aggravate it (Dreikurs, Grunwald and Pepper 1998).  Currently, schools have different types of reward and penalty policy in place, but almost all of them have one common goal which is to motivate students to learn. Educators nowadays are aware that giving penalties are counterproductive.</p> <p>Punishment is the use of physical or psychological force or action that causes pain in an attempt to prevent undesirable behavior from recurring. Scolding, threats,deprivations, and spankings are all forms of punishment. Back in the nineteenth century, Froebel wrote that the use of punishment was a good way for adults to make a child “bad”. If the goal for child is the development of morality, of making good choices on his /her own, then punishment should not be involved .conditions should be created that not only allow but strongly induce children to be or become moral and disciplined individuals who can make good choices on their own(Bettelheim,1985;Ramsburg,1997).Punishment tends to generate anger, defiance, and a desire for revenge. Moreover, it also gives encouragement to the use of authority rather than reason thus this would tend to break the relationship between adult and child (Kohn, 1994).Punishment teaches a child that those who have the power can force others to do what they want them to do(Bettelheim,1985;Samalin and Whitney,1995)</p> <p>Children can be categorizedas intrinsically or extrinsically motivated. Every teacher in the classroom uses strategies to acknowledge and encourage appropriate social and academic behavior by their students. These strategies take many forms,some overt and some dramatic (presentation of tokens or recognition at an assembly). Since Thorndike (1874-1949) described the Law of effect,educators and psychologists have noted that when a behavior is successful it is more likely to occur again in similar circumstances. Many teachers believe that motivation can be “jump started”by providing tangible rewards such as stickers, candy or prizes.They assert that reinforcing appropriate behaviors can have positive results since children tend to continue or repeat an action that is rewarded. Others argue that rewards devalue learning and counteract the development of self –discipline and intrinsic motivation. These opponents assert that tangible rewards produce short-term changes and only serve as motivators if students wants them.They contend the use of rewards fosters competition and the “what’s in it for me?” attitude;the more they are used, the   more incentives students expect. The simple message is that the consequences of a behavior affect future performance of that behavior. If, following the contingent delivery of a consequence, a behavior becomes more likely in the future, then that consequence was reinforcing or rewarding.An effective rewards and penalty system promotes positive behavior and regular attendance. It is the essential foundation for a creative learning and teaching environment.The ultimate goal of rewarding children is to help them internalize positive behaviours so that they will not need a reward. Eventually, self-motivation will be sufficient to induce them to perform the desired behaviour, and outside reinforcement will no longer be necessary.</p> <p>This research therefore, points out that in order to impart knowledge and facilitate students learning, teachers make use of different strategies (punishment and reward). The forms of punishment under study in this research are corporal punishment, suspension, and expulsion and the types of reward under study in this research are intrinsic and extrinsic rewards.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>In Nigeria and the world all over, academic performance remains a vital means through which students learning is measured and evaluated. The increasing poor performance in public examination has over the years been a great concern to stakeholders in education. Government, educational administrators and managers, captain of industries and professionals from all walks of life have continued to show their concern for the dwindling academic performance of senior secondary school students in public examinations such as WAEC(West Africa Examination Council), NECO(National Examination Council), JAMB(Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board), and NABTEB(National Business and Technical Examinations Board.</p> <p>However, the dwindling performance of students in public examination can be attributed to several factors such as poor study habits, lack of concentration in class, indiscipline, ineffective use of punishment and reward, family issue, peer influence, absenteeism, failure to reward appropriate and punish inappropriate behavior and the likes.</p> <p>The falling standard of education is a pressing problem of the society and it has become a cankerworm which must be tackled. Efforts made to identify the cause of these problems and to suggest possible solution has led educational researchers and scholars to investigate some teacher, school environment and students variable as correlates of students’ academic performance. Although these have led to improvement in students’ academic performance, it appears that such improvement is adjudged to be insignificant.This however is an indication that more investigation needs to be conducted for students’ academic performance to be improved upon significantly. This study therefore filled this gap by investigating the effect of punishment and reward on senior secondary school students’ Academic Performance in Shomolu Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purposes of this study are to:</p> <p>1.         Determine the effect of Corporal Punishment on the Academic Performance of Senior Secondary School students in Shomolu Local government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p>2.         Determine the effect of Suspension on the Academic Performance of Senior Secondary School Students in Shomolu Local government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p>3.         Determine the effect of Expulsion on the Academic Performance of Senior Secondary School Students in Shomolu Local government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p>4.         Determine the effect of Intrinsic Reward on the Academic Performance of Senior Secondary School Students in Shomolu Local government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p>5.         Determine the effect of Extrinsic Reward on the Academic Performance of Senior Secondary School Students in Shomolu Local government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study will be of much importance to teachers in Shomolu Local Government area of Lagos State on how to effectively make use of punishment and rewards in their relationship with the students.</p> <p>The study will also help students to understand the appropriate behaviors to exhibit in and outside the school. For the parents, the study will help them to know which behavior exhibited by the child requires reward and which requires punishment.</p> <p>Through this study, the stakeholders in education sector may come to appreciate the implications of punishment and reward in the Senior Secondary Schools. It is hoped that this study will help the Senior Secondary Schools administrators in Shomolu Local Government Area of Lagos State to b improve on the academic performance of students in various schools.</p> <p>This study will also help to discover the effects of punishment and reward on learning in some selected Secondary Schools in Shomolu Local Government area of Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong><strong>REASEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1.      What effect does corporal punishment have on the academic performance of Senior Secondary School students in Shomolu Local government Area of Lagos State?</p> <p>2.      What is the effect of suspension on the academic performance of Senior Secondary School Students in Shomolu Local Government Area of Lagos State?</p> <p>3.      What is the effect of expulsion on the academic performance of Senior Secondary School students?</p> <p>4.      What is the effect of extrinsic reward on the academic performance of Senior Secondary School students?</p> <p>5.       What is the effect of intrinsic Reward on the academic performance of Senior Secondary            School students?</p> <p><strong>1.7</strong><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>1.      There is no significant effect of corporal punishment on the academic performance of Senior Secondary School students.</p> <p>2.      There is no significant effect of suspension on the academic performance of Senior Secondary School students.</p> <p>3.      There is no significant effect of expulsion on the academic performance of Senior Secondary School students.</p> <p>4.      There is no significant effect of intrinsic reward on the academic performance of Senior Secondary School students</p> <p>5.      There is no significant effect of extrinsic reward on the academic performance of Senior Secondary School students</p> <p>1.<strong>7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The research will be carried out in selected Secondary Schools in Shomolu Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.8 OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>The following terms were used in the work,</p> <p>·        PUNISHMENT: An act of correcting a wrong ‘act’ or character exhibited.</p> <p>·        REWARD: An act of appreciating a job well done.</p> <p>·        MOTIVATION: An act of rewarding or providing with an incentive.</p> <p>·        REINFORCEMENT: An act of giving more force or effectiveness to; strengthen.</p>                                                           \n\nEFFECT OF PUNISHMENT AND REWARD ON ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF SENIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF PUNISHMENT AND REWARD ON ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF SENIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS", "id": 19}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT <strong>The study attempted to investigate the influence of adult education on family planing in Ikeja Local Government Area of Lagos State.

This shows that adult educational programmes has significance influence on the level of family planning among couples in Ikeja Local Government Area of Lagos State.</strong> </p> <p> CHAPTER ONE </p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>Introduction/Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Adult education has been given varying definitions by many scholars and organisations.</p> <p>UNESCO (1976) defined adult education as denoting “the entire body and organised educational process, whatever the content the level of method whether formal or otherwise, whether prolong or replace initial education in schools, colleges and universities as well as apprenticeship, whereby persons regarded as adult by the society to which they belong develop their abilities, which their knowledge, improve their technical and professional qualifications and bring about changes in their attitudes or behaviour in the two fold perspective of full personal development, participation, balanced and independent social, economic and cultural development.</p> <p>“Adult Education is a process whereby persons who no longer attend school on a regular and full time basis (unless full home programmes are especially designed for adult) undertake sequential and organised activities with conscious intention of bringing about change in information, knowledge, undertakings of skills, appreciation and attitudes or for the purpose of identifying and serving personal or community problem”.</p> <p>According to Onuoha (1990), programes that are adult education based are agricultural and farmers training programme, adult literacy programmes, occupational skill training, youth clubs, various community development programmes, programmes of instruction in health, nutrition, family planning co-operatives etc. These programmes, Onuhoa went further, are for the creation of awareness, passage of necessary information and the enhancement of individual development, growth and social well beings.</p> <p>People have consciously or unconsciously engaged themselves in family planning throughout history. Abstinence either life long or temporary and prohibitions, forbidden intercourse during certain festivals, effectively curtail the fertility rate (the number of life birth for each woman during her life time) (Barns 1990). Also separation of husbands from their wives for long period of time either because of war or employment, curtail the birth rate and fertility.</p> <p>According to Nnadi (1994) abortion has been used to limit family size and descriptions can be found in the herbal and other folklores of women and midwives of most societies. The deliberate abandonment of infants and young children even killing of new borns has not been uncommon in the past or even in some areas of the world today (Hooday, 1993).</p> <p>Adult education programes especially on health matters like family planning is an important programme that is intended to touch the lives of the people, especially couples and other sexually active youths in the society. Family planning, using adult education programme enables the adults who are still sexually active to know when to engage in sexual acts, what system to use and the best method of contraceptives to apply in curtailing fertility or birth rate. Therefore, adults more especially couples who engage themselves in adult education programmes would in any case avail themselves of the opportunity of curtailing their family size, avoiding abortion and being able to space their child birth rate (Anyanwu, 1994).</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>Historical Background of Family Planning</strong></p> <p>The technique of family planning, over the centuries have simply been modified, Himes (1936) notes tat the earlier premature people used some magical nature powers to help women control pregnancies and to regulate birth.</p> <p>The Greeks employed crocodile drugs as diaphragm olive and cedar oil were use as jelly. Under Emperor Augustus, the Romans employed the laws to stimulate population growth.</p> <p>In Britain, especially, as time passed, several interpretations came to be attached to the notion of family planning. There were several arrests, detentions and imprisonment of people who dared practice of talk of family planning.</p> <p>Amongst the martyrs include Kuwoeiton, Bradlaugh who were imprisoned for publishing the “Fruits of Philosophy” (an influential tract on birth control) and “preventive sexual intercourse” respectively (Brackett, 1962).</p> <p>The great depressing (1873 – 1876) however led to a change in mind concerning family planning both as a practice and social philosophy. Women had become emancipated and were therefore unwilling to bear the burden of unrestricted family sizes. There was a silencing of the English law following such publications as:</p> <p>a.            The law of population by Annie Besant (1879)</p> <p>b.            The wife’s handbook by Henry Allbult (1887)</p> <p>c.            The Hygienic method of family limitation by the Malthusian League (1913)</p> <p>These titles were used to attack the attitude of the government and politicians on matters of family planning or birth regulation in the British Empire.</p> <p>In London, by 1921 following the activities of Mrs. Stopes the first family planning was opened. The British Ministry of health granted labour women resolution to permit local authorities to provide family planning and birth control information and service to those who need them in 1930. In 1966, the British National Health Service accepted a recommendation of the Royal Commission on population that all forms of restriction against contraceptive advice to married women be removed to encourage voluntary parenthood.</p> <p>In the United States of America, at first there were similar political repressive approach to matters of either birth control or contraception.</p> <p>This was more during the period of president Reynold and Roosevelt hence contraceptive and contraceptive information was banned.</p> <p>With the end of the First World War in 1918, signs of change stated to emerge especially during a presidential address by Jacob.</p> <p>The first birth control clinic was established by Margent Sanger in Brooklyn in 1916.</p> <p>Then followed the federal council of the church of Christ publication in 1925 of a report on the status of women. The American Medical Association for the first time accepted family planning as part of medical proactive and education in 1937. Then following in 1942, the formation of the planned parenthood federation of U.S.A. (United State of American).</p> <p>The U.S. supreme court sitting in Connecticut in 1965 struck on the penalty that has been imposed by a statute out the use of contraceptives. There appeared another presidential request by Johnson and Nixon for a congressional support/approval for birth control and family planning activities within the United State (U.S. Times of 19th July, 1969).</p> <p>In Nigeria, the nation of family planning started as a voluntary organisation (through internationally supported with the establishment of clinics in Lagos, Kaduna, and Enugu in 1964 under the umbrella of the Family Planning Council of Nigeria. By 1981, the activities has spread to all states of the Federation including the local government under review.</p> <p>Following a government recognition, there was a change in the name to the Planned Parenthood Federation of Nigeria (P.P.F.N).  </p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Adult education is an important programme that enables adults learners and even young persons to be enlightened about issues in focus. Couples and others who do not expose themselves to adult education programmes especially on family planning, would have the problem of remaining in absolute ignorance and unawareness of the systems inherent in the control of birth rate. Many families who attend certain religious seeks do not avail themselves the opportunity of using contraceptives in order to stop the birth of children, rather they believe that they should not stop God’s creation of children. This enormous belief has created a lot of problems in the society today because people who are not exposed to adult education programme, who are not literate and attend one religion or the other go about having unspaced pregnancies and unguarded child births which has increased the population excessively and thereby causing inflation in the society.</p> <p>A meaningful family planning scheme can only be possible where couples and individuals are willing to adopt to change in modern family planning practices.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The major purpose of the study is to investigate the influence of adult education on family planning, a case study of Ikeja Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p>Other specific objectives include to:</p> <p>(1)         Find out whether there is significant influence of adult education on family planning.</p> <p>(2)         Determine whether those who exposed themselves to adult education programme on family planning have the problem of abortion or not.</p> <p>(3)         Examine the difference between the family planning system of those who are exposed to adult education and those who do not.</p> <p>(4)         Identify the types of contraceptives for family planning.</p> <p>(5)         Find out the effectiveness or failure of some contraceptives as methods of family planning.</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions will be raised in this study:</p> <p>1.            Will there be any influence of adult education on family planning among couples?</p> <p>2.            How can we determine the difference between the family planning of those exposed to adult education and those who are not?</p> <p>3.            How can we identify the types of family planning and contraceptives?</p> <p>4.            What are the effectiveness or failure of some contraceptives as methods of family planning?</p> <p>5.            How can the problems of family planning be solved?</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong><strong>Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The following hypotheses will be formulated in this study:</p> <p>1.            Adult educational programme will not significantly influence family planning among couples.</p> <p>2.            The socio-economic status of couples will not have any significant effect on their level of family planning.</p> <p>3.            Religious belief of couples will not have any significant relationship with their level of family planning.</p> <p>4.            There will be no significant difference between the attitude of the educated couples towards family planning and those who are illiterates.</p> <p><strong>1.7</strong><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study will be beneficial to the following:</p> <p>2.            <strong>Teachers:</strong> The findings and recommendations of study will go a long way in helping the school teachers to have better understanding on the use of contraceptives and other effective systems or methods of family planning.

The study attempts to unravel the causes, effects and remedies to child abuse among secondary school students in Lagos State. It was carried out in Bariga Local Government Area of Lagos State. A sample of 100 was randomly drawn from selected secondary schools in the local government and questionnaires were administered to the respondents. The mean percentage test, which was adopted in the study’s analysis, indicated that excessive battering of a child by parents/teacher/guidance; broken homes, child hawking before and after school and unconducive learning environment are all causes of child abuse. Also, it was found that child abuse negatively affects child’s school performance; such abused children are vulnerable to early pregnancy. Ill treatment as well causes permanent and life-long trauma, thereby making children develop low cognition to school subjects. The preaching of good morals by religious leaders to parents and guardians was part of the recommendations made in this study. Also, melting out punishment in form of fine on erring parents/guidance especially those forcing their children to hawk, and prevention from bad for peer influence will help eliminate or reduce to the barest minimum the incidence of child abuse among secondary school students.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Child abuse and neglect are fastly becoming universal phenomena in the current world societies despite the fact the child’s rights are being recognized and even to some extent, protected by legislations and constitutions in many countries of the world. Childhood abuse potentially has major economic implications for Nigerian schools and for their students. Even conservative estimates suggest that at least 8 percent of U.S. children experience sexual abuse before age 18, while 17 percent experience physical abuse and 18 percent experience physical neglect (Flisher, Kramer, Hoven, &amp; Greenwald, 2007). Childhood maltreatment, and aversive parenting practices, in general, has the potential to delay the academic progress of students (Shonk &amp; Cicchetti, 2001). It therefore has the potential to undermine schools’ ability to satisfy standards of school progress entailed in the No Child Left Behind legislation (U.S. Department of Education, 2005), putting them at risk for loss of federal funding. It also has the potential to adversely affect students' economic outcomes in adulthood, via its impact on achievement in middle and high school (Cawley, Heckman, &amp; Vytlacil, 2001).</p> <p>Child abuse has been defined by the African network for the prevention and protection against child Abuse and Neglect (ANPPCAN) as the intentional and unintentional acts which endanger the physical, health, emotional, moral and the educational welfare of the child. Hopper (2004) also described child abuse as any act of maltreatment or subjection that endangers a child’s physical, emotional and health development.</p> <p>Gelles, (2007) affirmed that child abuse include not only physical assault but also malnourishment, abandonment, neglect, emotional abuse and sexual abuse.</p> <p>According to Mba (2002), prominent form of child abuse in Nigeria are child battering, child labour, child abandonment, neglect, teenage prostitution, early marriage and forced marriage. Kolander (2000) stated that emotional and sexual abuses are highly noticeable in Nigeria. Oji (2006) observed that babies born by teenage mothers in Nigeria were 625,024 as at the reporting time.</p> <p>According to Walsh (2005), unwanted pregnancy has been identified to be a major cause of child abuse in Nigeria. Many abused children were unwanted in the first place and turned out to be a severe burden on their emotionally immature or impoverished parents. Odey (2003) stated that children from poor homes are more vulnerable to abuse and Todd, (2004) in his support said that Nigeria, which is known as corrupt nation in Africa is heading towards a dangerous poverty where its teeming population does not have enough food for healthy living. Oluwole (2002) equally lamented when analyzing the situation of children which are being used for house helps. Child labour is the major obstacles to the achievement of education for all (EFA) and this result into a setback on the achievement of the world target of universal primary education by 2015.</p> <p>According to Onye (2004), child abuse is an evidence of poverty. Aderinto and Okunola (2008) equally recorded that some children reported that they were pushed into street hawking for maintenance needs of the family. That means that they are the breadwinners of their various families at their early age. It is a common sight in major parks and streets in Nigeria to see children of school age between 6-16 years as bus/taxi mates, hawking wares, pushing trucks for money or begging for money when they are supposed to in the classroom learning in the schools. All these point to the fact that the worst hit groups are children who are at the risk of diseases, exploitation, neglect and violence.</p> <p>Although, the potential impact of child   abuse is large, but evidence of causal effects of maltreatment on children's longer term outcomes in school is generally lacking. The current state of evidence for a link between childhood maltreatment (physical and sexual abuse or neglect) and school performance is limited to negative associations between maltreatment and school performance. On average, children who are abused receive lower ratings of performance from their school teachers, score lower on cognitive assessments and standardized tests of academic achievement, obtain lower grades, and get suspended from school and retained in grade more frequently (Erickson, Egeland, &amp; Pianta, 2003). Abused children are also prone to difficulty in forming new relationships with peers and adults and in adapting to norms of social behavior (Shields, Cicchetti and Ryan, 2004). Although, these examples of negative associations between child abuse and school performance are suggestive of causal effects, they could be spuriously driven by unmeasured factors in families or neighborhoods that are themselves correlated with worse academic outcomes among children (Todd and Wolpin, 2003).</p> <p>In addition, not much of the previous evidence linking childhood maltreatment to worse school performance generalizes well to older children in middle and high school and to children not already identified as needing services. Evidence of the impacts of maltreatment on academic performance in the general population of middle and high school students is needed to establish evidence of effects on schooling attainment in the general education population and on economic outcomes in adulthood.</p> <p>Using a large dataset of United State of American (U.S.A) adolescent sibling pairs, this study explores effects of maltreatment-neglect, physical aggression, and sexual abuse on adolescents’ performance in middle and high school. First, the questions of how childhood maltreatment theoretically could negatively affect later school performance, and of how unobserved family background and neighborhood characteristics might influence ordinary least squares and fixed effects regression estimates of relationships between childhood maltreatment and later school performance, are discussed. Second, empirical estimates from models that controlled for observable and unobservable family and neighborhood characteristics are presented.</p> <p><strong>1.2    Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>Grill (2009) stated that the school can do a lot of things about child abuse since it has a way of affecting the school system. The problem of child abuse have long been existing in Nigeria, and have even become more even devastating to the society has whole. That history of child abuse in BarigaLocal Government Area of Lagos State is as old as the persistence of the phenomenon in Lagos itself cannot be overemphasized. Children suffered all forms of abuse ranging from child battering, child labour, child abandonment, neglect, teenage prostitution, early marriage and forced marriage. And in most cases, the parents are even at the centre of the root cause of all these social maltreatment.  The school though, as an agent of socialization portends  to have a strong and overwhelming influence on the development of the  child, but observation has shown that these essence of  education could probably be defeated if  the children are made to continually suffer  the pains of  child labour (Martins 2010). This study however, centers on the extent to which the school has been involved in its attempt to develop the child within the social context of child abuse. And It is in the light of these, that the study attempts to unravel the major causes of child abuse and how it affects the child’s educational performance.</p> <p><strong>1.3            Purpose of Study</strong> </p> <p>This research project has its main objectives the problem of finding out the effect of child abuse on the academic performance of secondary school student in Bariga Local Government Area of Lagos State.

This study is significant as the findings will be beneficial to parents, guardians, teachers, school heads and all other stakeholders in the educational sector, as they will be better enlightened on the problems associated with child abuse.  Such knowledge may curtail any further action of exploiting the child especially been used as object of raising family economy. Hawking no doubt expose the child to many social vices, thus the fact that the study attempts to create a model for proper upbringing of the child in the society makes it justifiable.</p> <p><strong>1.6    Delimitation/Scope of study</strong></p> <p>The study laid emphasis on the effect of child abuse and how it affects the academic performance of the child using secondary schools in Bariga Local Government Area as case study.</p> <p><strong>1.7    Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>The following terms are defined for the essence of this work:</p> <p>1.       <strong>Child Abuse</strong>: harsh or ill treatment melted on any child; it could be by physical pre emotional means.</p> <p>2.       <strong>Physical Abuse</strong>: any form of corporal punishment melted on a child by his parent, teacher or guardian.</p> <p>3.       <strong>Neglect</strong>: paying no attention, not given enough care, to leave undone what need to be done.</p>\n\nINFLUENCE OF CHILD ABUSE ON THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INFLUENCE OF CHILD ABUSE ON THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS ", "id": 21}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study attempted to examine the influence of mate selection and self-disclosure on marital stability among couples in Lagos State.</p> <p>The descriptive research design was used in the study. The questionnaire was used to assess the opinions of the selected respondents with the collection of relevant data from them, while the sampling technique was used to select the sample size of the study.</p> <p>A total of 120 (One hundred and twenty) respondents were selected by the application of the stratified sampling technique.

Furthermore, the findings showed that no significant gender difference exists in self-disclosure among couples, and it was finally found that there is no significant difference in marital stability between couples who disclosed themselves and those who did not. All the hypotheses were tested at 0.05 level of significance. Two null hypotheses were accepted and two were rejected.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0       Introduction</p> <p>1.1    Background to the Study</p> <p>The choice of a mate is a problem that human beings share with most other animals, because successful reproduction is central to natural selection. Peahens choose among most attractive peacocks, female elephant seals and even promiscuous chimpanzees exercise choice about their chimps with which they will be promiscuous (Broude, 1994). In every human society in the world, methods have been evolved for people to pair up and eventually get married in order to establish their own families. For most of the societies, this process was largely controlled by parents and kins in early days. Parents usually had direct control through strong community and kinship networks that exerted pressure on youths to conform to traditional norms. Only few societies, if there is any, allow young people to choose partners without the approval of parents and/or other relatives. It is when people remain in their communities or places of birth, that the bond of strong kin, networks is crucial in mate selection (Ekiran, 1996). Although mate selection process was once controlled by parents, it has now become much a matter of personal choice by the young lovers.</p> <p>Blossfed (1994), identified some methods of mate selection among individuals which include:</p> <p>a.       Arranged method of mate selection.</p> <p>b.       Self-selection  method.</p> <p>c.       Mate selection by friends.</p> <p>d.       Mate selection through others.</p> <p>According to Blossfed, parents choose spouses. Bankole (1991) observed that the general practice is for a father to look for a girl for his son to marry. the preliminary steps usually begin around puberty. According to Fadipe (1990) the usual age for girl’s betrothal start from ten years. Sometimes girls are said to have been marked out from childhood as intended wife for a particular young man with or without her knowledge. This however, may begin as a kind of joke between the two families involved, but with time the intention becomes more serious and often times, results to marriage.  According to Fadipe (1990), this method of mate selection is true of the Yoruba people of the South-West Nigeria, and other ethnic groups in the nation during the early days.</p> <p>As Adesomoju (2000) puts it, when an individual chooses his or her marital partner, this could be regarded as the self-selection method. This method was very uncommon in the early days, although it seldomly happened. Self-choice is the most prevailing method today. This is because since young people in search of higher education and better employment opportunities leave the rural areas for the urban centres, they are largely out of the control of their parents and as such, they choose marital partners by themselves. The factors at work can be summed up as: a change in economy, the decline of rural areas, the rapid growth of some occupations and the decline of others, the lure of the cities, the new opportunities far from home, the importance of education, and the relative emancipation of women, all of which led young men and women to seek more independence from their parents. Self-selection method is more pronounced among remarried couples than first marriage couples.</p> <p>In his study, Adeleke (2001) observed that friends can select spouses for their friends which usually leads to marriage. According to him, this method of mate selection is common either now or in the early days. This method of mate selection is a feature of urban life, and it is carried out by a friend who wants to matchmake his/her friend with another individual or friend. It is carried out through introduction of man to a woman or vice-versa by a friend. This is common among colleagues at the work places or business associates. This is particularly true of people who have gone through the bitter experience and stress of disappointment. Mates can be selected through others such as the pastors, marriage counsellors and or seminar leaders or family.</p> <p>As Sidney (1991) puts it, self—disclosure as a phenomenon was first investigated by Jourard (1971). The process was originally defined as telling others about the self. Since then, an extensive amount of information about disclosure has been produced, leading to significant shifts in the way we think about the phenomenon – self-disclosure. One change has been to consider disclosure as a process of revealing and concealing private information. Making this change, raises many questions about how people decide to disclose or remain private and helps us better understand the process within romantic relationships, marriage, and families (Burgron, 1982, Holtgraves, 1990; Petronio, 1991, 2000).</p> <p>According to Cutrona (1996), many people disclose themselves to their mates before marriage, this disclosure has in some instances caused them their marriage. For example, when a mate either man or woman discloses that he/she has a terminal disease like HIV/AIDS, the attitude of the other partner in any case changes, in most cases, negatively. People do not want their mates to be infested with such illness as HIV/AIDS. Also, a case where a mate has married before and had children before the current marriage, if the previous marital activity was disclosed, there would be attitudinal change or reaction which may not augur well with the relationship.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>There are many problems surrounding mate selection and self-disclosure among couples in the contemporary societies. Marriages have hit the rock these days due to wrong mate selections. For instance, couples have divorced because their spouses lack compatibility with them among other factors which they discovered in the lives of their partners. This is because human attitude is unpredictable and people, especially spouses have been disappointed due to negative attitude of their partners. And this has led to separation or divorce.</p> <p>Couples have course to divorce due to sudden knowledge of their spouses’ ugly past. For instance, marriages have been broken due to knowledge of one’s spouse’s terminal sickness or history of family illness and other bad incidences that run in a particular family of one’s spouse.</p> <p>For the above reasons, the researcher attempted to investigate the influence of mate selection and self-disclosure on marital stability among couples.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of the study is to investigate the influence of mate selection and self-disclosure on marital stability among couples.</p> <p>The specific objectives of the study include:</p> <p>(1)         To examine whether mate selection has relationship with marital stability among couples.</p> <p>(2)         To investigate whether self-disclosure affects marital stability among couples.</p> <p>(3)         To assess the marital stability of couples who disclosed their secrets and those who did not.</p> <p>(4)         To evaluate the marital stability of couples as a result of mate selection process.</p> <p>(5)         To find out whether there is gender difference in self-disclosure among couples.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions were raised in this study.</p> <p>(1)         To what extent will mate selection influence marital stability among couples?</p> <p>(2)         Will self-disclosure affect marital stability among couples?</p> <p>(3)         Will the marital stability of couples be affected by their self-disclosure?</p> <p>(4)         Will there be gender difference in self-disclosure among couples?</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong>Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The following research hypotheses were formulated to guide the conduct of the study.</p> <p>(1)         There will be no significant relationship between mate selection and couples marital stability.</p> <p>(2)         There will be no significant relationship between self-disclosure and marital stability among couples.</p> <p>(3)         There will be no significant gender difference in self-disclosure among couples.</p> <p>(4)         There will be no significant difference in marital stability between couples who disclosed themselves to their partners and those who did not.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study will be beneficial to the following individuals:</p> <p>(1)         Couples would benefit from the findings and recommendations of this study.

The instrument has reliability co-efficient of 0.76 when tested during the pilot study. The statistical tool used to test the hypotheses was Pearson product Moment Correlation and t-test . Four hypotheses were tested, three was rejected and one was accepted. The result showed that there was significant relationship between parental socio-economic status and students’ academic performance. Also, there was a significant gender difference on academic performance of male in intact family. Based on the above findings recommendation were made that counsellors should provide the necessary  assistance and psychological support for students from single parent family so as to overcome emotional problems among others. </em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The need for the presence of parents in a child’s life cannot be over emphasized as it goes a long way in ensuring the academic achievement of the student’s in school. Parents presence tends to influence the performance of their children or wards in school either positively or negatively. Separation of parents and the resulting emotional instability in the home are likely to affect the academic achievement of their children. Recent research has shown that separation of parents occur when relationship between the parents had broken down or because of migration of either parents, from one geographical location to another i.e not staying within the same geographical location.</p> <p>Bong (2008), showed that parents had little or no relationship with their children especially when they were young. Some children have both parents living together while in some homes, children lived with only their mothers or their fathers or even care takers or care givers or guardians as a result of the separation of their parents. Fathers separate from their children earlier and for longer periods than mothers, mostly because of a breakdown of relationship with the mothers. But separation could also be due to migration, death and abandonment.</p> <p>However, migration seems to be one of the main reasons why mothers leave their children. They could also separated from their children for financial reasons and sometimes in these circumstances, the child might either be given to someone with better resources or left in the care of someone while they seek work elsewhere. The mothers too may leave the home because of breakdown in relationship with fathers.</p> <p>Winston (2009), said \"It would be the ideal situation to have both parents in the home, but often, this is not the case but there is nothing that can be done about it, as there are factors such as migration, death, and breakdown of relationships to consider,\". Same problems emanated from parental separation which could lead to frustration, isolation of children and sometimes the students may be forced to exhibit temper tantrums while in the classrooms. The students anger, sadness and frustrated may justify the way they behave because the children hope that after they must have returned from school and wishes to play, no one would be available to play with them, in addition to periods of sadness and behavioural problems, parental separation could also contribute to changes in academic performance and success for secondary school students.</p> <p>Parental separation tends to affect the development of children of which educational development is inclusive. However, the academic achievement of students could be attributed to the influence of both parents. A lot of outstanding members of society have come from singled parent homes and even from foster homes where no parents were present.</p><p>     </p> <p>Since parental separation has an influence on the academic performance of adolescents, it is advisable that parents should sit down with their child and break the news about the separation if there be need. It has been noted that parental separation may result into a divorce and it becomes hard on the whole family. Hence the need for every member of the family to get used to the change in the family dynamic, as well as children coming to terms with the fact that mum and dad aren’t together anymore.</p> <p>The restructuring of families that occurs after a separation requires several adjustments for children, according to the Early Childhood Australia website. Transitioning between homes, especially homes where children are exposed to a lot of parental conflict, can be particularly detrimental. For example, if an adolescent goes back and forth between homes and must also listen to parents fighting or talking negatively about one another, it can cause the child lesser time to do homework and study. Newly separated parents might ask adolescents and teens to pitch in around the house more often, such as babysitting younger siblings, which also gets in the way of studying. Problems might also be so distracting that the child isn't able to concentrate and pay attention at school.</p> <p>A separation might mean the child has to move and enroll in a new school. This change in routine can interfere with a child's ability to concentrate in class and do his best in school work. In fact, this instability can impair developmental growth in general. According to a 2007 article published in \"American Sociological Review.\" Many adolescents tend to pull away from their parents during a separation. Pickhardt (2009), opines that if there be a separation from parents, a child might not want to approach parents for comfort or to discuss the transitions, leaving him without a support system as he navigates his new school and tries to do his schoolwork.</p> <p>Children who experience two drastic transitions during childhood, such as parents separation and move to a new school, tends to get lower grades and score lower on achievement tests than children who have no such transitions or only one transition. Among adolescents, just one such major transition raises the risk that the child will drop out of school, the same journal reports. Most children of separated or divorced parents live with their mothers, which can be especially hard on boys who need a father figure. Boys who have fathers who continue spending enough time with them tend to get better grades than boys with absent fathers.</p> <p>Parental separation doesn't automatically doom an adolescent to poor grades and lower test scores. Children who continue having warm, close relationships with their parents tend to fare better academically than a child who doesn’t. Further, children who were previously living in a home where parents fought or were abusive toward one another tended to do better with the separation because their home life became more stable. In the end, an adolescent's academic success likely isn't harmed, despite separation, if he has a stable home life and involved parents.</p> <p>The period of adolescence which most students pass through is very important to the development of an individual. Any laxity on the part of the parents in assisting and guiding the adolescents may result in academic backwardness and development of unwholesome behaviours, the foundation of what a person becomes in the society is laid in the home and at the initial stage of life. Parents therefore have important roles to play in seeing to it that the youths acquire the appropriate social, psychological, moral and academic development.</p> <p>In Nigeria, among the Yorubas for example, the parental roles are culturally determined. Maternal role is that of childcare and home making while the paternal role is that of economic responsibilities and discipline of children. Generally, it is the responsibility of the family, to train and bring up the child in the norms and values of the society. They are to be responsible for the psychological and emotional welfare of the child. The parents are mainly responsible for the educational and career development of their children. However, divorce and separation of various kinds or death of one spouse may leave the roles in the hands of a single parent. A considerable amount of research has recognized the importance of social contexts in determining engaging school behaviour of adolescents. In general, the emphasis has been placed on three different socialization agents, namely family, teachers and peers (Fredricks, Blumenfeld &amp; Paris, 2004; Simons-Morton &amp; Chen, 2009; Stewart, 2007). In their article, they focus on the family as it is often considered as the most important socialization agent for youngsters (Grusec &amp; Davidov, 2007; Hillaker, Brophy-Herb, Villarruel, &amp; Haas, 2008). Driven by the sharp increase in family instability, the question is raised whether this would have lasting negative consequences on school outcomes of adolescents, as education is considered the key factor in determining the long-term economic success of adolescents. Living in a non intact family makes adolescents more likely to be less engaged and detached from school and work (Brown, 2004; Hess, 2010).</p> <p>Education is becoming more and more one of the most important social cleavages within society, as it clearly divides the haves from the have-nots (Berlin, Furstenberg, &amp; Waters, 2010). Individuals with a higher educational degree have more chances at the labour market, whereas those with a lower educational degree struggle more to find a job and often have a lower occupational status and income (Pong, 1997; Amato, 2005). For adolescents, school forms one of the most important life spheres. Next to their home and family, adolescents spend most of their time at school, because education forms a clear stratifying mechanism in society, school outcomes of youngsters are important to investigate. They signal the future position of adolescents within society. Whereas the objective school outcomes for adolescents have been studied abundantly (Astone &amp; Mclanahan, 1994; Bean, 1985; Evans, Kelley, &amp; Wanner, 2001), the more subjective school outcomes are equally important to investigate (Van Houtte, 2004).</p> <p>These latter types of school outcomes are in the same way part of their school experience that forms them and leads to several consequences within their current and later life (Johnson, Crosnoe, &amp; Elder, 2001). To illustrate, disengaged students will have lower academic and career aspirations, which can limit their career options (Finn &amp; Rock, 1997; Kenny, Blustein, Chaves, Grossman, &amp; Gallagher, 2003).</p> <p>Adolescents difficulties in school often originate outside the school environment. This therefore placed emphasis on parental separation as a factor that influences adolescents academic performance. They examined the subjective outcome of school engagement that considers whether adolescents are concerned with their studies, if they are inquisitive and eager to learn, or if they dislike school and are averted to their studies. They searched for differences between adolescents in intact and non-intact families. Does growing up in a broken family affect academic performance? Are adolescents who experienced a parental separation differently affected by family contexts when school engagement is analyzed? Answers to these questions would tell the extent to which parental separation can affect the academic performance of adolescents in schools.</p> <p>Single parenting could be defined as a situation in which one of the two individuals, involved in the conception of the child is being responsible for upbringing of the child. Single parenthood may arise when either the male or female decides to produce and rear a child or children outside wedlock. A child from homes where the father and the mother are present will be well taken care of and socialised in the best way possible (Asana, 2008). This is due to the fact that the process of socialization depends on both parents playing complimentary roles in bringing up the child. Such a child is likely to achieve self-actualisation later in life, Children from single-parent homes are likely to suffer deprivation and denial of some rights and opportunities. Adolescents' from-broken homes are usually associated with anti-social behaviour and poor academic records. The problem of deprivation of a second parent is bad enough but when the remaining parent cannot cope with the resultant problems a tragic situation arises. In such a situation, the child becomes a misfit in the society.</p> <p>The family is the first socialising agent the child comes into contact with, it has a great influence on the child's physical, mental and moral development (Brien, 2006). The family lays the foundation of education before the child goes to school and the personality that the child takes to school is determined by the home. It’s important to note that both parents have roles to play in child education. The father is to provide the necessary tools for the educational advancement while the mother is supposed to supplement the father's efforts in this regard. When the father is absent and the mother is not privileged enough to cater for all the basic needs as well as supervised the academic performance of the child he/she (the child) will be backward or withdrawn.</p> <p>The same thing occurs when the mother is absent and the father is not privileged enough (Fisbet, 2005). A single parent faces doubled responsibilities requiring time, attention and money of the parent- Hence, less attention is paid to the education of the child. Teachers commonly describe children from single or separate parents as more hostile, aggressive, anxious, fearful, hyperactive and distractible than children from intact families. Hence, the need to  Investigate the influence of  single parent family on students academic performance, Investigate the influence of parent socio- economic status on students academic performance, Investigate if students from single parent family will performed better than students intact family, Investigate if students gender have any influence on students academic performance to the purpose of study as it goes a long way on student academic achievement.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Often times it is said that a child is a product of his immediate environment and this environment ranges from the physical environment to the social environment to the genetic or biological environment. These environmental factors would to a large extent determine the behavioural pattern of these children of which the attitude to their academics would not be left out. Needless to say that the family as an agent of socialization in the environment has an effect on the academic performance of adolescents because the kind of family one comes from affects his or her academic performance.</p> <p>The school performance of students could be traced back to their homes as we view that the home is the first point of call for every individual so any way an individual is raised from the home whether by a single parent or both parents would most likely affect the academic achievement of the children.</p> <p>Separation of parents from children tends to pose a serious threat to attainment of their educational goals since they (the children affected) lack the necessary parental role or care from parents. This is a problem that needs to be addressed so as to avoid any possible backwardness in academic attainment of students concerned.</p> <p>There are many students within our school system that come from single parent or separated parent families. Due to the many issues that stems from such family model, some students are unable to reach their full potential. As such parent model rapidly becomes the norm, it is necessary to find a way to address these issues so as to provide students and parents with solutions to help them achieve or perform to their highest ability.</p> <p>In essence, separation of parents may be caused by various factors such as geographical location, nature of family, parental socio-economic status to family size and parents wish among others.</p> <p>It is therefore a necessity that for any separation to occur, caution should be taken to avert the level of negative effect it could have on a student affected.</p> <p>It is against this backdrop that a study of this magnitude becomes imperative with a view to investigate the effect of parental separation on academic achievement of students in some selected secondary schools in Education District II in Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The major objective of this study is to investigate the influence of parental separation on the academic achievement of secondary schools students  in Lagos Educational District II.

This study also hopes to inform and guide parents on the need to maintain their homes as separation could have adverse effects on children. In addition, this study would also seek to enlighten students on the effect parental separation and socio-economic status of parents would have on their academic performance.</p> <p><strong>Operational Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Parent</strong>:                 Parents are caretakers of the offspring in their own specie i.e. one who takes care of his/her biological children.</p> <p><strong>Guardian</strong>:             Guardians are people who by appointment or by relationship have the care a person.</p> <p><strong>Adolescent</strong>:          An adolescent is child between childhood and adulthood usually between the ages of 10 and 19.</p> <p><strong>Adolescence</strong>:        This is a transitional state of physical and psychological human development that generally occurs during the period from puberty to legal adulthood.</p> <p><strong>Parenting</strong>:            This is the process of promoting and supporting the physical, emotional, social, and intellectual development of a child from infancy to adult hood.</p> <p><strong>Separation</strong>:          The condition of being apart, especially the condition of two peoplewho had lived together or been married living in different places</p>                                                             \n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF PARENTAL SEPARATION ON ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE INFLUENCE OF PARENTAL SEPARATION ON ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS", "id": 23}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study was conducted to find out the perception of drug use and abuse on student’s behavior in public secondary schools in Lagos State.</p> <p>Chapter one presented the background of study which consists of statement of the problem, research questions, research hypothesis, significance of the study, purpose of the study, delimitation, limitations as well as definition of term.

Despite worldwide concern and education about psychoactive substances, self medication and misuse of illicit drugs, many adolescents have limited awareness of their adverse consequence.</p> <p>Drug use is as old as the history of human race people have used herbs, roots, barks, leaves and all kinds of plant to relieve pain and help control disease. When drugs are properly administered, they become a blessing to human beings. It should, however, be noted that some drugs unfortunately produce enticing side effects such as a sense of feeling good, elation serenity and power such that what began as means of relaxation evolved in time into a problem of  dependence and abuse.  (Karechrio,1996). Drug can be defined as a substance that is purposely introduced into the body to change normal body functions.  Drug abuse explains the persistent excessive use of chemicals or substance for any reason other than its acceptable medical purpose. The influence of drugs is on the students behavior has been documented. Kaire (2005), noted that drug abuse have been identified as a major cause of unrest in public secondary school leading to poor performance in exams and mass drop  outs of students from secondary schools.</p> <p>Tabifor (2000), explains that drug addiction creates an enabling environment for violence as it gives the abuser a false sense of greatness and power. Curiosity, social pressure and peer group influence are reported to be primary reasons for substance misuse. Most often the student of public secondary schools starts by experimenting with the so called “GATEWAYDRUGS” such as tobacco, alcohol and marijuana. Drug abuse  also refers to the use of usually self administration or any drug in a manner that deviate from approved medical; pattern or with a given culture, in which cause the use of medically prescribed drugs such as barbiturate to induce Dulphoria  in social situation would be abuse on drugs. Drugs mainly abused as stimulant like Amphamine sedative and tranquilizers like Barbiturates, Valium and Mandrase Hauvelnogens. These drugs do not only have mild altering capacity but they may often be harmful.</p> <p>The world drug report (2011), reports that a total 0f 190 million people consume drugs and alcohol world wide and the majority of these are youths. Bennet.et al, 1991 observes that alcohol, tobacco and marijuana are the most common consumed substances by the adolescent (boys and girls) across the globe. Njuki (2004), maintains that there are many issues confronting Africa such as drug abuse which is not looked at with the seriousness it deserves. He observed that illicit drug-trafficking and drug abuse are increasing in Africa. Cannabis, methaqualone, heroin and alcohol are included among drugs used across the continent of Africa, Moreover, the injection of heroin has caused heightened concern as intravenous drug use assists in the continued spread of HIV/AIDS (Njuki , 2004). Ministry of Education (1996), made strategies in order to promote the boy’s and girls health ad their well being. They introduced regular health check in all schools and the prevention of drugs and alcohol use In its institution. Further, the ministry of Education has established guidance and counseling departments in schools which deal with cases of guiding and counseling the learners  when they fail victims of unwanted behaviours (Ministry  of Education, 1996).</p> <p>In Nigeria, earlier studies on students drug use were largely hospital based and confined to selected regions of the country however, in the  past 10  - 15 years such studies have taken the form of field work employing epidemiology techniques so as to provide more comprehensive information related to types, pattern of use and psycho-social correlates in drug use and abuse among secondary school students. From such studies it has been consistently found the alcohol, hypnosedatives, tobacco and psycho stimulants were the commonly abused substances with varying prevalence rates found for both overall and specific drug use. For instance  in Ilorin, Nigeria, the lifetime prevalence  rate  if drug use among secondary students was found to vary between 1.5% (for tobacco and 57% for psycho stimulants). In Sokoto, the reported prevalence rates were 10.9% - 17.8% among secondary school students and 19.5% - 50.7%. some authors in the country have raised the possibility of students under reporting their substance use habits, most especially the illicit ones for instance in a study in south west, Nigeria it was observed that although cannabis related psychiatric disorders are common among students in  Nigeria  psychiatric clinics, substance  use studies in the country have reported low use of cannabis amongst secondary school students. This could be due to denial  because of legal consequence associated with its use.</p> <p>Lagos, the former capital of Nigeria remains about the most populous city in the country and since the work of anymonys over 3 decades ago, changes that could increase the risk of substance use among school students have occurred these include a surge in population, increased numbers of street youths (mostly secondary school drop outs) popularly known as “area boys” and an attendant high crime rate. However, despite these persistent psychosocial problems in lagos, there is a paucity  of current literature available on drug use among secondary school students in the city.</p> <p>This study sets out to assess drug use and abuse on students behavior in public secondary schools in Lagos state. To find out types of drug and when a drug is said to be abused. Highlight some of cause of drug use and abuse, it effects on the public secondary school students.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Recent events in the attitude of students in secondary schools show that abnormal behaviour are the aftermath of the students on drugs. The truancy rate, absenteeism, cultism act, hooliganism, bullying is rampant in these  cadre or schools. Public secondary schools engage themselves in school to school street fighting and the researcher wonder the impact of drugs</p> <p><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of the study is to determine the relationship between drug use and abuse on students behaviour.</p> <p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research question will be formulated for this study</p> <p>1.     Will drug abuse influence gangsterism among secondary school students?</p> <p>2.     Will drug abuse affect the health of students in secondary schools?</p> <p>3.     Will drug abuse cause students to exhibit violent behaviour?</p> <p>4.     To what extent will self medication affect the health of students in secondary schools?</p> <p>5.     Will drug abuse contribute to hooliganism in secondary schools?</p> <p><strong>Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The following research hypotheses were tested in this study.</p> <p>1.     Drug abuse will not significantly influence gangsterism among secondary school students.</p> <p>2.     Drug abuse will not significantly affect the health of students in secondary schools.</p> <p>3.     Drug abuse will not significantly cause students to exhibit violent behaviours in secondary schools.</p> <p>4.     Self medication will not significantly affect the health of students in secondary schools.</p> <p>5.     Drug abuse will not significantly contribute to hooliganism among secondary school students.</p> <p><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>1.     The findings of this study might provide public secondary schools in Lagos State with the knowledge on the effects of drug use and abuse  on student behaviour.</p> <p>2.     This study might help in increasing the awareness on how drug abuse affects the health of the students and individuals.</p> <p>3.     The findings from this study might enlighten the students and teachers on the effects of self medications, drug misuse and the usefulness of prescribed drugs. </p> <p><strong>Delimitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>This original scope of this study is very wide due to the large number of public secondary schools in

factor in marital stability, in carrying out this study,Questionnaire on the Attitude of Mother-in-law towards Daughters-in-law as a Determinant of Marital Stability (QAMDDMS) was developed and percentage, mean and chi-square at 0.05 level of significant were used to test the hypotheses. The results of the study show that the communication patterns of daughter-in-law from different cultural backgrounds; communication and attitude of daughter-in-law with different educational background and also socioeconomic background all have significant influence on the attitude of daughters-in-law towards mother-in-law. The implication for policy and practice respectively drawn from the study are that: spouse family should be aware of individual differences before marriage or else the marriage could be heading to disaster. The study highlighted the needs for further study on teachers’ gender; effectiveness and teaching styles on students’ performance. </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Marriage is the legal relationship between a husband and a wife (Hornby 2007). It is a process where a man and a woman agree to have a life contract between each other mostly with the aim of procreation and self development. Marriage is also an agreement between two families to join their children together as husband and wife just as an African saying that you don’t marry a person, you marry a family. The institutions of marriage and family are inevitably intertwined. When two people choose to get married, they are also choosing the integration of two families (Lau, 2005).</p> <p> Sociologically, what marriage is all about is the integration of two families. After marriage, her family and his family will likely come to be considered jointly as “our folks”. That is the intended meaning of marriage. In practical terms, a brother-in-law is treated as a brother, a sister-in-law is treated as a sister, and a mother-in-law is treated as one’s own mother (Byng-Hall, 2008).</p> <p> The US Bureau of the Census (2006) defines the term family as “a group of two persons or more (one of whom is the householder) related by birth, marriage, or adoption, and residing together.  This is because the social relationships called family is such an important part of the society. In fact no society has existed without some sort of social arrangements Family relationships are never fixed; they change as the self and the significance of other family members grow older, and as the changing society influences their respective lives (Riley, 2008). Family experts report that in reality the most difficult relationship is the one between the mother-in-law and her daughter-in-law. Conflicts between wives and their mothers-in-law do not just happen. They need an arena, just as germs and viruses need an environment to breed (Lau, 2005). There must first be a common area in which both the wife and her mother-in-law are in constant contact. If the wife and her mother-in-law do not meet each other at all and each of them just lives her own life, there would, in theory, be no problem at all between them, because there is no contact. No contact, no conflict. It’s as simple as that. It is like saying if there were no marriages, there would be no divorces (Philips, 2005).</p> <p>“When you play badminton or tennis, there is hardly any chance of you crashing into your opponent unless you are playing like a chimpanzee. This is because each of you has your own court. When you play a game like squash, however, you have to be very careful not to crash into your opponent, or smash his head with your racquet” Lau, 2005.  The interaction between the wife and her mother-in-law is like the game of squash, where there are lots of opportunities for both players to be in contact with and crash into each other (Silverstein, 2012).</p> <p>When intergenerational conflicts occur, it typically involves the wife and her mother-in-law. In fact, in-law trouble has been characterized as a “female problem”, perhaps because women have traditionally shouldered the responsibility for maintaining kinship ties (Marotz-Baden &amp; Cowan, 2007). Fischer (2008) found that wives tend to turn to their own mothers for help after giving birth. Yet they may regard their mother-in-law’s concern over her new grandchild as “interference”.</p> <p>The mother-in-law/daughter-in-law impasse has never given birth to any good, dividing women who have much in common and who could benefit from one another’s friendship. It causes great unhappiness to mother-in-law, who feels her overtures of friendship are rebuffed, and who fear their connection with their son and grandchildren may be threatened by the daughter’s-in-law hostility. It causes distress to the daughter-in-law, who feels judged and pressured, particularly on matters involving her role as a woman in the family (Apter, 2011).</p> <p>Interpersonal communication is an integral part of human experience. Moreover, interpersonal skills are highly relevant to adjustment, because they can be critical to ones happiness and success in life. There is a need to be aware that communication is very important between mother and daughter in law and it can be effective or ineffective depending on what transpires between the speaker and the hearer and care should be taken not be an ineffective communication (Byng-Hall, 2008).</p> <p> Simmel (1955) made another important point by stressing that both conflict and cooperation are ways human beings relate to each other. When there is conflict between the wife and the mother-in-law, this should not create a rift if there is effective communication between the two. If information is shared between the two women at all times as necessary, there will be an understanding of self which will create a positive attitude by the wife towards the mother-in-law.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Strained  relationship is often noticed in many extended families, to the extent that daughter –in-laws often pray that they do not have mothers-in-law, or they don’t want those ones that will live with them. This is often as a result of the treat that mothers-in-law pose to regular running of the family. According to Ilumoye (2011), a lot of homes have been broken as a result of family (mother in law) interference into marriage.</p> <p>  A question to be raised is why daughters-in-law are so sensitive to what they perceive as lapses in a mother’s-in-law recognition of them. The answer may lie in the high demands they put on the response of a mother figure. Indeed, the touchiness or sensitivity often displayed by daughters-in-law to a mother’s-in-law behaviour is close to that of an adolescent’s to her mother (Apter, 2010). Many tensions, too, take place in the broader context of the work/family dilemma that is etched into so many of these women’s lives.</p> <p>The modern couple sees marriage solely as an integration of two individuals-just the husband and the wife. That seems to be the modern perception of a marriage. When the modern couple gets married, they often forget that it is not just a relationship between the two of them that has begun, but the relationship between the husband’s family, no matter how large, and the wife’s family, no matter how large. Problems somehow arise from this modern but much distorted perception of a marriage, because based on it; in-laws do not play important roles. Thus, brothers-in-law are not treated as brothers, sisters-in-law are not treated as sisters and mother-in-law is not treated as mother. When this happens, the relationship has begun on a wrong footing (Duval, 2004).</p> <p><strong>1.3 Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the attitude of mothers-in-law towards daughters-in-law as a determinant of marital stability in selected families in Lagos metropolis. But specifically, the study will among other things seek to:</p> <p>i.       Determine the role of effective communication on the attitude of mothers-in-law towards their daughters-in-law</p> <p>ii.     Discuss the consequences of ineffective communication between mother-in-laws and daughter-in-laws in marital stability,</p> <p>iii.   To recommend ways to improve marital stability.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Research Questions</strong></p> <p>In order to provide direction for this study, the following questions are asked:</p> <p>i.       To what extent does communication style influence the attitude of daughter-in-laws towards their mother-in-laws?</p> <p>ii.     Is there any difference in attitude and communication of daughter-in-laws from different cultural background towards their mother-in-laws?</p> <p>iii.   Do married women with different educational background differ in their communication and attitude towards their mother-in-laws?</p> <p>iv.         Is there any difference of socioeconomic background in attitude of daughters-in-law towards mother-in-law?</p> <p><strong>1.5 Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The following null hypotheses were formulated to guide the study.</p> <p>1.  The communication styles of daughters-in-law will not significantly influence her attitude towards the mother-in-laws.</p> <p>2.  The communication patterns of daughter in law from different cultural backgrounds will not significantly influence their attitude towards their mother-in-law.</p> <p>3.  There will be no significant difference in the communication and attitude of daughter in law with different educational background towards their mother-in-laws.</p> <p>4.  There is no significant effect of socioeconomic background in attitude of daughters-in-law towards mother-in-law.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study is significant because many people will find it useful. Such as:</p> <p>Married women who are having problems with their mother-in-laws will benefit from this study as it will expose them to other peoples experiences and give them insight into solving their own problems.</p> <p>Married men who have to continually mediate between their mother and wife will benefit from this study as it will help to find a way round the problems.</p> <p>Mother-in-laws who have been having a continual conflict with their daughter-in-laws will be able to use this study to resolve their differences.</p> <p>Marriage counsellors, psychologists and clergymen will also find this work beneficial in their respective fields since they provide both pre-marital and post-marital counselling to couples to be and couples.</p> <p>The society at large will also benefit from this study in the sense that their level of understanding of the conflict that could arise between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is raised and the resolution is provided.</p> <p>It will further be useful for future researchers in related discipline.</p> <p><strong>1.7 Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study will be carried out among married women in Lagos State. It will study the attitude of mother-in-laws towards daughter-in-laws as a determinant factor in marital stability. The limitation of the study is that it will not include single ladies and men in Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.9 Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>The following terms are defined as used in the study:</p> <p><strong>Attitude: </strong>it is an opinion or general feeling about something.

As Awoniyi (1999) puts it, formal education is a process by which the human mind develops through learning at school in stages from pre-primary through primary, secondary to tertiary (university) institution. The present socio-economic situation in Nigeria has made it obvious that the women must be given sound, formal education as their male counterparts are given.</p> <p>According to Lai (1995), in the olden days, a woman had little or no status as a person in her own right. In the Nigerian society, women were viewed as their husbands’ properties, and as such, had no say in the affairs of their own home. The women’s roles were basically those of taking care of their husbands and their children, their in-laws, the family compound, child-bearing and child rearing. Also, her place was believed to be naturally, in the kitchen. However, only few people would deny the functional roles of women in the larger society. Even through the average Nigerian woman still performs her basic traditional roles as a daughter to her parents, sister to her siblings, wife to her husband, mother to her children, daughter or sister inlaw to her husband’s family, she is economically viable, she contributes financially to the up keep of the family.</p> <p>According to Adiele (2000), the education of the girl-child was not a common phenomenon in the traditional Nigerian society before independence. In fact, her birth would not attract so much celebration as that of the male-child, and depending on the number of female children the mother had given birth to before her, the birth of an additional girl-child could cause her mother her marriage. This is still a major problem in some homes even among educated men.</p> <p>Education should be considered as a great line of defence for women faced with life threatening situations that traditional life-styles perpetuate. It opens the door to a lot of choices that are not found by tradition (Nwagwu, 1996). Grange (1997) posits that education encourages shaping one’s destiny. The situation of the educated Nigerian woman steps up beyond the confines of motherhood and enhances the quality of life in her family.</p> <p>Therefore, incessant child-bearing places a woman in a very weak position physically, economically and psychologically, yet barrenness is viewed as a curse in the Nigerian society due to high infantile mortality, the capacity to breed was much valued but advances in the field of medicine have greatly increased the survival rate among both infants and adults. According to Onyeanwu (2001), the incessant child-bearing is therefore, no longer necessary, instead, it poses great danger to the health of the mother and also increased family size that cannot be supported with the family resources, especially now that the Nigerian economy has nose-dived and the resultant effect of unemployment among men in the society.</p> <p>Therefore, to improve the living condition of Nigerian families, the life of the women who are the cornerstone of every household should be improved and the regulation of the size of the regulation of the size of the size of the regulation of the size of the nuclear family, through family planning, cannot be overemphasied (Lai, 1990).</p> <p>There has been a lot of discrimination against the female gender. In fact people just see them as breeding machines, in spite of the availability of family planning. The dissemination of appropriate and relevant information would lead to the acquisition of knowledge skills and women empowerment. This can help in breaking the intractable poverty cycle which many Nigerian families have come to be associated with due to ignorance of family planning devices and the attitude of many women towards the application of such devices.</p> <p>According to Halsall (1997), if women’s health and status remain poor, if their access to land and other facilities continue to be limited and if they continue to be held down by ill-timed or unwanted pregnancies, then the societal development would be retarded.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>Theoretical Framework</strong></p> <p>Family planning refers to the services offered to educate men and women about family life and the encouragement given to them to achieve their wishes with regards to the prevention of unwanted pregnancies, securing desired pregnancies, spacing of pregnancies and limiting the number of children in the interest of overall family and the family socio-economic status (Enudi, 1986).</p> <p>According to Amaechi (2003), the Federal Government released a National Policy on Population for development, unity, progress and self-reliance in 1988 included as part of the policy statement was the promotion of awareness among citizens of this country of population problems and the effect of rapid population growth on development and also the provision to every one of the necessary information and education on the value of reasonable family size, the individual family and the future of the nation on achieving self-reliance.</p> <p>Ajuzie (2000) theorizes that the value of family planning on the stability and the well being of the family need to be taught and the message should reach every woman since we practice the patriarchal family system because some want to oppose the idea of family planning and since men are considered as the head of the family, the decisions regarding the family size and child spacing cannot be taken by the woman alone. The government should not only design but take conscious effort to see to the implementation of enlightenment and educative programme regarding family planning, some of which are:</p> <p>1.            Vaginal douche</p> <p>2.            Diaphragm with cream</p> <p>3.            Cream or jelly alone</p> <p>4.            Use of condom </p> <p>5.            Calendar safe period calculation</p> <p>6.            Intra-urine device (I.U.D.)</p> <p>7.            Use of pills</p> <p>8.            Vasectomu</p> <p>9.            Bilateral tubal ligation (BTL)</p> <p>Each of these methods according to Anyanwu (2004) has its own advantages and disadvantages which should be clearly understood before a choice is made.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>There has been a lot of discrimination against the female gender. In fact, people just see them as breeding machines inspite of the availability of family planning.</p> <p>The dissemination of appropriate and relevant information on family planning would lead to the acquisition of knowledge, skills and women empowerment. This can help to break the intractable poverty cycles that many Nigerian families have come to be associated with due to the ignorance of family planning devices and the attitude of many women towards the application of such devices.</p> <p>According to Halsall (1977) if women’s health and status remain poor, if their access to land and other facilities continues to be limited and if they continue to be held down by lack of information concerning family, unwanted pregnancies and sexual diseases, the societal development would be retarded. Also, the problem that is involved in the negligence of family planning cannot be overemphasized. For example, without family planning there will be population explosion which could bring about shortage of food and other necessary amenities in the country. According to Uzomah (2004), women who do not expose themselves to formal education do not have necessary information, especially on family planning and majority of them have died in their bid to give birth to children.</p> <p>This study therefore, sets out to examine the effect of formal education on the Nigerian women’s attitude towards family planning.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of formal education on the attitude of Nigerian women towards family planning.</p> <p>Other specific objectives of the study include:</p> <p>1.            To ascertain the difference in the attitude of women towards formal education in Nigerian society.</p> <p>2.            To examine whether there is difference in the attitude of women towards family planning.</p> <p>3.            To examine whether difference exists between the attitude of women who have formal education and those who are not.</p> <p>4.            To assess whether there is difference in the level of awareness of family planning of women with formal education and those without formal education.</p> <p>5.            To investigate whether there will be difference in the number of children of women with formal education and the number of children of those without formal education.</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions were posed in this study:</p> <p>1.            Will the attitude of women towards formal education affect their family planning method?</p> <p>2.            How can we ascertain whether there is difference in the attitude of women towards formal education?</p> <p>3.            To what extent can we examine whether there is difference in the attitude of women towards family planning in Nigeria?</p> <p>4.            Is there any difference between the attitude of women who are exposed to formal education and those who are not?</p> <p>5.            Is there difference in the level of awareness of family planning of women with formal education and those without formal education?</p> <p><strong>1.6    Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The following research hypotheses were raised in this study:</p> <p>1.            There will be no significant difference in the attitude of women with formal education to family planning compared to those without formal education.</p> <p>2.            There will be no significant difference in the level of awareness of family planning of women with formal education and those with no formal education.</p> <p>3.            There will be no significant difference in the number of children of women with formal education and the number of children of those without formal education.</p> <p><strong>1.7    Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study will be beneficial in various ways thus: For instance, The government has continued to devote a substantial part of her health-care funds to finance family planning activities with the hope that the adoption of the modern method and give women a better place in the socio-economic sphere. This study therefore, examines the effect of formal education on Nigerian women’s attitude to family planning inspire of various family planning programems and service. The finding and recommendations in this study will be of immense benefit to manpower planning , administrators and other programme executors not only in Lagos Mainland Local Government, but also in Lagos State as a whole. The findings and recommendation of this study will equally be of benefit to the couples and other individuals if they will attempt to implement all or most of the suggestions or recommendations of this study in the interest of women, children and the entire families in Nigeria.</p> <p>The school administrators will no doubt, benefit from the findings and recommendations of this study. Also the benefit from the exposition this study will put them into because they will be able to make allowance for a larger enrolment in the short run. The state government will equally benefit from this study because it will help her to carry out a better projection or expected needs of the state population with a view to raising the per capita income.</p> <p>Finally, this study will be of great benefit to the population commission officials, because it will help them to regulate the child birth rate in the country if the recommendations put across in this study are observed and acted upon.</p> <p>The society, will also benefit from this study because it will be a good reference material to the public, especially adult members of the society. Also students at various levels will find this study a good reference material.</p> <p><strong>1.8</strong><strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study attempted to examine the effect of formal education on the Nigerian women’s attitude to family planning in Mainland Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.9</strong><strong>Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>Operational terms were defined in this study thus:</p> <p>1.            <strong>Fertility Rate:</strong> This is the summation of all the fertility obtained from the age specific rate for each year of child bearing </p>                                                         \n\nTHE EFFECT OF FORMAL EDUCATION ON NIGERIAN WOMEN’S ATTITUDE TOWARDS FAMILY PLANNING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF FORMAL EDUCATION ON NIGERIAN WOMEN’S ATTITUDE TOWARDS FAMILY PLANNING", "id": 26}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The study attempted to investigate the impact of information communication technology (ICT) on educational development of children in early childhood education in selected nursery schools in Mainland Local Government Area of Lagos State. In this study, some relevant and related literatures were reviewed under sub-headings. The descriptive research survey design was applied in the assessment of the opinions of the respondents with the aid of the questionnaire and the sampling technique. A total of 200 (Two hundred) respondents were used in this study. A total of four null hypotheses were formulated and tested in this study with the use of the Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient for hypotheses one and two, while the independent t-test statistical tool was used for hypothesis three and four respectively. All the hypotheses were tested at 0.05 level of significance. At the end of the tests, the following results emerged: that there is a significant effect of the use of ICT on learning of children at preschool, that there is a significant relationship between the use of ICT and teacher’s performance at preschool, that there is a significant relationship between use of ICT and pupils’ learning outcomes at preschool and that there isa significant gender difference in the use of ICT at the preschool level</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>The importance of ICT is quite evident from the educational perspective. Though the chalkboard, textbooks, radio/television and film have been used for educational purpose over the years, none has quite impacted on the educational process like the computer. While television and film impact only on the audiovisual faculties of users, the computer is capable of activating the senses of sight, hearing and touch of the users. ICT has the capacity to provide higher interactive potential for users to develop their individual, intellectual and creative ability. The main purpose of ICT consists just in the development of human mental resources, which allow people to both successfully apply the existing knowledge and produce new knowledge (Shavinina, 2001).</p> <p>The collective and rigid nature of learning and the passive nature of the learning associated with the use of radio, television and film do not contribute any innovative changes to traditional methods in education system. Information and communication technologies are being used in the developed world for instructional functions. Today, computers perform a host of functions in teaching and learning especially as many nations are adding computer literacy, reading and writing literacy skills students will need for succeeding in a technologically developed world (Thomas, 2005). At the instructional level, computers are used by pupils to learn reading, mathematics, social studies, art, music, simulation and health practices.</p> <p>In educational multimedia application, Shavinina (2006) asserted that today’s learning contents are domain-specific products and that they dominate the world market. According to Shavinina (2006), domain-specific educational multimedia is directed to knowledge acquisition skills development in the language arts, history, physics, literature, biology and so on.</p> <p>There is no doubt that ICT provides productive teaching and learning in order to increase children’s creative and intellectual resources especially in today’s information society. Through the simultaneous use of audio, text, multicolor images, graphics, motion, ICT gives ample and exceptional opportunities to the pupils to develop capacities for high quality learning and to increase their ability to innovate.</p> <p>Nigeria cannot afford to lag behind in using multimedia to raise the intellectual and creative resources of her citizens especially the children. This is particularly important for children whose adulthood will blossom in a cyber environment entirely different from that of the present (Shavinina, 2006). Nigerian children need to be taught by radically new educational programme and variety of educational contents with multimedia playing key role (Ayo, 2000).</p> <p>Technology plays a significant role in all aspects of life today, and this role will only increase in the future. The potential benefits of technology for young children’s learning and development are well documented (Wright &amp; Shade, 1994). As technology becomes easier to use and early childhood software proliferates, young children’s use of technology becomes more widespread. Therefore, early childhood educators have a responsibility to critically examine the impact of technology on children and be prepared to use technology to benefit children.</p> <p>Computers supplement and do not replace highly valued early childhood activities and materials, such as art, blocks, sand, water, books, exploration with writing materials, and dramatic play. Research indicates that computers can be used in developmental appropriate ways beneficial to children and also can be misused, just as any tools can (Shade &amp; Watson, 1990). Developmental appropriate software offers opportunities for collaborative play, learning and creation. Educators must use professional judgment in evaluating and using this learning tool appropriately, applying the same criteria they would to any other learning tool or experience. They must also weigh the costs of technology with the costs of other learning materials and programme resources to arrive at an appropriate balance for their classrooms.</p> <p>Computers are intrinsically compelling for young children. The sounds and graphics gain children’s attention. Increasingly, young children observe adults and older children working on computers, and they want to do it. Children get interested because they can make things happen with computers. Developmentally appropriate software engages children in creative play, mastery learning, problem solving, and conversation. The children control the pacing and the action. They can repeat a process or activity as often as they like and experiment with variations. They collaborate in making decisions and share their discoveries and creations (Haugland &amp; Shade, 1990).</p> <p>The teacher’s role is critical in making certain that good decisions are made about which technology to use and in supporting children in their use of technology to ensure that potential benefits are achieved. Teachers must take time to evaluate and choose software in light of principles of development and learning and must carefully observe children using the software to identify both opportunities and problems and make appropriate adaptations. Choosing appropriate software is similar to choosing appropriate books for the classroom, teachers constantly make judgments about what is age appropriate, individually appropriate and culturally appropriate (NAEYC, 1992).</p> <p>Early childhood educators must devote extra effort to ensure that the software in classrooms reflects and affirms children’s diverse cultures, languages, and ethnic heritages. Like all educational materials, software should reflect the world children live in: it should come in multiple languages, reflect gender equity, contain people of color and of differing ages and abilities, and portray diverse families and experiences (Derman-Sparks &amp; A.B.C. Task Force 1989; Haugland &amp; Shade, 1994).</p> <p>As pre-school educators become active participants in a technological world, hence they need in-depth training and ongoing support to be adequately prepared to make decisions about technology and to support its effective use in learning environment for children. Mayor (1997) advocates for teachers to be fully equipped to understand and communicate to both children and adults the skills required to build more sustainable life in a technological changing and highly globalized world. The potentials of technology are far-reaching and ever changing. The risk is for early childhood educators to become complacent, assuming that their current knowledge or experience is adequate. Technology is an area of the curriculum, as well as a tool for learning, in which teachers must demonstrate their own capacity for learning (Bredekamp &amp; Rosegrant, 1994).</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The problem of lack of the application of the information and communication technology (ICT) in the teaching and learning processes at the early childhood education delivery cannot be overemphasized. This is because several factors pose some hindrances to the effective use of ICT for the purpose of teaching pupils at the pre-school level. The major impediments to the successful use of information and communication technology (ICT) in the preschool level include: the high cost of computers in the developing countries; weak infrastructure that has caused deficiency in the use of computer; lack of skills and human knowledge to integrate ICT into teaching and learning in the preschool.</p> <p>Not only that, other problems of the non-utilization of ICT in teaching at the nursery schools include lack of relevant software. For instance, software that is appropriate and culturally suitable to the Nigerian education system is in short supply. Also, there is great discrepancy between relevant software supply and demand in developing countries like Nigeria. Limited access to the internet by many Nigerian teachers, especially those who teach the pupils at the preschool is yet another problem of this study. This is because, there are few internet providers that provide internet gateway services in Nigeria, many of the foreign companies that provide the internet services in Nigeria, provide poor services to the Nigerian masses, and so, teachers do not make good use of them.</p> <p>The above identified problems, gave rise to the examination of the effect of information communication technology on early childhood education.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main objectives of the study include to:</p> <p>1.            Determine if there will be any significant effect of the use of ICT on learning at the preschool;</p> <p>2.            Ascertain if there will be any significant relationship between the use of ICT and teachers’ performance in school;</p> <p>3.            Establish if there will there be any significant relationship between the use of ICT and pupils’ learning outcomes at the preschool;</p> <p>4.            Determine if there will be any significant gender difference in the use of ICT at the preschools.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following questions were raised in this study:</p> <p>1.    Will there be any significant effect of the use of ICT on learning at the preschools?</p> <p>2.    Will there be any significant relationship between the use of ICT and teachers’ performance in schools?</p> <p>3.    Will there be any significant relationship between the use of ICT and pupils’ learning outcomes at the preschool?</p> <p>4.    Will there be any significant gender difference in the use of ICT at the preschool?</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong>Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The following research hypotheses were formulated and tested in this study:</p> <p>1.            There will be no significant effect of the use of ICT on learning at the preschool.</p> <p>2.            There will be no significant relationship between the use of ICT and teachers’ performance in school.</p> <p>3.            There will be no significant relationship between the use of ICT and pupils’ learning outcomes at the preschool.</p> <p>4.            There will be no significant gender difference in the use of ICT at the preschool.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The beneficiaries of the outcomes of the study include:</p> <p>(1)         Teachers would be one of the beneficiaries of this study as the findings and recommendations of the study will enable them to appreciate the importance of the application of ICT in teaching and learning at the preschool level of the country’s educational system.

Research in this area has shown that this type of violence has touched the lives of many Nigerian couples. Although societal awareness and condemnation of the issue has increased in recent years. Domestic violence remain a hidden and persistent problem because of the power and control held by the abuser, the fear, intimidation and humiliation suffered by the victim of this crime.</p> <p>The oldest and most prevalent institution in the world today is the marriage institution. In all culture, there is a particular sanctity attached to this institution, so much that it is particularly considered to be a building block of any society.</p> <p>The pivotal position of marriage has made domestic violence a subject of interest to various disciplines, government, religious sects and professional associations.</p> <p>American Psychological Association (APA) (1996) defined domestic violence as a pattern of abusive behaviour including a wide range of physical, sexual, and psychological maltreatment used by a person in an intimate relationship against another to gain power unfairly or to maintain that person misuse of power, control and authority. If the abuse between intimate partners in which one person tries to control the other person through violence. Domestic violence is other wise called spousal abuse.</p> <p>The role of spouse in family relationship is significant, such that some people have acclaimed it to the power of surviving family adjustment. However, this role has its own problems. some spouses have been found to be abused in various forms, ranging from sexual to financial abuse and communicative abuse. All these have implication on family relationship.</p> <p>Domestic violence occurs in traditional heterosexual marriages, as well as in some sexual partnership. The abuse may occur during a relationship, while the couple is breakup, or after the relationship has ended. The key elements of domestic violence are: intimidation, humiliation and physical injury. Going by the definition of domestic violence couples engage in it to control the other partner and keep him/her from departing or quitting the relationship.</p> <p>A critical look at the definition of domestic violence will reveal that they assume the dimension of portraying women as the victims bearing the brunt, while men are seen perpetrators.</p> <p>This could be as a result of the widely held beliefs that women are the weaker sex while men are by right, the head of the family that must be obeyed.</p> <p>Nigeria as a country has her own fair share of domestic violence, which could be seen in the rate of divorce, separation and marital dishonesty in the country.</p> <p>According to Ajila (2000) in his study on wife beating in western Nigeria, it was found that 32% of women indicated that they have experienced abuse, 21% believe strongly that wives should be beaten while 72% believe that wives should be beaten once in a while.</p> <p>Bakare (1986) identified marital conflict to exist along a particular continuum which are:</p> <p>1.           Occasional verbal quarrels</p> <p>2.           Frequent verbal quarrels</p> <p>3.           Occasional physiological quarrel</p> <p>4.           Frequent physical quarrel</p> <p>5.           Psychological separation</p> <p>6.           Physical separation</p> <p>7.           Divorce</p> <p>A close look at this shows that a particular couple is expected to go through the whole stages, but it is not necessarily so in all situations. Some couples get to the divorce stage without going through physical quarrels and physical separation, while some resolve the conflict completely before it gets to divorce stage.</p> <p>Researchers indicated domestic violence, through prevalent in Nigeria is still largely under reported, if reported at all. The causes of domestic violence can be seen in two broad categories.</p> <p>The traditional causes are those factors that are commonly seen and discussed as leading to fighting among couples. They are immediate causes that can be pin pointed as leading to violence in the home. These include, among others, sex role, sexual dissatisfaction and infidelity, ego message, feeling of staying control, income petibility, religion conflict, alcohol consumption, money matters, childlessness, influence of inlaws etc.</p> <p>Secondly contemporary causes of domestic violence are those underlying remote factors that are not easily seen or implicated, yet they influence violence behaviour in marital relationship.</p> <p>Domestic violence has now become a common phenomenon. It should be noted here that as husbands abuse their wives so also wives abuse their husbands (Steinmetz, 1977). It is only the degree that varies.</p> <p>The question then is how well has domestic violence or abuse has been able to achieve its end going by the high rate of family discord, divorce, separation etc experienced today?</p> <p>Base on the above picture, the study is to determine the influence domestic violence on family relationship among couple in Oshodi Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>Theoretical Framework</strong></p> <p>Three theoretical models will be used to explain domestic violence and neglect in family relationships:</p> <p>1.           Resource Theory</p> <p>2.           The Patriarchy Theory</p> <p>3.           General System Theory</p> <p><strong>Resource Theory</strong></p> <p>The resource theory of family violence propounded by Goode (1971) assumes that all social systems (including the family) rest to some degree on force or the threat of force. The more resources – social, personal and economic a person can command, the more force that individual can muster. However, according to Goode (1971), the more resources a person actually has, the less that person will actually use force in an open manner. Thus, a husband who wants to be dominant person in the family, but has little education, has a job, low prestige and income, and lacks interpersonal skills may choose to use violence to maintain the dominant position.</p> <p>According to Nadin (1998) employed women are less depended on abusive partners and better able to extricate themselves from harmful relationships. Women are not absolved from this social vice of heart breaking. Some women (especially those of superior economic standings to their male counterparts) are tempted to play domineering role in the family such a way that their husbands have to play the second fiddle in a home, where they are supposed to be the head of the family.</p> <p>In the incidence of domestic violence on family relationship, the causal few in most cases include infidelity, sex role, sexual dissatisfaction, feeling of stay in control, influence of inlaws, economic handship, lack of education among others. For instance, women that are not allowed to work tend to stay in an abusive relationship because, their husbands sometimes gain economic and psychological control over them. According to Nadin (1998) employed women are less dependent on violent partners and better able to extricate themselves from violence relationships.</p> <p><strong>The Patriarchy Theory</strong></p> <p>The patriarchy theory according to Dobash and Dobash (1979) is that economic and social process operate directly and indirectly to support  patriarchal (male dominated) social order and family structure).</p> <p>The central theoretical argument is that patriarchy leads to subordination and oppression of women and causes the historical pattern of systematic violence directed against wives.</p> <p>The patriarchy theory finds the source of domestic violence in society at large and how it is organized as opposed to within individual families or communities.</p> <p>Globally, and in every culture, men have been seen and celebrated as superior to their female counterparts. Traditionally, the arrival of male child into a family is seen as a special blessing to such home. It is not uncommon, most especially among Africans to pry and earnestly expect a male child irrespective of the number of the female children in the families. The central belief is that male children are by all standard superior to their female counterparts and should be treated as such.</p> <p>This situation is buttressed also by the social order and family structure. Almost in every social strata, male men are mostly favoured for significant posts. The affair of family living is also conferred superiority on the men. This has helped shape the behaviour and perception of men as superior to the female counterparts and has largely contributed to their violent behaviour against wives in family relationships.</p> <p>In most cases, wives also tries to prove that they are never inferior, when this happen the consequence is domestic violence with its many evil effects on family relationship.</p> <p><strong>General System Theory</strong></p> <p>General System Theory, a social system approach was developed and applied by Straus (1973) and Jean (1983) to explain family violence. Here violence is viewed as a system product rather than the result of individual pathology. The family system operation can maintain, escalate or reduce levels of violence in families. The theory describes the processes that characterize the use of violence in family interaction and explains the way in which violence is managed and stabilized. Straus argues that a general system theory of family violence must include at least three basic elements:</p> <p>1.           Alternative causes of action or causal flow.</p> <p>2.           The feedback mechanism that enable the system to make adjustments and</p> <p>3.           System goals.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>It has been found that various forms of domestic violence exist in some family relationship and has degenerated into various marital problems among which are child negligence, communication gaps, destruction of property, divorce, separation and ultimately death.</p> <p>Base on the above picture, this study is therefore meant to determine the influence of domestic violence on family relationship among couples in Oshodi Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The primary purpose of this study are to:</p> <p>(1)     Determine the difference between domestic violence and family relationship among new and aged wedded couples in Oshodi Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p>(2)     Find out the difference between domestic violence and family relationship among Christian and Muslim couples in the area.</p> <p>(3)     Investigate the emotional stability of children of parents who engaged in domestic violence and those who do not.</p> <p>(4)     Examine the prevalent rate of domestic violence among male and female spouses in the area.</p> <p><strong>1.5   Research Questions</strong></p> <p>This study provides answer to the following questions:</p> <p>(1)         What is the difference between domestic violence and family relationship among new and aged wedded couples in Oshodi Local Government Area of Lagos State?</p> <p>(2)         What is the difference between domestic violence and family relationship among Christian and Muslim couples in the area?</p> <p>(3)         Is there any difference between the emotional stability of children of parent who engage in domestic violence and those who do not?</p> <p>(4)         What is the prevalent rate of violence among male and female spouses in the area?</p> <p><strong>1.6   Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The hypotheses that guide the study are as follows:</p> <p>(1)         There will be no significant difference between domestic violence and family relationship among new and aged wedded couples in Oshodi Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p>(2)         There will be no significant difference between domestic violence and family relationship among Christian and Muslim couples in Oshodi Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p>(3)         There will be no significant difference between the emotional stability of children of parents who engaged in domestic violence and those who do not.</p> <p>(4)         There will be no significant difference in the prevalent rate of domestic violence among male and female spouses in the area.</p> <p><strong>1.7</strong><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The outcome of this study will be of great benefit to the married couples, marriage counsellors, children of violent couples and the society at large.</p> <p>With reference to the married couples, the finding of this study will help them identify some of this evil effects of violence not only on them as perpetrators but also on everyone who maintains intimate relationship with them such as their children and extended family members or friends. Thus, be able to control their anger.</p> <p>Also, marriage counsellors will be able to identify the various forms of violence among couples and be able to provide adequate counselling assistance whenever the need arises.</p> <p>On the other way, children of violent couples will be exposed to the right attitude to violent behaviour of their parents so as not to grow up as perpetrators of domestic violence. These children will also be educated on the need to always develop healthy emotional life inspite of the violent circumstance prevailing among them.</p> <p>The society at large will be made to the damning effects of domestic violence on family relationship. It will also assist the society to see and accept marriage as a loving relationship that should be devoid of humiliation, intimidation, threat and physical injury.</p> <p><strong>1.8</strong><strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study basically covered married couples in Oshodi Local Government Area of Lagos.

Equally, parents should avoid being too strict with their children but should adopt the authoritative style where the children can contribute to decision making in their homes which is more democratic in nature.</p> <p> CHAPTER ONE </p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>The study of human development is centrally concerned with understanding the processes that lead adults to function adequately within their cultures. These skills include an understanding of and adherence to the moral standards, conventional rules, and customs of the society. They also include maintaining close relationships with others, developing the skills to work productively, and becoming self-reliant and able to function independently. All of these may be important to successfully rear the next generation. Researchers studying human development have assumed that the family is a particularly important context for developing these competencies, and therefore, they have examined how parents socialize their children to understand variations in adult outcomes. They have attempted to find associations between the way parents raise their children and children’s social, emotional and cognitive development.</p> <p>It has been assumed that variations in parents’ discipline style, warmth, attention to the needs of the child and parenting attitudes and beliefs all can be characterized in terms of consistent patterns of child-rearing, referred to as a parenting styles, that are systematically related to children’s competence and development.  Research that began in the mid-1980s has focused more on the particular dimensions of parenting that underlie the different parenting styles to provide a more detailed understanding of how parenting influences healthy child and adolescent development.</p> <p>Arnolds (2002) theorized that a  child tends to behave in the society as they were brought up or reared by their parents. The social adjustment of individual adolescent depends on the way and manner he/she is brought. According to Dike (2003), styles of parenting in the home affects their children’s social orientation in the larger society. A child cannot behave contrary to how he/she is nurtured by the parents/guardians. Dike (2003) is of the opinion that children behave according to the pattern of parental leadership styles. For instance, a child who is brought up through an authoritarian way of parenting, will in most cases, exhibit aggression to his/her peers, and show an attitude of strong reliance on the authority of the adult members of the society. Also a child tend to show excellence in knowledge, well informed and directed when he is brought up by the authoritative parenting style, while he/she could be wayward, rascal, or join the area boy or area girl group if he/she is nurtured by parents who are permissive in their style of parenting; and a child who is reared or brought up by the harmonious parenting style, will relate well in the society with his/her age mates, even with adults. This child who is brought up by the harmonious parents shows good interactions and cordial relationship with those who live near him/her. He/she is not hostile and does not easily break the norms and laid down rules in the society or the community where he lives.</p> <p>In his early years a child passes through various phases in his relations with others. A young child is essentially tremendous egocentric. He sees himself as the center of the universe. He is a person to be served and waited upon, a person with little patience for anything which blocks his desire or sense of security. He is, above all, a person who has small regard and less appreciation of the rights or feelings of others so long as he himself is served and has his way. Some individuals seem never to lose their egocentric attitude entirely, perhaps because of faulty upbringing or because of unusual environmental circumstances (Rice, 2001).</p> <p>But the progress of true maturity may be measured in part by an individual’s growing awareness of and interest in, other persons, together with an appreciation of their rights and desires and a willingness to subordinate personal wishes to the greater good of the greater number. Expanding the child’s social consciousness as he moves toward maturity is an important training problem. The outcome represents the difference between a “spoiled disagreeable, poorly adjusted child and a likable youngster who is finding acceptable social adjustments.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>Theoretical Background to the Study</strong></p> <p><strong>1.2.1</strong><strong>Theories of Parenting Styles</strong></p> <p>Baldwin and his colleagues (2000) provided one of the most important early attempts to describe systematic patterns of child rearing. This research conducted in the 1930s and 1940s, followed a group of children and their families longitudinally cover time. They observed parents and children interacting together in their homes, and they also assessed progress in children’s development at different ages. They identified two sets of parental childbearing dimensions that were related to differences in children’s outcomes. As others had done, they distinguished parents along a dimension of emotional involvement versus detachment. They also distinguished between democratic and autocratic parents. Autocratic parents were more likely to simply hand down their rules, while democratic parents were more likely to involve the child in family decision-making and provide explanations for their expectations. Their research demonstrated that democratic parents had children who were less hostile and who worked more effectively in the absence of adult supervision (Maccoby, 1992, Maccoby and Martin, 1993).</p> <p>There have been many subsequent attempts to improve on Baldwin’s descriptions of parenting styles. The most influential has been the research of Diana (2002) who believed that the democratic style as defined by Baldwin was not sufficient to produce culturally competent adults and that democracy must be combined with authority to produce optimal competence. Beginning in the 1960s, Baumrind identified a set of characteristics that she believed defined competence for children in North American society (Stone, 1991), and then she examined parents’ childrearing beliefs and practices to determine the parenting styles that were associated with those outcomes. She initially developed a typology of child outcomes, but research from 1990 onward has expanded to include four distinct parenting styles such as authoritarian, authoritative, permissive and harmonious.</p> <p>Stone’s (2003) widely used typology describes parenting styles as varying along two completely independent dimensions of demandingness and responsiveness that, when crossed, yield four parenting styles. Authoritative parents are both responsive and demanding. They set clear, reasonable standards for responsible behaviour that are consistent with children’s developing abilities, are firm in their enforcement, and provide explanations for their positions. They are also kind, warm, and responsive to children’s needs and will negotiate their expectations. Authoritarian parents are demanding but not responsive. These parents place high values on obedience to rules, discourage give-and take between parents and children, and do not take their child’s needs into consideration. Permissive or indulgent parents are responsive but not demanding. These parents are warm and accepting and tolerant of the child’s impulses. They also make few demands on the child for mature behaviour, do not use much punishment and avoid exerting their authority. More recently, permissive parents have been distinguished from rejecting-neglecting parents, who also do not make many demands on their children, primarily because they are disengaged and thus are neither demanding nor responsive (Spoch, 1999).</p> <p>Spoch’s (1999) research indicates that authoritative parenting is most effective in leading to healthy adjustment for children. Authoritative parenting consistently has been associated with a wide range of positive adolescent outcomes, including better academic performance, increased competence, autonomy, and self-esteem, more advanced moral development, less deviance, anxiety and depression and a more well-rounded orientation to peers (Macobby and Martin 1993), Steinberg (2001). Spoch has proposed that authoritative parenting is most effective because of parents’ high expectations and support for mature behaviour. Much of the research on parenting styles in relation to child and adolescent adjustment has been conducted on white middle-class families, but since the start of the 1990s, researchers have become increasingly interested in ethnic and cultural variations.</p> <p><strong>1.2.2</strong><strong>Theories of Social Adjustment</strong></p> <p>One of the normal tendencies of an adolescent is to attach greater importance to the attitude and opinion of others, especially those of his own age, than he does at any other time in the developmental sequence. Adolescence is a time of expanding and urgent interest in persons of the opposite sex, both as person and as biological organisms. It is a time of seeking an appropriate social role and satisfying social relationships which will be in accord with concepts of self. It is, above all else, a time when personal adjustment, both present and future, is closely related to social success and to ability to play the social role in which the individual would like to see himself (Runner, 2000).</p> <p>A youth is an individual without experience, still in fact, a child, who finds himself in what is to him a rapidly expanding adult’s world. He finds himself with new physical urges, new physical growth, new interests and values, and new concepts of self. He finds, unwittingly, that he has turned his back on much that used to be important to him. The process of growing up is both difficult and strange, particularly in its relations with others, either contemporaries or adults. From his social explorations he must finally emerge with mature and adequate social attitudes, standards and skills if he is to find any degree of social adjustment as an adult.</p> <p>In his early years a child passes through various phases in his relations with others. A young child is essentially tremendous egocentric. He sees himself as the center of the universe. He is a person to be served and waited upon, a person with little patience for anything which blocks his desire or sense of security. He is, above all, a person who has small regard and less appreciation of the rights or feelings of others so long as he himself is served and has his way. Some individuals seem never to lose their egocentric attitude entirely, perhaps because of faulty upbringing or because of unusual environmental circumstances (Rice, 2001).</p> <p>But the progress of true maturity may be measured in part by an individual’s growing awareness of and interest in, other persons, together with an appreciation of their rights and desires and a willingness to subordinate personal wishes to the greater good of the greater number. Expanding the child’s social consciousness as he moves toward maturity is an important training problem. The outcome represents the difference between a “spoiled disagreeable, poorly adjusted child and a likable youngster who is finding acceptable social adjustments.</p> <p>An examination of the location within a community of a child’s friends will illustrate the foregoing point. As a very small child his friends consist of relatives and children who are brought to the house to visit. When the child is able to go about a bit, it will be found that he has a concentration of friends in the immediate vicinity of his home, but seldom anywhere else. A little later the friends will be somewhat more scattered, but all in the same or the adjoining block. By the time he enters elementary school his friendships may extend for two or three blocks but the end of the first year it will be found that he knows children scattered over most of the entire area served by his grade, although his best friends are most likely to be those living in his immediate neighbourhood. This dispersing process will be accelerated with the individual’s entrance into junior and senior high school, until a map of the dispersion of the adolescent’s friends will find them spread rather widely over the community, and even outside of it, although still with a strong concentration within the neighbourhood. This condition will be particularly marked insofar as there are strong socio-economic, racial, or national differences existing within the community (Anderson, 2000)</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The social adjustment of children these days has been negative in the society; this has been attributable to the type of parenting in which these highly maladaptive children were reared and nurtured. Studies carried out by Strausser (2001), showed that children’s social adjustment in the community is not far fetched from the way they are brought up by their parents. According to this finding, children who are socially deficient, are mostly reared by parents whose styles of parenting were basically authoritarian in nature. Children whose parents are very autocratic and authoritarian, become highly aggressive, violent and autocratic to their peers in the school and at home. This is because, they had learnt aggression and violence from their parents who used force and high handedness in bringing them up in the home.</p> <p>Also, a child becomes way-ward in the society because he is brought up by the permissive parents who applied I-don’t-care attitude in bringing up the child. Little wonder why most children of these days are recalcitrant, obstinate, delinquent, harlotic, bullies, armed robbers, fighters, examination cheats, depraved-minded, alcoholics, drug abusers, addicts, violent demonstrators and destructive individuals in the school and at home; cultists and gangsters etc. These vices are anti-social behaviours that are perpetrated in the society by those whose parents may have lacked the correct parental styles and patterns in child-rearing.</p> <p>This study therefore, set out to investigate the problem of parenting styles on the social adjustment of secondary school adolescents in Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of this study is to examine the influence of parenting styles on social adjustment among secondary school students in Lagos State.</p> <p>Other specific objectives of the study include to investigate:</p> <p>1.       Whether there are difference in the social orientation of students who were brought up by authoritative parents and those brought up by the authoritarian parents.</p> <p>2.       Whether there is gender difference in social orientation of students as a result of parenting styles.</p> <p>3.       Whether the socio-economic status of parents affect their styles of parenting.</p> <p>4.       Evaluate whether the religious backgrounds of parents affect their styles of parenting.</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>These research questions were asked in this study:</p> <p>2.            Is there any difference in the social adjustment of students who are brought up under authoritative parenting style and those brought up under authoritative style?</p> <p>3.            Is there any gender difference in the social adjustment of students as a result of parenting styles?</p> <p>4.            To what extent will the socio-economic status of parents differ in their parenting styles?</p> <p>4.            Will the religious backgrounds of parents affect their styles of parenting?</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong><strong>Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>These hypotheses were formulated and tested in this study:</p> <p>1.            There is no significant influence of authoritative parenting style on students’ social adjustment.</p> <p>2.       There is no significant influence of religious background on the parenting style among couples.</p> <p>3.       There is no significant influence of ethnicity on parenting style.</p> <p>4.       The is no significant gender different in the social adjustment of students in schools.</p> <p><strong>1.7</strong><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study will be beneficial to the following individuals:</p> <p>1.            <strong>Parents:</strong> Parents, no doubt, are those who nurture and take care of children after giving birth to them in the home. With this findings and recommendations made in this study, parents would be well informed. Pertaining to different levels of patterns of parenting in the home.

According to Omoegun (2000), the adolescents due to their behaviour which are inimical to society’s norms and values, many at times, fail short of the demands of the society. The society demands that the youths should present good conducts and norms which are acceptable to the general community, which are also prerequisites for healthy living and good interactions in the society. As Onyedika (2003) observes, no decent society would like its youths to be recalcitrant to its laid down values and accepted norms.</p> <p>According to Onwuama (1988), the youngsters are seen as a group constantly seeking independence from the adult society, particularly, of parents and other authority figures. This need for independence has led adolescents to take a position and views different from those of their parents and other adults, and to act in conformity with their peers, however unconventional their actions may be. Nowadays, it is not unusual to hear some parents complaining about their children’s uncooperative attitudes. These days, children tend to disobey their parents and obey their friends and take directives from them. Agunloye (2000) states that it is very essential for parents to watch out for the company that their adolescent children associate with or keep. A popular adage says, “show me your friend and I will tell you who you are”. This means that if a child associates with drug pushes or abusers, sooner or later, he would join the group. Or if he/she associates with rogues and armed robbers, he/she would sooner or later be persuaded to join the group on one of their trips and share in the booty”. A trial will convince you! So they say.</p> <p>According to Onuoha (2005), parents are largely responsible for the lapses in the adolescent behaviour, because, they are expected to serve as role-models. Parents need to give more attention to the development of their adolescents in order to inculcate the right sense of discipline and correct orientation in them. This is because, where parents fail to train or bring up their child in the right direction, they (adolescents) tend to uphold the tenets of their of peers. These peers are seemingly inexperienced in child-upbringing, therefore, they inculcate in their friends wrong ideas that do not conform with the norms accepted in the community (Ayodele, 2002).</p> <p>No doubt, adolescents in our contemporary society, need to be counselled and directed on the best part to follow in life. According to Mundi (2001), the school counsellors have enormous work on their hands, because they cannot afford to sit down and watch the youths who are regarded as the greater tomorrow to act as they like and then turn to deviants in the society. When the counsellors and other significant adult members of the society fail to advise and direct the adolescents against wrong behaviour, they (adolescents) would continue in their wrong acts and uphold them till adult life, and the resultant effect is a disjointed and perverse community in which anything goes, a wild jungle where anarchy reigns supreme.</p> <p>Due to economic down-turn in Nigeria, and generally in the world today, parents have lost the firm grips they had on their children’s characters (Ajibola, 2000). According to Ajibola, in the olden days, when the economy was stable and in good condition, when parents were indeed breadwinners, they (parents) used to give effective instructions and directions to their children and these instructions were followed to the last letter, but these days, many parents are no more financiers of the home, and this has caused them to loose grips on their command structure to their children. Many parents these days, do not take proper care of their children. For instance, due to economic adversity, in many homes, children go out to work, by way of hawking and doing menial jobs and come to feed their parents. This situation does not warrant these parents to have the moral rights to discipline these children even though in the face of flagrant disobedience of parents’ rules and regulations.</p> <p>In this perspective, guidance and counsellors have a lot jobs to do, because their natural duties are to advise and diplomatically persuade individuals to follow the part of good life in order to come out of their problems. According to Uzoma (1998), the school should use the counsellors to return the wrong behavioural pattern of the adolescents to the good behavioural patterns where they would conform to the demands and aspirations of the decent society, especially that of the parents, teachers and the significant others in the near community.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Adolescent life is no doubt, a life full of storm and stress. Many adolescents have grown wings and flown above parental control, due to peer pressure and bad ganging up. In many circumstances now, the youths in the society have turned recalcitrants, they hardly obey the rules and regulations stipulated by their parents, teachers and the significant others in the community or the school. The economic downturn in Nigeria today, has caused parents and many adults to become handicapped, and could not usurp authorities on the young ones. In this circumstance, the youths have turned away from their parents, and have focused attention to their peers who have swayed them into becoming armed robbers, prostitutes, violent demonstrators, examination cheats, thieves, hired assassins, thuggs, rioters, rapers drug abusers and addicts etc.</p> <p>Due to the fact that youths of these days have not met the social demands of good values and norms of parents, teachers and others in the larger society, it has not augured well in the social community where orderliness and decorum are expected of all decent members of the society. For this lapses in lives of the young ones, the society, and indeed, parents, teachers and other adult members of the larger community have been at great pain and distress due to the seeming lack of good behaviour in majority of our youngsters. For instance, the laid down norms and expected values of the society, especially of parents and teachers are neglected by the youths, this has caused our social system, a great collapse, and no wonder there is so much decay in the system nowadays.</p> <p>The above problems necessitated the examination of the influence guidance and counselling on psychosocial adjustment of students in secondary schools.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>Specifically the study intends to:</p> <p>1.           Examine the relationship between school counselling practices and psychosocial adjustment of students.</p> <p>2.           Investigate the perception of students to guidance and counselling.</p> <p>3.           Assess the extent of psychological adjustment problems among students.</p> <p><strong>1.4   Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions addressed the following:</p> <p>1.           Is there any relationship between school counselling and students’ psychological adjustment?</p> <p>2.           To what extent does the students’ perceive guidance and counselling positively?</p> <p>3.           To what extent does the students’ perceive guidance and counselling negatively?</p> <p>4.           To what extent do students have psychological problems?</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong>Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The following hypotheses were formulated and tested in this study:</p> <p>1.           There is no significant relationship between school counselling and psychosocial adjustment.</p> <p>2.           Students will not positively perceive school guidance and counselling.</p> <p>3.           Students will not negatively perceive school guidance and counselling.</p> <p>4.           The students in schools have poor psychological adjustment.</p> <p><strong>1.6   Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study is essential when we consider the power of peer group influence on the students and the need for guidance to enable the students understand and adjust well within the school environment.</p> <p>The work would be a contribution to knowledge and literature in the area that the study covered.</p> <p>It will help to check some re-occurring problems which may hinder the attainment of well planned curriculum.</p> <p>This study will also be beneficial to the following individuals:</p> <p><strong>Parents:</strong> Parents, no doubt, are those who nurture and take care of children after giving birth to them in the home.

The study employed the descriptive research survey for the assessment of the opinions of the respondents. The questionnaire was used to collect vital information for this study. A total of 160 (one hundred and sixty) respondents were sampled for this study to represent the entire population of the study. Four null hypotheses were tested and the following results emerged at the end of the analysis of data: A significant influence of socio-cultural variables on marital stability among couples, there is a significant influence of ethnicity on couples that come from South Eastern Zone and others that come from Northern or Southern Zones of the country, it was also revealed that no significant influence of religion exists on couples’ marital stability, and it was indicated that a significant influence of communication exists on couples’ marital stability. In the long-run, it was found that socio-cultural variables play vital roles on the marital bliss of couples in the society. In the foregoing, the following recommendations were forwarded by the researcher.</p> <p>(1)         It is the opinion of this researcher that couples should avoid the consultation of the third party in their conflict. Rather, they should try to settle themselves whenever there is any marital disagreement.</p> <p>(2)         Couples should try to have one faith. It is not ideal that husband and wife should have different religious backgrounds or beliefs.</p> <p>(3)         For couples to maintain marital happiness and togetherness, love must be watch-word in the family. Without love, affection and element of trust, couples will not go far in their marriages.</p> <p> CHAPTER ONE 1.1       Introduction: Background to the Study   Culture is generally, described and accepted as people’s way of life, which among other things includes their material lives. The inspiration of every matured man or woman is to have a stable and happy marital life, be compatible in love, values, academic, economic and of course be socially alright. This in line with the postulation of Onyema (1994), that marriage is a social institution for the union of body and soul. However, stability in marriage may at times be influenced by certain socio-cultural variables. The influence of the variables may be negative resulting to insecurity and unhappiness in marriage or may be positive resulting to a stable and happy union. These variables range from cultural diversity (in case of interethnic marriage), to educational, social, economic and even religious background. Even age difference is inclusive in these variables. For instance, a lady once confessed that she can never marry an illiterate no matter how rich he may be, because, one day, he might ignorantly use her certificate as a toilet tissue. The implication of this open confession is incompatibility and social inequality in education which are factors that may influence marital stability. The current instability in some marriages in our society today tend to be the resultant influence of social, economic and cultural changes in people’s pattern of living. These changes, according to Amaonye, (1996), have occurred and have continued to occur so rapidly that they are not yet absorbed into our ways of living. Furthermore, compatibility in social lives of couples is a strong factor for marital stability and survival. When the social lives of couples are at variance, it may likely portend great threat to marital stability, because it takes time to come to terms with why some social outings and involvement are necessary. However, the realization of the salient influence of these socio cultural variables on marriage may likely be positive moment towards marriage stability in our society today. Age difference is a factor that can cause individuals to refuse to marry certain personalities. Age variables in any case, can cause disaffection and lack of love among married couples, and this is capable of causing bad blood, which may lead to conflict in marriage (Adeleke, 2005). A situation where a much more younger girl marries a much more older man, there may not be that husband and wife love and affection, which make marriage thick and stable. Also poverty or riches is another variable that can separate or unite couples. For instance, in a marriage where there is lack of money, the couple may not live happily in peace. This is because, according to Uzor (2000), finance is one of the uniting factors in marriage. Language barrier is another socio-cultural variable that makes or mars the union of husband and wife in marriage. This is because, if couples do not communicate well using a common language, disintegration may set in. As Ulumor (2003) puts it, without effective communication, no marriage can stand the test of time. Ulumor is of the opinion that couples who speak one common language, are found to be more united and in love, than those who do not speak a common language. So, inter-ethnic marriage is a factor that must be considered thoroughly before people dabble into marriage. Religion is an important socio-cultural variable in any marital union. Religion is the way of life of a people. According to Molokwu (2004), marriages have broken down due to differences in religious backgrounds or perception. According to Molokwu, differences or similarity in religious beliefs, consciousness, feelings and so on, build or destroy marriages. If couples are not in the same belief system, it could lead to lack of trust and confidence, and if trust and confidence are lacking in any marriage, it will be extinct. Marriage should be contracted through a careful planning and accidental marriage (that is marriages that are not planned but are forced on couples to save the family or families from embarrassment) should be avoided like a plague. Before a man weds his wife, both of them should reach the age of maturity. They should mature socially, economically, temperamentally, financially etc. For a happy marriage, they should maintain a feeling of love and affection. The wife must experience a feeling of being wanted and a sense of belonging, care and security. The husband too needs love and affection to ensure him of a stable marriage. Marriage partners should avoid cognitive error that is, they should not expect the other person to see it. Therefore, if the husband wants the wife to behave in a certain way, he should inform her about his wishes, the same is true of the wife to her husband. Sexual compatibility tends to foster marital stability, marital oneness to large extent depends on sex. Infact, sex is a form of communication and probably, the most legitimate in which two persons (husband and wife) express oneness of mind and feeling. Therefore, partners in marriage should be socially compatible. Child-bearing is a factor that foster marriage may not be her fault. The main may be very low to effect pregnancy. To avoid unnecessary doubts, both husband and wife should go for a medical checkup to rectify or correct the problem of childessness. For marriage to work out well, couples should not entertain the interference of in-laws or the third party syndrome. They should avoid washing their dirty lining in the public. They should be of one religious sect, joint account, mind the same thing, maintain peace in the home and allow love and affection to rule their world. 1.2       Statement of the Problem Marital instability is one of the painful experiences of life. The wish of every married man and woman is to spend their life time together and joyfully till death part them. However, this is not usually the case all the time because at a particular period in their lives, frictions do arise which leads to a near or total collapse of the marriage. And this is one of the inevitable challenges that accompany marriages. Socio-cultural factors such as religious, age, socio-economic status, social class, educational background, personality, traditional values etc influence the marital stability of marriage among couples are very important variables in marital stability but the relevance of these factors are not recognized by many couples, no wonder there are breakages in many homes as a result of no love, lack of understanding, lack of compatibility, disparity in age, in education, religion and social classes. Many for instance, have failed to realize that when couples are of diverse culture (inter-ethnic marriage), there is need to respect each other’s culture since this translates to respecting the person you married and subsequent marital stability. These days marriages fail due to lack of tolerance, lack of mutual trust, lack of patience, non-child bearing, no effective communication, lack of good marital altitudes, similarities between couples, lack of maturity and poor socio-economic status. Finally, when couples are not from same socio-cultural background, and do not have the value system and norms, they tend to vary in understanding of themselves and lack of understanding no doubt, creates conflict, and instability in marital union. Other factors that can break up marriages or bring about conflicts in marital vows include age difference, language barrier, low socio-economic status, religious differences and incompatibility and so on. Based on the above identified problems, the researcher set out to examine the influence of socio-cultural variables on marital stability among couples in Lagos metropolis. 1.3       Purpose of the Study The major purpose of this study is to determine the influence of socio-cultural variables on marital stability among couples in Lagos State. Other objectives of this study will include to: 2.            Examine whether there is difference between religion and marital stability among couples. 3.            Find out whether there is difference between ethnicity and marital success among couples. 4.            Determine whether there is influence of communication on marital stability. 5.            Investigate whether socio-economic status has an impact on couples’ marital success. 1.4       Research Questions The following research questions will assist the conduct of this study: 1.            Will there be a significant influence of socio-cultural variables on marital stability among couples? 2.            Will there be a significant difference between ethnicity and marital stability? 3.            Will religious backgrounds of couples influence their marital stability? 4.            Is there any significant influence of socio-economic states of couples on their marital stability? 1.5       Research Hypotheses The following research hypotheses will be formulated for testing in this study: 1.            There is no significant influence of socio-cultural variables on couples’ marital stability. 2.            There is no significant influence of ethnicity on couples’ marital stability. 3.            There is no significant influence of religion on couples’ marital stability. 4.            There is no significant influence of communication on couples’ marital stability. </p> <p> 1.6       Significance of the Study This study will be beneficial to these individuals: (1)         Couples: Men and women who are in marital unions, would benefit from the findings and recommendations of this study, because, it will enable them to be more informed concerning factors that tend to make or mar marriages. With this study, they would be able to learn how best to make their marriages to work well or factors that can disintegrate it. (2)         Parents: Parents would learn some factors that would help their children of marriageable ages to live peacefully with their would-be partners. Parents of children in marriageable ages would be able to abreast with the facts that would lead them to be in good positions to become marital counsellors to their children/wards. (3)         Counsellors: Counsellors would see this study as a good information that will help them to be in good position to give proper advice on factors that help or destroy marriages, with the study, counselors would be able to guide individuals who seek to marry on the best part to follow so as to guide and secure their marriages. (4)         The Society: The society is the beneficiary of happy marriages, because, if families are at peace, it be beneficial to the society because the products of a peaceful family is a product of united and peaceful society. Not only that, individuals in the society will be exposed to a better knowledge of the factors inherent in marital union. 1.7       Scope and Limitations of the Study The scope of this study will be the influence of socio-cultural variables on marital stability among couples in Mainland Local Government Area of Lagos State. The research will cover Mainland Local Government Area of Lagos State since the research is making use of only Mainland Local Government Area, the generalizability of the findings is limited to the local government area. However, this study cannot present all the marital problems exhibited by all the couples in Lagos State considering the scope the generalizability of the findings can only be applicable to the other couples in similar conditions. There could be other problems that manifest among couples in Lagos State, but this study will be restricted to the one’s highlighted in the hypotheses. </p> <p> 1.8       Operational Definition of Terms The following operational terms will be defined in this study thus: 1.            Culture: This is defined as a term emerged whole of idea and things produced by men in their historical experience by 1910 America Anthropologists were using “Culture” to refer to distinctive of traits characterizing particular tribal societies. 2.            Culture Heritage: This is a process of bringing together people of different ideas and cultural background to have common interest and perceive a common goal. 3.            Marriage: Marriage husband and wife or the legal joining together of two person’s of opposite sex as husband and wife. 4.            Cultural Variables: This means culture differences and variations among individuals in a given society or community. They can be socio-economic variables, education, age, religion, etc. 5.            Marital Stability: This refers to happiness, bliss, or compatibility in marriage. The following factors can bring about stability in marriage, they are age, religion, socio-economic status, culture, etc. </p>                                                           \n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF SOCIO-CULTURAL VARIABLES ON MARITAL STABILITY AMONG COUPLES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIO-CULTURAL VARIABLES ON MARITAL STABILITY AMONG COUPLES", "id": 32}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study investigated the influence of televised aggression and pornography on adolescents in secondary schools in Agege Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p>A sample of 120 students randomly selected from 4 senior secondary school children in public schools were used.

It is not surprising that speculations about violent behaviour have been prevalent in the society since motion pictures showing violent acts were first distributed with the advent of the television in the early 1950s.</p> <p>Violence surrounds us not only in real life but also in our entertainment as films and movies.</p> <p>With improved technology, television, both in its news reports and entertainment provides a steady show of violence e.g. riots, wars, terrorism, raids, rapes, etc, which has affected all parts of our daily lives especially adolescents in our school system.</p> <p>Stein and Fredrick (1999) described television as a dominating, powerful drug on the minds of children, as a conveyor of cultural values, attitudes and beliefs as it serves as an agent of socialization along side with the family, school and peer groups. Yet, television has not received much attention in terms of research as other agents of socialization especially in the developing countries such as Nigeria, hence the reason for this study.</p> <p>The research on the influence of televised violence on the social orientation of adolescents in secondary schools has been a great concern in the minds of educationists since the television is a powerful tool that is capable of affecting the behaviour of the youths. The effects of television violent programme on the lives of our youths and even the adults cannot be over-emphasized. More often than not, it has a negative impact on the behaviour of the adolescents due to weird and violent programmes that are shown on television. For example, when one tunes on the television, what one sees are violent programmes like wrestling, violent movies, rituals in terms of home videos or films and other extremely vicious and horrible acts which affect the minds and behaviours of the viewers especially the youths, even the adult members of the society. These violent programmes have affected the social orientation of the adolescents so much that they have emulated what they view on television and this has caused them to be maladjusted in their general behaviour.</p> <p>Many youths today have become bullies, aggressive fellows, fighters, armed robbers, heady, obstinate, corrupt and vicious as a result of what they have viewed on violent television programmes, films, internet etc. Many children have formed the habit of opening to corrupt or pornographic sites on the internet and glue themselves to these immoral pictures, taking in every inch of what they see and arousing otherwise dormant sexual instincts. This has caused many of our youths to turn to promiscuous and harlotic lives. Rapes and sexual harassment, seductive display of body parts, indecent dressing abound every where in our nation and these have affected the good norms of our society.</p> <p>The nation’s television stations are not helping matters because they are in the habit of showing programmes in which people are shot, stabbed, beaten up, poisoned, rapped, robbed, harassed etc. They also show cartoons in which animals or animated characters inflict injuries on one another in many ways.</p> <p>Television has been criticized for showing foreign films which propagate the culture of immorality, thus brutalizing the highly impressionable minds of our children. It has been argued that local films do not have anything to offer other than showing violence, ritual killings, notorious acts and murder as rightly reported by Amata (Guardian, Saturday, December 16, 2000).</p> <p>Some of the evils in our society these days are perpetrated by the adolescents who have watched one bad film or violent television programme or the other. Today, youths engage in immoral, wicked, and aggressive acts because they are constantly exposed to television programmes that affect the behaviour of the individual negatively. Children in the urban cities are the most affected because of the diverse social problems in the cities and their exposure to television viewing, internet browsing where they unhibitedly watch all kinds of pornographic films, listen to the radio and have access to different junk newspapers and obscene magazines and other aspects of the media that sway the mind and influence the psyche of the budding individual child negatively. In the rural areas, though the world is said to be a global village, these things are not readily available and rampart. No wonder, there are aggressive children these days mostly in the urban cities than in the rural areas and in the olden days when television aggressive programmes were not rampant as they are today.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The introduction of the mass media and the incessant display of television violence have to a great extent brought rapid changes on their social orientation in school, home and society at large. It is therefore not surprising that aggressive behaviours are prevalent in the society since the motion pictures displaying violent acts were first introduced.</p> <p>Many youths today have become aggressive, bullies, fighters, armed robbers, heady, obstinate, showing unrestrained disrespect to parents, teachers and elders both at home and school. Many adolescents these days are corrupt, wicked and immoral as a result of what they watch and learn from corrupt television programmes, films, movies and on the internet.</p> <p>Children these days watch more pornographic films on the internet than they study their books. This results in their becoming prostitutes, rapers, sexual abusers and harassers, deprived and perverted individuals. Some become rascals, radicals, weird in their dressing and appearances and maladjusted to the social norms of the larger society.</p> <p>It is as a result of these social vices in the society that prompted this research which aims at carrying out a study to examine the influence of televised aggression and pornography on the social adjustment of students.</p> <p><strong>Purpose of Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of televised aggression and pornography on the social adjustment of students.</p> <p>The specific objectives of the study are as follow:</p> <p>(1)         To find out whether there will be any significant effect of violent television programmes on social adjustment.</p> <p>(2)         To find out whether there is a significant effect of violent television programmes on aggressive behaviour of adolescents in schools.</p> <p>(3)         Whether there is a significant gender difference in the aggressive behaviour of students due to television viewing.</p> <p>(4)         Whether there will be a significant influence of pornographic films on the social adjustment of adolescents in school.</p> <p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions are raised to conduct this study:</p> <p>1.           Will there by any significant effect of violent television programmes on the social adjustment of students?</p> <p>2.           Will there be any significant effect of aggressive television programmes on students’ violent behaviour in society?</p> <p>3.           Will there be any significant gender difference in the aggressive behaviour of students due to viewing violent television programmes?</p> <p>4.           Will there be any significant influence of pornographic films on the social adjustments of adolescents in schools?   </p> <p><strong>Research Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>1.           There will be no significant effect of violent television programmes on students social adjustment.</p> <p>2.           There will be no significant effect of violent television programmes on the aggressive behaviour of students.</p> <p>3.           There will be no significant gender difference in the aggressive behaviour of students due to violent television programmes.</p> <p>4.            There will be no significant influence of pornographic films viewing on the social adjustment of students in schools.</p> <p><strong>Significance of Study</strong></p> <p>It is unarguably clear that violent television programmes influence the behaviour of the child either directly or indirectly. This study will therefore enable children to be more focused on their academic works than watching more television programme. It will also help children to realize that all what they see on television are mostly film ticks, make-beliefs and embellishments and they ought not to imitate them.</p> <p>The study will be significant to educators because the information gathered can help them to develop educational theories which could help or be useful in guiding adolescents in their social development.</p> <p>The study is significant to parents in that they will be able to control and monitor the type of programmes their children watch on television and the time to watch them through the recommendations of this study.</p> <p>Producers of television programmes will be encouraged to produce more informative and educative programmes which will help in the children’s academic performance and social adjustment.</p> <p><strong>Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>The key words that would be defined here are Aggression, Pornography and Social Adjustment. They would be defined in the context of the study.</p> <p><strong>Aggression:</strong> Is a deliberate unprovoked attack by a person or group on another. It is an energetic activity of the mind or body, whether innate or a product of frustration, and either healthily expressed as proper self-assertion or in the use and perfecting of skills etc, or morbidly expressed in bullying, masochism, destructiveness etc or sublimated in play.</p> <p><strong>Televised Aggression:</strong> Is that which holds a reward, either direct or indirect (in the form of observation of models). These rewards are, the influencing factors in aggression. It relates to the effect of glamorized violent role-models such as those in the media, on computer games, in cyberspace and in music. The issue to be addressed is whether people, especially children can tell the difference between reality and fantasy.</p> <p>Research on human aggression has progressed to a point at which a unifying framework is needed. All violence is aggression, but no all aggression is violent. Intimidation for instance is a case of non-violent aggression.</p> <p><strong>Pornography: </strong>Is an obscene literature, photograph or painting intended to cause sexual excitement. Pornography from the Greek word “Porneia” means “Prostitution”. In general usage today, it refers to literature, films and so on, that are sexually arousing. Soft-core pornography refers to pornography that is suggestive rather than explicit. Hard-core pornography in contrast, is explicit in that it shows actual sexual acts and photographs of the genitals. Generally, it is the explicit representation of sexual behaviour verbal or pictorial which degrades or demeans humans especially women.</p> <p><strong>Social Adjustment:</strong> It is the adaptation of a person to his social environment. Adaptation may take place by adapting self to the environment or by changing the environment. Generally, it is a relationship which involves the accommodation of the individual to circumstances in his social environment for the satisfaction of his needs and motives. It is the ability of the individual to integrate successfully with others to perform his social functions accordingly.</p>                                                          \n\nINFLUENCE OF TELEVISED AGGRESSION AND PORNOGRAPHY ON THE SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT OF ADOLESCENTS IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INFLUENCE OF TELEVISED AGGRESSION AND PORNOGRAPHY ON THE SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT OF ADOLESCENTS IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS", "id": 33}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>Background Study</strong></p> <p>The development of any nation or community depends largely on the quality of education of such a nation. It is generally believed that the basis for any true development must commence with the development of human resources (Akanle, 2007). Hence formal education remains the vehicle for social-economic development and social mobilization in any society. The difference between developed and developing nations is not on the basis of colour, race or any other criteria, but on the basis of education and knowledge. Even in a society itself, people are differentiated on the basis of the quality of education, received by them (Mumthas, 2006). Education therefore has an immense impact on the development human society. It is through education that knowledge and information is received and spread throughout the world.  In other words “without education, man is as though in a closed room and with education he finds himself in a room with all its windows open towards outside world” (Khan, 2003). Parents play an immense and significant role in the academic performance of their children. Educated parents would have increased emphasis on educational excellence. Educated parents are equipped by virtue of their education to take cognizance of the fact that parent- student- school- community relationship is important in order to promote educational attainment and academic achievement of their children and so they make the partnership a priority (Okantey, 2008).</p> <p>Parent has vital roles to play in the life of a child. The involvement of a parent on a child determines the future of such child.  Parenting involvement is a catch-all term for many different activities including at ‘home,’ good parenting, helping with homework, talking to teachers, attending school functions, through to taking part in school governance.    When schools work together with families to support learning, children tend to succeed not just in schools but throughout life. To say the fact, the most accurate prediction of a student’s performance in school is not income or social status, but the extent  to which that student’s parent is able to create  a home environment that encourage learning  and to  express high expectations for their children’s achievement and future careers.</p> <p>       Academic achievement is directly related to students’ growth and development of knowledge in an educational situation where teaching and learning process takes place. Academic achievement is defined as the performance of the students in the subject they study in the school (Pandey, 2008). Academic performance determines the student’s status in the class. It gives children an opportunity to develop their talents, improve their grades and prepare for the future academic challenges. Parental involvement in promoting children’s school success has been identified as a vital factor affecting students’ academic performance in school. In particular, various aspects of parental involvement although,  parents of different occupation classes often have different styles of child rearing, different ways of disciplining their children and different ways of reacting to their children. These differences do not express themselves consistently as expected in the case of every family; rather they influence the average tendencies of families for different occupational classes. (Rothestein, 2004).</p> <p>            Family is the primary cell of society where the child's upbringing must begin since his birth, still in cradle. According to V. Hugo, the person's principles established   since childhood are like letters engraved in the bark of a young tree, which grow, enlarge with it making its integral part. Therefore, right beginning makes the most important part of upbringing/education. Nobody ever said that children were easy to rise. They don't come with guidelines or instructions, and they certainly don't come with a pause button (I've looked!). What they do come with is a crucial set of physical and emotional needs that must be met. Failure of the parents to meet these specific needs can have wide-ranging and long-lasting negative effects (Christheisen, 2009).  This is because parent in the home are children first teacher. As a child move from infant to toddler and then to a pre-schooler, he learns how to speak, listen, write and read which latter develop the child to achieve academically.</p> <p> The influence of parents on children school performance is well documented in numerous studies. Gadsden (2003) says greater parental involvement at early stage in children’s learning, positively affects the child’s school performance including higher academic achievement. Harderves (1998) review that family whose children are doing well in school exhibit the following characters:</p> <p>•         Establish a daily family routine by providing time and a quiet place to study with the children and assigning responsibility for house hold chores.</p> <p>•         Monitor out-of-school activities, for example setting limits on television watching, reduce time of playing, monitor the groups of friends the pupils walk with.</p> <p>•          Encourage children’s development and progress in school; that is maintaining a worm and supportive home, showing interest in children’s progress at school, helping him or her with homework, discussing the value of a good education and future career with children.</p> <p>Upon this background, this study sets out to investigate the parental status and student academic performance in Lagos State secondary schools.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>The role of a parent to a child at any given time cannot be over emphasized. The home is very germane and crucial to a child’s well-being and development in later life.  Izzo et al (1999) studied 1205 US children from kindergarten through to grade 3 in a 3 year longitudinal research programme. Teachers rated four forms of involvement; frequency of parent-teacher contact; quality of parent teacher interaction; participation in educational activities in the home; and participation in school activities. These factors, as well as family background variables were examined to find any relationship they might have with school achievement as indexed by school grades. Consistent with other studies, Izzo et al showed that all forms of parental involvement declined with child’s age and that involvement in the home ‘predicted the widest range of performance variance. In another longitudinal study,   Dubois, (1994) showed that family support and the quality of parent child relationships significantly predicted school adjustment in a sample of 159 young US adolescents (aged 10 –12) followed in a two year  longitudinal study. At-home parental involvement clearly and consistently has significant effects on pupil achievement and adjustment which far outweigh other forms of involvement. When schools work together with families to support learning, children tend to succeed not just in school, but throughout life. The  challenges  of  single  parenthood,  family  crises and the ever increasing involvement of women in various areas  of  community  and  national  development  makes one  to ask questions as  to whether parents are still able to  be  committed  to  their  wards;  or  whether  they  are putting  enough  efforts  towards  effective  learning  and performance of their children.</p> <p>The foregoing discussion had established that socio – economic status and host of other factors relating to home environment of students, such as educational background of parents, health status of students, parental occupation and family size could have effects on children academic achievement.Given the importance of education to development, why then it is not taken seriously as indicated by low pass rates. What then mainly determines academic performance in the specific case of secondary school students in Lagos State? Well, in factual context, many ideas come to mind if we think why some students perform better than others: is it because they study more at home? Do they have a higher capacity to learn? Does the personal background, way of life and environment of the student favour his/her performance?</p> <p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>In addressing this problem, the following research questions will be raised:</p> <p><strong>1).</strong> to what extent is the effect of parental socio – economic status on students' academic performance?</p> <p><strong>2).</strong> what is the effect of parental involvement on student academic performance?</p> <p><strong>3).</strong> is there any impact of family background on students' academic performance?</p> <p><strong>4).</strong>whatis effect of parent authoritativeness on student academic performance?</p> <p><strong>Research Objectives</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the parental status and academic performance in secondary school. Specifically, it seeks to find out;</p> <p><strong>1).</strong> the effect of parental socio – economic status on students' academic performance.</p> <p><strong>2).</strong> the effect of parental involvement on student academic performance.</p> <p><strong>3).</strong> the impact of family background on students' academic performance.</p> <p><strong>4).</strong>the effect of parent authoritativeness on student academic performance.</p> <p><strong>Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The following research hypotheses will be tested:</p> <p><strong>1).</strong> There is no significant relationship between parental socio – economic status and students' academic performance.</p> <p><strong>2).</strong> There is no significant correlation between parental involvement and student academic performance.</p> <p><strong>3).</strong> There is no significant relationship between family background and students' academic performance.</p> <p><strong>4).</strong> There is no significant influence between parent authoritativeness and student academic performance</p> <p><strong>Significance of this Study</strong></p> <p>It is envisaged that the findings of this study may expose some factors that might be responsible for poor performance of students in school. The identified areas where government at different levels could come in will be brought into focus in other to bridge the gap of educational attainment of children of low and high income earners in the society. The importance of achieving the objectives of education programme among the general populace cannot be over emphasized. A researcher, Laosa, (2005) had posted as follows: \"The educational achievement gap has deep root; it is evident very early in child's lives; even before they enter schools. Socio–economic differences – such as health and nutrition status, home environments that provide access to academically related experiences, mobility rates, and financial assets can certainly influence academic achievements\" (Laosa, 2005). The responsibility of training a child always lies in the hand of the parents. This is congruent with the common assertion sociologist that education can be an instrument of cultural change which is being taught from home is relevant in this discuss. It is not out of place to imagine that parental socio–economic background can have possible effects on the academic achievement of children in school.

Most puberty changes have occurred and most of their physical attributes are set (Cross 1992). Still, the teen years are considered by most authorities in development to be the most stressful. Personal appearance and social popularity grow to be overwhelming forces in teens’ daily life. According to Darroch and Singh (2000), teenagers naturally make sexual behaviour a part of attaining peer affirmation. A teen may be asked, dared or may even belittled into proving solidarity with the peer group by performing sexual acts (Lewis and Lewis, 2004). As Ounyea (1994) puts it, research studies have shown that teenagers consistently submit to sexual pressures even without any inducement from peers.</p> <p>Hein (2001) observed that sexuality education for adolescents must present materials perceived as relevant to them, in a factual manner that avoids the appearance of preaching or admonishment. Adolescents of this level, possess a strong sense of autonomy. They easily detect in adult, especially their teachers, hidden strategies designed to alter their behaviour or thinking. Course material and exercises examining reproduction, contraception and communication are among the more meaningful at this stage, but prevention of sexual assault and information on sexual variables also generated interest among adolescent (Dryfold, 2003). At this stage, students requires contemporary information and the use of contraceptives.</p> <p>The average student today in higher institutions especially at the University of Lagos, grew up in the pill era and simply assumes that highly effective methods of contraception are available. It is difficult sometimes to remember that this has been true only for about the last three decades and previously contraception was a hit-or-miss affair at best (Adekeye, 2000). According to him, contraception is less controversial than it once was (except for the issue of side effects).</p> <p>Today, there are variety of reasons for an individual student at the higher institution to use contraceptives. Munoye (1998) states that many girls these days do not want to go into pregnancy and then abort their careers at school, this is why they prefer to take pills in order to avoid unwanted pregnancies or to get involved in premature marriages before completion of their education.</p> <p>According to Anyanwu (2002) there are many methods of contraceptives in the society. These include the condom; the withdrawal method; the intrauterine contraceptives device, the diaphragm, the spermicides, the douching methods etc. Among all the methods of preventing unwanted pregnancies by the youths in schools, the condom and the pills are the most commonly needed or are used. Apart from its side effects, the variety of pills are used by women in many society today. This is because of its relative effectiveness. Also, the 90% of women, especially girls in various school at the tertiary level, use condoms as preventives methods in pregnancies. This is because, the condom is easy to use and has virtually no side effect after use. Therefore students both male and female prefer to use them, apart from deriving sexual pleasures they perceived prevention of pregnancy gives them assurance (Uzodike, 2003; Alani, 2002 and Adedoyin, 2004).</p> <p><strong>1.1     Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The problem of unwanted pregnancy among adolescents or teenagers of school age, has been a daily concern to both parents and teachers, and even the youths themselves. This is because many youngsters, especially the female ones, have abruptly stopped schooling due to problem of unprotected sexual activities such as sex without condom and or without taking pills after sex. Findings shows that majority of our youth have even contracted the sexually transmitted diseases (STD), apart from the unwanted pregnancies, this has cut short the lives of most youths in terms of contacting the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome and the HIV. While some others have ended their educational careers, through their premature pregnancies.</p> <p>The above problems resulted in the investigation of the perception of undergraduates towards the use of contraceptives at the University of Lagos.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p><p> The objectives of this study include </p> <p>1)           To find out whether undergraduates students take contraceptives or not.</p> <p>2)           To investigate whether there is relationship between the use of contraceptives and avoidance of pregnancy.</p> <p>3)           To examine the pregnancy rate among undergraduate students of University of Lagos.</p> <p>4)           To assess the level of awareness of contraceptives among female students at University of Lagos.</p> <p>5)           To identify the different types of contraceptives available for students use.</p> <p>6)           To find out whether there is gender differences in the use of contraceptives amongst students.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions:</p> <p>1.            Do undergraduate students take contraceptives or not?</p> <p>2.            Was there any relationship between the use of contraceptives and avoidance of pregnancies?</p> <p>3.            To what extent can the pregnancy rate among undergraduate students of University of Lagos be examined?</p> <p>4.            Was there high pregnancy rate among undergraduates of University of Lagos due to non-use of contraceptives?</p> <p>5.            How can the different types of contraceptives be identified?</p> <p>6.            Is there gender difference in the use of contraceptives among students at the University of Lagos?</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The following hypotheses were formulated and tested in this study:</p> <p>2.            There will be no relationship between students perception and the use of contraceptives.</p> <p>3.            There will be no significant relationship between students attitudes and their use of contraceptives.</p> <p>4.            There will be no significant gender difference in the use of contraceptives among students.</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study will be beneficial to the following individuals:</p> <p>1.            Students who are in the tertiary institutions, especially at the University of Lagos, would find this study very helpful because the findings and recommendations would be help them identify some of the important contraceptives that are available for use and their effectiveness in preventing pregnancy and contracting of diseases such as HIV/AIDS, syphilis etc. This study would enable students to know the most save and effective contraceptives to take in order to avoid after effects. This study will enable students to not only identify some available contraceptives, but know their strengths and weaknesses.</p> <p>2.            Teachers would equally benefit from the recommendations and findings of this study because it will enable them to identify some contraceptives students use; their effectiveness or otherwise even their after effects to students health and vitality. Teachers (Lecturers) would find this study quite revealing as its finding would go a long way in helping the perception of their students towards the use of some contraceptives and their effects on them.</p> <p>3.            Parent would find this study very useful as its findings and recommendations would help them to identify some important contraceptives needed by their children at school, especially the undergraduate students at the University of Lagos. This study will help parents know the most effective contraceptives and their usefulness or otherwise to their children at school. With the findings and recommendations of this study, parents would be able to identify some of the contraceptives that may be useful to them also, in their family planning.</p> <p>4.            The Federal Ministry of Health will see this study as a great asset, as its findings and recommendations would enable the ministry to be abreast with the challenges facing those who use contraceptives that are not effective especially the fake ones and this knowledge will assist the ministry to tackle the problem of fake and adulterate drugs in Nigeria.</p> <p>5.            The society will also benefit from this study because the content of this study will help people in the larger society to appreciate the roles contraceptives play in birth and population control. This study will be a reference point to both students, new researchers, old researchers and the general public.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong><strong>Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study examines the perception of undergraduate students toward the use of contraceptives at the University of Lagos, Akoka in the Mainland Local Government Area of Lagos State. In this study, finance, time, sourcing of materials and other logistics would be some constrain on the completion of this project work.</p> <p><strong>1.7</strong><strong>Delimitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study is set to examine the perception of the University of Lagos undergraduates’ perceptions towards the use of contraceptives. The study was carried out at the Faculty of Education, University of Lagos, Akoka, in Mainland Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.8</strong><strong>Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>Operational terms were defined in this study in the following ways:</p> <p>(1)         <strong>Contraception:</strong> Birth control by prevention of conception or impregnation. This refers to the most common method of sterilization. The most effective temporary methods are nearly 99% effective if used consistently and correctly.</p> <p>(2)         <strong>Consistency:</strong> This is a term which refers to the continued rate or frequency things happen or take place. It means repeated occurrence of an event.</p> <p>(3)         <strong>Reproduction:</strong> This means the process by which organisms replicate themselves, assuring the continuation of their species. The two basic forms are asexual and sexual. Asexual reproduction (e.g. fission, spore formation regeneration and vegetative reproduction) produces an offspring generally identical to its single parent. Sexual reproduction produces a new individual through the union of special sex cells (gametes) usually from different parents.</p> <p>(4)         <strong>Pregnancy:</strong> This refers to the process of human gestation that takes place in the female’s body as a fetus to birth. It begins from when a male sperm contact with the female egg in the fallopian tube.</p> <p>(5)         <strong>Perception:</strong> This is the process of registering sensory stimuli as meaningful experience. The dividing line between sensation and perception has varied according to how the terms are defined.</p>                                                           \n\nPERCEPTION OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TOWARDS THE USE OF CONTRACEPTIVES <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PERCEPTION OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TOWARDS THE USE OF CONTRACEPTIVES ", "id": 35}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The study examined the relationship between parental roles and early childhood education and its development. A detailedliterature was  reviewed in relevant subheadings. The descriptive research design was used in order to assess the opinions of the respondents using the questionnaire and the sampling technique. A total of 300 (Three Hundred) respondents (made up of 150 males and 150 females) were selected and used in this study as the sample of the study which represented the entire population of the study. Four research questions were raised in the study and were analyzed together with the bio-data of the respondents using the simple percentage frequency counts, while four null hypotheses were formulated and tested using both the Pearson's Product Moment Correlation Coefficient and the  independent t-test statistical tools at 0.05 level of significance. At the end of the data analyses, the following results emerged: there is a significant relationship between parental role and children’s academic performance, there is a significant difference between the academic performance of children reared by intact parents and those reared by single parents, there is a significant gender difference in the academic performance of children reared by intact parents hose reared by single parents and finally, there is a significant difference between the attitudes of children reared by intact parents and those reared by single parent. With the above results, it is summarized that there is a positive relationship between parental role and children's academic achievement. Based on the conclusions of this study, the researcher recommended certain number of measures to the parents,  government, teachers and the society that will be useful in promoting the early childhood education programme that will breed a healthy future leader of the Nation.</p> <p><br/><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The quality of life for a child and the contributions the child makes to the society as an adult can be traced back to the first few years of life. From birth until about five years old, a child undergoes tremendous growth and change. If this period of life includes support for growth in cognition, language, motor skills, adaptive skills and social-emotional functioning, the child is more likely to succeed in school and later contribute meaningfully to the society. A good early childhood care and education provides the intervention programmes that support children’s survival growth, development and learning including health, nutrition and hygiene, cognitive, social, physical and emotional development from birth to entry into primary school in formal, informal and non-formal settings, United Nations Educational and Scientific Cultural  Organization (UNESCO, 2007).</p> <p>Anyakogu (2010), states that the primary location for early childhood education and development is the home. This is because, the home is the first contact the child had in order to interact effectively with both parents and siblings. The home is a place, where learning begins for the child. A place the child learns how to respect parents and to</p> <p>imitate and recognize people around him. Traditionally, the responsibility for child care in Nigeria as elsewhere in Africa rests on the extended family and the wider community. These members of the society contribute to the upbringing of the child, providing him or her with a wide range of stimulating interactions that will affect the child’s development positively, especially in psycho-social terms.</p> <p>In recent decades, rapid urbanization has increasingly eroded this traditional pattern of the child care. Hodges (2009) observed that “’for the approximately one third of families who now live in the cities, the mutual support that was a prominent nature of rural life has given way to situation where each household is to a large extent responsible on its own for the care of children”. Living in cities implies that many mothers are engaged outside the home or otherwise for most part of the day and this has implication for child upbringing in the family (Adeleke, 2009).</p> <p> This is because, many parents’ love and burning desires for paid job and monetary reward, in order to make the family more comfortable and to meet up with the payment of other home bills, have taken over parents’ love and care for their children. This has caused many parents to leave their children at the hand of immature house-helps and nannies, hence poor growth and development of the child in the society and the school.</p> <p>Parental roles in early childhood development are varied. The quality of care given to young children affects their development. Parents and in particular mothers, are responsible for feeding, hygiene in the house as well as the response to illness in young children. For babies, mothers breast milk offer the best and most complete food. Breast milk provides babies with antibodies, which help to keep off the risk of illness (Leon, 2011). Parents especially mothers who are engaged in routine jobs, do not have time to feed the baby with adequate breast milk. Also, due to education and civilization, most mothers believe that breast feeding the baby will affect their breasts and thereby making them to look older than their ages, they fail to breast feed their babies within the required period. This has caused most children to have poor growth and social development, and by extension, poor academic achievement in school.</p> <p>Monde (2012) claims that the early introduction of other liquids and solids if prepared in unhygienic conditions increases the likelihood of infection, often resulting in potentially life threatening conditions like diarrhea. Exclusive breast feeding in the first six months of life is enough to support the growth and development of babies and this should be complemented with high quality foods until about 24 months of age to sustain the rate of growth. Adequate care and nutrition lays a solid foundation for proper early childhood</p> <p><br/></p> <p>development. This is because proper nutrition aids brain growth necessary for intellectual, cognitive as well as psycho-motor development in the child.</p> <p>The home serves as the take-off point of this development. The child who is usually helpless depends on maternal stimulation for the development of proper physical and physiological functioning. This includes toileting, feeding and bathing (Ayo, 2010). Toileting and feeding training for the baby in the early life of the child is very crucial and necessary for the child’s later years of life. For example, within the ages of 2 to 3 years some children are able to feed themselves rightly with the use of the spoon without assistance while some cannot do that. Some children know when they are pressed to use the toilet  before they wet up their clothes. This can only be made possible if parents, especially mothers are available and have time to take their responsibilities at this crucial time of the child’s development and growth.</p> <p>The mother is the first important person in a baby’s world. How she behaves to the child is crucial in establishing a feeling of comfort and security. According to Esu (2010), “insufficiency of maternal care is detrimental to development during the early years as the child grows. It is the responsibility of both parents to lead children through the early years, providing them with adequate nutrition, stimulation, good values, and good health habits. It is also a parental role to teach children the language of their immediate environment. They should help children to communicate with the family and with their peers (Amadi and Amadi, 2009). This is because, if children are taught how to communicate with family members and peers at the early age or stage, it help them to acquire or learn good behaviours and positive social adjustment in the society and at school even when they grow up as adolescents and adults. For instance, they would learn how to respect the older members of the society in terms of greeting, making requests and so on. They also learn how to express themselves so as to acquire knowledge further from others in the community.</p> <p>Children learn at different times. Often by the time a child is twelve months, he or she can pronounce a few words, and by the time the child is five or six years, he/she can communicate very well. It is the duty of parents and the home to ensure language development, especially in the early years while the school reinforces this later (Ayodeji, 2012). This is because, by the time parents teach their children how to speak good languages that are acceptable in the society and avoiding the bad languages that are frowned at by the society, they become good members of the society that would grow and maintain a decent society or family structure.</p> <p>Language acquisition is critical as it establishes personal and group</p> <p><br/></p> <p>identity. It is also a basis for social interactions and for the development of cognitive processes. Since parents have a special interest in their children, it should be maximized for their best interests especially in the home, in an atmosphere of conduciveness. This is because a conducive environment stimulates cognitive, affective and psychomotor development of the child (Ofo, 2009).</p> <p>A necessity for early childhood care and development; ignorance of the law, they say is not an admissible excuse. Thus, ignorance on the part of parents in the upbringing of their children is unacceptable, as it may affect children’s growth and development negatively. This corroborates the observation of Ogbonna (2011) which says that “where there is ignorance of the needs of the child at the different stages of development, there is bound to occur practices which are detrimental to the child’s personality development”. Therefore, this calls for early childhood care in order to develop the total child.</p> <p>Times are changing and   should be dynamic enough to move according to the times. There was a time when everyone in the whole community took care of the child who does not even belong to them. That time is gone. A child is now for most part of early childhood, left in the care of parents who must be knowledgeable enough to handle them. Parents therefore, should acquire the right methods of child</p> <p><br/></p> <p>upbringing, whether traditional or modern. Parents should be made to understand that harshness to children often breeds delinquency and thick skin which may manifest later in the lives of these children (Adeduro, 2008). Hence, some childrengrow to be the pride of their parents while some bring disgrace and shame to their parents. Late in life due to manner they were being nurtured.</p> <p>The idea of not “sparing the rod” so as not to “spoil the child’ should be exercised with caution, as Ogbonna (2009) rightly observes, it “may prove too harsh and disastrous for the child’s moral and other aspects of personality development”. Parents should learn to direct the lives of children towards positive development. they should learn to inculcate in their children, the correct attitude towards moral and ethical values. This will help them to have the required discipline for living in a society like ours. Parents are indispensable in early childhood development because this stage of development affects the later stages depending on how they are brought up by parents. So, early childhood development sets the tone for adult living (Ofo, 2009).</p> <p>The family is the first point of call of a child. Here, the child experiences the first social interactions, learn his or her first language and develops relevant attitudes to life. The implication therefore is that the child is first a product of his or her family and how the child relates to the larger society depends on the experiences made available to him or her in the family. Parents being the closest allies in early childhood, it is important that for positive and meaningful development of the child, parents must be properly “schooled” and experienced in the art of child upbringing (Adeleke, 2008).</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The problem inherent in the parental academic achievement and development of children at the early childhood level cannot be overemphasized because parents are the first teachers of their children. Unfortunately these days, some parents play negative roles in the upbringing of their children.</p> <p>The ages 0–8 years require proper parental care and education in all ramifications. If appropriate, correct care and education are not given to the children at this stage, it will lead to children’s acquisition of negative characters devoid of decent society’s expectations. Some parents love their jobs than their children. Such parents have little or no time to stay with their children, nurture and interact with them to know their feelings.</p> <p>There were cases where minor injuries at home generated to complications due to lack of parental care and love. There were cases where children would either told their parents to come back to pick them from schools or sometimes would preferred to remain in the school rather than go home with their parents.</p> <p>Some parents cannot define the role of parents from the role of school, until such children are sent home for either unkept hair, teeth, uniform, socks etc that the parents would know what to do. All these factors have contributed to the down-ward performance of children from most families.</p> <p>The above problems gave rise to this study as it examined parental roles on early childhood education and its development in Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study seeks to ascertain the relationship between parental roles and early childhood education and development.</p> <p>The specific objectives include:</p> <p>1.      To assess the extent to which parental role affects children’s academic performance.</p> <p>2.      To find out whether there is any significant difference in the academic performance of children who are reared by intact parents and those reared by single parents.</p> <p>3.      To find out whether there is any significant difference in the attitudes of children reared by intact parent and those reared by single parents.</p> <p>4.      To find out the gender difference between the academic performance of children brought up by intact parents and those brought up by single parents.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Research Questions</strong></p> <p>1.      To what extent do parental roles affect children’s academic performance?</p> <p>2.      Will there be any significant difference between the academic performance of children reared by intact parents and those reared by single parents?</p> <p>3.      Will there be any significant difference in the attitudes of children reared by intact parents and those reared by single parents?</p> <p>4.      Will there be any significant gender difference in the academic performance of children who were brought up by intact parents and those brought up by single parents?</p> <p><strong>1.5 Research Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>1.      There is no significant relationship between parental roles and children’s academic performance.</p> <p>2.      There is no significant difference between the academic performance of children reared by intact parents and those reared by single parents.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>3.      There is no significant difference in the attitudes of children reared by intact parents and those reared by single parents.</p> <p>4.      There is no significant gender difference in the academic performance of children reared by intact parents and those reared by single parents.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>It is a general belief that early childhood education is of great importance, because it is the foundation for other levels of education, just as a well laid foundation is the strength of the structure.

During this period, the child experiences accelerated rate of development in secondary sex attributes.</p> <p>These include broken voice, natural emission in boy and enlarged breast in girls; armpit and public hairs in boys and girls and the development of heterosexual interests, coupled with this, is elongated and expansion of penis, enlargement of testis and other primary sex organs (New Jersey, 1980).</p> <p>The Secondary School age or adolescent stage is the period of identifying oneself to a total person. It is the period or stage in which the individual adolescent asks questions about themselves. The search for answers involves much explanation, question and seeking supportive figures. Peers are mostly the supporter because they are the ones with whom the lines of communication are most open. Parental influence therefore, may seem to be minimal while peers influence is stronger.</p> <p><strong>1.2 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>According to history, sexual activities have served as means of expressing some mankind’s best and worst emotion (Read and Greene, 1975)</p> <p>A cursory review of human activities extending from the beginning of recorded history throughout the Dark Age and renaissance reveals the instances of Rape, adultery and illegitimacy (Greene, 1975)</p> <p>The situation has not changed much in contemporary time. Efforts are however being made  by health education experts, religious leaders, youth clubs and organisation to bring a positive attitude change in people education of children and youths about their sexually and appropriate sex roles.</p> <p>The sex life of Senior Secondary School (SSS) students poses a social problem which society has ignored primarily because it has workable and acceptable answer (Grauley Stewart Diaz 1973).</p> <p>The youths of this generation have more opportunity than ever before to indulge sexual intercourse because three controlling fears of the past, social disgrace, venereal disease, unwanted pregnancy have been reduced by breakthrough in medicine and related discipline. Also diversified job opportunities enable parents to travel great distance for better career and recreation. This reduced the effectiveness of family and community supervision of the adolescent (Grauley et al 1973).</p> <p>Apart from social disapproval of adolescent sexual later experimentation, there are serious health related problems. These include exposure to venereal diseases and its medical consequence due to delayed and appropriate treatment, prostitution, abortion, by quacks, the use of questionable method of birth control and finally premature termination of education which increased social liabilities.</p> <p>There are efforts to deal openly and constructively with these sex related problems some of which is that, children should know about venereal disease by the time they reach the age of puberty. Information of this kind should be linked with advice on the value of self-restrain and should stress the idealistic views of the union of man and woman in marriage. Also proper understanding and appropriate sex education will be remedy to teenage pregnancies in Nigeria.</p> <p>The present generation of Nigeria Secondary School Student are much more younger than those of the last decade, this is due to new innovation in Nigeria education as well as the awareness and concern of parents in sending their children to school at a much tender age.</p> <p>Although, they are younger in chronological age, they mature much earlier than predecessors. This was attributed to better nutrition, improved standard of living and health care services. In order to be of assistance to the adolescent in adjusting to the demand of the society in sex, there is need for a thorough understanding of the adolescents especially with respect to their attitudes of sex.</p> <p>The parent and communities attitude towards sexually or sexual behaviour was that of comparison between their own generation and that of the present generation of the youths.</p> <p>Assumptions and speculative reports about Senior Secondary Student’s sexual attitudes are inconsistent regarding changes in students’ sexual attitudes. For instance, it is generally assumed that there has been a great increase in numbers of active Secondary Schools in the recent past. But is it really the case?</p> <p>This and related questions are what the study is set  about to investigate and come out with the correct data related to Senior Secondary School Student sex attitudes in the recent years.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of the study was to identify the sexual attitudes of the Senior Secondary School Students so as to serve as basis for the introduction of sex instruction or sex education in our Secondary Schools.</p> <p>The study will also look at the extent of such behaviour among the Secondary School Student and their attitudes towards current trend in their sex life. This would probably serve as a source of information for those responsible for the welfare of the adolescent, that is, Parents, Teachers, Federal and State Ministry of Social Development, Youth and Sports.</p> <p><strong>1.4 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The problem of the study is to determine the sexual attitudes of the Senior Secondary School Students in Ikorodu Local Government Area. To determine the sexual attitudes among the students, the study was designed to answer the following questions</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1.      Will student’s religious beliefs affect their sexual attitudes</p> <p>2.      Will the family’s level of education affect student’s sexual experience?</p> <p>3.      Will there be difference between male and female sexual initiation?</p> <p>4.      What is the level of sexual discussion among the adolescent peer group and parents?</p> <p><strong>1.6 HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>The following hypothesis will be tested in this study:</p> <p>1.           There will be no significant difference in the sexual attitudes exhibited by religious and non-religious students.</p> <p>2.           There will be no significant difference between student from highly educated family and student from less educated family as far as sexual experience is concerned.</p> <p>3.           There will be no significant difference in the sexual initiation between male and female adolescent students.</p> <p>4.           There is no significant difference in the level of sexual discussion among the adolescent peer group and parents.</p> <p><strong>1.7 DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The research narrowed the scope of the study to few Secondary Schools in Ikorodu Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p>Ikorodu Grammar School, Ikoyi, … The Study were limited to Senior Secondary School Classes 2 and 3 male and female students alone because they constituted adolescent age group of 14 – 19 years where sexual personality traits had been quite established and pronounced for significant study.</p> <p><strong>1.8 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>1.      The importance of the study is that of revealing the sexual attitudes of Senior Secondary School Students despite the disapproval of the society towards pre-marital sexual behaviour.</p> <p>2.      To identify the source of information about sex and how sex education in schools can prevent pre-marital sexual activity, spread venereal diseases and teenage pregnancy in our schools and the society at large.</p> <p>3.      The findings of the study could also be used as formative evaluation procedure to determine the direction of the programme of sex instruction in our schools.</p> <p>4.      It may also serve as reference for present and future sex education research in Nigeria, because the controversies which its findings may generates are expected to be ground for future research as well as awakening the realization of the need for family life as sex education as a formal academic discipline in Nigerian Secondary Schools.</p> <p><strong>1.9 DEFINITIONS OF TERMS</strong></p>

investigated the influence of communication on attitude towards mother-in-law among female married adults in Lagos Metropolis.</p> <p>In carrying out the study, four null hypotheses were postulated to provide direction. The study consisted of one hundred randomly selected samples. The instrument used for data collection was a self-designed questionnaire by the researcher of a 4 point Likert format. Both one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Independent t-test Statistical Techniques were used for data analysis. The results of the analysis showed that:</p> <p>1.     Communication style does not have a significant influence on the attitude of daughter-in-law towards their mother-in-law.</p> <p>2.     Cultural background does not have a significant influence on the attitude of daughter-in-law towards their mother-in-law.</p> <p>3.     Educational background does not have a significant influence on the attitude of daughter-in-law towards their mother-in-law.</p> <p>4.     Ethnic background has a significant influence on the attitude of daughter-in-law towards their mother-in-law.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Marriage is a choice. That may not be a definition of marriage, but that is nevertheless a fact of marriage (Warren, 1990). “You don’t marry a person, you marry a family”. So goes the conventional folk wisdom neatly summing up a fact of life. The institutions of marriage and family are inevitably intertwined. When two people choose to get married, they are also choosing the integration of two families (Lau, 2005). Sociologically, that is what a marriage is about: the integration of twp families. After marriage, her family and his family will likely come to be considered jointly as “our folks”. That is the intended meaning of marriage. In practical terms, a brother-in-law is treated as a brother, a sister-in-law is treated as a sister, and a mother-in-law is treated as one’s own mother (Byng-Hall, 1980).</p> <p> The US Bureau of the Census (1986:116) defines the term family as “a group of two persons or more (one of whom is the householder) related by birth, marriage, or adoption, and residing together. Most of us live out a large share of our lives in some form of family or another. We can easily see that family cannot be ignored if we want to understand the societal patterns and processes all around us. This is because the social relationships called family is such an important part of the society. In fact no society has existed without some sort of social arrangements that may be labelled kinship or family.</p> <p>Family relationships are never fixed; they change as the self and the significance of other family members grow older, and as the changing society influences their respective lives (Riley, 1983). Family experts report that in reality the most difficult relationship is the one between the mother-in-law and her daughter-in-law. Conflicts between wives and their mothers-in-law do not just happen. They need an arena, just as germs and viruses need an environment to breed (Lau, 2005). There must first be a common area in which both the wife and her mother-in-law are in constant contact. If the wife and her mother-in-law do not meet each other at all and each of them just lives her own life, there would, in theory, be no problem at all between them, because there is no contact. No contact, no conflict. It’s as simple as that. It is like saying if there were no marriages, there would be no divorces (Philips, 1995).</p> <p>When you play badminton or tennis, there is hardly any chance of you crashing into your opponent unless you are playing like a chimpanzee. This is because each of you has your own court. When you play a game like squash, however, you have to be very careful not to crash into your opponent, or smash his head with your racquet (Lau, 2005). The interaction between the wife and her mother-in-law is like the game of squash, where there are lots of opportunities for both players to be in contact with and crash into each other (Silverstein, 1992).</p> <p>Interpersonal communication is an integral part of human experience. Moreover, our interpersonal skills are highly relevant to adjustment, because they can be critical to our happiness and success in life. There is a need to be aware that communication can be effective or ineffective depending on what transpires between the speaker and the hearer and care should be taken not be an ineffective communication (Byng-Hall, 1980).</p> <p>Communication can be defined as the process of sending and receiving messages that have meaning. Berlo (1960) has divided the interpersonal communication process into four basic components: the source of the message, the message itself, the channel in which the message is sent and the receiver of the message.</p> <p>The source is the person who initiates, or sends the message. The message is the information or meaning that is transmitted from one person to another. The channel refers to the medium through which the message reaches the receiver and the receiver is the person to whom the message is targeted.</p> <p>Communication is more effective and less problematic when people have similar frames of reference (Clark, 1985). Communication with others- friends, lovers, parents, spouses, children, employers, in-laws- is such an essential and common place aspect of our lives that it’s hard to overstate the importance of being able to communicate effectively. Moreover, many of life’s satisfactions and frustrations and heartaches as well hinge on our ability to communicate effectively with others. For examples, research has shown that married couples who perceive themselves as effective communicators are more likely to be happily, rather than unhappily married (Yelsma, 1984). Conversely, poor communication is reported to be the most common problem among couples who seek marriage counselling (Beck &amp; Jones, 1973).</p> <p>Communication is effective when the message we intend to convey is the message that is actually received. Therefore, it entails both the accurate transmission of a message and the accurate reception of a message (Hahn, 2000).</p> <p>A communication barrier is anything in the communication process that inhibits or blocks the accurate transmission and reception of messages. Barriers to effective communication can reside in the source, the receiver or sometimes in both. Common barriers to effective communication include defensiveness, carelessness, self-preoccupation, collusion and instigation of unnecessary conflict.</p> <p>The most basic barrier to effective communication is defensiveness-an excessive concern with protecting oneself from being hurt. We are prone to react defensively when we feel threatened (Gibb, 1961). When a person consistently instigates unnecessary conflict with others, this contentiousness sets up barriers to effective communication. Such behaviours come in a variety of forms (Nye, 1973). Some people tend to deliberately annoy and provoke others to get a “rise” out of them.</p> <p>When intergenerational conflicts occur, it typically involves the wife and her mother-in-law. In fact, in-law trouble has been characterized as a “female problem”, perhaps because women have traditionally shouldered the responsibility for maintaining kinship ties (Marotz-Baden &amp; Cowan, 1987). Fischer (1983) found that wives tend to turn to their own mothers for help after giving birth. Yet they may regard their mother-in-law’s concern over her new grandchild as “interference”.</p> <p>The mother-in-law/daughter-in-law impasse is a tragedy, dividing women who have much in common, and who could benefit from one another’s friendship. It causes great unhappiness to mother-in-law, who feels her overtures of friendship are rebuffed, and who fear their connection with their son and grandchildren may be threatened by the daughter’s-in-law hostility. It causes distress to the daughter-in-law, who feels judged and pressured, particularly on matters involving her role as a woman in the family (Apter, 1991).</p> <p> Simmel (1955) made another important point by stressing that both conflict and cooperation are ways human beings relate to each other. When there is conflict between the wife and the mother-in-law, this should not create a rift if there is effective communication between the two. If information is shared between the two women at all times as necessary, there will be an understanding of self which will create a positive attitude by the wife towards the mother-in-law.</p> <p>Communication is the key to any friendship especially with the one woman in the world who loves your husband as much as you do. After investing 18 years or more of her life in this man, she’s unprepared for him to “disappear” into the world you two create. Beginning the habit of communication with your mother-in-law can be as easy as responding to her efforts hence the study.</p> <p><strong>1.2 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND</strong></p> <p>Social psychologists like Kurt Lewin (1947) define a close relationship as a relatively long-lasting relationship in which two people interact frequently and engage in a variety of mutual activities and in which the impact of their interactions is strong. There are many different types of close relationships. Closeness may occur in friendships, work relationships and family relationships.</p> <p>Social exchange theory postulates that interpersonal relationships are governed by perceptions of the rewards and costs exchanged in interactions. According to this theory, interactions between acquaintances, friends, lovers and in-laws are likely to continue as long as the participants feel that the benefits they derive from the relationship are reasonable in comparison to the costs (Kelley &amp; Thibaut, 1978).</p> <p>Scholars have conceptualized social change in multiple ways. Social science scholars of communication focus on persuasion, including how beliefs, attitudes, and/or behaviours in a society are created, modified, or reinforced (O’Keefe, 1990). To bring change, persuasion scholars have grappled with filling what is called the KAP gap- that is, the gap between an individual’s knowledge, attitudes, and practices (Rogers, Vaughan, Swalehe, Rao, Svenkerud, &amp; Sood 1999).</p> <p>Reciprocity involves liking those who show that they like us. In general, it does appear that liking breeds liking and loving (Byrne &amp; Murnen, 1988). Studies suggest that we like people more when they give us positive evaluations that match our self-concepts as opposed to positive evaluations that contradict our self-concepts (Berscheid, 1985; Shrauger, 1976).</p> <p>To George Simmel (1950), reciprocity was the stuff of everyday life. He observed how people give to each other, receive from each other and take from each other. One person acts, the other reacts, and the actions and attitudes of each. Levine et all 1976, says “all human interactions should be viewed as kinds of exchange”. He thus laid the ground work for the sociological approach that has come to be known as exchange theory (Simmel, 1950).</p> <p>Attribution theory tries to explain human behaviour. Heider  (1958) was the  first  to propose  a  psychological theory  of  attribution, but  Weiner  and  colleagues  (Jones et  al, 1972;  Weiner,  1986) developed a theoretical framework that has become a major  research  paradigm of social  psychology. Heider (1958) discussed what he called ‘naive’ or ‘commonsense’ psychology. In his view, people were like amateur scientists, trying to understand other people’s behaviour by piecing together information until they arrived at a reasonable explanation or cause.</p> <p>Attribution theory is concerned with how individuals interpret events and how this relates to their thinking and behaviour. Attribution theory assumes that people try to determine why people do what they do. A person seeking to understand why another person did something may attribute one or more causes to that behaviour.</p> <p>According to Heider (1958) a person can make two attributions:</p> <p>1.     Internal attribution: the inference that a person is behaving in a certain way because of something about the person, such as attitude, character or personality.</p> <p>2.     External attribution: the inference that a person is behaving a certain way because of something about the situation he or she is in.</p> <p>Our attributions are also significantly driven by our emotional and motivational drives. Blaming other people and avoiding personal recrimination are very real self-serving attributions. We will also make attributions to defend what we perceive as attacks.</p> <p>Attribution theory can be applied to the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationship. The daughter-in-law who already has a stereotyped idea of dealings between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law will be biased in her interaction with her mother-in-law. Any occasion to attribute behaviour to the stereotype will be an opportunity to portray the mother-in-law in a bad light. The mother-in-law is not free from such set ideas about her daughter-in-law. For instance, mothers-in-law believe the wives want to displace them totally out of their son’s life as soon as they are married. If the wife should exhibit any behaviour which threatens the mother-in-law, this will be seen as an affront and attributed to the typical behaviour of wives and no deeper reflection would be entertained to see if there is an unseen reason for that behaviour.</p> <p>Attitude is a hypothetical construct that represents an individual’s like or dislike for an item (Jung, 1966). Attitudes are positive, negative or neutral views of an ‘attitude object’, that is, a person, behaviour or event. People can also be ‘ambivalent’ towards a target, meaning that they simultaneously possess a positive and a negative bias towards the attitude in question.</p> <p>Attitudes come from judgements. Attitudes develop on the ABC model (affect, behavioural change and cognition). The affective response is a physiological response that expresses an individual’s preference for an entity. The behavioural intention is a verbal indication of the intention of an individual. The cognitive response is a cognitive evaluation of the entity to form an attitude. Most attitudes in individuals are a result of observational learning from their environment. The link between attitude and behaviour exists but depends on human behaviour, some of which is irrational. For example, a person who is in favour of blood transfusion may not donate blood. This makes sense if the person does not like the sight of blood, which explains this irrationality.</p> <p>Unlike personality, attitudes are expected to change as a function of experience. Tesser (1993) has argued that hereditary variables may affect attitudes-but believes that they may do so indirectly. For example, if one inherits the disposition to become an extrovert, this may affect one’s attitude to certain styles of music. There are numerous theories of attitude formation and attitude change.</p> <p>Consistency theory implies that we must be consistent in our beliefs and values. People expect consistency; we have a strong preference for consistency in our lives. We want things to work the same way every time they happen. Thus, we have ‘mental worlds’ of our expectancies about the world, the people in them, and our relationships with the world and other people. The glue that holds all these mental relationships together is consistency. Consistency becomes like a form of human gravity. It helps us to understand the world and our place in it.</p> <p>The most famous example of Consistency Theory is Dissonance Theory associated with Leon Festinger. Dissonance is as a result of inconsistencies. According to Festinger (1957), as much as we need consistency, there are many occasions where things occur in surprising and unexpected ways. There is an inconsistency between what we expected and what we got. Dissonance is simply a technical term for the cognitive, emotional, physiological and behavioural state that arises when things do not go the way we expected them to.</p> <p>Dissonance is an unpleasant experience which we want to get rid of when we have it. We want to get back to the state of consistency, back to where things make sense.</p> <p>We can get rid or reduce dissonance by denying it and pretending like it didn’t happen and swamping the dissonance and acknowledging that things didn’t work out like we expected at this time, but remembering all those other times when it did. The goal here is to overload all that bad dissonance with lots of good memories and thoughts. Also we can change our expectancy and here we try to alter in some real way something that really did happen and lastly we can change our evaluation of the event. Instead of responding with dissonant thoughts, we actually change our evaluation and find the best possible outcome.</p> <p>Dissonance theory is applicable to mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationship. There are certain expectations of the wife by the mother-in-law. Such attitude as submissiveness, respect, obedience and dedication especially when she is on a visit to the family. The daughter-in-law also has a certain expectations of the mother-in-law. Some of these are being a role model to her, a support within the husband’s family, being there for the grandchildren etc. When these expectations are not being fulfilled by both women, there is a state of dissonance. They would have to deal with these situations by denying that anything is amiss, swamping the dissonance with good memories and thoughts of their mother and daughter, changing their expectancy and sometimes changing the evaluation of events between them to see a brighter side of it.</p> <p><strong>FACTORS THAT AFFECT ATTITUDE CHANGE</strong></p> <p>Attitudes can be changed through persuasion. In Hovland’s (1960) view, we should understand attitude change as a “response to communication”. He and his colleagues did experimental research into the factors that can affect the persuasiveness of a message and enumerated the following:</p> <p>1.     Target characteristics are characteristics that refer to the person who receives and processes a message. The first is intelligence trait and the result is that more intelligent people are less easily persuaded by one-sided messages. Another variable is self esteem and there is some evidence that the relationship between self-esteem and there is some evidence that the relationship between self-esteem and persuasibility is actually curvilinear, with people of moderate self-esteem being more easily persuaded than both those of high and low self-esteem levels (Rhodes &amp; Woods, 1992).</p> <p>2.     Source characteristics- the major source characteristics are expertise, trustworthiness and interpersonal attraction/attractiveness. The credibility of a perceived message has been found to be a key variable here (Hovland &amp; Weiss, 1951); if one reads a report on health and believes it comes from a professional medical journal, one may be more easily persuaded than if one believes it is from a popular newspaper.</p> <p>3.     Message characteristics- here the nature of the message plays a role in persuasion. Sometimes presenting both sides of a story is useful to help change attitudes.</p> <p>4.     Cognitive routes- A message can appeal to an individual’s cognitive evaluation to help change an attitude. In the central route to persuasion the individual is presented with the data and motivated to evaluate the data and arrive at an attitude changing conclusion. In the peripheral route to attitude change, the individual is encouraged to not look at the content but at the source. This is commonly seen in modern advertisements that feature celebrity/celebrities. In some cases, physician/doctors and experts are used. In other cases film stars are used for their attractiveness.</p> <p>Attitudes are defined as a mental predisposition to act that is expressed by evaluating a particular entity with some degree of favour or disfavour. Individuals generally have attitudes that focus on objects, people or institutions. Attitudes are also attached to mental categories. Mental orientations towards concepts are generally referred to as values. Attitudes comprise four components:</p> <p>a.     <strong>Cognitions</strong> are our beliefs, theories, expectations, cause and effect beliefs and perceptions relative to the focal object.</p> <p>b.     <strong>Affective </strong>component refers to our feeling with respect to the focal object such as fear, liking or anger.</p> <p>c.      <strong>Behavioural Intentions</strong> are our goals, aspirations and our expected responses to the attitude object.</p> <p>d.     <strong>Evaluations </strong>are often considered the central component of attitudes. Evaluations consist of the imputation of some degree of goodness or badness to an attitude object. When we speak positive or negative towards an object, we are referring to the evaluative component. Evaluations are function of cognitive, affective and behavioural intentions of an object. It is most often the evaluation that is stored in memory, often without the corresponding cognitions and affect that were responsible for its formation (Hovland &amp; Weiss, 1951).</p> <p><strong>Persuasive Communication and Attitude Change</strong></p> <p>There are several ingredients for persuasive communication with regards to attitude change. First, the source must be credible. Second, it is implied that a message should be repetitive to be effective. Known as the sleeper effect, researchers have found that a persuasive message may have a greater delay impact than initial effect on receiver attitudes (Rajecki, 1999). A persuasive message aimed at attitude change must also be different than the receiver’s opinion. This is a straight forward concept-an attitude cannot be changed if it mimics the message attitude.</p> <p><strong>1.3 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The modern couple sees marriage solely as an integration of two individuals-just the husband and the wife. That seems to be the modern perception of a marriage. When the modern couple gets married, they often forget that it is not just a relationship between the two of them that has begun, but the relationship between the husband’s family, no matter how large, and the wife’s family, no matter how large. Problems somehow arise from this modern but much distorted perception of a marriage, because based on it; in-laws do not play important roles. Thus, brothers-in-law are not treated as brothers, sisters-in-law are not treated as sisters and mother-in-law is not treated as mother. When this happens, the relationship has begun on a wrong footing (Duval, 1954).</p> <p>This is why in some societies, marital partners are chosen based on parental arrangements and there is a restriction on the range of acceptable partners along religious and class lines (Bumiller, 1989)</p> <p>The issue of mother-in-law has often times generated serious conflict especially among female married adults. Most married women tend to believe that their mother-in-law intrude into their family by ‘babying’ the son or presenting herself as weak and therefore be ‘mothered’ by the son (Apter, 1990).</p> <p>Also some mothers-in-law are perceived to be overbearing, getting involved with the childcare of their grandchildren and housework in their son’s home. Some wanted to be in charge and expected to be treated as the head of the family even in their son’s home. The wife is treated not as a daughter but as an outsider whilst the son and all he represents is given a preference over and above what the wife might desire.</p> <p>A question to be raised is why daughters-in-law are so sensitive to what they perceive as lapses in a mother’s-in-law recognition of them. The answer may lie in the high demands they put on the response of a mother figure. Indeed, the touchiness or sensitivity often displayed by daughters-in-law to a mother’s-in-law behaviour is close to that of an adolescent’s to her mother (Apter, 1990). Many tensions, too, take place in the broader context of the work/family dilemma that is etched into so many of these women’s lives. They want to resist certain roles, but to protect others. So both a mother-in-law deference within the home (through offers to help) and her presumption of control within the home (playing hostess at a family meal, commenting on and controlling young children’s behaviour) are resented. However, a woman naturally have vested interests in the well-being of her son and grandchildren; and when the daughter-in-law perceives her remarks and behaviour within the home as attempt to manipulate the daughter-in-law into her ‘proper place’, the daughter-in-law perceptions may be accurate.</p> <p><strong>1.4 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the attitudes of mother-in-laws towards daughter-in-laws as a determinant factor in marital stability in some selected families in Lagos State. But specifically, the study will among other things seek to:</p> <p>i.            Determine the role of effective communication on the attitude of mother-in-laws towards their daughter-in-laws,</p> <p>ii.         Discuss the consequences of ineffective communication between mother-in-laws and daughter-in-laws in marital stability,</p> <p>iii.       To recommend ways to improve marital stability.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In order to provide direction for this study, the following questions are asked:</p> <p>i.            To what extent does communication style influence the attitude of daughter-in-laws towards their mother-in-laws?</p> <p>ii.         Is there any difference in attitude and communication of daughter-in-laws from different cultural background towards their mother-in-laws?</p> <p>iii.       Do married women with different educational background differ in their communication and attitude towards their mother-in-laws?</p> <p>iv.       Is there any difference in the attitude of daughter-in-laws towards their mother-in-laws due to ethnic background?</p> <p><strong>1.6 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>From the research questions, the following hypotheses are formulated to guide the study.</p> <p>1.     There is no significant influence of communication styles on attitude of daughter-in-laws towards their mother-in-laws.</p> <p>2.     The communication pattern of married women from different cultural background does not significantly influence their attitude towards their mother-in-laws.</p> <p>3.     There is no significant difference in the communication and attitude of married women with different educational background towards their mother-in-laws.</p> <p>4.     There is no significant difference in the attitude towards daughter-in-laws due to ethnic background from mother-in-laws.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is significant because many people will find it useful.

Of the approximately 40 million people afflicted with HIV/AIDS worldwide, the top threelocations are in nations of sub-Saharan Africa, with 25.4 million, cases, .followed by 9.6 million combined cases in nations of Asia Eastern Europe and 1 million cases in North America. A joint report on the AIDS pandemic by .UNAIDS and the WHO pointed to steep increases in HIV inflections in East Asia Eastern Europe and Central Asia between 2002-2004.</p> <p>Many World health bodies since the discovery of HIV / AIDS ·have been reporting frightening increases in the prevalence rates - the virus and syndrome, particularly between adolescent and youths. Half of the newly HIV infectedpersons are about 15,000. 6,000 per day and they are aged 15-,29 largely adolescents under which undergraduates' falls. This alarming rate of spread of HIV/ AIDS also includes Nigeria, where about 5.4% of adults (ages 15-49) are living with HIV / AIDS.</p> <p>University of Lagos, Akoka, Nigeria of about 35,000 populations with 100 different cultures and ethnic backgrounds. Student life in University of Lagos is very active and dynamic and since these students are youths therefore, it is a common thing to find them with common interests which can lead to best of times or worst of times or atime of marvelous new birth as a result of the friendship tie that are formed between boys and girls and that are often centered around sex.</p> <p>HIV voluntary testing is a process whereby an individual willingly accept to go for a HIV test and before the test is conducted, he or she is counseled, the counseling is aimed at enabling the client to cope with stress and take personal decision relating to HIV/AIDS. The counseling is provided to prevent further transmission of HIV and provide psychosocial support to those infected. After the counseling, HIV antibody test is conducted to identify the presence of antibodies to HIV in the blood and afterwards a ·post - test counseling is carried out which will depend on the test result.</p> <p>Research evidence show that undergraduate attitude towards HIV voluntary testing is a very important factor in knowing the HIV status of the population of a nation like Nigeria who is named among those countries where levels of knowledge of safe sex and HIV remain low. For instance, student who cultivate negative attitude towards voluntary testing are pure evidence that their perception about HIV/AIDS IS very poor therefore, there is the need for intense advocacy for voluntary counseling and testing and all undergraduates should endeavour to willingly go for voluntary HIV· test which will held in curbing the increasing number of HIV transmission.</p> <p>In the present circumstance. of this scourge of HIV/AIDS, voluntary counseling and testing is paramount and this is urgently needed, especially by the undergraduates who are seen as a vulnerable group and who are constantly influenced by the environment in which they live, particularly among their peers. Hence; there is the need for this research work to determine the attitude of undergraduates of the University of Lagos towards HIV voluntary testing.</p> <p>1.2 <strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The issue of increasing' number of HIV infections and AIDS have become a global debate, since the discovery of this killer virus reports have shown' the frightening increase in the prevalence rates of the virus and. syndrome, particularly among adolescent and youths.

society. Marriage is a social institution that is designed among other things by God to be enjoyed by humans and not to be endured. Since it involves two adults that comes together to live as one, conflicts will arise which will shake the union to its very foundation. Causes of the conflicts are numerous; some of them could be avoided with pre marital counselling, marriage counselling proper and post marital counselling to produce a stable family life.  </p> <p>Divorce is a total brake down of the marriage union without remedy. Some causes are lack of communication, lack of love for one another, lack of tolerance between the couple, barrenness in the typical African system, conflicts of individual roles and a host of others.</p> <p>The effects of divorce goes beyond just the couples, even beyond the immediate family members, also extends to the children’s future life because it affects their whole total life.  This research work considered the effect of divorce on the immediate family members in the area of the pupil’s attitude to examination, the moral performance of pupils from divorced parents, the academic performances and the pupil’s attitude to drugs and alcohol.</p> <p>From these effects, five hypotheses were developed and administered to four different schools in Surulere Local Government Area of Lagos State.

Marriage according to Olusanya (1982) is a sacred and permanent contract between a man and a woman who have consented to live a life of fidelity and caring for each other for the purpose of promoting their mutual growth and welfare throughout their lives.</p> <p>A family is the bedrock of any society. A healthy family produces a healthy and crime free individuals in a society, while an unhealthy and unstable family produces an unstable and criminal congested society or community. A man from a troubled home cannot be productive likewise a woman from an unstable home cannot be termed a “virtuous woman” which produces a healthy and uncultured off springs.</p> <p>Marriage… made in heaven! Marriage vows… taken to be together forever! The magical starting days of married life are full of dreams and pleasure. But as the time passes, many couples may begin to realize that they are not perfect for each other. They come to know about the huge differences between them; and feel that they are not compatible with each other. Small arguments may turn to big conflicts. Sometimes these conflicts cross the tolerance limit and make it difficult for the couple to live together and the couple starts thinking about breaking the relationship and getting separated. Yes, they wish to get a divorce!</p> <p>Divorce is a legal termination of marriage between a husband and wife. But why do marriages fail? It may be due to certain marital problems such as aggressiveness of one of the partners, physical or emotional abuse, alcohol or drug addiction, family stress and strain or infidelity of a partner. Whatever might be the reason, but divorce and separation is definitely painful for both the partners. And it’s not all only about the couple; it also affects the entire family, especially the children.</p> <p>The institution of marriage commands high social recognition importance in Nigeria. Traditional marriage grounds itself in an arrangement between families and not essentially a union of two individuals. It is also regarded as a union between a man and a woman for the duration of their lives and also as a forum for wider association between two families or two sets of families (Obi, 1966: 155). Expectations are that “marriage is for life” or “should be for life”. This can be explained by the religious and socio-cultural beliefs that the matrimonial home is sacred and the utmost fulfillment was in marriage.</p> <p>While marriage is supposed to be a beautiful special relationship for the life and calls for harmonious integration of husband and wife to “become one flesh”, many other factors (psycho-social, cultural, education, economic and environmental show the tendency for people inside marriage to deviate significantly). They pursue autonomy and harmony simultaneously and these two are diametrically conflicting goals (Adelson, 1970). This as Kalis (1970) has noted, the particular nature of conflict in human relations may be perceived rightly as the most abundant source of psycho-social problems which threatens marriages and many other institutions.</p> <p>Conflicts are bound to emanate from the marriage relationship since it involves human beings who have come from various cultural backgrounds and have different individual and social values. The sum of the couple’s reactions to their marital problems will ultimately determine the survival of their marriage or its failure. Counsellors involved in resolving marital conflict must necessarily understand the nature of such conflicts if they must succeed in their enterprise. The study is an attempt to understand the nature of marital conflicts as well as help counsellors acquired skill in resolving conflicts general and marital conflict specifically.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Spouses usually work had toward handling these differences and difficulties but</p> <p>some are not able to resolve the differences and difficulties. Their marriage fails. When marriages fail, divorce is the resultant effect. There are some basic and fundamental needs for a stable and peaceful marriage which cannot be overemphasized. Some major causes of divorce include financial problems, sexual incompatibility, problems from in-laws, religious incompatibility, financial problems, cultural differences, lack of parental skills, poor communication, childlessness (mostly in the African system and even the issue of a male child),  among other issues.</p> <p>Marriage counselling is not yet as effective as is psychotherapy or counselling directed at non-marital problems. In one study, for example, about 66 percent of the subjects who received marriage counselling reported the result “helpful”. In contrast, 88 percent of the subjects who sought help for personal non-marital problem reported the result as “helpful” (Guin et al 1960).</p> <p>In Nigeria the issue is not how effective marriage counselling is, it is its total absence even in “official quarters”. This means that the divorce rate is high (Weigh 1994) and even for marriages that seem to be together, the couples are unhappy and only “bear their marriage as a big cross” (Mbazue: 1995).</p> <p>The absence of pre-marital and marital counselling may be the reason why Kumuyi (1990) reports that homes are breaking at an alarming rate today. Unhappy marriages and marital break down in Nigeria has serious implications for the society. Amongst most Nigeria a community, a marriage is not an individual affair. It involves the entire family and even the village or community (Bulus, 1986). Marital breakdown therefore affects the health of the society. If the family therefore is an index of measuring the success or failure of the society, it means that marital failure translates into the failure of the society.</p> <p>There is therefore need to understand and solve marital conflicts because of the implications they have for development.  In Nigeria we are faced with such problems like youth delinquency, robbery, drug abuse, sexual immorality, prostitution and several others.</p> <p>Several studies have investigated the family background of such children involved, and the result have shown that most of these problems mentioned above are as a result of parental separation. As a result, the attention of the government, individuals charitable organizations, parents, teachers, guidance and counsellors are needed to consider this alarming problem.                   </p> <p>Counselling like education is a lifelong process. This means that every human being needs guidance and counselling as they grow from cradle to crane. The importance of guidance counsellor to adolescents and children in their multifarious problem of adjustment to living cannot be overemphasized. In their daily interaction with peers, teachers and parents, adolescents encounter educational, vocational and personal social problems which they cannot resolve themselves. Fears, anxiety, conflicts, suspicious of adult values and occasional rebellious acts sometimes show the type of stress and strain which typical adolescents experience as they grow from childhood to adulthood.  </p> <p>Perhaps more than adolescents, parents also need guidance and counselling for their daily living roles as parents especially in training their children to be good citizens of the nation and also to have and keep a peaceful and successful home.  Counsellors have been trained to listen effectively and help individuals make use of their wealth of resources to resolve their personal concerns. Major reason for the Federal Government of Nigeria to issue a policy statement as contained in the National Policy on Education (2004) and observed as follows:</p> <p>“In view of the apparent ignorance of young people about career prospect, and in view of personality maladjustment among school children, career officers and Counsellors will be appointed in post primary institutions. Since qualified personnel in this category are        scarce, government will continue to make provision for the training of interested teachers in Guidance and Counselling. Guidance and Counselling will also feature in Teacher education programmes.”</p> <p>Consequent upon the above, frantic efforts were made by the three tiers of government to train Counsellors for all levels of educational system study and generous scholarships were granted teachers to undertake courses in Guidance and counselling. It is in this vein that the curriculum of counsellor trainees especially at the undergraduate level has been focused on training them to meet the demands of adolescents not only at the secondary school level but also beyond. Counselling assumes that for us as people it is quite easy to relate with and disclose to other people who take time to listen to us and our problems and try to help us understand them.</p> <p>Before guidance and counselling was introduced into the 3rd world like Nigeria, some group of individual were responsible for advising and counselling individuals in the traditional society in the resolution of social, personal, educational and vocational problems according to Odebunmi (1982) consisting of traditional religious priests, fortune tellers, elders and heads of families within the extended family system, teachers and principals within the educational systems, priests and religious leaders of churches and Imams and Alhaji’s within the Moslem religion, friends and acquaintances within the peer group.</p> <p>The American Personnel and Guidance Association (1967) defined Guidance as an organized effort of a school to help the individual child develop to his maximum potential. Bernard and Fullmer (1977) on their part consider Guidance as the formal and informal effort to guide youths into the future. For Ipaye (1983) sees Guidance as a generic label, an umbrella term that covers all the means whereby an institution identifies and responds to the needs of pupils or students no matter the nature of the need and no matter its source thereby helping the child to develop to his maximum potential.</p> <p>Arbuckle (1966) has attempted to distinguish the usage of the term ‘guidance’ as a concept, as an educational construct and as a service. To him, it is used as a concept to denote the utilization of a point of view to help an individual. From the educational point, it refers to the provision of experiences that assist pupils to understand and accept themselves and function effectively in their environment. Also as a service, it denotes procedures and processes organized to achieve a helping relationship Olusakin (2010).</p> <p>The American Guidance Service Inc. defines Counselling as the process in which an experienced and trained person assists a second person to understand himself and his opportunities, make appropriate adjustment and decisions in the light of his understanding, accept the responsibility for the choice and to follow a course of action in harmony with his choice.</p> <p>Shertzer and Stone (1976) defined Counselling as a learning process in which individuals learn about themselves, their interpersonal relationships and behaviours that advance their personal development. Thompson and Poppen (1972) define Counselling as a person-to-person relationship in which one person helps another to resolve an area of conflict that has not been hitherto resolved, Olusakin (2010).</p> <p> Smith (1955) defines it as a process in which the counsellor assists the Counsellee to make interpretations of facts relating to a choice, plan or adjustments which he needs to make. It involves a one-to-one relationship and must be done by well trained personnel.</p> <p>Marital counselling has been described as the organized application of techniques or interventions which is designed to modify for the better, maladjustment or maladaptive nature of human relationship of marital partners. In the opinion of Akinade (1997), marital counselling is concerned with assisting couples to understand where they are so that they may decide for themselves which way to go. It could be divided into two broad phases i.e.; the pre marital counselling phase and the marital (after marriage) phase.</p> <p>While the first is concerned with assistance given to prospective spouses before they enter into marriage, the second is meant to address marital issues/problems likely to be faced or is being faced by married couples during the wedding ceremony and later in their inter relationship as husband and wife. It involves the use of counselling theories and techniques as well as biological (genetic) screening of the individuals about to go into marriage, Adeyemi (2004). The Planned Parenthood Federation of Nigeria (PPFN) believes that a good family life is important because it is the condition, not only for health and happiness, but also for responsible citizenship, community life and prosperity, Adeyemi (2004).</p> <p>Due to consistent quarrels and fighting in troubled families, there is the need to help couples and their children through counselling. This is the rationale behind this study. The issue of broken and divorced parents is a serious one that affects the life of many young ones especially in Nigeria due to so many reasons which will be considered in the course of this project. Conflicts in the family always prevent the home from performing its duties or responsibilities towards the rearing of the young ones and the growing youths. Love is a word that covers a broad spectrum of attraction, liking, respect and positive interpersonal relations (Makinde: 2001). The importance and relevance of Love in the home cannot be overemphasized.</p> <p><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to examine the place of Guidance and Counselling in the causes and the effects of divorce on the immediate family members in Nigeria. It is aimed at considering the major alarming causes of divorce and the end result of these causes on the immediate family members i.e. the father, the mother and the children in the typical Nigerian system. The major implication of guidance and counselling before the divorce and after the divorce proper. To create awareness on the nature and types of conflicts generally, specifically marital conflicts. To create the need to raise structures and institutionalize pre-marital counselling in Nigeria. To make for harmony and integration of the family unit.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In view of the problems caused by parental separation and total divorce in the Nigerian society, this study will be of great help to couples, teachers, adolescents, guidance counsellors and the general society at large.</p> <p>By knowing and identifying the causes and effects of divorce with their different implications, the study will highlight the importance of mutual understanding among couples for the sake and welfare of the children and the family. It will also enable parents to know the right path in which to train and develop their children. It will help parents know that the social vices associated with their separation sadden and weakens the society in general.</p> <p>The study will help children to live a normal life under the right atmosphere; it will also enable children to seek the help of a guidance counsellor who would help in identifying their problems and finding a lasting solution to them. It has been shown (Asher and White 1978) that children from disrupted families tend to have lowered socio-economic and educational attainments and higher rates of instability in their marriages.</p> <p>Like Oguntoye (1987) noted, children may undergo a great level of personal pains when their parents’ marriage end, they feel hurt, confused, angry, violent, abandoned, insecure, inferior and other social problems in relation to their mates in the society. This study will help teachers know how to help children from divorced homes and understand what they are going through. To show them love and care, listen to their problems and be able help them academically to achieve their goal in life. From this study, couples would learn to live a respectable, peaceful and exemplary married life.</p> <p><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is limited to Nigeria alone due to the alarming rate at which we are experiencing divorce in our society presently. It is experienced in all areas of our society including the Western culture, but due to time, facts and space, this study will focus on the Nigerian experiences only.</p> <p>Under the Matrimonial Causes Act, the only ground upon which the court can grant a decree of dissolution of marriage is where the marriage has broken down irretrievably. The facts upon which the court will hold these are as follows:</p> <p>*the respondent has willfully and persistently refused to consummate the marriage;</p> <p>*that since the marriage, the respondent has committed adultery thus the respondent finds it Intolerable to live with the respondent;</p> <p>*the respondent has behaved in such a way that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with him;</p> <p>*desertion of at least one year;</p> <p>*that the parties have lived apart for a continuous period of at least     two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition and the respondent does not object to a decree being granted;</p> <p>*that the parties to the marriage have lived apart for a period of at least three years immediately preceding the presentation.</p> <p>All these and many more will limit the scope to just the Nigerian system because of the religion, the system and the total Nigerian family system. Although divorce is experienced in all societies and cultures, but the study will be limited to the Nigerian system, in Lagos State and in Surulere local government area in particular for practical illustration and complete understanding.  </p> <p>In order to understand the study, there is the need to carry out a full study on the causes of divorce, the effects on the children, the effects on the adolescents, the couples involved and the general society. The period of this research was short, which did not give room for travelling far and wide to compare the availability and utilization of the research materials in other schools outside the Lagos metropolis.</p> <p>Some selected private and public schools were utilized for the research study in order to carry out a full and comprehensive study on the major causes of divorce in our immediate society, the effects of divorce on the children and the whole family, the academic and psychological effects on the couple and the children, the guidance and counselling effects and the contributions of counsellors to avoid the present adolescents from experiencing these ugly monster called “Divorce”  </p> <p>The questionnaire would measure type of family relationship of both parents, divorced or not. Does it affect the students’ behaviour? The relationship of the pupil to his father’s wives, if polygamous. Occupation of parents, total number of children, which of the parent is the pupil living with? The problem in the family and how all the above variables do affect the pupil’s life in general and the academic performance in particular. Also a performance test on English language and Mathematics were constructed to test the performances of the pupils with duration of 45 minutes under a strict conducive examinations condition.</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>Having review relevant literature on this study, the focus still remains on the guidance and counselling implications on the causes and effects of divorce on the immediate family members in our Nigerian society. To achieve the state objective of the study, the following research questions were developed to guide the study.</p> <p>1.   Would there be any significant difference in attitude to  examination between students from divorced parents and those from intact homes?</p> <p>2.  Would there be any significant difference in attitude to drugs and alcohol between pupils from divorced parents and those from intact homes?</p> <p>3. Would there be any significant difference in the academic performance of students from divorced parents and those from intact homes?</p> <p>4. Would there be any significant difference in the in the moral behaviour of pupils from divorced parents and those from intact homes?</p> <p>5. Would there be any significant difference in the school attendance between students from divorced parents and those from intact homes?</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>The following hypotheses will be tested in the course of the research; </p> <p>1.  There would be no significant difference in the attitude to examination between students from divorced parents and those from intact homes.</p> <p>2.  There would be no significant difference in attitude to drugs and alcohol between pupils from divorced parents and those from intact homes.</p> <p>3. There would be no significant difference in the academic</p> <p>    performance of students from divorced parents and those from</p> <p>    intact homes.</p> <p>4.  There would be no significant difference in the moral behaviour of pupils from divorced parents and those from intact homes.</p> <p>5.  There would be no significant difference in the school attendance of students from divorced parents and those from intact homes. </p> <p><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>In the course of this research, some terms will be defined for better understanding of the study.</p> <p><strong>GUIDANCE</strong>- African communities had always had guidance and that this had always been carried out by traditional helpers who assisted people when they had personal concerns and problems they that could not solve all by themselves. Guidance is a total programme of highly, specialized activities implemented by all staff members to help individuals make wise intelligent choices and decisions.  </p> <p><strong>COUNSELLING</strong>- is a one to one , person to person or face to face encounter between the counsellor and the counsellee. It is a helping relationship based on</p> <p>trust. It is also a process by which an individual is assisted to evaluate him or</p> <p>herself and his or her opportunities, i.e. to make feasible choices in the light of his or her unique characteristics and opportunities, to accept responsibility for his or her choices and initiate a course of action that is in consonance with any given choice.</p> <p><strong>MARRIAGE</strong>- is a sacred and permanent contract which is assumed to be enacted when two people (usually a man and a woman) decide of their own accord and in the presence of at least two witnesses to exchange the formal consent to live a life of vocation of love and sharing for each other for the purpose of promoting their mutual growth and welfare as partners in their journey together through life.</p> <p><strong>FAMILY</strong>- is the bedrock of any society. A family is a bio-social group, a network of person’s intimately held together by a bond of social, kinship or blood relationships.</p> <p><strong>DIVORCE</strong>- or dissolution of marriage is the ending of a marriage before the death of either spouse. Black’s law dictionary* defines Divorce as the imports of a dissolution of the marriage relation between husband and wife, i.e. a complete severance of the tie by which the parties were united.</p> <p><strong>MARITAL COUNSELLING</strong>- is concerned with assisting couples to understand where they are so that they may decide on their own volition which way to go.</p> <p><strong>RESPONSIBILITIES</strong>- these is the taking care of the political, social, physical, mental and economic challenges that occurs in the home to bring about peace and stability.</p> <p><strong>ACEDEMIC ACHIVEMENT</strong>- it is the sum total of all the child’s academic activities and performances in the school. This could be obtained through test grades. Academic achievements are the display of knowledge in subjects which are measured through tests by teachers.</p> <p><strong>ATTENDANCE</strong>- it is the action or time of being present. It includes punctuality, lateness, absenteeism and truancy.</p> <p><strong>PUNCTUALITY</strong></p>                                                         \n\nTHE EFFECT OF DIVORCE ON THE FAMILY: IMPLICATIONS FOR COUNSELLING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF DIVORCE ON THE FAMILY: IMPLICATIONS FOR COUNSELLING", "id": 40}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>The study examined the influence of socio-cultural variables and marital stability among couples in Lagos Metropolis in Mushin Local Government Area of Lagos State</em></p> <p><em>The descriptive research survey was applied in the assessment of the respondents’ opinions in this study.

Without love, affection and element of trust, couples will not go far in their marriages.</em></li> </ul> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>Culture is generally</strong> described and accepted as people’s way of life, which among other things includes their marital lives. The inspiration of every matured man or woman is to have a stable and happy marital life, be compatible in love, values, academic, economic and of course be socially alright. This in line with the postulation of Onyema (1994), that marriage is a social institution for the union of body and soul.</p> <p>However, stability in marriage may at times be influenced by certain socio-cultural variables. The influence of the variables may be negative resulting to insecurity and unhappiness in marriage or may be positive resulting to a stable and happy union. These variables range from cultural diversity (in case of interethnic marriage), to educational, social, economic and even religious background.</p> <p>Even age difference is inclusive in these variables. For instance, a lady once confessed that she can never marry an illiterate no matter how rich he may be, because, one day, he might ignorantly use his certificate as a toilet tissue. The implication of this open confession is incompatibility and social inequality in education which are factors that may influence marital stability. The current instability in some marriages in our society today tend to be the resultant influence of social, economic and cultural changes in people’s pattern of living. These changes, according to Amaonye, (1996), have occurred and has continued to occur so rapidly that they are not yet absorbed into our ways of living.</p> <p>Furthermore, compatibility in social lives of couples a strong factor for marital stability and survival. When the social lives of couples are at variance, it may likely portend great threat to marital stability, because it takes time to come to terms with why some social outings and involvement are necessary. However, the realization of the salient influence of these socio cultural variables on marriage may likely be positive moment towards marriage stability in our society today.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The wish of every couple is to spend their life time together and, joyfully till death part them. However, this is not usually the case all the time because at a particular period in their lives, frictions do arise which lead to a near or total collapse of the marriage. And this is one of the inevitable challenges that accompany marriages.</p> <p>Socio-cultural factors such as religions, age, socio-economic status, social class, educational background, personality, traditional values etc influence the marital stability of marriage among couples. And the  factors are very important variables in marital stability which are seldom recognized by many couples, no wonder there are breakages in many homes as a result of no love, lack of understanding, lack of compatibility, disparity in age, in education, religion and social classes.</p> <p>Many, for instance, have failed to realize that when couples are of diverse culture (inter-ethnic marriage), there is need to respect each other’s culture since this translates to respecting the person you married and subsequent marital stability. These days marriages fail due to lack of tolerance, lack of mutual trust, lack of patience, non-child bearing, no effective communication, lack of good marital altitudes, similarities between couples, lack of maturity and poor socio-economic status.</p> <p>Finally, when couples are not from same socio-cultural background, and do not have the same value system and norms, they tend to vary in understanding of themselves and lack of understanding no doubt, creates conflict, and instability in marital union.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The major purpose of this study is to determine the socio-cultural variables on marital stability in Lagos state.</p> <p>Other objectives of this study include to:</p> <p>2.           Examine whether there is difference between religion and marital stability among couples.</p> <p>3.           Find out whether there is difference between ethnicity and marital success among couples.</p> <p>4.           To determine whether there is influence of communication on marital stability.</p> <p>5.           To investigate whether socio-economic status has an impact on couples’ marital success.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions will assist the conduct of this study:</p> <p>1.           Will there be any significant influence of socio-cultural variables on marital stability?</p> <p>2.           Will religious backgrounds of couples influence their marital stability?</p> <p>3.           Is there any significant influence of socio-economic states of couples on their marital stability?</p> <p>4.           Will lack of communications affect the marital stability of couples?</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong>Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The following research hypotheses were formulated for testing in this study:</p> <p>1.           There is no significant influence of socio-cultural variable and couples’ marital stability.</p> <p>2.           There is no significant influence of religion and couples’ marital stability.</p> <p>3.           There is no significant influence of communication and couples’ marital stability.</p> <p>4.           There is no significant influence of socio-economic statuses of couples on their marital stability?</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>Marriage should be contracted through a careful planning not accidental marriage (that is marriages that are not planned but are forced on couples to save the family or families from embarrassment) should be avoided like a plague. Before a man weds his wife, both of them should reach the age of maturity. They should mature socially, economically, temperamentally, financially etc.</p> <p>For a happy marriage, they should maintain a feeling of love and affection. The wife must experience a feeling of being wanted and a sense of belonging, care and security. The husband too needs love and affection to ensure him of a stable marriage. Marriage partners should avoid cognitive error that is, they should not expect the other person to see it. Therefore, if the husband wants the wife to behave in a certain way, he should inform her about his wishes, the same is true of the wife to her husband.</p> <p>Sexual compatibility tends to foster marital stability, marital oneness to large extent depends on sex. Infact, sex is a form of communication and probably, the most legitimate in which two persons (husband and wife) express oneness of mind and feeling. Therefore, partners in marriage should be socially compatible.</p> <p><strong>Couples:</strong> The findings and recommendation of this study will be of great benefit for couples; both the already married ones and those intending to marry. This is because they will learn the factors that contribute to marital stability or harmony in marriage.</p> <p><strong>Adolescents:</strong> They will learn from the study, especially those who are of marriageable ages. This is because they will get to understand that there are some factors that can help marriages to grow and develop instead of dying down. They would have an insight of the role of social cultural factors,  money or wealth play in sustaining marriages.</p> <p><strong>The Society:</strong> The society will learn through this study how finance can make marriage to work well. This is because, without enough financial powers, marriages tend to be conflict-stricken.</p> <p>For marriage to work out well, couples should not entertain the interference of in-laws or the third party syndrome. They should avoid washing their dirty lining in the public. They should be of one religious sect, joint account, mind the same thing, maintain peace in the home and allow love and affection to rule their world.</p> <p><strong>1.7   Delimitation</strong></p> <p>The delimitation of this study is the influence of socio-cultural variables and marital stability in Lagos state. A case study of Mushin local government area.</p><p> </p> <p><strong>1.8   Scope / Limitation of the Study </strong></p> <p>The research will cover Mushin local government area of Lagos State since the research is making use of only Mushin local government area, the generalization of the findings is limited to mushin local government area.</p> <p>However, this study cannot present all the marital problems exhibited by all the couples in Lagos State considering the scope the generalization of the findings can only be applicable to the other couples in similar conditions.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><br/></p> <p>There could be other problems that manifest among couples in Lagos State, but this study will be restricted to the one’s highlighted in the hypotheses.</p> <p><strong>1.9 Conceptual Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>For easy comprehension of this study, all conceptual terms were defined thus:</p> <p>1.      <strong>Culture</strong>: This is defined as a term emerged whole of idea and things produced by men in their historical experience by 1910 America Anthropologists were using “Culture” to refer to distractive of traits characterizing particular tribal societies.</p> <p>2.<strong>     Culture Heritage:</strong> This is a process of bringing together people of different ideas and cultural background to have common interest and perceive a common goal.</p> <p>3.      <strong>Marriage</strong>: The legal joining together of two person’s of opposite sex as husband and wife.</p> <p>4.      <strong>Socio-Economic Status (SES):</strong> This refers to the combined influence of income, occupation, reduction, cultural tastes or values and prestige on social ranking. (Bidwell and Vendor, 1999).</p> <p>5.      <strong>Social Status:</strong> Mey (1998) defined social status as groups of individual who are accorded similar levels of prestige within the community and who share similar cultural taste, interest, patterns of consumptions and life styles.</p> <p><strong>6.     Stability:</strong> This refers to something that is fixed, not likely to move or change its position. In simple terms, the quality of being stable.</p> <p><strong>7.     Cohabitation: </strong>This is the act of living together of a man and a woman without formal marriage as husband and wife.</p> <p><strong>8.     Communication:</strong> According to Adanma (1980), communication is the act of interaction between two individuals or from one person or group to another. It is the act of transmitting news or information between the source and the receiver through a medium.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>REFERENCES</strong></p> <p>Aaron, A. S.

The study concentrated on the different roles counselor plays in secondary schools, perceptions of students at the junior and senior secondary levels on the role of counselors, importance of career counseling in schools as well as the need for counselors in secondary schools.</p> <p>The findings show that the perception of students of the role of school counselors is positive. This prove that the secondary school students in Esan West local Government Area of Edo State have positive perceptions of the role of school counselors in their choice of a career, which clearly shows the need for more professional counselors in our public schools.</p> <p>Some recommendations were made such as creating counseling units in secondary schools, recruiting more professional counselors in schools as well as organizing career day/week for students and ways to include career guidance into the secondary school programs.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The field of school based guidance and counseling programs have been designed to help students gain career awareness within the educational system. Over the years the field has been confronted with great challenges that make it more difficult to provide students with strong career guidance. Guidance professional in many public schools are often assigned large work loads. The average US studentscounselor ratio is 479 to 1and it grows to more than 1000 to 1 in some schools (American school counselor association, 2010). This contrasts greatly with what is necessary to ensure adequate students services. The American school counselor association recommends a student counselor ratio of 250 to 1. In order to implement comprehensive developmental school counseling program designed to meet the needs of all students. (American School Counseling Association, 2010).</p> <p>Further complicating these high ratios, guidance professionals are at times redirected to assignments that do not match or need their professional counseling skills. Responsibilities may include such diverse activities as conducting testing programs, registering students for courses, filling out college application, handling disciplinary issues and monitoring student’s records. Some of these activities such as coordinating and administering cognitive, aptitude and achievement tests have been declared inappropriate by the American School Counselor Association, while others merely stretch the limit of any individual professional, leaving less time to focus on direct student services such as career guidance. A survey of high schools counselor in Florida found that more than 30% reported that “actual career counseling” occupied very little of their time (Osborn, Debra and Baggerly, 2004)</p> <p>There is also a dichotomy between what counselor need to know about helping students make good educational and career decision and what counselors learn in their counselor preparatory programs. Many counselor preparatory programs focus predominantly on mental health models rather than academic and career development models (Martin 2002). Thus some guidance professionals lack current and accurate knowledge concerning career guidance and emerging career opportunities and may have outdated perceptions about post secondary options that impact the information they share with students (Mitkos, et. al. 2008).</p> <p>The term “school counseling” broadly refers to the process of meeting the needs of students in several areas of development, such as academic career and personal. Experts agree that professional school counseling program should be “comprehensive in scope, preventive in design and developmental in nature”.</p> <p>The term “Guidance” refers to a more specific trajectory within the field of counseling a pathway to helping students choose a vocational or career path “guidance is the processes of helping people make important choices that affect their lives such as choosing a preferred life style.” One distinction between guidance and counseling is that while guidance focuses on helping individual choose what they value most, counseling focuses on helping them make changes</p> <p>Several changes have taken place in the evolution of counseling and guidance program in schools around the world. Counseling and guidance appeared to have moved from a single vocational counselor in schools to an organized program that focuses on;</p> <p>(a)  content (core competencies that all students can acquire)</p> <p>(b)  Organizational framework (structural component and program component) and resources (human and political). Gysbers and Henderson, 2000.</p> <p>As such Counseling and guidance experts are increasingly emphasizing the need for program planning and evaluation and improving effectiveness of programs and accountability of counselors.</p> <p> In establishing carefully planned counseling and guidance programs in post primary education, the idea of gender responsiveness is critical.</p> <p>The term “gender responsiveness” refers to the practice of active and engaged strategies and responses to issues relating to gender in educational planning and policies. Gender responsive programming promotes greater equity by;</p> <p>(i)          Ensuring that the overall need and interest of both boys and girls in post primary schools are met.</p> <p>(ii)        Effectively incorporating life skills-based strategies for preparing the nest generations to make life career decisions.</p> <p>(iii)      Ensuring access to programs for upper level education /college/university readiness.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Lack of preparation to navigate the changing workplace can be tied specifically to a lack of career knowledge and awareness. More than half of high school students say no one in their school has been helpful in advising on career options or option to further their education. (Hurley et.al, 2002). Without structured guidance activities, young people tend to drift through their high school education without gaining knowledge of all the career opportunities available to them or the skills that are required. Some will become discouraged and drop out of high school; others may miss the connections between high school, post-secondary education and the workplace and make career decision based on inaccurate or incomplete information.</p> <p>In a survey carried out by the state of our nation’s youth, the top career choices among students in an open ended question were doctor or surgeon (10%), teacher of professor (8%), engineer (6%), nurse/medical assistant (6%), arts or entertainment (5%), lawyer or attorney (5%). (Horatio Agler Association of Distinguished American, Inc 2008-2009}. Most of these choices require a number of years of post secondary education. Yet only 70% of students graduate from school on time and only 34% graduate ready for college. (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2000). This disconnects between aspiration and educational performance set students up for personal or financial disappointment as they are faced with the realities of the job market.</p> <p>Many other students enter college without a clear career goal. resulting in indecision and the costly prospect of excessive time spent in post- high school institution as they drift from one program to another or pursue courses of study that do not align with employer need. Students over the age of 25 are now one of the fastest growing populations in community colleges. (Gateway Community College, 2006). They often enroll to get additional skills to be competitive in the workplace. Many of these students have already completed some college or even a 4-year degree, but have found it inadequate or inappropriate for the career opportunities that are available to them. Engaging in post secondary education without a clear purpose does not use public or private resources as effectively as possible and these students would have greatly benefited from stronger career guidance early in their educational experience.</p> <p><strong>1.3   PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study among other things is to find out;</p> <p>(1)   How students view the role of counselors in secondary schools.</p> <p>(2)   If students sex and age has effect on their perception of the role of counselors in the choice of a career.</p> <p>(3)   The role of counselors towards students’ choice of career in secondary schools in esan west local government area of Edo state.</p> <p>(4)   The perception of students on the need for counselors in their choice if career in secondary schools.</p> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>This research will attempt to answer the following questions:</p> <p>(1)    What are students’ perceptions of counselor’s role in secondary schools in Esan west local government area of Edo state?</p> <p>(2)    Does the student’s age have effect on their perception of the need for counselors in secondary schools?</p> <p>(3)    Does the students’ sex have effect on their perception of the need for counselors in secondary schools?</p> <p><strong>1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The findings of this research will reveal to students, teachers administrators, parents, government and employer of labour the importance of school counselors in secondary schools as regards students choice of career. Students would benefit by understanding how important and indispensable the counselor is in their choice of a career.</p> <p>It will make parents and teachers understand the essence of early grooming of their children and ward regarding career choices and the role of the counselor towards achieving success and satisfaction for their children/students professionally.</p> <p>The administrator would be able to provide materials that would facilitate positive counselor/student relationship in order to be more productive.</p> <p>Government and employer of labour on their part will enjoy a better well prepared and packaged work force with necessary orientation and experience that will help in nation building and greater efficiency.</p> <p><strong>1.6   SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study covered secondary school students that reside in Esan West Local Government Area of Edo State. Five secondary schools were randomly selected with from the 17 secondary schools in the area. This research looked at Students perception of the role of the school counselor in the choice of career and how they can be improved. The effect of counselor’s advice on the choice and decisions of students in the area will be taken into account during the course of this research.</p> <p><strong>1.7   LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>A study of this nature would not be complete without discussing some of the problems encountered by the researcher. The various problems that limit the outcome of this research work are therefore discussed below;</p> <p>This research depends mainly on the responds of the students and teacher/counselors. The time set aside for this study was too short; as a result, the researcher had no opportunity to make all intensive and extensive study on the topic.</p> <p>Again there was period of long holiday for teachers and students in the local government area used as a case study of this research work.</p> <p>Finally teachers, students and counselors could not return all the questionnaires distributed to the researcher. And this would only make him to only work with the ones that got to him.</p>                                                          \n\nSTUDENTS’ PERCEPTION OF THE ROLE OF SCHOOL COUNSELORS IN THE CHOICE OF A CAREER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STUDENTS’ PERCEPTION OF THE ROLE OF SCHOOL COUNSELORS IN THE CHOICE OF A CAREER", "id": 42}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>        This study investigated the need for guidance and counseling among Nigerian University Students, a case study of Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma, Edo State.

The method of data analysis was simple percentage for the research questions.</p> <p>The study found out that:</p> <p>·              The university students have problems that require the professional services of guidance counselors.</p> <p>·              The university undergraduates should be given educational service as one of the services to enhance their academic achievement.</p> <p>·              The university undergraduates lack vocational guidance and as such are in direct need of vocational services.</p> <p>Based on these findings conclusion was reached and recommendations made.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>        Guidance and counselling services in the university promote the personal social planning and programming for students with special learning needs.</p> <p>        The students need to prepare themselves not only academically but also socially in order for them to gain acceptance into the new community.</p> <p>        It’s also good to know that, the undergraduates, even though a good number of them are adults, there is the need to guide them if the purpose which they are in the university is to be achieved.</p> <p>        Also, majority of students in the University are faced with anxiety and stress, to be able to handle situation like this, they need counselling.</p> <p>        The services of guidance and counselling in tertiary institution is to bring about well guided and properly counselled among university undergraduates who will be leaders of tomorrow because the role of guidance and counselling cannot be over emphasized.</p> <p>        Most university administrators in Nigeria are searching for stability as a way out of crises and a means to restore some lasting tranquility on campuses. Recently, dramatic increase in violence and revolutionary behaviour among students has almost attained a high proportion throughout the world. Guidance and counselling services are needed in order to find lasting solutions to some problems that have plagued institutions of learning for a very long time.</p> <p>        Students need counselling programme as a result of these unruly behaviours. In order words, university undergraduates need help to resolve their home, social, academics, health, emotional, vocational, financial and religious problems. The undergraduates at this level are made to understand the nature and complexity of their problems and better means of solving the problems.</p> <p>        Fresh students appear to be plagued by the questions self-defined by their present status within the community, by their position within their peer group and by their academic performances in secondary school. Without counselling programme/support, they will feel inferior and be defeated of their social identities. Difficulties may come the way of new students trying to adjust to the new environment and they will find it painful and hectic. This may be due to the differences they encounter in life when in secondary schools.</p> <p>        Values espoused by other students are social climate, course of study, study conditions and degree of freedom and adjustment to these differences often result in crises of some sort. The crises can be averted if guidance and counselling services are made available to this category of students at the point of entering into the university.</p> <p>        Since counselling aims at the total development of the individual persons, it also helps students to find spiritual and ethical measuring in life and help them to live in harmony within the other members of the university community. The inculcation of ethnical values through guidance and counselling services will go a long way in curbing irrational behaviours among university undergraduates. Effective counselling services in the university will constrain students from rebellion against the established rules of their schools organization and destruction of school properties.</p> <p>        The student is aspiration should be brought into balance with the goals of their educational institutions and those of their surrounding community will be maintained.</p> <p>        Denga (2003) is of the opinion that the need for guidance and counselling in our educational system is increasingly pressing as educational, economic, technological, social and ideological advancements are being made. Each student will need to be helped to strengthen his own abilities to make meaningful and realistic choices and to face problems encountered in the society.</p> <p>        According to Oladele (2007) no matter how good and well constructed an educational policy may be, if guidance and counselling is not given priority and made an integral part of the system, it cannot succeed. Guidance and counselling services within the frame work of education has the potential to help an individual to realistically examine his/her belief and values within the comprehensive nature of the university set up, only good guidance and counselling services can help the undergraduate through social adjustment to take the right decisions and understand himself and his world.</p> <p>        The importance of guidance and counselling services among undergraduates are glaring and inevitable. The services are veritable instruments for achieving success in and out of school. As revealed by findings and conducted by number of Nigerian scholars, among whom are Adugbo (2000), Denga (2003), Allolla (2004), Bello (2007), guidance and counselling services are yet to take off effectively in Nigerian schools generally due to some problems that are yet to be addressed properly.</p> <p>        These problems includes inadequate number of personnel (counsellors), lack of materials and facilities for effective guidance services, lack of finance, inadequate time allocated to guidance and counselling services in schools, unhealthy perception of the school head, counsellor, students and parents.</p> <p>        The need for guidance and counselling services amongst Nigerian university students cannot be compromised if the universities must actualize the goals for which they were established. So it is important for the universities to properly design counselling services to interpret the goals of the constitution the students and his family in term of its ability to satisfy students’ educational, vocational, social and personal needs. Also it is important for the achievement of academic goals and aspiration in the university.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>        The following are some of the problems that will make university undergraduates face a lot of worry:</p> <p>1.      Emotional stress</p> <p>2.      Victimization from lecturers</p> <p>3.      Persons and social needs</p> <p>4.      Indecent dressing</p> <p>5.      Examination malpractice</p> <p>6.      Peer group influence e.g drinking, smoking, cultism etc</p> <p>7.      Financial insecurity (lack of finance)</p> <p>8.      Sexual harassment</p> <p>9.      Addiction to social networking like face book, 2go, twitter to mention but a few.</p> <p>These problems have eaten deep into the fabrics of the university and as such having negative effect on the standard of graduates, however it is the researcher’s concern that this ill attitude is affecting the quality of university graduates in Nigeria, therefore urgent attention is needed. This study will fill the obvious lack of research in this area.</p> <p><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The general purpose of the study is to determine the need for guidance and counselling services among students in Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma.</p> <p> The specific objectives of this study are as follows:</p> <p>To identify the need for university students that form guidance and counseling services.</p> <p>To find out strategies for providing effective guidance   services for the university students.</p> <p>To ascertain the need for guidance and counselling services in Nigerian Universities.</p> <p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>1.      What are the common social vices among students of Ambrose Alli University?</p> <p>2.      What are the peculiar problems of female students of Ambrose Alli University?</p> <p>3.       What are the unique problems facing male students of Ambrose Alli university?</p> <p>4.      What are the unique problems facing male students of Ambrose Alli University.</p> <p>5.      Is there need for guidance and counselling services to students of Ambrose Alli University?</p> <p>6.      Does Ambrose Alli University management have guidance and counselling service unit for her students?</p> <p><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>        The study will provide contemporary and best way for guidance and counselling suitable for undergraduates of the university.</p> <p>It would help the university administrations to identify areas of guidance and counselling services that need attention.

The background of the study gave a general and comprehensive introduction of the study, statement of the problem were identified. The significance of the study was outlined and operational definition of terms was included for proper understanding, scope of study was also drawn out current related literature were reviewed and theoretical framework that, is relevant lo the study that is discussed. Questionnaires with open and closed ended questions were administered to 115 respondents and all were retrieved and a total of 100 that were properly filled were analysed. Date was analyzed using frequency table, percentages pie chart and bar charts. The discussion of result and interpretation of findings were made. The results from the findings in figure IV shows that 95 (95%) of the respondents have good knowledge about exclusive breastfeeding while in figure IX only 15(15%) practices exclusive Breastfeeding. From the above, it was observed that the respondents have good knowledge about exclusive breastfeeding had no influence on their poor attitude towards the practice of Exclusive Breastfeeding. Other factors such as early resumption to duty and late closing hour as seen in figure VII, XIX 98 (98%) and also lack of support from colleagues in figure XIX 96 (96%) are other hindrances to the effective practice of Exclusive Breastfeeding.</em></p> <p><em>The findings result revealed that female bankers have good knowledge about Exclusive Breastfeeding while their attitude towards the practice of Exclusive Breastfeeding is very poor. Recommendations and suggestion for further study were made.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Breastfeeding is considered the most complete nutritional source for infants, because, breast milk contains the essential fats, carbohydrates, proteins and immunological factors needed for infants to thrive and resist infection in the formative year.</p> <p>          Cardwell and Barry, 2004, jones et al, 2003 in their analysis of child survival strategies, identified exclusive breastfeeding from b to u months as the single most effective preventive intervention in reducing child mortality with the potential of saving 1.3 million infants uses annually.</p> <p>          Similary, leoan-cava et al (2003), have observed that improved breast feeding practices are crucial for child growth and development. However, advocate of breast feeding have noticed that there have been steady decline due to the behaviour of female bankers. This is particularly more pronounced in developing countries, like Nigeria.</p> <p>          Wagner et al, (2005) have also observed that despite all the recommendations by experts as regard infants breast feeding for the first size months of life, a significant percentage of mothers choose not to breastfeed. Work and family conflict are the major concern to many, if not all, the most female bankers over the world. Most of the banking institution continue to spend resources in an attempt to help their staffs manage family duties and responsibilities at work place; however, work and family boundary (exclusive breastfeeding) have been the most challenging factor associated with female bankers in ikpoba hill, Benin city (cooner 2002)</p> <p>Some may be due to work factor like female bankers who spend more time in the office.</p> <p>          Results of studies conducted in developing countries has shown that, nutritional deficiency and growth retardation is a common occurrence amongst children between the age of 3 and 15 months old, owing to sub optional breastfeeding and poor complementary feeding practices (shrimptonetal 2001)</p> <p>Parts of the efforts to promote inproved breastfeeding practices focused on hospital norms and services, legislations and institutional polices, health workers training, mass media campains, peer counselling and educating, mother to mother support and a combination of these strategies (Green,1999, till et al, 2004) (Quinn et, al, 2005). Specifically, the United States agency for international development (USAID) in 1996, issues a grant to the academy for international development to design and implement a 10-years program, known as the LINKAGES project, to improve breastfeeding practices rapidly and at scare. Unluckily this has not yielded and encouraging result. This is because in African countries, the national rate for early initiation of breastfeeding were low, with Ghana having the lowest rate (35%) following by Madagascar (34%)Quin et al, 2005) as it has been ensured that safety, optimum growth, health survival of the human infants; that duration of the breast feeding may also determine the strength of mother/child born and attachment, yet exclusive breast feeding is not being in full practices among female bankers because of the long time they spend in the office, and non-provision of curech by their management because of the risky environment where they work.</p> <p>Breastfeeding decline significantly from 1900 to 1960 due to increasing negative attitude towards the practice and the development of infant formulas under modern health centres, human breast milks considered the healthiest form for milk for babies because of its numerous advantages over artificial formulas (National health services 2007).</p> <p>          Although breast feeding is natural, the current instant feeding practice are far from optimum because of lack of updated knowledge and training among medical and Para medical personnel, misconception in the community, misformation by infant food manufacturers and return to work, illness, breast engorgement and mastitis havelead to exposure of infants to infections like gastoententis and diorrhea which have resulted over a million death annually worldwide (Ghai, 2008).</p> <p>Due to the above reason, baby friendly hospital initiative (BFHI) was launched in 199 as part of the “innocent declaration of 1991 our promotion, protection and support of breast feeding by WHO and UNICFE. Baby friendly hospital are conform to its ten steps for successful implementation of breastfeeding in the context of HIV, emergencies as well as expansion towards other type of health facilities and the community to discourage the use of breast milk substitute that and water within the first six months of infant life (WHO,2012). This has shown that excusive breast feeding is beneficial to babies, mothers, and even the community at large. However, it is a very challenging task to engage in especially for bankers</p> <p>This project intends to find out the roles and practices of exclusive breast feeding among female bankers in IkpobaOkhaL.G.A in Benin City Edo state who practices exclusive breast feeding.</p> <p>          At the end of this study recommendation will be made for the management of banks to provide a conducive environment for the nursing mothers to keep their babies and also reduce the working hours for them to be able to exclusively breastfeed.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Despite the effort and strategies that have been put in a place by WHO and UNICEF to increase awareness of exclusive breastfeeding through baby friendly hospitals initiatives in order to reduce complication associated with artificial feeding like respiratory and gastro intestinal infections. It has been observed by the researchers are still reluctant to practice exclusive breastfeeding due to work factor and environment.</p> <p>Hence, the question “what is the knowledge and attitude of female bankers towards the attitude of exclusive breast feeding in IkpobaOkha L.G.A Benin city</p> <p><strong>OBLECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>1.     To assess the level of knowledge and the practice of exclusive breast feeding among female bankers.</p> <p>2.     To ascertain the attitude of female bankers towards the exclusive breastfeeding.</p> <p>3.     To find out the factors influencing the practice of exclusive breast feeding among female bankers.</p> <p>4.     To ascertain the measures of improving exclusive breast feeding to banking industry.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>1.     It will generate dats concerning the breast feeding among female bankers</p> <p>2.     Promote the wellbeing of the children of female bankers.</p> <p>3.     To increase the knowledge of female bankers towards the awareness of the benefits of exclusives breast feeding and suggest ways to overcome these challenges to successful practice of exclusive breast feeding.</p> <p>4.     To astain the attitude of female bankers towards breast feeding.</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>1.     What is the level of knowledge of female bankers towards exclusive breast feeding</p> <p>2.     What type of attitude is developed by female bankers towards the practice of exclusive breast feeding</p> <p>3.     What are the factors influencing the effective practice of exclusive breast feeding among female bankers</p> <p>4.     What are the benefits of exclusive breast feeding among female bankers</p> <p><strong>SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>          Scope of study is limited to female bankers that are of child bearing age in IkpobaOkha local government area of Edo state Nigeria.</p> <p>It headquarters are in town of Idogbo.

This attraction could be for sexual</p> <p>gratification, sense of identity or a feeling of belonging. Literatures have shown that these two parties (male and female) have always had a strong connection that is beyond the ordinary. Something, someone or an idea has drawn them together.</p> <p>Premarital sex is generally used in reference to individuals who are presumed not yet of marriageable age, or between adults who will presumably marry eventually, but who are engaged in sexual activity prior to marriage (Lucas, 2000, Ramesh, 2008 and Barbra et al, 2001).</p> <p>Public opinion polls have consistently shown that premarital sex is wrong and dangerous to health resulting in abortions, teenage mothers and sexually transmitted infections (Aaron, 2006; Finer, 2007). Premarital sex is sex before marriage and it is generally found among the youth. It involves fornication, rape, defilement and incest. The causes behind it have been established including curiosity among the youth, proof of manhood, lust, pornography and it adverse effects, insanity and sex promiscuity as well as  moral decadence among the youths (Choe et al, 2004).</p> <p>Premarital sex is perceived and seen as a taboo in many cultures and considered a sin against man and God in most religion, it has become more commonly accepted by large portions of populaces in developed countries within the last few decades. The rise in premarital sex in Africa has resulted from a sexual revolution that came with western culture (Scott, 2005). A 2014 pew study on global morality found that premarital sex was considered particularly unacceptable in “predominantly Muslim nations” such as Indonesia, Jordan, Pakistan and Egypt, each having over 90% disapproval, whilst many people within western European nations were the most accepting with Spain, Germany and France having less than 10% disapproval.</p> <p>According to a 2001 UNICEF survey, in 10 out of 12 developed nations with available data, more than two thirds of young people have had sexual intercourse while still in their teens. In Denmark, Finland,</p> <p>Germany, Iceland, Norway, The United Kingdom and The United States, approximately 25% of 15years old an 50% of 17year olds have had sex. This goes a long way to prove that even before the students gains admission into the University a hand fill of then are already familiar with the experience of sexual intercourse an so the trends to continue even at the University level.</p> <p>Worldwide, rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among the youth are soaring; one-third of the 340million new STDs each year occur in people under 25 years of age (Fernandez et al, 2010). There are many behavioral problems among the adolescents that Nigerian society today has to contend with. Such problems include truancy, disobedience, drug offences, assault, insult, stealing, violent demonstrations, Vandalism, examination malpractice, robbery and secret cult activities (Nnanchi, 2003). Apart from these widely publicized behavioral problems, heterosexual activities are listed among types of behavioral problem prevalent in Nigerian secondary schools. These are variously named in the literature as sex abuse, sex offences, sexual misconduct, sexual immorality, sexual promiscuity, and sexual maladjustment (Odoemelamelam, 1996, Adedipe, 2000, Ndu, 2000; Nnachi, 2003). When this individuals graduates from their secondary school they do not only graduate with learned behavior and new ideology which they bring in to the University to explore their new gained freedom.</p> <p>Sexual intercourse from observation and from the reports and witness of people who engage in them attest to the fact that it is highly pleasurable, both during and after the act, and as such an average person would be attracted to activities that induce pleasure. People engage in premarital sex, in this case University undergraduates for several reasons whether out of curiosity, for pleasure sake or a feeling of achievement etc. The case of premarital sex among undergraduate student of the University of Benin one can say has been on the increase and is gradually becoming a part of the norm in our society and the University communities. In one occasion in my Faculty just outside the entrance I witness a girl and a boy obviously not married kissing and smooching for a long period of time in the dark. Here and there within an outside the University Campus, cases of students caught engaging in sexual intercourse has been reported among undergraduate students in some locations of peculiar features. A roommate of mine attest to an incident where him and his friends caught some students in the act around the dark corners in his faculty, one thing lead to the other and the case got to the security department University of Benin.</p> <p>According to Abdullahi and Umar (2008), “Sexual behavior among the students in our University is speculatively very rampant and worrisome. In this contest it is important to understand why youth engage in risky sexual behavior and to understand the influencing factors for the behavior. When the Dean, students’ affairs of the University of Maiduguri whose responsibility is to regulate the conduct of students issued a circular to checkmate sex activities amongst students, the students felt that neither the deanery nor the university authority had jurisdiction over their sex life. The students, who live in congested rooms and study in a difficult academic environment, were angry, not for the lack of facilities in the halls of residence or in the teaching areas, but with the interference of the university management with their personal life (Their Activities). In the night of Monday, 28</p> <p>January, 2002 the students went on demonstration during which the Dean of student affair was beaten and sand thrown on him.</p> <p>From the above, one can see that matters pertaining to sex and sex activities are held dearly by students, even when other aspects of their health an even their future is threatened. They would rather fight for “their personal life”. Taking out time to meditate on why in this present time the issue of sex has become an issue of grave concern, one would observe that the media has somehow succeeded in creating in our subconscious, pictures of sex, sexual feeling and sexual arousal. Careful observation would reveal the fact that on almost all television station you turn to there is either a beautiful damsel who is half naked intentionally showing off her cleavage, the size of her breast or her hip just to get your attention to a particular product or service. This is also the case for the opposite sex who would flaunt his muscle and “six pack” just to sell underwear’s. Access to the internet (which is actually a great thing) have heightened this issue of sexual feeling and arousal most especially among undergraduates who at the click of every link is beckoned to subscribe to a porn site or watch a pornographic video, or hookup. Newspaper, Magazines and other book materials are not left out in this jingle of sex and sexual activities. All of which strengthens and empowers the individual to engage in premarital sex, where everything around an individual preaches the pleasure of sex and a desire to gratify ones id.</p> <p>A look at all the facts and speculation that has been built around premarital sex among individuals in the society at large and among undergraduate students of the University of Benin in particular, one can conclude that it is a matter that needs to be addressed and causes carefully assessed to get better understanding or insight into these causes and possibly provide alternative activities or suggestions that can help address this issue for the benefit of the individual, the university community and the nation at large.               </p> <p><strong>Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>This research work is designed to assess the cause of premarital sex among undergraduate students of the University of Benin. From my own personal observation, a walk and a careful survey of the environs of the university community one would find packs of already used condoms littering the ground, even though it is not that rampant. It could be possible that these packs was used as instructional materials or for the primary purpose for which it was made.</p> <p>Students lives in community, where they meet people from different background and as such they are exposed to peer influence and a desire to meet up with certain standard. All of this and more can lead to premarital sex which culminates in various problem such as unwanted pregnancy, exposure to sexually transmitted infections, poor academic performance, school dropout and a host of others.</p> <p>All of these problems associated with premarital sex are preventable or at least the effect on a large majority of students can be reduced to the barest minimum. Accessing the causes can help us better understand ways to prevent and checkmate the occurrence of premarital sex among undergraduate students of the University of Benin.</p> <p>Premarital sex, pose a great threat to the future of the numerous naive students admitted yearly into the university and also to the name of the school, because if this act increase various consequences will inevitably follow and it can grow into becoming a part of the culture among the students, taking a cue from “arrowing” which means to throw abusive words on passerby from the flyover just to have fun and make them feel embarrassed. From this one can see that there is need to carefully assess the causes of premarital sex among undergraduate students of the</p> <p>University of Benin.         </p> <p><strong>Research questions</strong></p> <p>In a view to reaching a meaningful and an objective result/conclusion the following questions were drawn to guide the research work.</p> <p>1.     Does peer group influence contribute to the occurrence of premarital sex?</p> <p>2.     Do financial gains influence premarital sex?</p> <p>3.     Does curiosity have any effect on premarital sex?</p> <p>4.     Do the media influence the occurrence of premarital sex?</p> <p><strong>Purpose of the study</strong></p> <p>  The purpose of this research work is the assessment of the causes of premarital sex among undergraduate students of the University of Benin. The effect of premarital sex and possible suggestions for preventing or curbing this menace.</p> <p>This research work will help school authorities to Identify measures to be put in place that will help to curb the incidence of premarital sex among undergraduate students.</p> <p>If this study is properly utilized, it can help the school authority and the public in general on better approach to teaching sex and sex education.</p> <p><strong>Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>The conclusion reached and the result gotten from this research will provide additional knowledge to past research findings already done on premarital sex, provide the University of Benin with an arsenal of knowledge about the causes of premarital sex in her institute and also would be very beneficial to the numerous student admitted yearly to be better equipped against the pressure and occurrence of premarital sex among undergraduates.  </p> <p>This study will help to identify how peer influence contributes to premarital sex, the influence of financial gains on premarital sex, how curiosity or desire to experiment affects student’s decisions to engage in sexual intercourse before marriage. </p> <p>Finally the results of this study can be used to strategize for better alternatives on educating the students on sex, and how to go about the unavoidable pressure associated with sex in the university community.     </p> <p><strong>Scope of the study</strong></p> <p>This research study is focused on the prestigious federal university of Benin located in Egor local government of Edo State, Nigeria.

Other forms of penetrative sexual intercourse include penetration of the anus by the penis (anal sex), penetration of the mouth by the penis or oral penetration of the vulva or vagina (oral sex), sexual penetration by the fingers (fingering), and penetration by use of a strap-on dildo (Rutter &amp; Steinberg, 2004). These activities involve physical intimacy between two or more individuals and are usually used among humans solely for physical or emotional pleasure and commonly contribute to human bonding (Richard &amp; Fedwa, 2007). A variety of views concern what constitutes sexual intercourse or other sexual activity (Douglas &amp; Nancy, 2008) which can also impact views on sexual health (O’leary, 2002).</p> <p>            The term sex, often shorthand for sexual intercourse, can mean any form of sexual activity (Randall &amp; Byers, 2003). Because people can be at risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections during these activities (Daouglas, Ann, Fedwa &amp; Randall, 2007) though the transmission risk is significantly reduced during non-penetrative sex (Keath, Wayne &amp; Nilamadhab, 2005), safe sex practice is advised (Dianne, 2008) various jurisdictions have placed restrictive laws against certain sexual acts, such as incest, sexual activity with minors, extra marital sex, prostitution, sodomy, rape and zoophilia. Religious beliefs also play a role in personal decision about sexual intercourse or other sexual activity such as decisions about virginity (Daouglas, Ann, Fedwa &amp; Randall, 2007) as well as legal and public policy matters.</p> <p>            Religious views on sexuality vary significantly between different religions and sects of the same religion, though there are common themes, such as prohibition of adultery. Reproductive sexual intercourse between non-human animal is more often termed copulation, and sperm may be introduced into the female’s reproductive tract in non-vaginal ways among the animals, such as by cloacal copulation. For most non-human mammals, mating and copulation occur at the point of estrus (the most fertile period of time in the female’s reproductive cycle), which increases the chances of successful impregnation (Lloyd, Rutter &amp; Ann, 2007; Jared, 2005). However, bonobos, dolphins and chimpanzees are known to engage in sexual intercourse regardless of whether or not the female is in estrus, and to engage in sex act with some sex partners (Hales, Ann, &amp; Weiner, 2010) like human engaging in sexual activity primarily for pleasure (Carpenter, 2005), this behaviour in the aforementioned animals is also presumed to be for pleasure (Fawcett, 2008), and contributing factor to strengthening their social bonds (Laura, 2005).            </p> <p>The sexual rate activity rate among young teens is increasing. Among males who turned 20 between 1970 and 1972, 20 percent had sexual intercourse by age 15, compared to 27 percent of those who turned 20 between 1985 and 1987. Of females who turned 20 between 1985 and 1987, 10 percent had initiated sexual intercourse by age 15. Compared to 14 percent of those who turned 20 between 1970 and 1972 (Marisglio &amp; Mott, 1998). African Americans are more likely to initiate sexual intercourse at a young age. More than half of African American males have already had sexual intercourse by age 15. White and Hispanic males do not attain these levels of sexual activity until age 17. In 1992, approximately 25 percent African American females and approximately 15 percent Hispanic and white females have had sexual intercourse by age 15 (Marsiglio &amp; Mott, 1998). Pregnancy rate among females age 14 and under rose from 13.5 (per 1,000 females age 14) in 1973 to 17.1 in 1992. Approximately nine percent of sexually experienced females age 14 and under become pregnant each year (Moore, Miller &amp; Glei, 1995). The abortion rate among all females age 14 and under was 5.6 (per 1,000 female age 14) in 1973, 8.4 in 1980 and 7.9 in 1990. In 1994, there were 12,901 births to teens under the age of 15 (Nord, Moore &amp; Morrison, 1992). Moreso, adolescent females may be more susceptible to STDs than older women. Teen girls have fewer antibiotics to STDs and may have a higher risk of cervical infections (Moore, Miller &amp; Glei, 1995). The maternal death rate for teen under age 15 is two and a half times greater than that of mothers aged 20 to 24 (Moore, Myers &amp; Morrison, 1993). Babies born to teens younger’s than 15 are more than twice as likely to weigh less than 2,500 grams (about 5.5 pounds) at birth and are three times more likely to die in the first 28 days of life than babies born to older mothers (Langan &amp; Harlow, 1994). The risk between early child bearing and poor health outcomes is due to the numerous risk factors associated with being young, such as inadequate prenatal care and nutrition (Boyer &amp; Fine, 1992). The younger a woman is, the less likely she is to receive prenatal care during the first trimester of her pregnancy (Moore, Miller, &amp; Glei, 1995). Of African American teen mothers who were less than 16 years old when they gave birth, 72 percent were still living in poverty at age 27. Among Hispanic women and White women, 67 percent and 32 percent, respectively, are living in poverty (Boyer &amp; Fine, 1992).                     </p> <p>            Sexual abstinence has been seen as the only way of avoiding different sexually transmitted diseases and, it has put in much efforts at it’s campaign to school students, civil servants, private sectors workers and independent workers; as to the advantages of staying away from having sexual intercourse before marriage. This camping become enstrengthened due to the discovery of the ubiquitous killer disease known as Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) which has an onset of Human Immune Virus (HIV) and, this has caused sexual activities to reduce to the bearest minimum. Though some are still perpetrating commercial sexual activities but, not as it used to be on the increase sometimes back. The first cases of AIDS were identified in Uganda in the early 1990s (Kagimu, 1996). Since then the epidemic has progressed, with an estimated 15 – 20 million Ugandans out of a total population of 18 million HIV-positive (STD/ACP Programme, 1995). There has been several researches carried out on sexual abstinence all over the world, and, but of variables had been used to measure sexual abstinence. Some of which are in-laws, literacy level, peer influence and many more but, all these are still demanding that other variables be used to test sexual absence.</p> <p>            An examination of the characteristics of adolescent sexual behaviour shows that there are differences by gender and socio-economic status, with males found to be sexually involved at younger ages than females. Some studies examined the role of schooling on adolescent sexual behaviour, and argued that in-school teenagers are more likely to exert autonomy in deciding to engage in sexual relationships. The role of the family as a socialization agent has also been examined. Meeker found that in general, the social control exercised by community elders over the fertility and sexuality of young female has become weak due to modernization and westernization. The Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey of 2007 reported that the median age at first sexual intercourse for girls is just over 16 years. By age 18 and 20, 63% and approximately 80% respectively have experienced sexual intercourse. The second phase of the survey published in 1999 reported that half of the female respondents had sexual intercourse by age 18; about one-quarter had sex before age 15. Interesting aspect of the report is that, men are exposed to sexual intercourse later than women. The median age at first sexual intercourse among men is 20, compared to 18 for women. While the HIV/AIDS pandemic has been inflicting a devastating impact on various sectors of life, one of the major obstacles to its prevention is social stigma. Stigma is defined as an attribute that is deeply discrediting which links a person to undesirable characteristics, thus reducing that individual’s status in the eyes of society (Clifford, 2004). It has been indicated that stigmatized individuals are believed to possess some features that convey a social identity that is devalued in a particular social context. In stigma, one group sees the other as abnormal and should be abhorred. It’s components includes people distinguishing and labeling human differences; dominant groups linking labeled persons to undesirable characteristics; labeled persons are placed in distinct categories so as to accomplish some degree of separation of ‘us’ from ‘them’ and labeled persons experience status loss and discrimination that leads to unequal outcomes (Dorothy, 2003). It manifests in avoidance, social distancing, coercion and non-supportiveness’s elf-stigma leads to reduced or diminished self-esteem. Stigmatization can lead to prejudicial thoughts, behaviours and actions on the part of individuals and groups (Adelini, 2004).</p> <p>            The ancient world discouraged promiscuity for both healthy and social reasons (Joseph, 2003). According to Pythagoras (6th century BCE), sex should be practiced in the winter, but not the summer, but was harmful to male health in every season because the loss of semen was dangerous, hard to control and both physically and spiritually exhausting, but had no effect on females (Robert, 2005). This idea may have been merged with Zoroastrian idea of good and evil in a philosophy known as Gnosticism, which influenced Christian and Islamic attitudes to sexual activity (Emery, 2005). Throughout history, and especially prior to the 20th century, there have been those who have held that sexual abstinence confers numerous health benefits. For males, lack of abstinence was thought to cause a reduction of vitality. In modern times, the argument has been phrased in biological terms, claiming that loss of semen through ejaculation result in a depletion of vital nutrients such as lecithin and phosphorous, which are also found at the higher levels in the brain.               </p> <p>            Some advantages in favour of sexual abstinence were also claimed by Walter Siegmeister, better known as Raymond and Bernard, an early 20th century American alternative health, esoteric writer, author and mystic, who formed part of the alternative reality subculture. In his essay entitled science discovers the physiological value of continence (1957) he states: “It is clear that there is an important internal physiological relation between the secretion of the sex glands and the central nervous system, that the loss of these secretions, voluntarily or involuntarily, exercises a detrimental effect on the nutrition and vitality of the nerves and brain, while, on the other hand, the conservation of these secretions has a vitalizing effect on the nervous system, a regenerating effect on the endocrine glands, and a rejuvenating effect on the organism as a whole.” Considering the above statement based on what is experienced amid youths in the Nigeria setting, there are believes that when one refrain from sex such a person would have scrotal pains so, this believe has caused many youths to run into sex while others believe that, by having sex, ones life longevity reduces by twenty one days depending on the number of time he/she have sex, so, this also is refraining youths from having sexual intercourse while some youths are not even afraid to face any negative consequences for having se. the widely dreaded HIV/AIDS is another thing of fear among youth in that it’s victims have been seen and, it’s news is allover the places and, still some youth could not abstain from having sex so, they use contraceptives/protectives such as condom. This endemic has to stop or get reduced in rate therefore, parents, government, non-governmental bodies, association, etc has a lot to do as regard the issue of sexual abstinence among youths.</p> <p>            Sexual abstinence has been practiced at all edges by different cultural backgrounds even, biblical proof stated 1st Thessalonians 4:2-4 that, “for this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honour. In the African setting, it is common of parents to monitor their children such as knowing where and when they will leave a particular place and, most importantly, the types of friends that they keep because, it is a taboo in African cultural setting for a young man to get married to a disvirgin lady even, it is a disgrace to the entire family of such a lady.  This African culture is also depicted in the book of Hebrew 13:4, “let marriage be held in honour among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.  The medicine of the Prophet by Al-Suyuti (pp. 18-20) states “go and take virgin as your wife whom you will caress and who will caress you,” while an Hadith of the Prophet (S.A.W) states “whoever among you is troubled by his sexual urge, let him marry for marriage causes the eyes to be lowered and safeguards the private parts.” This facts undoubtedly shows that the African culture against sexual intercourse before marriage isn’t bias but, for the safety of the adolescents in that, a lot of it had led to contracting of deadly sexually transmitted diseases.</p> <p>            Parents, as adolescents themselves reveal, are the ones who have the most influence on their children’s decisions about sex. Indeed, two-thirds of all adolescents share their parent’s value on this. nearly all parents (90 percent) report having had a helpful conversation about delaying sex and avoiding pregnancy with their adolescent children, compared to 71 percent of adolescents who report having had such a conversation with their parents (Edgars, 2000). Meanwhile, several negative outcomes has been attached to adolescent sexual intercourse especially those who lack parental monitoring and these outcomes are: lack of wages and career opportunities, increased welfare dependency, interrupted education, single parenthood, psychological distress, increased medical complications during childbirth and high likelihood of further unintended pregnancies (Chilman, 1988; Voydanoff &amp; Donelly, 1993; McLaughlin &amp; Micklin, 1983; Zabin &amp; Hayward, 1993). Drop in abstinence, religion may also play a vital role at bringing adolescents to consciousness on the related risks associated with having sexual intercourse before marriage.</p> <p>            Religion plays a significant role in the life of individuals in any society. It’s role as a moral builder has been variously acknowledged but, one factor that has not been given adequate attention in Nigeria, especially among adolescents, is the role of religion in adolescents sexuality. Although several studies have shown a correlation between adolescent sexual behaviour and religious commitment (Cullen, 2003), no serious attempt to confirm the underlying mechanism through which religion affects sexual behaviour exists in Nigeria because, religious values are the source of moral proscriptions for many individuals, the teachings of the churches and mosques are likely to play a role in the formation of individual attitudes, values and decisions. The extent to which religion influence individual attitudes and behaviour, however, depends on the specific doctrines and religious institutions on the degree of integration and commitment of individuals to their particular religious institutions (Iyod, 1999; Beckly, 2000; &amp; Larma, 2001).</p> <p>            The Christian religious group have strong opposition against premarital sex, although such opposition is more radical among the Pentecostal and evangelical religious movements. While the later can sanction their members by excommunication, the former can tolerate the offending members with the hope that they will turn a new life (Odimegwu, 2005). This differential institutional commitment to premarital sexual abstinence leads to the expectation that in individual Catholics and evangelical Protestants would be less accepting of premarital sex than non-fundamentalist Protestants. Those who with no religious affiliation would be most likely to accept and engage in premarital intercourse (Beckly, 2000). Since most religious groups discourage premarital sex, the degree of commitment to religious organizations may be more important as a determinant of premarital sex and abstinence attitudes and behaviour than religious affiliation.</p> <p>            Individuals who attend religious services may receive more frequency religious messages on abstinence and, their greater religious commitment may also make them more likely to accept the teaching of their religious institutions concerning abstinence and against premarital sex. Thus, individuals who attend religious services frequently and who value religion in their lives are probably more likely than others to develop sexual attitudes and behaviour that are consistent with their religious doctrines. As a result young people who are active in religious groups would either have a greater commitment towards sexual abstinence before marriage or would place greater emphasis on maturity in sexual relationships than would young adolescents less active in religion institutions (Peter, 2001 &amp; Odimegwu, 2004).</p> <p>            Charity is always believed to begin at home. So, as a parental, monitoring of the children is very essential and, the teaching of moral lessons so that, even if peer would influence such a child it will be of bearest minimal and such child might have developed a filter to choose from shaft and powder. Many policy makers, health professionals, and “safe sex” advocates respond to parental influence and adolescents sex by demanding more comprehensive sex education and broader access to contraceptives for minors. They assume that adolescents are unable to delay their sexual behaviour and that a combination of information about and access to contraceptives will effectively lead to protected sex, preventing any form of harm to adolescents. Not only are these assumptions faulty, they tend to disregard important factors that have been linked to reduce adolescent’s sexual activity. A particularly noticeable omission is parental influence. Therefore, this study chooses to test sexual abstinence in adolescents using the duo of parental monitoring and religious influence as correlates of sexual abstinence among in-school adolescents.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Sexual activities has found it’s bearing among Nigeria in-school adolescents and this has even polluted the academic environment by reduction in the number of female adolescents who achieves in terms of education; due to unintended pregnancies, contraction of deadly diseases such as HIV/AIDS and others sexually transmitted diseases which will not allow them to complete their education with their colleagues; eventually makes them become a dropout.                                   </p> <p>            The issue of sexual abstinence which cannot be adopted by adolescent brought a lot of adverse effect in the area of teenage pregnancy, contraction of HIV/AIDS, abortion, leading to the destruction of the womb, maternal death, due to unripe age of child delivery, rapid school drop-out due to unplanned pregnancies, etc. All these have brought about low self-esteem in the adolescent and a decline in the manpower of a nation. Consequently, it brings about a huge disgrace to the family from where they originate.             </p> <p>            Moreso, peer influence most times play a changing of orientation from acceptable to unacceptable; role in adolescents in that, some parents have time to take care of their wards but, these wards goes out there to come-in with an entire different attitude. Most times these attitudes that are acquired are kept in the covert at home but, overt at the midst of friends. So, the role or impact of peers can also not be underestimated when considering factors that causes sexual activities among in-school adolescents. </p> <p>            Campaign on sexual abstinence has been echoed by various religious organizations while some adolescents are adapting and most of them are remaining adamant in that, they have tasted sex and are not willing to change therefore, government should equip schools with counsellors and bring back the life planning foundation programmes that was eradicated so as to compliment the effective work of counsellors at reducing sexual activities and promoting sexual abstinence among in-school adolescent; because it was observed that, the absence of these two factors also contributed to increase in the sexual activities of Nigeria in-school adolescents. </p> <p>            Sexuality in the period of adolescent is poorly handled in that, in Nigeria, most parents sees sex education as country to the teachings of the Koran and Bible therefore, they failed to enlighten the adolescents. These adolescents when mixed with their peers learn alot of things about sex and, they pick it up in the wrong way; a situation which gas accounted for different unintended pregnancies, different lives had been lost through abortion while several innocent by ignorant souls had been lost through HIV/AIDS.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The general purpose of this study is to assess the influence of parental monitoring and religious activities on sexual abstinence in some selected secondary schools in Ilorin West LGA of Kwara State. </p> <p> The study is guided by the following research questions.</p> <p>(1)   To what extent will parental monitoring jointly predict sexual abstinence among in-school adolescents in Ilorin West LGA of Kwara State.</p> <p>(2)   Is there any relationship between the independent variables (parental monitoring and religious influence) and the dependent variable (sexual abstinence) among in-school adolescents in Ilorin West LGA of Kwara State.</p> <p><strong>(3)</strong>   What is the relative contribution of parental monitoring and religious influence on sexual abstinence among in-school adolescents in Ilorin West LGA of Kwara State.</p> <p><strong>1.4       Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study will benefit students especially, the female because, some of the adverse effects of school activities are treated in this research while the benefits that awaits those who could refrain from sexual activities are also discussed i.e. those who engages in it jeopardizes their future career opportunities by dropping out of school due to unintended pregnancy and abortion to include the loose of lives while those who refrain will set the sky as their limit in academic and career pursuit. Ultimately, the killer endemic disease HIV/AIS and other STDs awaits those who practices sexual; activities while those who refrain enjoys their God given life.     </p> <p>            Parents stand vagary of chances to benefit from this study in that, those parents who are myopic of the fact that HIV/AIDS and other SIDs exist and those who are aware would be able to use knowledge gained from this study to protect their wards through words of advise and motivation especially, enlightening them on the dangers in sex before marriage and the shame it can cause the family. It will enable parents to enlighten wards on the existing cultural, Biblical and Koranic beliefs as regards sex before marriage as to as reduce sexual activities among adolescents.</p> <p>            Schools will benefit from this study by organizing sexual abstinence programmes for students as did by Federal Government of Nigeria in 1997; a programmer which several numbers of student benefitted from.  Important information on sexual abstinence could help pupils manage their health. Evaluation of comprehensive sex education programme shows that these programmes could help youth delay onset of sexual activity, reduce the frequency of sexual activity, reduce number of sexual partners, and increase condom and contraceptive use. Importantly, the evidence shows youth who receive comprehensive sex education are not more likely to become sexually active, increase sexual activity, or experience negative sexual health outcomes.       </p> <p>            Counsellors should intensify their efforts believing that teens who received a behavioural intervention centered on abstinence were more likely to delay first sexual intercourse than teens who received a control intervention. Studies have shown that behavioural interventions can reduce behaviours related to HIV/AIDS and STI risks. Intervention programmes would be based on strengthening beliefs, supporting abstinence, preventing pregnancy and STIs, foster attainment of future goals and increase skills for resisting pressure to have sex.</p> <p>            Religious leaders should identify efforts to talk out adolescents on sexual activities making them understand that the religious which such adolescent practices doe not favour it. This could be effective during modrast lessons (for Islam) and Sunday Schools and Bible Studies (for Christians) where topics relating to sexual activities could be discussed and, adolescents will be made to see the negative outcomes of sexual activities as a way of abreacting their minds from sexual activities.  </p> <p>            Community comprise of parents of adolescents therefore the community should take into cognizance the betterment of their wards by implementing some rules and regulations that will strictly kick against sexual activities and indecent dressing in the environ. Community can bring up ethics that will refrain adolescents from sexual activities and, this could be discussed at the community meeting where different ethical codes can be put in place.   </p> <p>            Policy makers have continued to support these campaign on sexual abstinence and, there is clear evidence including compelling recent evidence from a long-awaited, congressionally mandated report on federally funded abstinence-only-until-marriage programmes that are effective in stopping and delaying adolescents sex. Infact, policy makers through Federal Government has been supporting and evaluating single-purpose abstinence promotion programmes since 1992 and there is evidence that the programmes are effective i.e. Life Planning Education Programmes (LFEP).     </p> <p><strong>1.5       Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study is limited to the study of parental monitoring and religious activities on sexual abstinence.

He went on to criticize society’s increasingly permissive attitude toward out-of-wedlock childbearing, pointing specifically to the treatment of the issue in the television sitcom Murphy Brown. “It doesn’t help matters when prime time TV has Murphy Brown—a character who supposedly epitomizes today’s intelligent, highly paid, professional woman—mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and calling it just another ‘lifestyle choice.’”</p> <p>         Quayle’s speech, especially his reference to Murphy Brown, provoked an outpouring of commentary. Numerous Americans agreed with Quayle, expressing concern that the “traditional family” and “family values” were being undermined by a public morality that too readily condoned unwed motherhood and divorce. Many also agreed with Quayle’s argument that the media and popular culture were to blame for promoting loose sexual values and immoral lifestyles.</p> <p>         Others took exception to Quayle’s statements. Some, seeing his speech as a moralistic attack on single mothers, responded by insisting that most single mothers work hard to provide for their children and to raise them well. Others considered Quayle’s view of the traditional family as nostalgic and unrealistic, out of touch with the social and economic realities of life in contemporary America. The character Murphy Brown, played by actress Candice Bergen, directly responded to Quayle in a subsequent episode of the show. In words that doubtlessly resonated with many Americans, she declared, “Perhaps it’s time for the vice president to expand his definition [of family] and recognize that whether by choice or circumstance families come in all shapes and sizes. And ultimately, what really defines a family is commitment, caring and love.”</p> <p>           The intensity of the public reaction to Quayle’s speech suggests that his comments touched on an issue of concern to a large number of people. Indeed, many commentators have expressed alarm about the increase in single-parent families over the past four decades. In 1960, they point out; 5.8 million American children lived in single-parent families; by 1996 that number had risen to 18 million. This growth has been fueled by an increasing rate of out-of-wedlock childbearing. In 1960, 5.3 percent of American babies were born to unwed mothers; that rate has increased to 30 percent. These numbers are even higher for African Americans: As of 1992, 68 percent of African American babies were born to unmarried women. A rising divorce rate has also contributed to the growing number of single-parent families. The U.S. divorce rate rose nearly 250 percent between 1960 and 1980; it then leveled off at what is now the highest rate in the industrialized world. It is commonly noted that about half of the marriages undertaken today will end in divorce.</p> <p>                 Much of the debate over single-parent families focuses on how these trends affect children. Many social scientists contend that children raised in single-parent homes are more likely to experience a variety of problems than are children raised in two-parent homes</p> <p>          Family this is seen as the social group whose members are related by ancestry, marriage or adoption and who live together, cooperate economically and care for the young (Murdock.1998).</p> <p>              Family is also seen as a group of  individuals  related  by  to  one  another  by  blood  ties, marriage or adoption who form an economic unit, the adult members are responsible  for the upbringing of children (Giddens, 1997).</p> <p>             Types of family relationships are always recognized within wider kinship groups. In virtually all societies we can identify what sociologists and anthropologist call the nuclear family two adults living together in a household with their own or adopted children.</p> <p>Extended family may include grand parents, brothers and their wives, sisters and their husbands, aunts and nephews.</p> <p>Single parent families can be defined as families where a parent lives with dependent children, either alone or in a larger household, without a spouse or partner. There was a rapid and drastic increase in the number of single-parent families in the latter half of the twentieth century. This change has been used by some to argue that we are witnessing the breakdown of the family (defined as a married couple residing with their dependent offspring) with negative effects for children, families, and society (Popenoe 1996).</p> <p>         Types of single parent families are generally categorized by the sex of the custodial parent (mother-only or father-only families).</p> <p>          Mother-only families include widows, divorced and separated women, and never-married mothers. In the case of divorce, mothers are usually given custody in the United States and other developed countries. In Italy, in 1997, for example, 90 percent of children whose parents divorced went into the custody of their mothers. Since the vast majority of single parents are mothers, most of the research focuses on female-headed families. However, regardless of sex, single parents share similar problems and challenges (Grief 1985).                                                                                                                                                           </p> <p>               Father- only families formed as a result of widowhood, desertion by the mother, or wives refusing custody. The increase in father-only families is due, in part, to the efforts of fathers to obtain custody of their children. Factors supporting their transition into primary parenthood include financial security, prior involvement in housework and child care during the marriage, satisfaction with child-care arrangements, and a shared sense of responsibility for the marital breakup (Grief 1985).</p><p> 1.2 Statement of the Problem                          </p> <p>         The problem of this study is to find out the most urgent problem that now faces the single parent families.

Experimental design was used in order to assess the opinions of the respondent with the use of questionnaire to deduce responses from the participants. One hundred and twenty (120) students were selected randomly from three senior secondary schools in the Local government of the study. The instrument utilized for the study was Self designed Questionnaire. Five hypotheses were postulated and tested in the study, using the independent t-test for hypothesis one and hypothesis three, while hypotheses two was analyzed with analysis of variance, while four and five were tested using the Pearson Product Moment Correlation Co-efficient tool at 0.05 level of significance . At the end of the analysis, the following results emerged: Hypothesis one revealed the  that there was significant difference between family conflicts and sexual abuse; Hypothesis two revealed that therewas significant relationship between Policies, Family environments and sexual abuse;Hypothesis three revealed that there is no significant difference between anxieties by adolescents and sexual abuse; and Hypothesis four revealed that there was significant relationship between groups by adolescents and sexual abuse; while Hypothesis five revealed that there was significant relationship between sexuality educations acquired by adolescents and sexual abuse. Based on the findings of the study, the following recommendations among others were forwarded that government should create awareness of sexuality education and danger involved in any one who is been caught in sexual abuse. More so, Government should also employ those that study sexuality education and competent in the field of sexuality education. Hence, it is suggested that similar research with relevant research methodology should be used in carrying out research in other states of the federation to ascertain the degree of conformity which this research have on sexual abuse and sexuality education of adolescents of all senior secondary school students in Nigeria.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong>       <strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Over the last three decades, researchers, clinicians, and other health advocates have explored the incidence, prevalence, and consequences of sexual violence occurring within the context of domestically violent relationships, including adult marital and cohabiting relationships. Until recently, sexually based crimes occurring within adolescent acquaintance and dating relationships have gone largely unnoticed (Wordes&amp; Nunez, 2002). In fact, most research, education, and preventative measures with adolescent populations have largely been related to sexual violence perpetrated by a parent or caregiver ( Stufflebeam, D. L. 2003). However, increased inquiry into rape and sexual assault among our nation's youth, such as the National Council on Crime and Delinquency's review of victimization of teenagers (Wordes&amp; Nunez, 2002) and the U.S. Department of Justices' (USDOJ) evaluation of Sexual Victimization of College Women (Fisher, Cullen, and Turner, 2000), has focused attention on the nature and consequences of sexual violence occurring within our adolescent population. This attention has resulted in the inclusion of two Healthy People 2010 objectives that relate specifically to reducing rape, attempted rape, and sexual assault among children and adolescent in Nigeria.</p> <p>The World Health Organization  (WHO), in the World Report on Violence and Health (Krug, Dahlberg, Mercy, Zwi, &amp; Lozano, 2002), defined sexual violence as: Any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed, against a persons sexuality using coercion, by any person, regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting, including but not limited to home and work. Sexual violence may include attempted and/or completed rape, sexual coercion and harassment, sexual contact with force or threat of force, and threat of rape (Fisher, Cullen, and Turner, 2000; WHO, 2002). According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), adolescents are more likely to experience sexually violent crimes than any other age group (AAP, 2001). In fact, greater than half of all victims of sexual crimes, including rape and sexual assault, are women under the age of 25 years. The National Crime Victim Survey (2000) noted that adolescent females age 16-19 are four times more likely than the general population to report sexual assault, rape, and attempted rape. Often this violence occurs within the context of dating or acquaintance relationships, with the female partner the likely victim of violence and the male partner the likely perpetrator.  However, other forms of sexual violence occurring among our nations youth, including sexual violence in gay and lesbian relationships, sexual violence perpetrated as hate crimes, and sexual violence as a form of hazing, while not included in this review, should not be disregarded. </p> <p>Sexual abuse experienced in childhood or adolescence is a developmental stressor that can have profound, long-term physiologic and psychosocial effects (Banyard, Williams, &amp; Siegel, 2001; Cicchetti &amp; Rogosch, 2001; DeBellis, 2001). It has been associated with a variety of health-compromising behaviours and health problems, often considered attempts to cope with the trauma engendered by the abuse (Barker &amp; Musick, 1994; Finkelhor &amp; Browne, 1985; Hutchinson &amp; Langlykke, 1997).</p> <p>Over the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the partnering of adolescent females with older adult males, often referred to as adult-teen sex (Donovan, 1997; Elstein&amp; Davis, 1997; Harner, Burgess, &amp; Asher, 2001; Lindberg, Sonenstein, Ku, and Martinez , 1997.) While most adult women do partner with slightly older males, application of this social norm to adolescent females has been linked to an increased risk for victimization, including physical and sexual violence. Furthermore, imbalances in power and control, financial resources, levels of life experience, and even physical strength and stature may place younger females partnered with adult males at risk for experiencing unplanned and unprotected sex, unwanted pregnancy, and exposure to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV and AIDS. While partnering with an older male may be considered consensual in nature to the female, her peers, and possibly her family, sexual relationships with significantly older males may meet the legal definition of statutory rape. As such, several teen advocacy and pregnancy prevention programs have called for increased utilization of existing statutory rape laws to aid in the prosecution and punishment of adult men who have sex with adolescent females (Harner, Burgess, &amp; Asher, 2001).</p> <p><strong>1.2       Theoretical framework</strong></p> <p><strong>Bowen Theory</strong></p> <p> Bowen's family systems theory (shortened to 'Bowen theory' from 1974) was one of the first comprehensive theories of family systems functioning (Bowen, 1966, 1978, Kerr and Bowen, 1988). It continues to be a central influence in the practice of family therapy.  It is possible that some local family therapists have been influenced by many of Bowen's ideas</p> <p>Bowen family systems theory is a theory of human behavior that views the family as an emotional unit and uses systems thinking to describe the complex interactions in the unit. It is the nature of a family that its members are intensely connected emotionally. Often people feel distant or disconnected from their families, but this is more feeling than fact. Family members so profoundly affect each other's thoughts, feelings, and actions that it often seems as if people are living under the same \"emotional skin.\" People solicit each other's attention, approval, and support and react to each other's needs, expectations, and distress. The connectedness and reactivity make the functioning of family members interdependent. A change in one person's functioning is predictably followed by reciprocal changes in the functioning of others. Families differ somewhat in the degree of interdependence, but it is always present to some degree. Eight interlocking concepts make up Bowen's theory.</p> <p><strong>Justification of </strong><strong>Bowen</strong><strong> theory</strong></p> <p>Adolescence is a stage of storm and stress; boys and girls are into rape due to the unequal before the law of the land. There should be right to speak out to the necessary authorities if rape incident occurs, regardless of power and personality. If things are all equal, the way you treat a rich man victim and a poor man victim, the rate of the perpetrators will significantly reduce.</p> <p>Besides, counsellors, teachers and significant others should try to apply different mechanism to reduces the rate of rape in the society and to treat everybody equal before the law.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>Sexual violence is often referred to as a \"hidden\" crime (CDC, 2000) or a \"silent epidemic\" as rape and sexual assault frequently go unreported to the police and other authorities (Abbey, Zawacki, Buck, Clinton, &amp; Mcauslan, 2001). In fact, according to the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault (2001), less than 15% of rapes are ever reported. This has been a concern for the researcher to dwell on the study.</p> <p>Adolescents also may minimize sexually violent behaviours or may not perceive the sexual act as a crime and thus, not report sexual abuse case. Fisher, Cullen, and Turner (2000) noted that among college women who described experiencing a sexual act meeting the legal definition of rape, less than half (46.5%) personally defined the experience as rape. This may be due to several factors, including denial, sexual inexperience, guilt, previous victimization, and acceptance of traditional sex-role stereotypes. Furthermore, the misperception that visible injuries and physical trauma are always present after assault may cause some adolescents, especially those with minimal physical injuries, to not identify as a victim. This gives the researcher so much concern and if probably to design a paradigm to follow when adolescent is sexually abused.</p> <p>Fear may also significantly impact an adolescent's likelihood of reporting sexual abuse case. Among college age women, Fisher, Cullen, and Turner (2000) noted that 95% of rapes were not reported to the police. While two-thirds of the victims did tell someone about the assault, such as a friend, family member, or college official, victims cited fear that they would be treated hostility by the police (24.7%) and fear of reprisal by the assailant or others (39.5%) as factors influencing their decision not to report the crime. Fear may be a significant barrier to reporting when the perpetrator is a fellow classmate or peer with whom the victim must interact on a regular basis.</p> <p>Characteristics of the abuse experience have also been shown to differ for girls and boys. It was found that the estimated percentage of male victims’ perpetrators who are themselves male ranges from 18 to 97, depending on the study, and that the estimated percentage of male perpetrators for female victims ranges from 80 to 100 ( Dhaliwal, 1996).</p> <p>Though most investigations regarding sexual violence occurring among adolescents target college-age populations, there is growing evidence that sexual violence in dating and acquaintance relationships may occur among much younger populations (Beyer &amp;Ogletree, 1998). In 1998 the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions National Violence Against Women Survey, which explored the incidence and prevalence of both intimate partner violence and sexual violence, noted that one out of every six women has been the victim of rape or attempted rape by the age of 18 (Tjaden and Thoennes, 1998). Almost one-third (32%) of these assaults took place between the ages of 12 and 17 years.</p> <p>Fear may also significantly impact an adolescent's likelihood of reporting sexual abuse. Among college age women, Fisher, Cullen, and Turner (2000) noted that 95% of rapes were not reported to the police. While two-thirds of the victims did tell someone about the assault, such as a friend, family member, or college official, victims cited fear that they would be treated hostility by the police (24.7%) and fear of reprisal by the assailant or others (39.5%) as factors influencing their decision not to report the crime. Fear may be a significant barrier to reporting when the perpetrator is a fellow classmate or peer with whom the victim must interact on a regular basis. </p> <p>This is a problem to the society because the victim that seizes not to report the rape case will be likely to face isolation from his or her peers.</p> <p>The most common age for sexual abuse to begin is age nine. Most sexual abuse is reported by teenagers, but they have usually been victimized for many years before finally reporting the abuse. Most sexual abuse, particularly that involving a continuing relationship or incest, starts before the child reaches puberty (Daugherty, 2012).</p> <p>Therefore, considering the gravity of the problem, this study investigates the differential gender perception of sexual abuse among adolescents in secondary schools.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Purpose of study</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of the study was to determine the differential gender perception of sexual abuse among adolescents in secondary schools in Ikorodu Local Government Area of Lagos State.

It will enable him to understand and appreciate the issues and problems involved in sexual abuse. The emotional, social and physical development of adolescents has a direct effect on their overall development and on the adult they will become. That is why we have to understanding the need to invest in adolescents is so important, so as to maximize their future well-being. Thus, the importance of this study lies in its ability to bring out factors that influence, as well as factors that can hinder sexuality education and development in adolescents.</p> <p>Also, the government especially at the federal level will through this study understand that budgetary allocations given to education is inadequate and may have a change of policy or a rethink on the issue of budgeting allocation to education in Nigeria.

The population of this study covered the teachers in selected secondary schools at Kosofe Local Government, area Lagos State where data was collected using simple random sampling. Collected data was analyzed using chi-square and descriptive statistics. Demographic data such as gender, age, and qualification were used. Findings showed that broken homes has a significance on student’s academic performance. It was concluded that there is a significance difference between students from broken homes and students from intact homes. It was therefore recommended parents should be educated on the importance of living together and the negative effect of broken home on the academic, social and emotional state of the child.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Family is the basic unit of a society and it’s the most important component of the society. According to Alfred Adlers (1973), a family which parent are separated or divorced would affect the individual because every child has a problem in which both the mother and father are to attend to, for example the mother is supposed to teach the child some moral attitudes or behavior while the father is supposed to teach the child (son) how to be a responsible man and to be responsible for the society and to be able to overcome the individual psychological problems like problems of work, problem of friendship, problem of love. It may be alternated to the word “house” but a house is more appropriately referring to the material structure whereas home refers to the intangible things that bind together the family members. It has the immeasurable love and care that keeps together the mother, father and their children. The family is an essential factor for a human well-being, everything about a man, his background, attitude, all his achievements, his honour and dignity, rallies on the structure of the man’s family. Marriage on the other hand can be seen or viewed at as a legal union of two people i.e. a man and woman in love as husband and wife. In Nigeria marriage is regarded as an institution which every person gives much importance.</p> <p>Umahi, (2009) states that, marriage is a system by which a society recognizes a man and a woman bounded by love to stay together as couples, have a sexual relationship and expect children which they will bring up together. In Nigeria when a person is married he or he is expected not only to have children but also to give them the psychological emotional, moral and economic support with adequate education which will be of help to them in future. Couples have the duty to give their children education which will enable them live happily, be stable emotionally, and acquire worthwhile knowledge, understanding and skills.</p> <p>Egbo (2012), views broken home as a place where the parents engage themselves in quarreling, fighting suspecting, keeping late hours to the detriment of the children’s primary drive for food, sleep and other basic needs. Broken homes could be due to divorce, separation or death. If there is no love, understanding and peace in the home children suffer and pay severely for it. Those children may be defective behaviorally and often they are not given worthwhile education training and skills which in turn may have a carryover effect which is always detrimental to the progress and stability of the society. Studies have shown that divorce though frowned at is on the increase amongst our youths. Hake (2000) lamented that after couples have made solemn and sacred contracts before the public, friends well-wishers and family members as their witness to be together till death put them apart, the same couples fall victims to broken home within a short period in our modem society.</p> <p>When a home is broken, affected in many ways for example are the girls who may run into men in order to pay their school fees. Some of them may get pregnant in the process which might which might warrant them to quit schooling entirely (Okoye, 2001). Nwosu (1991) noted that some girls take to prostitution in a bid to also pay their school fees which may be difficult for their single parent. Boys also may give in to robbery roistering in the school, joining criminal gangs and exhibiting all form of social vices.</p> <p>Empirical evidence has equally shown that children from intact-homes will be well taken care of and better socialized life for example a child with a good mother and father care whereby serves as a good model to the child in which the child does not turn into a deviant and more also, peer pressure challenges would be avoided through the supervision and help of both parent. This is due to the fact that the process of socialization depends on both parents playing complimentary roles in raising such children; which will definitely impact positively on the later during school years. On the other hand children from single parent homes are likely to suffer deprivations and denials of some rights and opportunities that will have negative psycho-socio impact on them in school years. Studies have equally shown that children from broken homes are usually associated with anti-social behaviours and poor academic records.</p> <p>Adolescence in simple terms is a distinct phase of life. From Literature it is a period of 13-18 years of an individual’s life. It is a period of rapid psychological and social expansion. Agubosi (2003) stated that it is the era of peer grouping when the adolescents spend most time with their age group. This stage is a period of storm and stress (Bolarin 1999, Olayinka 1997) and identify formation (Osarenren 2001) Adolescence is a transitory period between childhood and adulthood. During this period an individual is seen neither as a child nor an adult. Hall in Salami &amp; Alawode (2000) claimed that adolescents are characterized by emotional instabilities and hyperactivities, which cause them to experience storms and stress. Erickson in Salami &amp; Alawode (2000) opined that identity formation creates tension in the adolescents to the extent that some of them become confused about their personality.</p> <p>The period of adolescence is very important to development of an individual. Any laxity on the part of the parents in assisting and guiding the adolescents may result in academic backwardness and development of unwholesome behaviours. The foundation of what a person becomes in the society is laid in the home and at the initial stage of life. Parents therefore have important roles to play in seeing to it that the youths acquire the appropriate social, psychological, moral and academic development.</p> <p>In Nigeria, the parental roles are culturally determined. Maternal role is that of childcare and home making while the paternal role is that of economic responsibilities and discipline of children. Generally, it is the responsibility of the family, to train and bring up the child in the norms and values of the society. They are to be responsible for the psychological and emotional welfare of the child. The parents are mainly responsible for the educational and career development of their children. However, divorce and separation of various kinds or death of one spouse may leave the role in the hands of a single parent. Single parenting can be defined as a situation in which one of the two individuals, involved in the conception of the child is being responsible for the upbringing of the child Henslin (1985). The family lays the foundation of education before the child goes to school and the personality that the child takes to school is determined by the home Maduewesi &amp; Emenogu (1997). Fadeye (1985) in Salami &amp; Alawode (2000) pointed out that both parents have roles to in child education. The father is to provide the necessary tools for the educational advancement while the mother is supposed to supplement the father’s efforts in this regard. When the father is absent and the mother is not privileged enough to cater for all the basic needs as well as supervise the academic performance of the child he/she (the child) will be backward or withdrawn. The same thing occurs when the mother is absent and the father is not privileged enough Ortese (1998).</p> <p>A single parent faces doubled responsibilities requiring time, attention and money of the parent. Hence, less attention is paid to the psychological well-being and education of the child. Children from single-parent homes are commonly described as more hostile, aggressive, anxious, fearful, hyperactive and distractible than children from intact families Nwachukwu (1998). The concept of adjustment is associated with what may be called living systems: system of organs, psychological systems or personality systems, In the process of adjustment, forces are balanced naturally within the system with forces originating from the environment. The immediate goals of the process may be characterized generally as a type of equilibrium with the system and in the interaction of the system with the environment. Generally, adjustment refers to an individual’s general adaptation to his environment aid the demands of life such as the way he relates to other people that is interpersonal behaviour, handles his responsibilities, deal with stress, for example inadequacy in learning, growing up and meeting his own needs and life satisfactions.</p> <p>Adjustment is not a one way process in which the individual conforms to the duties and requirement of others but rather a two way process, for it is the ability to be oneself, hold on to one’s own and make reality adapt itself to one’s requirement and needs. It does not imply a state or condition of contentment or pure mind. Since life is constantly changing, the ability to revise ones attitude and behavior appropriately is essential ingredient of adjustment. Psycho-social adjustment is easier when the individual is educated &amp; free from family conflicts. There are several issues an individual needs to adjust to in life, academic, psychological, social-life, marital life, job experience etc. For the adolescence academic challenges &amp; problem: from home are one of (he issues they may need adjustment.</p> <p>Secondary school students that are from broken homes are likely not to perform well and are usually withdrawn, shy and anti-social among their mates. The psychologists theorize that individual who is emotionally healthy is the one who has learned to cope effectively with himself and his environment since the environment is in a constant state of flux and the adolescent is continuously developing and changing; psychological effectiveness or good mental health is an ongoing process and not static achievement. The term mental health is really a description of behavior. If a person’s social and personal behavior appears to be reasonably well integrated, he/she appears to be reasonably happy. If the society approves of his/her behavior, his/her means of coping therefore, with himself and his environment may be more effective. Thus he/she may be psychologically healthy or well adjusted (Mickelson, 2001). This study therefore seeks to highlight and enumerate the impact of broken home on academic performance and psychosocial adjustment of secondary school students in Kosofe Local Government.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>There is a global awareness of the importance of the home environment on student’s academic achievement. In Nigeria, most homes are not intact as a result of incompatibility of the couples, death of a parent and the quest for oversea trips to make more money, and at times marital infidelity. This has resulted in the separation of couples and children. In some states in the federation, this is quite clear that most young ladies abandon their homes, and embark on oversea trips with a view to making money. Also, some men who travel abroad, abandon their homes and would not communicate with the families back-home, so, children from such homes are in dilemma, especially in terms of adjustment. Chador (2008) notes that the environment in which a student comes from can greatly influence organization of the family and by extension; effect a child’s emotion, personality and academic achievement. Bearing in mind the role of the family, a child’s education, the failure of the family to perform its duties could hinder the child’s academic achievement. Any nation that is desirous of advancing technologically will no doubt ensure that the future of her future leaders (the adolescents) is well guided, protected and guaranteed.</p> <p>Furthermore, a single parent faces doubled responsibilities requiring time, attention and money. Hence, less attention is paid to the education of the child. The teacher commonly describe children from single parent homes as more hostel, aggressive, anxious, fearful, hyperactive and distractive than children from intact family (Nwachukwu, 1998). Children from broken home exhibit behaviours like drug abuse, smoking, drunkenness, sexual abuse, truancy and disrespect for elders at the detriment of themselves, their family and the society as well.  </p> <p><strong>1.3     Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of broken home on the academic performance and psychological adjustment of secondary school students in Kosofe Local Government Area of Lagos State.

In many countries, especially in developing countries, governments have been the main provider of student accommodation for public higher institutions. As a result of limited government resources, government in developing countries are unable to adequately meet the accommodation demand for all public higher institutions. Over past two decades, governments in many developing countries have involved private hostel providers to participate in building hostels and halls of residence for students in order to meet the demand for more accommodation infrastructure (Centre for Global Education, 2002). This has attracted some private individuals into investment in students’ hostel accommodation.</p> <p>The importance of accommodation covers the entire aspects of human life. Primarily, it involves physical protection from hazards which ordinarily may be regarded as shelter but also provide the setting from many of the basic biological and social processes necessary to sustain life, which permit the healthy growth and development of the mind. In all, accommodation as a unit of the environment of man, has a profound influence on the health, social behaviour, satisfaction and general welfare of the community. It reflects the cultural, social and economic values of a society as it is the best physical and historical evidence of civilization in a country (Aluko, 2009). Research on student development in higher education system in many developed nations is not restricted to academic activities; diverse issues relating to hostels are also involved (Shelton, Nicole, Tessa and Trail 2010; McCorkle and Mason, 2009; Hanasonso and Nadler, 2012). Thus, problems relating to students campus residential settings have been of interest to many researchers, most especially human resource practitioners, Social Psychologists, Sociologists and scholars in humanities etc, in these societies for decades.  Despite the prevalence of a large body of literature on college roommate relationships in developed nations, literature on roommate interpersonal relationships among tertiary students is very scanty in sub-Sahara Africa (SSA). The dearth of knowledge in this area in Nigerian higher institutions of learning is precarious and it is traceable to the poor-state-of- the- art-facilities, which have been hindering effective learning. The most crucial aspect of these facilities as related to this study is insufficient accommodation for students. Where accommodation is available, it usually is poorly maintained and managed due to poor funding of higher education and prevalence of endemic corruption in higher institutions.  Consequently, the management of higher education system resorted to ‘private developer policy on students’ residential matters’ in order to make provisions for students’ accommodation without any financial implication on the institution (Omonijo, Uche, Rotimi &amp; Nwadialor, 2014). </p> <p>The study on student development is never restricted to academics in developed nations. It equally involves diverse issues relating to hostel, off-campus apartments, parents’ homes etc. Thus, problems relating to students hostel squatting, whether on campus or off, have been of interest to many researchers in these societies, for decades. The students need comfortable accommodation in the universities for them to study hard and pass their examinations (Osagie, 1993). The original idea of hostel accommodation was to provide a more conducive academic atmosphere for students. As a result, the first generation Universities built beautiful hostels, befitting the image of undergraduate and post-graduate students. Students’ population then was within control. In some of the hostels, two or a maximum of three students occupied a room (Guardian, 2004). Abubakar (2007) noted that students are supposed to be accommodated one per room and where two or more students shared a room often lead to conflict among them.</p> <p> With university life can be a strong indicator of the academic level of the students from one hand and the level of social relations development and achieving personal goals from the other hand. It could be noted that many educational scholars studied this aspect in order to explore the status of the academic, social and psychological level of undergraduate students then determining the problems facing them when trying to achieve their goals. (Al-nabhan, 2007).  The stage of university life is an important part of the student’s life as he moved from the total dependence on the teacher, family and curriculum into the complete independence. Moreover, many students move away from their cities into new places causing a change in their cultural, social and psychological environment, this may affect their adjustment with the university life. (Al-shinawi&amp; Abdurrahman, 1994).  Students living in Hostel are a distinct group, who have unique needs and problems. They have particular physical, social and emotional characteristics. They are away from home for the first time and have to learn to manage their own affairs, and adjust to new conditions of living without a family member of greater experience to guide them . Also students who live independently are subjects to less parental control that can inhibit unhealthy behaviour. Such students are more prone to poor eating habits, lack of sleep, or the acquisition of new habits, such as smoking or drug use.  Furthermore, student persistence toward graduation is positively correlated with the quality of roommate relationship, the hostel social environment, adjustment and emotional support.  Satisfaction with social life and other social factors also have been shown to contribute to overall persistence. Interpersonal relationships are defined as an association between two or more people that ranges from informal interactions to formal partnerships and commitments. Interpersonal relationships develop over time, and researchers have proposed a life-cycle of this development. The relationship typically starts in the acquaintance stage.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of problem</strong></p> <p>Nigerian University students live within and outside University campuses with many students to a room. The behaviour they exhibit toward one another often results in a series of conflicts. Some students exhibit deviant social behaviour in the room, some squat their friends or relation without informing other roommates, some practice their religion to offend other roommates, some use the fact that they belong to intimidate other roommates and roommates who support different contestants in student union elections and principal officers’ of the Universities in crisis period sometimes end up with conflict in their rooms. Patch (2005) noted that some roommates never contribute to bills, steal and use other roommate properties without permission and sell drugs in the room.</p> <p>The problem which bought to the investigate concerned recent changes in the programmes and enrolment of students in universities in Nigeria. The increase in the social demand for university education has led to increasing demand and need for more quantitative and qualitative learning environment. Presently, the situation still persists, more worrisome is the situation of students’ hostel accommodation issues experienced in universities in Nigeria. The National Universities Commission (2005), whose goal is to ensure quality and comparative education in the Nigerian university system, recommended minimum standards. It is very appalling that most often, government emphasizes provision of education to students without a corresponding emphasis on provision of affordable students’ accommodation. Lack of hostels have serious effect on students’ health and learning (Chukwu, 2007). Accommodation problems experienced by these students have become a barrier to the realization of university education goals, as indicated in the Nigeria National Policy on Education (FRN, 2004). It is these factors that motivate this study to examine accommodation problems in universities in Nigeria with particular reference to the University of Lagos. Specially, the study will investigate the influence of hostel squatting on interpersonal relationships and emotional adjustment of students in university of Lagos.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Purpose of Study</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is therefore to access the influence of hostel squatting on academic performance, interpersonal relationships and emotional adjustment of students in university of Lagos.

The purpose of this research was to determine the level of family success in the promotion of the family life education and to assess the challenges affecting the family life education Five questions and hypotheses were stated for the study, the study employed a descriptive survey research design. An instrument titled: Influence of Parental Involvement on the Promotion of Family Life Education. (IPIPFLE) was used to collect relevant data for the study.  The sample respondents involved were selected based on simple random sampling technique and the statistical tools was employed to analyse the data collected, frequency counts and percentage used to test the stated research question. Fifty (50) individuals were randomly selected from each establishment. The total sample is one hundred and fifty workers (150) individuals. 5 research questions and hypotheses were designed and formulated for the purpose of the study. The study revealed that there was a significant difference between parents’ involvement in family education and the success of family life education. It also revealed that there was a significant difference between parents’ occupational status and the promotion of family life education. The study further revealed that there was a significant relationship between educational level and their involvement in family life education. Based on the findings it was concluded 71% percents of the respondents strongly agreed that parents should be more involved in the promotion of family life education. The recommendations were made based on the findings of this study which include the following: parents should be involved in their children’s education, by volunteering at School; parent involvement theory and exemplary parent involvement programs recognize the value of creating meaningful partnerships among homes and schools in order to enhance parent involvement; act as teachers: Parents should create a home environment that promotes learning, reinforces what is being taught at school and develops the life skills.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p><p> 1.1     Background to the study </p> <p>Preparing individuals and families for the roles and responsibilities of family living is nothing new. Because knowledge about human development, interpersonal relationships, and family living is not innate, societies have needed to develop ways through which they may transmit the wisdom and experience of family living from one generation to succeeding ones. Some societies transmit his knowledge through formal means such as puberty initiation rites. For the most part however, individuals learn about family living in the family setting itself as they observe and participate in family activities and interactions in their own and other families</p> <p>As societies change and become more complex, this pattern of informal learning about living in families becomes inadequate.</p> <p>The development of new knowledge, advances in technology, and changing social and economic condition create situation where the teaching of previous generation are no longer appropriate or sufficient. In this circumstance, societies must find or create new ways to prepare individuals for their family roles and responsibilities.</p> <p>Clark (2003) opines that when parents and family get personally involved in education, their children do better in school and grow up to be more successful in life. According to Clark, parent’s involvement includes a lot of different types of activities. Some parents have time to get involved in many ways; others may only have time for one or two activities.</p> <p>Aluede (2000) contends that the earlier in a child educational process, parent involvement in family life education begins, the more powerful the effects. The most effective forms of parent involvement are those which engage parent in working directly with their children on learning at home. Parent may get involved in family life education by ensuring better school attendance by their children, increased motivation, and better self-esteem.</p> <p>Although most parent do not to know how to help their children with their education with their  guidance and support they may become increasingly involved in home learning activities and find themselves with opportunities to teach, to be models for and to guide their children. Parent participation in education was twice as predictive of academic success as family socio-economic status, (Uwakwe, 2000). When schools encourage children to the practice reading at home with parents the children make significant gains in reading achievement compared to those who only practice at school. The more intensely parent are involved, the more beneficial the achievement effects. Parent who read to their children, have books available, take trips, guide TV watching, and provide stimulating experiences contribute to student achievement. The more parents participate in family life education, in a sustained way, at every level-in advocacy, decision making and oversight roles and as home teachers- the better for children’s academic achievement.  </p> <p>The society depends primarily upon the family institution for the production of children who constitute young members of the society. Also, the family is seen as the primary agent of socialization where the norms and values of a society are internalized by the new members of the society that is children, teaching and behavioral pattern and ways of life. In addition, the family performs the functions of provision of basic necessity of life like food, shelter, clothing, education etc.</p> <p>Arqqawal (1981) asserts: “It is the home not the school that determines the quality of the direction of any child’s life, and that teacher’s works is fulfilled or destroyed by the operation, for good or ill this major factor in the education of any child.” (page 19)</p> <p>Adeyemo (1998) and Akinboye (2000) have observed that children from unstable homes have less adaptability to school situation, less initiative and possess a less measure of emotional self-control. The anxiety level of home and the pattern of parental communication with children may affect learning. For instance, a child that is frequently upset over parent quarrels are at risks for lower levels of education achievement (Krohn and Bogan, 2001).</p> <p>Infants whose parents lack warmth and stability and fail to provide educational stimulation (e.g teaching and child new words) are at risk of learning and emotional problems (Werner and Smith, 1992: 24). Infants who suffer from neglect may also be at risk of health and developmental problems (Kenpe and Goldbloom, 2007:312).</p> <p>In a study of young people from low-income black homes with varying family structures,</p> <p>Clark (1993) finds that parents of high academic achievers set firm but not harsh rules, seek information about their children’s academic progress, enhance literacy skills through activities such as reading and word games, and model an optimistic assertive approach to life. In Clark’s study, the two-parent and single-parent families that had these attributes produced higher achieving students, while the two-parent and single-parent families that lacked these characteristics produced less successful students. Similarly, Goldenberg (2009) describes how assertive parent involvement may significantly influence student achievement, over the course of Goldenberg’s case study, the children who improved their reading skill received encouragement and /or home tutoring from their parents.</p> <p>Preparing individuals and families for the roles and responsibilities of family living is nothing new, because relationships, and family living is not innate, societies have needed to develop ways through which they may transit the wisdom and the experience of family living from one operation to succeeding ones. Some societies transmit this knowledge through formal means such as puberty or initiation rites. For most part, however individuals learn about family living in the family setting itself as they observe and participate in family activities and interaction in their own and other families (Aluede, 2002). As societies change and become more complex this pattern of informal learning in families becomes inadequate. The development of new knowledge, advances in technology and changing social and economic conditions create situation where the teaching of previous generations are no longer appropriate or sufficient, in these circumstances, societies must find or create new ways to prepare individuals for their family roles and responsibilities. One of these new ways is family life education (Alueze and Ikechukwu, 2002).</p> <p>The desire that Nigeria should be a free, just and democratic society, a land full of opportunities for all its citizens, able to generate a great and dynamic economy, and growing into a united and self reliant nation, cannot be over-emphasized; to achieve these goals, education in Nigeria is an instrument par excellence for effective national development Federal Ministry of Education (2004). With changes in the society, every child desires to become a millionaire within a day. It now seems to be difficult for majority of the children to really concentrate on their studies in this country. Good community committee (2005) observed that the seed of academic under-achievement among children have been imbibed from childhood. Many children fail to find self-respect or self-discipline and capacity to cope with problems in ways that are constructive or have any appreciation on the importance of skills needed for learning. In other words, it seems to be true that the causes of academic-achievement among the youths are multiple, complex and interrelated. Good community committee (1995) and Schewertz (2005) identified single-parenthood, poverty, youth v iolent (crime), drug problem, school instability and rebellion as causes of children under-achievement in schools. Sewel (2000) include among many other reasons for students drop out as no liking school, being suspended or being expelled. Other reasons include economic reasons socio-economic status of the family. Influence from friends who are also school drop-outs, personal reasons such as pregnancy for girls. In addition, school drop-outs had lower grades in school, more disciplinary problems, and lower rate of home work completion externalized sense control. Often times, when children fail their promotion examinations, they would rather prefer going to farm and obtain or acquire plots of land to plant cocoa and become cocoa farmers. During cocoa season in such parts of South-West Nigeria, children and parents’ common slang is ‘Oga teacher, how much is your salary? Two kilos (Kilogrammes) of cocoa will pay your salary.  This local syndrome might be responsible for students drop-out in many rural areas. The rate of drop out appears to be worst among boys with the emergence of commercial motor cycling known as Okada. Also, some boys become bus conductors or illegal timber contractor know as ‘Payabayaba’.</p> <p><br/> According to Ayodele (2007), there was a case of a male student who was arrested for social ills (stealing) and during interrogation; he said that he dropped out from school because his school fees was not paid and his mother gave birth to nine children for different nine fathers.  Ayodele says further that in the study of some female students, it revealed that when they fail in school or their fees were not paid, they seem to experience fear, anxiety, inferiority complex and guilt among their mates and this seems to give them some psychological problem. This leads female children to get involve in pre-marital sex and hurriedly get married.</p> <p>Owuamanam (2002) contends that some people go into marriage when there is no money to pay school fees or take care of their children’s needs. Another problem observed to be rampant among female children is the issue of regular meeting. As soon as some female children see their drop-out friends with expensive wears and their babies, the next thing they do is to copy their colleagues so that they too can dress like friends and look nice among their peer groups, this usually results to termination of their academic career.</p> <p>It seems that if parents were not educationally oriented, their interest towards the education of their children might be negatively affected. Adaba (2001) noted that parents do not encourage the education of their female children because of erroneous belief that investing money on the education of female children may end up to be waste when they get married because they lose family’s name and the husband’s family would reap the fr uits of their labour. Adaba also said that some parents were unable to pay school fees and provide necessary materials needed by their wards and that this contribute to children’s under-achievement in schools. Alonge (2003) opined that some parents are harsh and wicked to their children if they do not perform well or fail their examinations.</p> <p>In another development, if children do not have a stable family life and have bad school experiences, they may end up as school drop-outs.</p> <p>The true influence of children’s background on achievement can be estimated better if one takes into account those family characteristics- parental values and press for the child to achieve and the child’s own efforts and perceived efficacy-that appear to operate independently of convectional aspects of class (for the few countries in which these factors have been studied) and better indicators of the material and social aspects of class.</p> <p>The national desire that Nigeria should be a free, just and democratic society, a land full of opportunities for all its citizens able to generate a great and dynamic economy and growing into a united and self reliant nation, is an important pointer to the role education has to play in the polity. To achieve these goals, education in Nigeria is an instrument per excellence for effective national development, Federal Ministry of Education (2004). With  changes in the society, every child desires to become a millionaire within a day. It now seems to be difficult for majority of the children to really concentrate on their studies in this country. Good community Committee (1995) observed that the seed of academic under-achievement among children have been imbibed from childhood. Many children fail to find self respect or self-discipline and capacity to cope with problems</p> <p>This background emphasizes the need to bring into focus the present study which sought to explain parental involvement, successes and challenges in the promotion of family life education.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>Meaningful family involvement is a powerful predictor of high student achievement. Students attain more educational success when families work together to motivate, socialize, and educate students. Students whose families are involved in their education typically receive higher grades and test scores, complete more homework, have better attendance, and exhibit more positive attitudes and behaviors than children whose parents do not show care nor concern about their education and these lead to poor academic performance of such students. When parents do not motivate, socialize and educate their students their academic performance tends to be negatively affected. Research has provided ample evidence that parental involvement affects achievement in core subjects such as reading, mathematics and science, and the behaviour of students, their school attendance and their attitude and adjustment to school. According to Jerry Trusty (in Henderson and Mapp, 2002), student perception of their parents’ involvement and expectations are also highly effective and influential in their education. Moreover, students who feel their parents’ support for their education and have good communicationare more likely to continue their studies past high school. When parents show little or no concern about their children education, the students withdraw from school, perform poorly academically and may play truancy in attendance to school. The family size has a great role to play on the overall development and promotion of family life education and academic performance of the child in particular. The size of a family has a significant effect on interrelationship among its members but must be considered as only one part of a larger picture. The large number of children can have negative effects on promotion of family life education. A small family group enables a greater degree of democratic participation by all the children, something not possible in larger families. The small family rests upon the ideas of planning, individualisation, democratic co-operation, social isolation and intensive pressures.</p> <p> 1.3       Purpose of study </p> <p>The main purpose of the study is to examine the influence of parental involvement on the promotion of family life education. The specific objectives include:</p> <p>1. To determine the level of family success in the promotion of the family life education</p> <p>2. To assess the challenges affecting the family life education.</p> <p>3. To find out the extent to which the educational level of parents influence their involvement in Family Life Education.</p> <p>4.

Seven research objectives leading to seven research questions and hypotheses were stated to guide the study. A total number of 250 teachers were carefully selected from the entire population through the method of stratified and simple random strategy. The research design was descriptive survey in nature where questionnaire was developed to gather the data used for the study. The Pearson Correlation Statistics was employed to test the null hypotheses stated for the study using 0.05 Levels of Significance in order to accept or reject them. Findings of the study showed a significant relationship between age and promotion of maladaptive behavior that lead to poor academic performance; there is a significant relationship between school entry age and academic performance; Equally, results also showed significant relationship exists between cult activities and academic performance; significant relationship between examination malpractice and academic performance. Other findings of the study showed a significant relationship exists between deviancy/delinquency and academic performance of students; significant relationship exists between truancy to school and academic performance of students, Recommendations were made following the outcomes of the research findings. They include. need for counseling services in Secondary Schools in Mushin Local Government Area of Lagos State; Children should be exposed to reading and writing at very early age; Government should place indefinite ban all form of associations in secondary schools that are not promoting students’ knowledge, skill and attitude; Government should also continue in the fight against corruption in all its ramifications and punish offenders to show deterrent to others; It was also recommended thatmaladjusted students in secondary schools in Mushin Local Government Area should be given psycho- socio therapy. Also, parents should ensure that their children get to school early every day, and that the present curriculum on religion and national values should be properly implemented</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       Background to the study</strong></p> <p>Social problems are issues happenings which are frequently occurring in the society in recent times. They are the issues that affect everybody in the society. The issues are of great concern to both the young and adults. They are not personal or individualized issues but general issues and as such require general solution. Some of the social issues that pervade the length and breadth of our country such as corruption, social inequality, ethnicity, limited resources, poverty, criminality, and other socio-economic crises have manifested in different dimensions in secondary school levels of our education system and appear to be taking alarming proportions. It is important to consider the effect social problems have on students’ academic performance. Although several socio-economic and psychological variables like hard work and discipline, family income, parent’s education, ability, interest and aptitude have been identified to impact on academic performance, often lost in this inquiry, however, is consideration of adolescent biological age, school entry age, cult activities, examination malpractice, truancy/ deviancy and late-coming to school which are some of the social issues happening in secondary school students. The relative lack of attention to these prevalent social problems in secondary schools is unfortunate given the academic and behavioural performance problems noticeable in our country.</p> <p>First, adolescents’ age has been identified as identity crises. They are faced with so many questions about life ‘what’,’ how’, ‘where’ and ‘when’. They are anxious to get quick result; a situation that exposes them to different dangers. Our mass media are filled with different reports of social evils perpetrated by adolescent students in schools. Equally, school entry age may be a cause or benefit to child’s education. In this way, parents’ socio-economic development dictates the time a child will be exposed to learning in school. Research findings on the relationship between school entry age and academic performance are in mix. There is a need to strike a balance between these mixed results.</p> <p>Second, cult activities among secondary school students were a thing unheard of in recent past. Today cultism has taken a center stage in the secondary schools. When cults strike, chances are that there is some disruption in the stability of the academic calendars (Olusakin, 2004). Students who are not serious with their academic work, whose bulk are found (if not all) in the secret cults, usually precipitate confusion capable of leading the closure of schools. The cultist disturbs the peace of the academic environment through their violent activities. The violent activities that happened at secondary schools in Port-Harcourt, Rivers State and Adamawa State in 2012 were reported in the daily Newspapers (Nation Newspaper, 2012; the Nigerian Tribune, 2012). This situation may lead to closure of schools thereby keeping students home for very long time which may affect their education. Some of the cultist when caught may face suspension or outright dismissal from schools. Whatever may be the case, cultism among students in secondary schools is necessary evil that affect students’ outcomes in schools since those who engage in it pay less attention to reading and studying in schools.</p> <p>Third, students get involved in examination malpractice because of their desire to get best scores without the corresponding efforts in preparation. Corruption in private and public places and the twin sister, Nigeria orientations on certificate have not helped matter. Every high school student knows that examination malpractice is evil and corrupt, but many of them still get involved. Today, the situation is so bad that some parents, teachers, proprietors / proprietresses, and examination officials, who should champion the campaign against examination malpractice, are also aiding it. In any case, students are less likely to adhere to formal examination regulations where they perceive that rewards are based on personal rather than professional criteria, where they perceive widespread corruption in national and local government than in societies where high levels of integrity are perceived to prevail (Okolie, 2004).</p> <p>Third, it is not uncommon to see students reacting aggressively when teachers try to control them when they make noise and distract other students in class. In similar vein, rape or sexual promiscuity, arson and wanton destructions of buildings and properties and copying of foreign ways of life seem to be the way of lives of many adolescent students. It should be borne in mind that when students set buildings ablaze and destroy properties, the resultant effect is the closing of the school. Hence, deviant and delinquent activities among secondary school students are social issues prevalent in school that have become so rampant. This affects students’ learning and invariably the academic performance.</p> <p>Four, the situation in our secondary schools regarding the issue of absenteeism and truancy is pathetic. Absenteeism and truancy are presently major problems facing our schools, and the damaging effects to students’ academic performances have largely been overlooked.</p> <p>However, academic performance in the context of this study is students’ ability to do well, fairly or poorly in an examination. The evaluation for determining students’ academic performance is carried out through various forms of standardized tests and examination. It is worthy of mention that academic performance, including academic failure is often viewed in narrow terms, as an individual behavior limited to the early life course.  In essence, academic performance has implications that play out across life stages and on multiple levels. It is pointed out that academic struggles predict individual’s short-term problem behavior and dropout, and can derail educational and occupational trajectories of well into adulthood. It can also create disorder and undermine the general mission of schools, and more so, widespread academic failure has influence on rates of fertility, mortality, marriage, and unemployment through its relation to educational attainment and the development of human capital (Egenti, 2005). Thus, what appears merely to be an aspect of the adolescent experience actually has far-reaching consequences across a variety of social phenomena. This further justifies the need to examine how social problems among students are related to their academic performance in secondary schools.</p> <p>Furthermore, despite the law put against examination malpractices and the teaching of Civic Education, Social Studies and Christian Religion / Islamic Religion at the junior and senior secondary schools in Nigeria in order to promote good values among students, yet social issues in secondary schools still persist. There is therefore, the need to continue making inquiry on these problem areas among secondary school students to stem the tide of circumstances.</p> <p>Most undeniably, the present Nigeria generation has been generation of youth restiveness and moral decadence, corruption, arson and looting, kidnapping, and terrorism among others are on the rise in deteriorated neighborhoods and large cities like Lagos. Student participation in such activities is on a steady rise and poses a serious threat to achieving our education objectives.</p> <p>Undeniably, academic and maladaptive behavior performance of students in the secondary schools deserves a study of this nature. The impetus towards a research in this direction is further reinforced by the trend in poor performance of the secondary school students in their West African School Certificate Examinations, and students’ emotional life. It therefore becomes a major part of the educator’s responsibilities to be able to identify sources of emotional stress in students to appropriate areas of professional and adult guidance in school.  It is against this background information that this research seeks to examine the relationship between social issues in school and students’ academic performance in Mushin Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Theoretical Framework of the Research</strong></p> <p>The theoretical background for this study stems from four theories. These theories are:</p> <p>i.          The Social Control by Hirschi (1978)</p> <p>ii.         Labeling and conflict theories by Howard Becker (1963) and Karl Marx (1867)</p> <p>iii.        Functional and interactionism theories by Daphend of (1959), and</p> <p>iv.        Social cognitive theory by Albert Bandura (1977 - 1986)</p> <p><strong>Social control theory by Hirschi (1978)</strong></p> <p>The theory asserts that ties to family, school and other aspects of society serve to diminish one’s propensity for deviant behaviour. As such, social control theory posits that crime occurs when such bonds are weakened or are not well established. Control theorists argue that without such bonds, crime is an inevitable outcome. Unlike other theories that seek to explain why people engage in deviant behaviour, control theories take the opposite approach, questioning why people refrain from offending. As a result, criminality is seen as a possibility for all individuals within society, avoided only by those who seek to maintain familial and social bonds.  Hirschi, believes that these bonds are based on attachment to those both within and outside of the family, including friends, teachers, and co-workers; commitment to activities in which an individual has invested time and energy, such as educational or career goals; involvement in activities that serve to both further bond an individual to others and leave limited time to become involved in deviant activities; and finally, belief in wider social values. These four aspects of social control are thought to interact to insulate an individual from criminal involvement (Siegel and McCormick, 2006). Researchers have closely examined bonds, schools, community and religion to determine the strength of social control theory as it specifically relates to young people.  It is proposed that for young people, a key aspect of social control is found within the family, particularly through interactions with and feelings towards parents. Of the studies that have examined the impact of social control on delinquency, a large proportion has found a negative relationship between parental attachment and delinquency. As such, it has been found that the greater the attachment to parents, the lower the likelihood of involvement in delinquent behaviour. Empirical evidence supports the notion that parenting practices and parental support can impact violent offending by youth. In conjunction with parental attachment, adolescent attachment to school is seen by Hirschi’s social control theory as a fundamental means of establishing social control. A significant number of studies pertaining to social control theory include measures of the role of school attachment and school support in the lives of young people. It is to be noted, however, that strong attachment to school was associated with less violent offending. The role of the community and neighborhood as agents of social control has also been assessed in the social control literature. In light of the fore-going, this theory is relevant in explaining the relationship between social issues happening in secondary schools in Mushin Local Government Area of Lagos State and students’ academic performance.</p> <p>Labeling and Conflict theory by Howard Becker (1963) and Karl Marx (1867)</p> <p>This is another theory that strengthens the research investigation. As propounded by Howard Becker (1963), this theorist viewed deviance as the creation of social groups and not the quality of some act or behavior. He believed that social groups create deviance by making rules whose infraction creates deviance, and by applying those roles to particular people and labeling them as outsiders. From this point of view, deviance is not a quality of the act the person commits, but rather a consequence of the application of rules and sanctions to an’ offender’. The deviant is one to whom the label has been successfully attached.</p> <p>The conflict theorists reject the idea that social problems can be solved by reforming major contradictions in the way society is organized; contradiction that lead to large-scale conflict between those who have access to the “good life” and those who do not.. In “The communist Manifesto” and “capital” and other works, Marx attempted to prove that social problems like unemployment, poverty, crime, corruption, conflict and violence, and so forth, are not usually the fault of individuals or of poorly functioning organizations. An evitable outcome of capitalism is class conflict, especially conflict between those who own the means of production and those who sell their labour for wages. Conflict is a fact of life in modern industrial societies.</p> <p>Functionalist and Interactionism Theories by Dahpendorf (1959) and Thomas (1923)</p> <p>The functionalist theory looks at the way social institutions like the family, education, economy, polity, religion and their sub-systems function. Functionalist sociologist do not focus on the behaviour and problems of individuals, instead they see social problems as arising out of the failure of institutions of society, like the family, education, economy, polity, and religion to adapt to changing social conditions. Every part or institution of society is seen as having a function in the sense that it contributes to the smooth running of the society. Hence, when one part of the society is out of the line with the others, there is pressure for its reintegration with the other related parts. In this way, stability in society, by and large, prevails. It is not only stability based on functional necessity but stability based on consensus of values. Individuals in society, according to this theory, share the same basic values and are thus agreed on the way they behave towards each other as individuals or as members of groups.</p> <p>The functionalist theory of deviance-disorganization can be fruitfully used in the study of such current problematic condition in Nigeria as, examination malpractice, cultism, deviant and delinquent activities among students in secondary school that affect academic performance as well as society’s criminality, violence, as well as, poverty, unemployment, population problem, problem families, environmental degradation and pollution, and homelessness, and insecurity.</p> <p>Interactionism theory offers an explanation which gets us closer to the individual level of behaviour. Research based on this perspective looks at the processes whereby different people become part of a situation that the larger society defines as a social problem. The interactionism approach focuses on the ways in which people actually take on the values of the group of which they are members. It also explore how different groups define their situation and in so doing “construct” a version of life that promote certain values and behaviours and discourages others. From the interactionism perspective, an individual or a group’s definition of the situation is central to understanding the action of that individual or group: “situation people define as real are real in their consequences (Thomas, 1923). Above all, labeling theory as discussed earlier is a major application of the interactionism perspective that offers an explanation for certain kinds of social problems. The interactionism perspective of the “definition of the situation”, peer group interactions and labeling can be related or applied to the understanding of some current problems in Nigeria , which include: crime and delinquency, violence, human trafficking, prostitution, drug abuse , child abuse, prejudice and discrimination, corruption, and insecurity that affect student’s academic performance..</p> <p><strong>Social cognitive theory by Albert Bandura (1977-1986)</strong></p> <p>Social cognitive theory rests on several basic assumptions about learning and behaviour. One assumption concern triadic reciprocality or the view that personal behavioural and environmental factors influence one another, a bidirectional and reciprocal fashioning is a product of a continuous interaction between cognitive behavioural and contextual factors. For instance, classroom learning is shaped by factors within academic environment experienced by oneself and by another. At the time learning is affected by student’s own thoughts and self belief and their interpretation of the classroom context.</p> <p>            A closely related assumption within social cognitive theory is that people have an agency or ability to influence their own behaviour and the environment in a purposeful, good-directed fashion (Bandura, 2001). This belief conflicts with earlier form of behaviourism that advocated a more rigorous form of environment determinism. Social cognitive theory does not deny the importance of the environment in determining behaviour, but it does argue that people can also, through forethought self-reflection and self-regulatory processes, exert substantial influence over their own outcomes and the environment more broadly.</p> <p>            A third assumption within social cognitive theory is that learning can occur without an immediate change in behaviour or more broadly that learning the demonstration of what has been learned and distinct processes. One reason for this separation is that social cognitive theory also assumes that learning involves not just the acquisition of new behaviour, but also that of knowledge and cognitive skills, concepts, abstract rules, values and other cognitive constructs. This division of learning and behaviour is a shift from the position advocated by behavioural theories that students can learn but not demonstrate the learning until motivated to do so.</p> <p>            This theory emphasizes cognitive compression as the cornerstone of adolescent behaviour. The adolescents here acquires the mental activity to deal with the world around him, with this developed mental capacity, he perceives and examines his environment, form ideas and make inferences. The basic explanation of deviant behaviour or delinquency is on mentality. Jean Piaget brought about the stage concept of cognitive development, when people go through series of moral stages beginning early in childhood and continuing through the adult years. Each stage of development assumes a relatively a variant order in the course of development. Also each stage is marked by a different view of right and wrong.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The problem that necessitated this research is students’ indiscipline which could be seen in their poor academic and behaviour performance in various secondary schools in Mushin Local Government Area of Lagos State. </p> <p>The rate of late coming to schools and absents from schools among students is very disturbing which appear to make students to miss some topics taught in schools. The end result may be too devastating to the students and parents.</p> <p>Most students nowadays are too stubborn and don’t seem to take corrections. Rather than reading and studying hard for their school works, they students tend to distract while teaching is going on in classroom, fight and act in a manner calculated to disrupt the teaching and learning process. All these down facing attitudes among students are threat to achieving better students’ outcomes in schools.</p> <p>Today’s students see shortcut as a means of passing examination. Every year, several students’ results are cancelled and withheld in some examination centers where cases of examination malpractice are reported. This causes gear deal of damage to the students, parents schools and government in terms of repeating the examinations, paying the school and examination fees all over again. The destructive effect this may have on our country’s image is such that this menace should be fought at all vehemence.</p> <p>More problems arise from students’ cult activities, deviancy / delinquency which make students to resort to violent means in achieving their academic ends.  Every now and then, we experience disruption of academic activities because of students’ cult activities, and other violent crises happening in our secondary schools. At times, human lives are lost and school properties destroyed. This leads to closing of schools for months and when schools eventually re-open, students may likely forget what they have learnt. It may also cause high school dropouts among students who can’t cope with academic learning. This is a great threat to our country’s education system in training the right personnel that will occupy in various sectors of our economy and provide solution to socio-economic development of our country.</p> <p>In an attempt to find lasting solutions to myriads of social problems in the country, government has tailored the curriculum of our compulsory education with a view to solving some of the problems and also towards achieving the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals (MGDs) policy initiatives. One of the major outcomes of the committee was the integration of social studies, civic education, Christian and Islamic religion and security education into Religion and National Values. The innovation carried out was both national and pedagogical in nature.</p> <p>  It is not certain whether efforts taken by government to curbing these behaviours have yielded any fruits in the past. Student participation in anti-social behaviors is on a steady rise. At same time, the alarming effect of this behavior constitutes a major challenge to teachers, parents, guardians, and the government, the stake-holders in the educational sector and even among the well- meaning Nigerians at large.</p> <p>In the light of the overall challenges of social problems in schools, this study sets out to examine the relationship between social problems and academic performance of students in secondary school in Mushin Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.4       Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of the study is to examine the relationship between social problems happening in schools and academic. Specifically, the study is aimed at finding</p> <p>1.         The relationship between age and students’ moral behavior in relation with academic performance.</p> <p>2.         The relationship between school entry age and academic performance.</p> <p>3.         The relationship between cult activities and academic performance.</p> <p>4.         The relationship between examination malpractice and academic performance.</p> <p>5.         The relationship between truancy and academic performance.</p> <p>6.         The relationship between deviancy/delinquency and academic performance.</p> <p><strong>1.5 The Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions will guide the proposed study:</p> <p>1.         What is the relationship between age and students’ moral behavior in relation with academic performance?</p> <p>2.         How does school entry age have relationship with academic performance?</p> <p>3.         Is there a relationship between cult activities and academic performance?</p> <p>4.         How is examination malpractice related with academic performance?</p> <p>5.         What relationship exists between truancy and academic performance?</p> <p>6.         Is there relationship between school deviancy delinquency and academic performance?</p> <p>7.         Is there relationship between social problems and academic performance of students?</p> <p><strong>1.6       The Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The following null hypotheses will guide the proposed study.</p> <p>1.         There is no significant relationship between age and students’ moral behiour in relation with academic performance.</p> <p>2.         There is no significant relationship between school entry  age and academic performance.</p> <p>3.         There is no significant relationship between cult activities and academic performance.</p> <p>4.         There is no significant relationship between examination malpractice and academic performance.</p> <p>5.         There is no significant relationship between truancy and academic performance.</p> <p>6.         There is no significant relationship between deviancy/delinquency and academic performance.</p> <p><strong>1.7       Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This research study has implication for addressing social problems in our society and specifically the problem of anti-social behavior associated with urban secondary school students the Lagos metropolis. In view of the prevailing undesirable behaviours in youths, this study will expose the students to the harmful effects of deviance on academic performance and thus serve as a cautionary measure for students.  It will enlighten teachers and school managers or administrators on the behavior pattern of students thereby helping them to use education to adjust the maladjusted students in their anti-social behaviours. This research study will equally educate parents on the associated risk behaviours of adolescents which their children sometimes involved themselves that contribute to their poor performance in school work. This will help inculcate in the students the behavior pattern that the society expected of her citizen, more so, now that the present democratic dispensation is bent on eradication of all corrupt practices. It will also contribute to the existing literature on social problem of among secondary school students and academic performance in the Lagos Metropolis.</p> <p><strong>1.8       Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The scope of the study is limited to the entire secondary school student in Mushin Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.9       Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study examined social problems happening in secondary schools with particular emphasis on age, school entry age, cult activities, examination malpractice, truancy, deviancy/ delinquency and how the relate with academic performance of students in secondary schools. Also, obtaining materials used for the study poised some constraints.</p> <p><strong>1.10     Operational Definitions of Terms   </strong></p> <p>Academic performance: This is the behavior of a student that can be directly observed by evaluating what he/she has learnt during a course of study. This behavior can be measured through class work, homework, class participation and tests.</p> <p>Absenteeism:  Absenteeism is regular persistent absence from work or school.</p> <p>Deviance:  This refers to possibility of an individual or group deviating from an established norm. Any behavior which does not conform to the rules, regulations, norms, and values of a given time is viewed as deviance.</p> <p>Delinquency: this is the behavior pattern that breaks certain rules or laws enacted by constituted authority.</p> <p>Social problem: A social problem exists when a significant number of people in a society believe that a certain condition is in fact a problem</p> <p>Examination Malpractice:  a deliberate act of wrong doing contrary to official examination rules and is designed to place a candidate at unfair advantages and disadvantages.</p> <p>Cultism:  a cult is a pattern of a devotional worship of a deity. It is a deviation from the orthodox norms of public worshiping</p> <p>Truancy:  staying away from school without any good reason. It means an act of or practice of deliberately staying away from school without any acceptance reason, whether or not the parents or guardians know and approve of it (Fugleman and Richardson, 2001). </p>                                                          \n\nTHE SOCIAL PROBLEMS AND ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS IN SELECTED SECONDARY SCHOOLS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE SOCIAL PROBLEMS AND ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS IN SELECTED SECONDARY SCHOOLS", "id": 52}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.1     <strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Marriage is the oldest institution in the world it was instituted by God Himself in the Garden of Eden.  Marriage was not the idea of any man. It was the original idea of God Almighty. God felt the need for marriage and instituted it “And the Lord God said, it is not good that the man should be alone, I will make him an help meet for him” Genesis chapter 2 verse 18.</p> <p>Since then man and woman alike have always tried to live in companion of each other because they are created social being.</p> <p>Marriage can also be define as a union between a man and a woman to become husband and wife with the above definition. </p> <p>Marriage is meant for mature man and woman and not for boys and girls because they can not yet cope with the challenges of marital life. Early marriage therefore is define as a union of a boy and a girl and a man to become husband and wife below the age of 18 years.</p> <p>In the light of this study, when a girl below the age of 18, engages herself in marriage it is referred to as “Early Marriage”.</p> <p>Finally to correct this social problem among this group of people is the reason why this study becomes important.</p> <p>1.2     <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The incident of early marriage in recent time has been on the increase in Nigeria despite all the enlightenment, campaigns and awareness through formal and informal education.</p> <p>In Lagos State for instance, where almost all the ethic groups in Nigeria is represented, it is a common thing to see young girls with their children on their backs hawking different ware in the neighbourhood.

Young people need effective speech, language and communication skills in order to have a wide range of life choices. For most young people, communication pattern continues to develop throughout the school years and into adulthood. They develop the skills they need to solve problem, build effective relationships, negotiate and tell jokes. Hence, there is a link between parents’ and children’s communication patterns.</p> <p>Several recent studies found that parents with low literacy levels are less likely to help their children with reading and writing (Williams, Clemens, Oleinikova, and Tarvin, 2003; Parsons and Bynner, 2007); _ feel less confident in doing so (Williams etal.,2003); are less likely to have children who read for pleasure (Parsons andBynner, 2007); are more likely to have children with lower cognitive and communicative skills (De Coulon, Meschi and Vignoles, 2008). these links have been challenged.</p> <p>The context provided by parents and their consistent support might be more important than any transfer of skills [for their children’s literacy development] (Auerbach, 1989, p.171). Parental education level has an impact on young children’s communication pattern</p> <p>Parents’ level of education correlates with the cognitive development of babies between 12 months and 27 months of age (Roberts, Bornstein, Slater and Barrett, 1999).Despite the importance of communication, some parents education has in one way or the other influenced their children communication pattern.</p> <p>Parental education has a significant influence on children's communication pattern well into adolescence and adulthood.  parents continue to be a vital source of support socially and emotionally as well as academically. Parents often have different views of young people’s communication strengths and needs because of their knowledge of them over time, so maintaining an effective relationship between home and school is important. However this is often difficult when, typically, contact with school becomes less as pupils move through primary school.                                     </p> <p>The home is crucial. Parents have the greatest influence on the achievement of young people through supporting their learning in the home rather than supporting activities in school.  Early intervention is vital. The earlier parents become involved in their children’s literacy practices, the more profound the results and the longer-lasting the effects. Children learn long before they enter formal education. Parents are a child’s first educator. A child’s family and home environment has a strong influence on his/her communication pattern and educational achievement. This influence is stronger during the child’s early years but continues throughout their school years.</p> <p>Parents reading to babies and young children has a strong impact on children’s communication pattern. Parents’ reading to their children in the pre-school years is regarded as an important predictor of literacy achievement (Weinberger, 1996). Hence an uneducated parent may not be able to read to their children.  This parental activity is associated with strong evidence of benefits for children such as communication growth, reading achievement and writing (Bus, Van Ijzendoorn and Pellegrini, 1995; Brooks, 2000), the enhancement of children's language comprehension and expressive language skills, listening and speaking skills, later enjoyment of books and reading, understanding narrative and story (Wells, 1987; Crain-Thoreson and Dale, 1992; Weinberger, 1996),</p> <p> Parental involvement in their child’s reading has been found to be the most important determinant of language and emergent literacy (Bus, Van Ijzendoorn and Pellegrini, 1995). Children who are read to at an early age tend to display greater interest in reading at a later age (Arnold and Whitehurst, 1994).  Story reading at home enhances children's language comprehension and expressive language skills (Crain-Thoreson and Dale, 1992). Oral language developed from parent/child reading predicts later writing development (Crain-Thoreson, Bloomfield, Anthony, Bacon, Phillips and Samwel,</p> <p>1999).                                                                                                                                     </p> <p>Parents who introduce their babies to books give them a head start in school and an advantage over their peers throughout primary school (Wade and Moore, 2000).</p> <p>Many background variables affect the impact of the family and home environment (such as socio-economic status, , family size, etc.) but parental attitudes and behaviour, especially parental education in home learning activities, can be crucial to children’s achievement and can overcome the influences of other factors. Put succinctly in a question form, the problem of this study is: what is the influence of parents education on  communication pattern of primary school student in Lagos metropolis</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Primary school students life is no doubt a time for speech and language development, hence, communication pattern should be of paramount interest to both parents of the children and their teacher. In many circumstances now, the primary school students in Nigeria fail to understand the need for good communication pattern and parents and has failed also to sensitize the primary school children on the need for proper communication pattern.</p> <p>Schools also has failed to integrate communication pattern as part of curriculum of primary schools in Nigeria. Hence ignoring the need and the roles good communication pattern to a child even through his/her career in adulthood.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The general purpose of the study is to investigate the influence of parent education on  communication patterns of public primary school students of  Lagos metropolis.</p> <p><strong>1.4 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Specifically, the study sought to:</p> <p>1.      Determine the influence of parental education on their childrens' communication pattern</p> <p>2.      Ascertain the difference in communication patterns between children that are read to by parents and  their peers that are not read to.</p> <p>3.      Determine the influence of parent-child communication patterns on the in-school children’ academic achievement.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In order to realize the above objectives, the following research questions were raised.</p> <p>1.      To what extent do parental education influence children's communication pattern?</p> <p>2.      What is the difference between the communication patterrn  of children that are read to by parents and their peers that are not?</p> <p>3.      What is the influence of parent-child communication patterns on their primary school children’ academic achievement?                                                                                                                             </p> <p><strong>1.6 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES.                                                                                                                         </strong></p> <p>1.

Studies have shown that the period consists of pressure which may be either internal or external to the young adult (Adams, 2006 &amp; Schneider, 2010). Besides being a transitory period, they posited that it is a time of self-definition for the young individual. The high-risk behaviors of adolescence are the result of multiple causes, often beginning in early childhood, that change with age and are interrelated in complex ways. These causes operate at ecological (e.g., socioeconomic status, neighborhood, cultural context, social-relational (e.g., family members, peers, teachers), and individual (e.g., genetic dispositional factors and temperamental characteristics, sex) levels, that unfold against the backdrop of biological, neuro-cognitive, and emotional maturation and shifts in age-related social-developmental processes.</p> <p>Research in the past two decades has highlighted the central role of genetics as a major factor contributing to the most troubling and costly outcomes of adolescent risk-taking, including violence, criminal activity and substance use disorders (Jaffee, 2005; Taylor, Iacono, &amp; McGue, 2000). However, there is mounting evidence that genetic influences on a variety of problem outcomes reflect a complex interplay between inherited and environmental risk, with genetic risk leading to pathological behavior for some youth only when the primary socializing environment also is adverse (Cadoret, Winokur, Langbehn, &amp; Rroughton, 1996; Reiss &amp; Leve, 2007; Tienari, 2004).</p> <p>Families, socioeconomic status and peers, the most significant socializing contexts for the emergence of adolescents’ behavioural patterns, are the foci of this paper.  Socioeconomic status on adolescents’ behavioural patterns can only be understood in light of the simultaneous influence of other socializing contexts, particularly the peer context that will be discussed in the next section, but also broader contextual conditions that add to, shape, and moderate the effect of the family (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Collins, Maccoby, Steinberg, Hetherington, &amp; Bornstein, 2000). Conditions such as family poverty, family income, parental education level, neighborhood violence, single parent family status, major family disruptions e.g., (divorce, death of a parent), and cumulative family adversities all have demonstrated effects to increase adolescents’ behavioural patterns (Amato &amp; Keith, 1991; Brooks-Gunn &amp; Duncan, 1997; Sampson, Raudenbush, &amp; Earls, 1997).</p> <p>Parents are one of the most important and influential elements on the lives of their children. They have the power, ability to shape, sustain and develop their children's who will be interested, creative and tolerant, through their positive involvement in the learning process and educational activities. On the other hand parents who do not involve in their children educational process are also considered to be capable of repressing and destroying the motivation and ability of their children through neglect and indifference to their achievements. \"A child’s capability to succeed in school depends on how successfully the child is managed by his /her parents in the home environment. It is an environment where the child learns the skills, attitudes and behavior which could mould them into a productive and successful student. However, not every child comes from a home that could provide them with the requisite educational resources necessary for their academic success. In accordance with that, a parent’s socioeconomic status plays an important role in providing these educational resources and it appears to impose the greatest impact on the child’s educational outcomes\"( Vellymalay, 2012). Socioeconomic status has a relatively strong impact on parental involvement compared to other factors. However, there is a question as to how far the strength of the parent’s socioeconomic status could inspire a child to achieve academic success.</p> <p>Parental involvement has a positive impact on student achievement at all socioeconomic levels, though involvement is probably more important for low socioeconomic schools, as they are more likely to have lower test scores and graduation rates. \"Regardless of income, ethnicity or background, students with involved parents are more likely to earn higher grades and test scores, have better attitudes, behavior and attendance, and graduate and go onto additional education.</p> <p>Higher parental involvement is associated with higher educational expectations, enrollment in gifted and talented programs, and positive perceptions of school\"(Henderson, 1988). While parent involvement positively affects a student’s academic achievement, low Socioeconomic families are least likely to be involved in their students’ education (Turney &amp; Kao, 2009; Ratcliff &amp; Hunt, 2009; Van Velsor &amp; Orozco,2007; Machen, Wilson, &amp; Notar, 2005; Abdul-Adil &amp; Farmer, 2006). Low Socioeconomic families are often working all of the time to take care of their families, and they have no time to participate in their child’s education on campus (Ratcliff &amp; Hunt, 2009). Based on a study involving low socioeconomic mothers, mothers want to be involved in their child’s education, but the other problem is that they are less comfortable around teachers, and so they do not get involved (Machen, Wilson, &amp;Notar, 2005).</p> <p>In contemporary society, peer group influences have become increasingly pronounced and studies have shown that adolescents were more likely to increase behaviour that receives peer group approval (Arnett, 1992; De Vries, 1995; Allen, 2005; Clark &amp; Loheac, 2007). Adolescents spend far more time in the exclusive company of their peers than their counter parts did in the past. Changes in the family roles that forced women into paid jobs have greatly reduced the quality time families spend together thus making peer groups a viable alternative for the young individuals (Clark &amp; Loheac, 2007). Peer groups appear to answer adolescents concerns about many things including their changing bodies.</p> <p>According to Schneider (2010) becoming a peer group member meets many adolescents concerns about social expectations such as developing independence from their parents, learning decision-making skills and acting on their own. However, these young teenagers find social expectations confusing and the ways of achieving them even more challenging. Peer influence on adolescents has been reported as being shrouded in myths and fear by parents. Parents perceive peer influence as a clog in the wheel of socializing their children desirably (Schneider, 2010). According to You (2011) perceived support from peers gives adolescent students a sense of motivation which enables them to see the importance of pursuing academic success This is because adolescents who are accepted by their peers are more likely to be psychologically healthier and self-confident than those rejected by their peers (Allen et al., 2005). However, Kiran-Esen (2012) reported significantly negative relationship between peer pressure and self-efficacy expectation (social and moral) in adolescents and that academic self-efficacy was higher in adolescents who were experiencing low level of peer pressure.</p> <p>There are a variety of negative health indicators that show a peek during adolescence, namely homicide rates, non-intentional injuries, driving under alcohol effect or infection by sexually-transmitted diseases (Mulye, Park, Neson, Irwin &amp; Brindis, 2009). Experimenting substances also occurs usually during adolescents, a time of development in which tolerance is lower and the risk of dependency increases (Glaser, Shelton &amp; Bree, 2010). Peers and family have a key role in promoting health during adolescence, as well as, the perception that youngsters have of their quality of life and subjective well-being. Health does not depend solely on the delivery of health care during illness; on the contrary, influence of different settings may be crucial (Gaspar &amp; Matos, 2008). Behavioural problems that occur during infancy and adolescence (particularly external problems, such as substance use and violence behaviours) may continue throughout adulthood, associated to social non-adaptation, substance abuse and conflicts (Bongers, Koot, Van der Ende &amp; Verhulst, 2008). The peer group may on one hand, serve as a model and influence behaviours and attitudes, whilst on the other hand, it may provide easy access, encouragement and an appropriate social setting for consumption (Glaser, Shelton &amp; Bree, 2010).</p> <p> Social Learning Theory suggests that it is not necessary for adolescents to observe a given behaviour and adopt it; it is sufficient to perceive that the peer group accepts it, in order to be able to opt for similar behaviours (Petraitis, Flay &amp; Miller, 1995). Peers may strongly determine preference in the way of dressing, speaking, using illicit substances, sexual behaviour, adopting and accepting violence, adopting criminal and anti-social behaviours and in many other areas of the adolescent’s life (Padilla, Walker &amp; Bean, 2009; Tomé, Matos &amp; Diniz, 2008). An example of this is that the main motives for alcohol consumption given by adolescents are related to social events, which usually take place in the company of friends, namely: <em>drinking makes holidays more fun, it facilitates approaching</em> <em>others; it helps relaxing or facilitates sharing experiences and feelings </em>(Kuntsche, Knibbe, Gmel &amp; Engels, 2005). Also, mimicking risk behaviours may be greater when consumption begins in the context of a social event (Larsen, Engels, Souren, Granic &amp; Overbeek, 2010).</p> <p>Adolescence is an extremely difficult period when the individual goes through various physical and mental changes. Children and young adults go through a lot of stress (Fontana, David and Slack, Ingrid, 1997). The pressure of school, meeting expectations of parents and teachers and planning out a career for themselves puts them under considerable strain and tension. These conditions are more often imposed upon them by adults. Added to this is the adolescents’ experience of its own intense feelings of joy, sorrow, fear, love, disappointment and anger. Relationships with friends are of utmost importance and success or failure in these interactions weighs heavily on them. They have to go through formal education in these formative years and at the same time need to develop their self-confidence and a sense of personal identity.</p> <p>Recognizing the nature and strength of these pressures allows us to appreciate that stress; neuroses, unhappiness and depression are by no means the prerogative of adults. Unfortunately, little is done with formal education to help adolescents learn to understand themselves, to control their anxieties and their thought processes, and to discover tranquility, harmony and balance within themselves. Little is done to help them manage their own inner lives, to use their mental energies productively instead of dissipating it in worries and random thinking and to access the creative levels of their own minds. A lack of education in mind training at this stage has resulted in most adolescents developing bad mental habits. Often their minds are turmoil of excitements, hopes, expectations, anxieties and fantasies.</p> <p>The rate of depression among adolescents is typically high. Their mood swings lead to agonizing periods of self-doubt. Virtually at no other time in life is there more a need for a mind training that, without denying or seeking to judge or repress a single feeling or emotion, can settle the individual into calm and relaxed state.Thus, the present study is designed to examine the influence of socioeconomic status and peer pressure on adolescents’ behavioural patterns in Lagos Metropolis.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>It has become a common phenomenon to read, hear or witness incidences of change in adolescent and enthusiasm for delinquent acts such as alcohol intake, drug abuse, rape, prostitution, sexual perversion, stealing, cultism, adolescent suicide, school dropout and all kinds of wanton misdemeanor which has become a problem in our sour societies and homes.</p> <p>However, adolescents behaviours are differ from each other, there are patterns which they follow, the causes of negative behaviours are parental socioeconomic status of adolescents and peer pressure. Both school and home environments play an important role in adolescents’ behavioural pattern, negative peer influences, lack of attachment to school personnel (e.g., teachers, nurses), poor school achievement and attainments, and cognitive or learning difficulties. It’s sad to say that these behaviours and social problems like truancy, school dropout, depression, fighting and aggression have patterns are unfortunately fallout of the social ills in the society. It is the society or our environment that creates severe poverty, homelessness and economic hardships.</p> <p>The societal norm violations are symptoms of social problems and the source of deviance is found within the social structure. This shows that anti-social behaviours expressed by students or adolescents are reflective of what obtains in the larger society. Many have agreed that deviant acts perpetrated by students in the secondary schools are due to negligence by parents, families and environmental and are responsible for the downward turn in the academic performance and social adjustment of these students. Therefore, to curb negative adolescents’ behaviour the teachers, parents and counsellors should be charged with a great responsibility to help the adolescent adjust to behaviors like truancy, drop out from school, depression, fighting, aggression etc. Therefore, it is against this background that this study is designed to examine the influence of socioeconomic status and peer pressure on adolescents’ behavioural patterns in Lagos Metropolis.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of this study is to examine the influence of socioeconomic status and peer pressure on adolescents’ behavioural patterns in Lagos Metropolis.

Living with a single parent has been associated with children’s delinquency alcohol and substance use. Lower self-esteem, psychiatric problems, early initiation of sexual intercourse and learning school before graduation. A growing number researches suggest, however, that single parent family may different managing for African Nigeria.</p> <p>Much of the research which has found detrimental effects of living with a single parent has be conducted with middle class peoples on the adolescent development research has found family structure effects that single parent at home hand a detrimental impact regardless of their person; cooper, pierce and Tidwell (1995) also concludes that living in a single-parent or step parent family is a risk factor for increased doing and alcohol use on the adolescent.

Also comparing the academic performance of the child, factors on single parent, the self-esteem and depressive symptoms, parenting attitudes of low-income and single parents who have young children and young youth.</p> <p><strong>1.10</strong> <strong>RESEARCH  PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Due to the adolescent living with their single parent has a detrimental effect on them most people find it difficult to expose some the social behavior.</p> <p>Children who come from single-parent families exhibit significantly different social behavior than those from intact families. According to the Texas youth commission children with one parent are at greater risk of having impulsive, aggressive and anti-social behavior problems. This can lead to delinquency and possible criminal behavior, problems. A single-parent may not have the time to balance her responsibilities with supervising her child, according to author and clinical nurse Vicky. R. Bowden. Female adolescents living with one parent are more likely to engage ion sexual activity, smoking, prostitution, lesbianism and robbery, according to the institute for American values. This means a higher chance of becoming a teenage mother. Children of single- parents may also find it more difficult to form and maintain social relationships than children from intact families. A child from an intact family has a positive example of a relationship and has this basis to form solid relationship. The child of a single-parent does not have such an example.</p> <p>School behavior: A child’s behaviour at school can be dramatically affected when there is one less parent in the home according to the institute of America values  children from single-parent families skip school, cut class are late almost 30 percent more than children from intact families, with only one parent in the home, a child may have less supervision when it comes to staying out of trouble, single parent has to  juggle work, home, finances and bringing up a child on his own which can be overwhelming. According to father for life. Org, 71 percent of high school dropouts come from homes without fathers.</p> <p><strong>Illegal Bahaviour</strong>: The texas youth commission states that children who come from single-parent families have a greater risk of engaging in illegal activity, this include using of illegal drugs and underage drinking if a child’s whereabouts are not monitored by parents, there is a greater risk of illegal behavior. A single parent who works full-time may not have the time to monitor her child. In a two-parent home, there is a greater likelihood that a child’s behavior will be supervised.</p> <p>According to the institute for American values, a male teenager is more likely to be arrested if he lives in a fatherless home. Children age 14 and over who come from an intact family are less instructions procedure for the data collection and the statistical method employed to analyse the data.</p> <p>likely to be arrested that those from a single-parent home.</p> <p><strong>Psychological disorders</strong>: According to the mayo clinic, teenager can develop a number of psychological disorders due to a lack of supervision, a lack of positive parent involvement and divorce. They are more likely to develop Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) anxiety depression and Attention Deficit Hyperactively Disorder (ADHD), also children are three times less likely to develop mental disorders, such as oppositional defiant disorder and anxiety, depression ant attention deficit, if they come from intact families the risk of developing these disorders can also be high for children who come from a two-parent family where the marriage is troubled. But as children continue to grow they learn from walking and talking in their environment that is conducive, peer group, schools and be open minded by having strong moral character with good understanding.</p> <p>On the single parent homes on the children which lend to affect the life style of the parents, families and relationships with other people,  education  enlightenment and other  social activity, a higher stress home lowers self-esteem in children and parents, which can result in negative and unpleasant behavior of single parenthood on adolescent.</p> <p><strong>Financial support</strong>: Raising a child in a single parent home puts stress on finances, stress accumulated for the parent who is trying to manage a work  like and a home life, and also for the child who may suffer from the lack of financial support for daily necessities and an absentee parent.</p> <p><strong>The self-esteem:</strong> In single parent families, self-esteem issues play a major role in a child’s behavior, children have lower self-esteem with a single parent than children who are raised two parents, the strongest finding relates that the mother-daughter relationship suffers the most, as girls formulate their world-view and confidence from the example of the mother.</p> <p>Due to the single parent unpinning of the child especially the female children most of them end up having unwanted pregnancy (pregnancies) Ogunde (1983) indicates that most of the adolescent girls that become pregnant are those with low education, inferior self image and are therefore----------</p> <p>And the socio-economic status of the family. Touliato et al (1978) examined that it is an important factor in the scholastic achievement of a child “a child when born is neither good nor bad but the home in which he lives shapes him. Right from childhood, parents are supposed to inculcate societal norms and values through the use of reward, to reinforce positive behavior, and punishment, to stamp out the undesirables behavior.</p> <p>Maslow (1976) in his theory of hierarchy of needs and sequential development of man contended that man has five “basic needs’ which are hierarchy. These are, oxygen, water, food, shelter and love or sense of belonging.</p> <p>A person that is denied any of these basic needs at early childhood grows up to be a mal-adjusted individual,. For the survival of a child therefore, the family is the only institution that can see to the satisfaction of these basic needs. These show the indispensable role that a family plays in the total development of an individual. If however, the type of family- structure that adults keep or the home they provide is defective, it could hinder th normal growth and intellectual development of their children. Consequently, his academic achievement will be defected.</p> <p>Family structure therefore refers to the over-all make-up of a home as dictated and designed by the parents, and this has direct bearings on the child’s academic achievement. Also children raised in an intact family attain superior academic and occupational achievement, compared with children who were products of a disrupted family.</p> <p><strong>Education</strong></p> <p>The educational level of parents also contribute to the behavioural maturity of children, single parents who do not have a full high school education result in lower wage earning potential and can suffer from a higher incidence of health problem, because of this children can suffer from aggression, depression and anxiety, as noted by author Katti gray from research studies done by Princeton University beginning in 2007, in her article “Broken Ties” from the journal Diverse, she claims that the higher the education in parents produces more opportunities for the child, and possibly contributes to better behavior moreso, single parenting and the economic struggles are often associated with raising a child in the society.</p> <p><strong>1.11</strong> <strong>SIGNIFICANCE  OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will assist student, by single-parents by exposing them to many variables that may contribute tot heir poor academic performance, and behavior wise, it will help in awakening parents to their responsibilities and finish them with the necessary information in how to influence their children holistic development social and interpersonal relationship with their parents and peer group positively. It will also help the facilitators, academic authorities, and counselors or psychologist to have board knowledge of the problem of single parents and its effects on the psychological and social adjustment on  the adolescents to assist them.</p> <p><strong>1.12</strong> <strong>THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</strong></p> <p>Concept of single parenthood. It is a situation where one of the parents is involved in the process of bearing and raising a child, parents are no longer readily available to take then full responsibilities over the child most researchers have shown how far reaching effects on the children and adolescent. Ogunlana (1999) stated that parenthood is a responsibility requiring the full co-operation of both parents who must ensure the total development of their offspring(s).</p> <p>Structurally, a family is either broken or intact a broken family in this context is one that is not structurally intact for various reasons vis-à-vis death of apparent, divorce, separation dissertation and illegitimacy in which case, the family was never completed.</p> <p>Conkline (1996) analysis become necessary because life in a single parent family can be traumatic and children brought up in such family structure often suffer some emotional problems, which may hundred their academic performance, on the other hand, children raised in two-parent family structure are often stable emotionally and they suffer less emotional problem thereby making them less anxious in their pursuit of their academic work.</p> <p>However, situation should be noted that not true at all lines since there are some children still perform academically better than children from two parent family structure (Apia and Olutola 2007). This situation may however be attributed to other factors inherent in the personality of the child.</p> <p><strong>1.13</strong> <strong>LIMITATIONS OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study causes on the influence of single parenthood on the psychosocial of adolescent self concept, the stud particularly revolves around two selected government ministry of education  the researcher would have loved to carry out this research in all the ministry in Lagos State, but due to time and finance the researcher is limited to two ministry.</p> <p><strong>1.14</strong> <strong>THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</strong></p> <p><strong>Family</strong>: This is a group of people who are related by blood or marriage and it consists of father, mother and children.</p> <p><strong>Adolescent</strong>: This is a period of life between childhood and adulthood.

The descriptive survey design was used in this study. The research instrument used for this study was a questionnaire tagged PPBBAQ which was adapted by the researcher. The population of this study covered the students in selected secondary schools in Ejigbo Local Government area of Lagos State where data was collected using simple random sampling. Collected data was analyzed using Pearson moment correlation co-efficient statistical tools, descriptive statistics. Demographic data such as gender, age, and class were used. Findings showed that peer pressure has a relationship with bullying. It was concluded that there is a relationship between bullying and gender of the participants. It was therefore recommended that school administrators, vice principals and teachers should refer all victims and perpetrators of bullying to the counsellor.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Schools have always been recognised as an institution for the transfer of knowledge and culture to the future generation. It is a dynamic human system dedicated to the nurturing of mutual growth and understanding between children and adult.</p> <p>The school is an institution designed for the teaching of students enrolled in it and part of the purpose of the school is to develop the student through knowledge acquisition so that he/she may become a social being. By this, the student is expected to learn how to relate with fellow students, teachers and significant others in the school on the one hand, live in a harmonious way (by blending with societal values) in the society on the other hand. The school is also expected to be a place where students should feel safe and secure, and where they count on being treated with respect. The reality, however seem to be that only few students or pupils can harmoniously with their school mates without experiencing violence in the school.</p> <p>Human beings are gregarious and social in nature. They hardly live in isolation but prefer to live and interact with one another. The urge to interact creates some challenges, which need to be addressed. Therefore, in order to achieve development, norms are developed to guide human interactions. Although, the norms may vary from one place to the other, there are some commonalities. One of such norms, which promotes friendship and discourages aggressive behaviours is positive interpersonal relationship. However, interpersonal relationship among secondary school students in Nigeria is gradually being threatened by deviant behaviours such as bullying. Bullying has become a source of concern to counsellors, teachers, school administrators and parents due to its adverse effects on relationship among students. Smith (2001) reported that ten percent of children in America indicated that they had ben bullied by other students, but had not bullied others. Another six percent stated that they had been bullied and had also bullied other children. A total of thirteen percent of the students noted thatthey had bullied other students but had not been bullied. Stephenson and Smith (1989), Olweus (1991) and Craig and Pepler (1997) observed that most bullying take place in school and usually encouraged by the audience. The researchers noted that the victims of bully are the most insecure, the least likeable and the most unsuccessful in school. Also, children who are bully-victims appear to be at the greatest risk of adjustment difficulties. Boys and girls are equally likely to report being victimized by bullies. It was found that most bullies have littles or no empathy for their victims and show littles remorse about bullying.</p> <p>Bullying takes place in social settings with many onlookers aware of the distress caused to victims. Up until relatively recently, most researchers have tended to employ a standard, internationally accepted definition of bullying, and many studies are based on the work of Olweus (1992): ‘A person is being bullied when she or he is exposed, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more persons.’ Olweus further argues that bullying involves an imbalance of power. Bullying has various forms, it can be verbal (e.g., name-calling), physical or indirect (e.g., spreading unpleasant rumours) (Olweus 1992). Bullying is thus a complex phenomenon, and despite the generally accepted definition, bullying behaviour has been conceptualized in different ways.  </p> <p>Olweus (1972) coined bullying as “mobbing,” and defined it as an individual or a group of individuals harassing, teasing, or pestering another person. Bullying and victimization are prevalent problems in the area of adolescent peer relationships.</p> <p>Experiences with peers constitutes an important developmental context for children and adolescents (Rubin, Bukowski, &amp; Parker, 2006). Children’s experiences with peers occur on several different levels: general interactions with peers, friendships, and in groups. Social competence reflects a child’s capacity to engage successfully with peers at different levels. This section will provide an introduction and overview of friendships, peer groups, and socio-metric status, with attention to developmental changes that occur during childhood and adolescence.</p> <p>The impact of peer influence on adolescent development is generally associated with negative connotations. I believe that the use of the peer group as a vehicle for problem-solving development has not been fully utilized, even though it presents significant opportunities for childcare practitioners and educators.</p> <p>It is wildly accepted that membership in peer groups is a powerful force during adolescence. These groups provide an important developmental point of reference through which adolescents gain an understanding of the world outside of their families. Failure to develop close relationships with age mates, however, often results in a variety of problems for adolescents – from delinquency and substance abuse to psychological disordered (Hops, Davis, Alpert &amp; Longoria 1997). Furthermore, higher peer stress and less companionship support from peers has been associated with a lower social self-concept in adolescents (Wenz-Gross, Sipestein, Umtoh, Widaman, 1997).</p> <p>As children progress through adolescence, they build knowledge baes that help them navigate social situations. An abundance of literature has suggested that there is considerable individual variation regarding cognitive skill development during adolescence as it relates to peer influence. Dodge’s (1993) research indicated that poor peer relationships were closely associated with social cognitive skill deficits. He found that adolescents who had developed positive peer relationships generated more alternative solutions to problems, proposed more mature solutions, and were less aggressive than youth who had developed negative peer relationships. Along those same lines Bansal (1996) found that adolescents who compared themselves negatively in reference to their peers experienced a reduction in attention to problem-solving tasks.</p> <p>Most public and private childcare systems continue to overlook peer influence despite the growing body of literature indicating that it represents a powerful force in maintaining orderly, productive and positive academic and rehabilitative environments (Bellafiore &amp; Salend, 1983; Brendtro &amp; Lindgren, 1988; Emery, 1990; Gadow &amp; McKibbon, 1984; Gibbs, Potter, Goldstein, &amp; Brendtro, 1996; Salend, Jantzen, &amp; Geik, 1992; Wasmund, 1988).</p> <p>Pettit (1997) found the peer group to be a useful resource in decreasing violence and aggression in children; Brannon, Larson, and Doggett (1991) reported that the peer group process facilitated the disclosure of victimization by adolescent sexual offenders.</p> <p>Over the past two decades, child and family-service programs have popularized the term empowerment and, to some extent, have incorporated peer-referenced paradigms into their approaches with adolescents. Many programs have failed to truly value children as partners in this process; instead, they have used peer influence to police the environment and maintain order once children have broken adult-imposed rules.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>There have been several studies on the relationship between peer group pressure and other concepts like academic performance, career choice, class courting, motivation, achievement, study habit, and truancy etc, with little or no research by scholars in the area of peer group pressure and bullying behaviour.</p> <p>In addition there have been several worrisome cases in secondary schools where adolescents indulge in bullying the less stronger students and this attitude has been condemned by teachers, parents and administrators. Despite the fact that schools have rules and regulations to tackle or curb such deviant or delinquent behaviour it seems or appears inefficient and ineffective.</p> <p>Also of recent the rate of bulling behaviour among adolescents in secondary schools is on the high side and several brows have been raised that such behaviour has been highly influence by peer group pressure.</p> <p>It is therefore rationally viewed that if bullying behaviour can be curbed among adolescents in secondary schools it will reduce anxiety, fear and other psychological effects it has on its victims and as a result help them focus on their academics. The adolescents need to learn how to develop positive self-thought and have a personal philosophy that will guard and guide them through this period of storm and stress.</p> <p>The adolescents needs to be given hints and speculations on how to select good friends, how to select or pick their friends and shouldn’t allow their friends pick them. They should vividly understand why they should move with good groups and not the bad ones because bad communication they say corrupt good manners. They should also be made to understand that a person who is a victim of bully can as a result of that commit suicide while some become fierce, wild, and notorious as a result of revenge. It is towards this view and assumptions that the study tends to ascertain the relationship between peer group pressure and bullying behaviour of adolescents in selected secondary schools in Lagos metropolis.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of the study will be directed to investigate the relationship between peer group and bullying behaviour of adolescents in selected secondary schools in Lagos metropolis. This research will specifically seek to;</p> <p>          i.            Ascertain the relationship between peer group pressure and bullying behaviour among adolescents in selected secondary schools in Lagos metropolis.</p> <p>        ii.            Find out the relationship between peer group pressure and anxiety among adolescents in selected secondary schools in Lagos metropolis.</p> <p>      iii.            Examine the significant relationship between peer group pressure and psychological effects among adolescents in selected secondary schools in Lagos metropolis.</p> <p>      iv.            Ascertain the relationship between bullying and gender of the participants among adolescents in selected secondary schools in Lagos metropolis.</p> <p><strong>1.4       Research Questions</strong></p> <p>        i.            Is there any significant relationship between peer group pressure and bullying behaviour among adolescents in selected secondary schools in Lagos metropolis?</p> <p>      ii.            Is there any significant relationship between peer group pressure and anxiety among adolescents in selected secondary schools in Lagos metropolis?</p> <p>    iii.            Is there any significant relationship between peer group pressure and psychological effects among adolescents in selected secondary schools in Lagos metropolis?</p> <p>    iv.            Is there any significant relationship between bullying and gender of the participants among adolescents in selected secondary schools in Lagos metropolis?</p> <p><strong>1.5       Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>        i.            There is no significant relationship between peer group pressure and bullying behaviour among adolescents in selected secondary schools in Lagos metropolis.</p> <p>      ii.            There is no significant relationship between peer group pressure and anxiety among adolescents in selected secondary schools in Lagos metropolis.</p> <p>    iii.            There is no significant relationship between peer group pressure and psychological effects among adolescents in selected secondary schools in Lagos metropolis.</p> <p>    iv.            There is no significant relationship between bullying and gender of the participants among adolescents in selected secondary schools in Lagos metropolis.</p> <p><strong>1.6       Significance of the study</strong></p> <p> The will be of immense benefit to innumerable members of the society who sees peer group as a negative or wrong community otherwise known as partners in crime, hence the saying birds of the same feather flock together. The research is meant to provide government officials with more information and ideas on how peer groups and teachers in public schools relate. It will further provide teachers with ideas on how to provide dynamics that will motivate learners and adolescents, so as to give room for good academic performance and good behaviour.</p> <p><strong>School Authorities:</strong> this is necessary so that parents can gain and will understand the implications and consequences of bullied children and thus mobilize all resources to curtail the problems arising from the situation.</p> <p><strong>Parents:</strong> through appropriate parental counselling programmes, parents will easily checkmate their children if they are moving with bad gangs and if their child is passing through psychological issues.</p> <p><strong>Students:</strong> it will help students to desist from wrong company, become selective before they make friends, in other words they will loop before leaping because bad company they say corrupt good manners. It will also help students desist from violence, destruction of properties especially chairs and tables during riot or demonstration or strike. They will become enlightened that the properties are used by them and destruction of it will or may hamper the process of teaching and learning.</p> <p><strong>Government:</strong> employment into schools will be strictly for those that study education and with competent knowledge in behaviour modification. More so, there will be pre service training and in-service training for teachers for exposure and experience will serve as feedback for the government agencies.</p> <p><strong>Ministry of education:</strong> more indices that will encourage the sector to determine the psychological level of a child and the allocation given to school will be properly monitored. Policy that will bring about positive change in adaptive behaviour that will transcend to the entire society will emerge. </p> <p><strong>1.7       Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study covers the relationship between peer group pressure and bullying behaviours of adolescents’ in selected secondary schools in Lagos metropolis. It is limited to selected secondary schools in Ejigbo only.</p> <p><strong>1.8       Operational definition of terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Relationship: </strong>this is the way in which two things are connected e.g peer group pressure and bullying.</p> <p><strong>Adolescents: </strong>These are young people developing into adult usually between the age of 11 and 19.</p> <p><strong>Bullying: </strong>It is the use of force, threat, or coercion to abuse, intimidate, or aggressively dominate others by adolescents.</p> <p><strong>Peer group pressure: </strong>Positive or negative is when your classmates, or other people your age, try to get you to do something.</p>                                                           \n\nTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PEER GROUP PRESSURE AND BULLYING AMONG ADOLESCENTS IN SELECTED SECONDARY SCHOOLS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PEER GROUP PRESSURE AND BULLYING AMONG ADOLESCENTS IN SELECTED SECONDARY SCHOOLS", "id": 57}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Abstract</p> <p>CHAPTER 1:  INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.    Background to the Study</p> <p>2.    Statement of Problem</p> <p>3.    Scope of study</p> <p>4.    Objectives of Study</p> <p>5.    Significance of Study</p> <p>6.    Research Questions</p> <p>7.    Research Hypothesis</p> <p>8.    Research Methodology</p> <p>9.    Sources of Data</p> <p>1.10 Outline of Chapters</p> <p> CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/> 2.1:   Conceptual framework<br/> 2.2:   The concept of financial system<br/> 2.2.1: The concept of financial distress<br/> 2.2.2: The types of banks<br/> 2.3: The gap in financial system¦<br/> 2.4: The role of banks in filling the gaps in financial system<br/> 2.5: The structure of Nigeria banking system<br/> 2.6: The distress in commercial and merchant bank<br/> 2.7: Causes of distress in commercial and merchant bank<br/> 2.8: commercial and merchant bank and economic growth<br/> 2.9: The effects of commercial and merchant bank distress on the growth of<br/> the economy</p> <p>CHAPTER 3: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/> 3.

Tension and behaviour disorder, disagreement increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescents that may be in opposition to parents’ values. All these conflicts create in parents mixed feelings and makes parenting a complex task, with specific parenting practices which are less important in predicting child well-being. Base on this the researcher was interested in investigating parenting styles and its influences on adolescents’ behaviour. Null hypothesis was formulated to guide the study. Review of literature was carried on accordingly. A sample of 627 respondents was selected for the study. The selection was done through the stratified and simple random sampling techniques. Questionnaire was the main instrument for data collection. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was adopted. The hypothesis was tested under a 0.05 level of significance. The result of the analysis revealed that parenting styles significantly influence adolescents’ behaviour. Recommendations were made based on the result; that parents and adolescents should maintain cordial relationship and interaction to guide against behaviour misconduct and family conflict, leading to depression, anxiety, aggression and worries on the growing person</p> <p>Introduction A thorough understanding of adolescence in society depends on information from various perspectives, including psychology, biology, history, sociology, education and anthropology. Within all of these perspectives, adolescence is viewed as a transitional period between childhood and adulthood, whose cultural purpose is the preparation of children for adult roles (Karson &amp; Wilson, 2004).</p> <p>It is a period of multiple transitions involving education, training, employment and unemployment, as well as transactions from one living circumstances to another. Hence, the end of adolescence and beginning of adulthood varies by country and by function. Adolescents Attitude</p> <p>Furthermore even within a single nation, state or culture there can be different ages at which an individual is considered mature enough for society to entrust them with certain privileges and responsibilities. Such milestones includes driving a vehicle, having legal sexual relations, serving in armed forces or in a jury, purchasing and drinking alcohol, voting, enticing into contracts, finishing certain levels of education and marriage.Adolescents Attitude</p> <p>Adolescence is usually accompanied by an increased independence allowed by the parents and legal guardians, including less supervision as compared to pre adolescence. Adolescence is a search for risk taking, without risk-taking, teenagers would not have the motivation or confidence necessary to make a change in society from childhood to adulthood. Risk taking potentials have lead so many to new found sexual attractiveness, drinking, drug use/addiction, negative attitudes or responses to elders, delinquency, depression, aggressiveness and examination malpractices. Adolescence makes a rapid change in one’s role within a family. Young children tend to ascertain themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescent (Grotevant, 1997) when they are increasingly view by parents as equals.Adolescents Attitude</p> <p>The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship with his or her parents (Rawlins, 1992). When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent-child conflict and less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptance, clothing and the adolescents’ right to privacy (Steinber, 2001) which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parentsadolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents’ values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreement (Social Networking, 2012).Adolescents Attitude.</p>                                                           \n\nADOLESCENTS ATTITUDE TO PARENTAL DISCIPLINE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ADOLESCENTS ATTITUDE TO PARENTAL DISCIPLINE", "id": 62}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Introduction</p> <p>One of the leading causes of premature death in the last twenty years has been the scourge of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The disease, AIDS, was first heard of in 1981. Within twenty years, it spread to all continents of the world and remains a great killer to which no man has found a solution. In 1988 alone, about 5.8 million new cases occurred, bringing the total number of people living with Human Immuno-deficiency Virus/AIDS by December, 1998 to approximately 33.4 million. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS, 2007) estimates that there are now 40 million people living with HIV or AIDS worldwide. Since the beginning of the epidemic, AIDS has killed more than 25 million people worldwide. It has replaced malaria and tuberculosis as the world’s deadliest infectious disease among adults and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Fifteen million children have</p> <p>been orphaned by the epidemic. Young people worldwide are the sub-group most affected while about</p> <p>Department of Educational Foundations and Councelling, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria</p> <p>Department of Psychology, Obafemi Awolowo University,Ile-Ife, Nigeria</p> <p>Depratment of Local Government Studies, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria</p> <p>Department of Accounting &amp; Business Education,University of Ado-Ekiti, Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria</p> <p>half of new HIV cases are occurring in people aged 15-24. According to Okonofua (1999) it is no longer news that the Human Immuno- deficiency Virus is now well established in Nigeria. Although the virus was first identified in Nigeria in 1988, over 4 million Nigerians were estimated to have contacted the virus by the end of 1998. This makes Nigeria the second country in Africa with the heaviest burden of the disease, in terms of absolute number of those afflicted, second only to South Africa.</p> <p>The disease has now permeated the entire Nigeria society. It affected men and women in urban and rural areas, as well as adolescents, commercial sex workers, traders, high profile politicians and socialites, servicemen and women, truck drivers and students. Indeed, everyone must feel vulnerable to the disease, which is fast rampaging the most productive age groups in the Nigerian population. Several thousands have died from the disease, and this has brought untold hardship and disorganization to many Nigeria families.</p> <p>In Nigeria, the burden of HIV/AIDS on the citizenry is alarming. Statistics on the spread of the disease show that Nigeria records about 1,400 new infections every day. This figure represents one new infection per minute. By October 1998, it is believed that Nigeria records about 571,036 cases of HIV infection. In the hierarchy of the world’s most infected AIDS nations, Nigeria is said to occupy the 27 position, constituting 8.9 percent of global infection and 12.5 percent of the African HIV/AIDS burden.</p> <p>Professor Debo Adeyemi, one time health minister in Nigeria, describes the spread of HIV/AIDS as</p> <p>alarming. According to him, about 25 million adults in Nigeria are already infected with the disease. He</p> <p>reasons that with his figure, assuming that there are no new cases of infection, fatality from the disease</p> <p>will surpass the totality of deaths recorded from the Nigeria civil war by the year 2010.</p> <p>The disease up till now has got no cure despite many years of drug and vaccine research activities.</p> <p>Although few drugs are now available that could prolong the lives of infected persons through reduction of</p> <p>the load of the virus and improvement in the number of white blood cells. Such drugs are, however, very</p> <p>expensive, globally, and quite scarce in Nigeria. Good nutrition and prompt treatment of presenting</p> <p>diseases can also prolong the life of an infected person. Thus, the only effective way of controlling</p> <p>HIV/AIDS, presently, is by prevention, with education as the main thrust of this approach.</p> <p>How counsellors react to a counsellee and how they communicate these feelings are of critical</p> <p>importance in counselling. Adolescents come to the counsellor for help and understanding. They bring to</p> <p>the counsellor confused feeling, ideas, fears and hopes with which they are struggling. The counsellors</p> <p>attitudes toward them determine in large measure the extent to which they will attempt to cope</p> <p>constructively with their problems and undertake positive actions. If the counsellor demonstrates a</p> <p>genuine acceptance of these adolescents, they will feel that they are received.</p> <p>Inadequate knowledge of HIV/AIDS among adolescents, particularly secondary school students calls for a</p> <p>study that will assess the role of school counselors in the prevention of the disease. This study</p> <p>specifically investigated the level of awareness of HIV/AIDS among secondary school students in Osun</p> <p>State and assessed the precautionary measures taken by secondary school students against the</p> <p>transmission of HIV/AIDS. This was with a view to assessing the role of school counselors in the</p> <p>prevention of the pandemic among secondary school students in Osun State.</p> <p>Objectives of the Study</p> <p>The specific objectives of the study are to</p> <p>(a) investigate the level of awareness of HIV/AIDS among secondary school students in Osun State;</p> <p>(b). assess the precautionary measures taken by secondary school students against the transmission of HIV/AIDS;</p> <p>(c). appraise the activities of school counsellors in the prevention of HIV/AIDS.</p> <p>Research Hypotheses</p> <p>In order to empirically achieve in a non – spurious manner the objectives of the study, the following hypotheses were postulated and tested:</p> <p>1. Awareness/knowledge of HIV/AIDS will not significantly influence the practice of precautionary measures against the transmission of the disease.</p> <p>2. Gender will have no significant influence on secondary school students’ practice of the precautionary measures against the transmission of HIV/AIDS</p> <p>3. Activities of school counsellors will have no significant influence on the practice of precautionary measures against the transmission of HIV/AIDS Review of Empirical Studies</p> <p>(i) Beliefs and Attitudes about AIDS</p> <p>This section presents several works that have been done on AIDS. It presents the disease’s aetiology</p> <p>and some forms of attitudinal changes, which have accompanied AIDS as a result of social norms and</p> <p>personal beliefs. In particular, works that pertain to beliefs about AIDS in Nigeria shall be reviewed.</p> <p>There are so many norms and personal beliefs and attitudes concerning AIDS that it would be almost impossible to mention them all, but the point of this study are to investigate the most prominent ones. First is the attitude of total disbelief. This is the most drastic and it comes in several forms. In Africa,</p> <p>there are large groups of people that claim that AIDS is a “White Man’s Disease”, equating it with illnesses such as anorexia or bulimia (Daily Mail &amp; Guardian, 2002). They believe it is just as foreign, claiming that their original traditions have not changed. They feel that regarding sexual practices, their traditions have not changed – which is polygamy and having concubines. They claim that Africans are not the inventors of taking intravenous drugs for pleasure, and homosexuality is a taboo. As a result, people with this belief look upon the AIDS issue with scorn and contempt. Needless to say, such people do not tend to change their attitude towards their sexual behaviour Even among scientists of the Western world, there are unbelievers Eugene (2001) of the Alive and Well magazine claim that there are no reliable HIV/AIDS tests and that those in use now, the ELISA and the Western Blot tests can only detect the presence of antibody proteins that are assumed to belong to HIV. These tests, he argues, cannot look for, and cannot</p>                                                           \n\nSCHOOL COUNSELORS’ ROLES IN PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF HIV AND AIDS IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SCHOOL COUNSELORS’ ROLES IN PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF HIV AND AIDS IN NIGERIA", "id": 63}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationships between stressful life eventsi and anxiety during the period of adolescence. It is known that stressful life events are commonly studied risk and environmental factors in the development of psychopathology in childhood and adolescence. In addition, physical and psychological symptoms of anxiety are often associated with stressful life events. These events are related to the different experiences of conflict and disrupted communication in the family.</p> <p>Subsequently, these events directly or indirectly affect the self-esteem and the self-image of adolescents during the period of adolescence. This research starts with the assumption that stressful life events predicted anxiety during the period of adolescence. Another assumption, in this research, is that females have higher level of anxiety compared with males. This study was conducted on a sample  of 160 participants (80 girls and 80 boys) students in the fourth year of secondary school. The instruments used in the research include: scale of stressful life eventsi for children and adolescents – Stress-D, and the Scale for anxiety for children and adolescents – SCAD-62. The results showed that stressful life events were significantly associated with anxiety symptoms (r= .962, p&lt;.01).

The sample comprises 150 senior secondary two students randomly selected with the use of stratified random sampling technique from five secondary schools in five selected Local Government Areas of Lagos metropolis. It is envisaged that this study would benefit couples and those contemplating marriage as it will expose them to other experiences thereby giving them insight into marital problem solving mechanisms. Society at large will also benefit from this study because their awareness level on marital conflicts and the consequences on adolescents would have been raised since a better family makes a better society.

Independent t -test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical techniques were used for data analysis. The findings showed that there is a significant impact of marital conflicts on the psychosocial adjustment of adolescents. Psychosocial adjustments did not significantly differ due to gender but on the other hand Psychosocial adjustments significantly differ due to marital conflict. Marital conflicts Significantly affect adolescents’ perception of marriage as an institution.</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Marriage is the socially acceptable union between a man and a woman. It means the coming together of two totally different individuals as husband and wife who agree to plan and set up their own family. Osarenren (2002) viewed marriage as usually a union between an adult male and an adult female. Marital conflicts come in different forms like spouse battering, spousal abuse, sexual abuse, marital irresponsibility, incest, rape, subtle struggle for control between the couple and other abusive behaviours. There is concern about the rising rate of unresolved marital conflicts, which often lead to marital instability, further leading to divorce, desertion, single-parenthood and legal separation. Thus, unresolved marital conflicts oftentimes lead to failed marriages. Marital conflicts are often caused by childlessness, forced marriage, incompatibility, communication gap, interference by in-laws, finances, infidelity, sex of children, lack of appreciation etc. Therefore, when marital conflicts occur regularly, it may have adverse effects on the psycho-social adjustment of adolescents who are the products of such marriages.</p>                                                          \n\nGENDER DIFFERENCES IN THE PSYCHO-SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT OF NIGERIAN SINGLE PARENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " GENDER DIFFERENCES IN THE PSYCHO-SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT OF NIGERIAN SINGLE PARENTS", "id": 65}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This paper offers a critical account of the amnesty programme introduced by the Nigerian state in 2009. It examines the impact and limitations of the amnesty as an instrument of peacebuilding, and emphasises the need for wider reforms that address underdevelopment and poverty in the Niger Delta region. The paper argues that the amnesty programme is a laudable effort but is by no means a silver bullet. It is better understood as a specific response to a resource-driven conflict that requires a broader, comprehensive resolution.</p> <p>Nigeria’s resource wealth has been a major driver of conflict in the past 40 years. The Niger Delta region has been plagued by simmering grievances that blossomed over time into a popular insurgency against the Nigerian state and multinational oil companies (MOCs) (Ukiw, U. 2011. “The Nigerian State, Oil and the Niger Delta Crisis”.

This paper offers a critical account of the amnesty programme in Nigeria. The analysis is located within a narrative of the overarching political economy dynamics in Nigeria which are influence violence, underdevelopment and poverty in the Niger Delta region. The paper argues that the amnesty programme should be complemented with wider reforms that tackle the root causes of the Niger Delta crisis.</p> <p>The next section provides a review of the amnesty programme which examines its objectives and operations. This is followed by a critical discussion of the limitations and weaknesses in the approach to amnesty in Nigeria. In conclusion, the paper identifies wider reforms that are needed for lasting peace, security and development in the Niger Delta.</p>                                                           \n\nCOUNSELLING STRATEGIES FOR ADDRESSING MILITANCY AND SOCIAL RESTIVENESS IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COUNSELLING STRATEGIES FOR ADDRESSING MILITANCY AND SOCIAL RESTIVENESS IN NIGERIA", "id": 66}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Grassroots education is imperative if economic development is to be actualized. Therefore, it becomes necessary to study the primary school teachers’ perception of the Universal Basic Education (UBE). This study attempted to find out the primary school teachers’ perception of the Universal Basic Education (UBE) programme and their perceived contribution towards the success of the programme. It further examined how favorable perception towards the scheme could be a catalyst in the successful implementation of the UBE. To accomplish this task, two research questions and a hypothesis were raised to guide the study.School Counsellor</p> <p>The opinion of one hundred and eighteen (118) teachers, out of four hundred and forty-seven teachers (447) that constituted the population of the teachers in Esan West Public Primary Schools was obtained. The respondents were randomly selected. The questionnaire was used for data collection. A 1-4 Likert-type scale ranging from Strongly Agreed to Strongly Disagreed was used to score the responses of the subjects. The data collected were analyzed using percentages, means, standard deviation and chi- square (X2). A significant difference existed among primary school teachers in their perception and operation of the UBE scheme.School Counsellor</p> <p>The result revealed that 58% of the respondents had favorable perception of the UBE programme. And since perception affects our attitude towards a programme, this positive response will go a long way in enhancing the implementation of the UBE scheme, which invariably will contribute immensely to economic growth and national development.School Counsellor</p> <p>Education lies somewhere in between pure public goods and pure private goods. Though education could be financed privately and even provided privately, not all the benefits of educations could be confined to those who paid for it and it is not possible to exclude the less educated from the various spillovers generated by the more educated (Ndagi, 1977). Education is regarded as quasi-public good.</p> <p>Usually, there are budget cuts and we are given less to spend and each naira is buying less educational goods and services because of inflation. A process of tackling the economic problems of development would entail a political development – a development in the way power is distributed in the region, in what institutions have, what functions and how community participates in the entire process. As Dr. Kwame Nkruma’s dictum asserts “seek ye first the political kingdom and all others will be added unto it”.</p> <p>Education is a basic necessity for good life, economic development and natural development. Globalising world economy is a farce until education is globalized. It has been observed in many quarters that no nation could become stable, prosperous or achieve a sustainable development and enduring democratic rule without an educational citizenry.</p> <p>Each year, about 130 million primaryschool-age children are denied access to education. Two-thirds of them are girls (UNICEF, 1999). More than 150 million children start primary school but drop out of school before they have completed five years of education (UNICEF, 1999). It is estimated that one in five individuals in the developing world will still be illiterate in 2010 (UNESCO, 1997). Less than two percent of children with disabilities in developing countries are included in formal education (Walkins, 2000).School Counsellor</p> <p>From the foregoing, it is quite clear that there is a global campaign for education. It has been observed that there is no universally accepted definition for the word “education” right from Plato to the present day. The definition varies according to the individual perception of life or his sociopolitical and the culture of the community. Nevertheless, there are components of education, which are common to all societies and cultures. Based on the above observations, education has been defined in many ways.School Counsellor</p> <p>Ehiametalor (1985) defines education “as the acquisition of knowledge, the aggregate of all processes through which a person develops ability, skills, attitudes and other forms of behaviour with posilive value in the society in which he lives”. Majasan (1995) sees education as a life long process, which enhances the individual’s quality of life, builds up his personality and enables him to contribute effectively to the development of his society at any stage of his life career. Dewey (1924) defines education as:School Counsellor</p> <p>A process of fostering, nurturing, cultivating a process. All these words mean that it implies attention to the condition of growth. We also speak of rearing, raising, bringing upwards which express the different levels which education aims to cover. Etymologically, the word education means just a process of leading or bringing up. When we have the outcome of the process in mind, we speak of education as shaping, forming, molding activity – that is shaping into the standard form of social activity.School Counsellor</p> <p>Education, therefore, entails more than acquisition of knowledge, it is the aggregate of one’s ability, skills, attitudes, values, perception and acceptable pattern of behaviour by the society. Apart from parents who are involved in the process of moulding of the child, the teachers have important roles to play.School Counsellor.</p>                                                          \n\nSCHOOL COUNSELLOR AND PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS’ PERCEPTION OF THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UNIVERSAL BASIC EDUCATION (UBE) PROGRAMME<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SCHOOL COUNSELLOR AND PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS’ PERCEPTION OF THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UNIVERSAL BASIC EDUCATION (UBE) PROGRAMME", "id": 67}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>An abundance of research has shown that large transactional distance between geographically dispersed learners and supporting staff in Open and Distance learning institutions contribute to students’ feelings of isolation, low self efficacy and reduced level of motivation which culminates to poor academic performance.

It is regarded as an important stage in human development the world over. People who plan their retirement well in advance adjust well to retirement, and they are likely to go through it as a honeymoon phase in which they are quite active or may go through an R and R (Rest and Relaxation) phase of recuperating from stress and strains of employment (Odu, 1998 &amp; Dada &amp; Idowu, 2010).</p> <p>According to Belsky (1990) retirement is a transition from the world of work into a world of less rigorous work activity and rest, especially in respect of retirement due to old age or long years of service. In Nigeria, no officer in the public service shall be allowed to remain in service after attaining the retirement age of sixty years or thirty five years pensionable service whichever is earlier (Federal Republic Nigeria, 2008). However, some retirements have not been due to old age or long service, but to a cut down in expenses in the public and private sectors of the economy as well as political factors (Adeoye and Legbara, 1997).</p> <p>There are thousands of Nigerians who retire everyday. Workers, especially those on the verge of retirement have many concerns. The challenges and prospects of an enjoyable retirement are different for each and every person. Retirement anxiety affects millions of Nigerians every year. Concerns like: What will I do with my time? Who am I that I am longer a physician (or teacher or manger)? Do I have enough money or financial security to continue to live on when I retired? Have I saved enough? Will my spending have to be drastically curtained? Can I count in my national health insurance providers for Medicare? Can I count on my pension administrator or government for payment of my gratuity and pension?</p> <p>Workers are not left out of this crossroads and puzzles. Their pay at the end of the month hardly takes them home. They have families to fend and provide for. Their wives and children must eat in order to live. Their children need to go to school and be well educated in order to be well off in life. They need houses of their own. These workers who are still in service are part of the larger society who read, see and watch on the pages of newspapers and in television respectively news of pensioners dying on the queue while waiting to be screened for payment of gratuity and pension; of other retirees waiting for over two years for their pension and gratuity to be processed; fraud by government officials and pension administrators; Pensioners being owed over two years of pension arrears and pensioners threats of committing suicide. Post-Retirement Life Styles A case in point is the recent threat by Mr. Amadi Dennis, who retired from Edo State Civil Service, who threatened to commit suicide on the 14th of February, 2014 because of government refusal to pay his gratuity and pension. He rescinded his ‘valentine gift’ to all Nigerians following plea from eminent Nigerians and friends. Obviously, these are enough to cause retirement anxiety among workers.Post-Retirement Life Styles</p> <p>The causes of retirement anxiety among workers therefore, are irregular payment of pension and gratuity, lack of faith in the ability to survive because of what befell other retirees in the past, lack of planning for retirement on the part of workers, lack of business skills and vocational expertise, lack of personal development, lack of funds to venture into business before and after retirement; unnecessary delay in processing pension claims (Brandon 2011). In order to overcome the anxiety, workers device means to continually remain in the service or work even in retirement (Brandon, 2011). Post-Retirement Life Styles This seems to be the reason for falsification of records and age by workers in a bid to remain in service even after attaining the retirement age. Little wonder then why septuagenarians and octogenarians are still in the public and private services when they are supposed to be enjoying their retirements.Post-Retirement Life Styles</p> <p>The actions and inactions of government and other retirement service administrators on one hand, and the situation faced by workers on the other hand are obviously anxiety provoking, especially to workers who are yet to retire or be retired. There is therefore the need to examine retirement anxiety in all ramifications and proffer counselling interventions for  managing retirement anxiety among workers. In doing this, the paper focuses on the concept of retirement anxiety, nature, causes and effects of retirement anxiety on workers, and counselling interventions for managing retirement anxiety among workers.Post-Retirement Life Styles.</p>                                                         \n\n POST-RETIREMENT LIFE STYLES OF SOME NIGERIANS AND THE COUNSELLING IMPLICATIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  POST-RETIREMENT LIFE STYLES OF SOME NIGERIANS AND THE COUNSELLING IMPLICATIONS", "id": 69}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p>This study investigated the counselling needs of widows in Rivers State implication for study. The sample of this study consisted of 2000 widows from Rivers State. These widows were drawn using the purposive sampling technique. The instrument used for the data collection was a self made questionnaire-widows needs assessment questionnaire (WNAQ). This was validated and its reliability coefficient was 0.84 and 66 respectively. The WNAQ sought information on widows counselling needs based on their age, family size, size of children and socio-economic background. Each item had 4 point likerf scale set against it. Gender Inequality</p> <p>The response options ranged from strongly needed to needed. Each subject was required to indicate the extent to which widows needed guidance or not. Two hypotheses were formulated for the study. T-test statistics was used to test the hypotheses respectively. It was found that widows needed counselling services irrespective of their age and family size respectively. There is no significant difference between this counselling need of young widows and their elderly ones. There is no significant difference between the counselling needs of the widows with large families and those with small family size. On the basis of these findings, it was recommended that Government should design all human rights programme with a gender component to automatically include an assessment of the widow’s situation and their access to economic and social rights.Gender Inequality</p> <p>The widows should be of height priority and finally programmes for the widows’ empowerment are necessary if their rehabilitation is to be achieved. Introduction Recently, Nigerians have seen the need for counselling  services as a panacea for varieties of developmental tasks. Okeke (2003:105) sees it as a dynamic instrument for changes and a tool for national growth and development.Gender Inequality Supporting the above view, Briggs (2005) observed that from a narrow perspective, counselling services are perceived as accomplishment that one acquires in schools, colleges or from private individuals instructors. UNESCO (2004) report signaled that the need and demand for counseling services are assumed to be enormous and will continue to expand. Although, they are difficult to measure.Gender Inequality</p> <p>The report points to key indicators such as urban population growth increase in the number of working authors, demographic changes and the education profile of the country. A widow is a woman who has lost her husband through death and usually she feels an ominous ring of finality and heartrending grief which is almost incomparable in any other type. This situation is unalike a perceived of a husband louse through divorce, separation, or abandonment or rejection in which they can still meet though not on good terms.Gender Inequality</p> <p>In Nigeria, when a woman loses her husband, the relatives of the husband deny her the inheritance she should have gotten from the late husband. She is accused of having a hand in the death of her husband and made to pass through agonizing rituals to prove her innocence. The prevailing attitude suggests that a widow cannot own property in her own right. In such situations, widows tend to suffer a lot at the loss of a partner, and this has socio-economic and health implications for the widows. They are at tremendous risk of physical and several abuse. This tragedy is magnified in Africa by HIV/AIDS especially if their late husband had died of HIV/AIDS and infected them with the disease.Gender Inequality.</p>                                                           \n\n GENDER INEQUALITY AND THE STATUS OF WIDOWS IN NIGERIA: IMPLICATIONS FOR COUNSELLING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  GENDER INEQUALITY AND THE STATUS OF WIDOWS IN NIGERIA: IMPLICATIONS FOR COUNSELLING", "id": 70}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study was designed to investigate if parents and peer groups of school students have any influence in the choice of a career among secondary school students. The relationship between the two primary factors (parental and peer group influence) and career choice was determined using Pearson product moment correlation coefficient. One research question and one hypothesis were formulated to guide the study.Vocational Choice</p> <p>Three research instruments were used. They are: the students occupational clusters preference scale (OCPS), peer pressure assessment scale (PPAS) and the parental influence assessment inventory (PIA). The population of the study comprises students in senior secondary school two (SS2). Result showed that there was no significant relationship between parental and peer group influence on career choice in humanities among secondary school students. It is recommended that counselors should work directly with parents and peers, especially as regards career development with a view to enhancing the positive aspects; this may eventually improve the career development prospects of our future workers.Vocational Choice.</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>In recent times, there has been growing interest in the interrelationships between career choice, peer group and parental influence. More importantly the focus has been on the factors that tend to move an individual towards a career. The achievement of children as they grow up has always been a matter of intense interest to parents. The young adolescent in school is expected to set high aspirations for him or herself and to work towards the achievement of those goals. Moreover, children are made to become aware of the prestige that goes along with successful career choice. Vocational Choice</p> <p>Education, economic incentives, peer group influence and parental influence are sometimes used as pressures to induce the young adolescent into predetermined careers, regardless of the potentials, actual needs and ego of the child. The glamour associated with some careers often turn out to be an illusion. Empirical findings have confirmed to a greater extent, the impact of the family in which a person lives and the family goals and objectives on his/ her choice of career. Trost and Levin (2000) opined that the family influences the behaviour or character of a child. Tella (2003) also found that parents play an invaluable role in laying the foundation of their children’s career. In the same light Wikelund (2006), pointed out that the more intensively parents are involved in their children’s learning, the more beneficial are the achievement effects.Vocational Choice</p> <p>Thus it is assumed that when parents monitor homework, encourage participation in extra curricula activities, are active in parent’s teachers’ associations and help children develop plans for their future, such children are likely to respond positively in academic activities. Alika and Egbochuku (2009) found that parental influence exerts a lot of influence on the educational attainment of the adolescent especially the socio-economic status of parents.Vocational Choice.</p>                                                           \n\nA STUDY OF THE DETERMINANTS OF VOCATIONAL CHOICE AMONG SENIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A STUDY OF THE DETERMINANTS OF VOCATIONAL CHOICE AMONG SENIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS", "id": 71}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>A help seeking survey and measures of socioeconomic status, cultural mistrust, and African Self-consciousness were administered to 315 black college students to study attitudes toward counseling and counselor preference.

A large sample of high school students (n = 3,999) was examined by self-report survey with 153 questions concerning demographic characteristics, stealing behaviors, other health behaviors including substance use, and functioning variables, such as grades and violent behavior. The overall prevalence of stealing was 15.2 percent (95% confidence interval (CI), 14.8–17.0). Twenty-nine (0.72%) students endorsed symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of DSM-IV-TR kleptomania. Poor grades, alcohol and drug use, regular smoking, sadness and hopelessness, and other antisocial behaviors were all significantly (p &lt; .05) associated with any stealing behavior. Stealing appears to be fairly common among high school students and is associated with a range of potentially addictive and antisocial behaviors. Significant distress and loss of control over this behavior suggest that stealing often has significant associated morbidity.</p> <p>The lifetime prevalence of stealing appears fairly high. A recent, large epidemiological study of adults found that 11.3 percent of the general population admitted to having shoplifted in their lifetimes.1 This finding is consistent with estimates by the National Association of Shoplifting Prevention that 1 (9.1%) in 11 people has shoplifted during his lifetime.2 Stealing in adults has been associated with other antisocial behaviors, psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., substance use disorders, pathological gambling, and bipolar disorder), and impaired psychosocial functioning.1 Stealing appears to start generally in childhood or adolescence, with approximately 66 percent of individuals reporting lifetime stealing beginning before they were 15 years of age.1</p> <p>Despite the early age at onset of stealing, as well as the significant adult morbidity associated with this behavior, stealing among adolescents has historically received relatively little attention from clinicians and researchers. Limited research suggests that adolescents who steal have impairments in problem-solving skills and a cognitive bias toward inappropriate solutions to problems.3 Other research suggests that parent-child difficulties, school failure, and negative peer influences underlie adolescent stealing.4</p> <p>Although stealing may be fairly common, it is unclear how many adolescents who steal have kleptomania. Kleptomania, characterized by a diminished ability to resist recurrent impulses to steal objects that are not needed for their monetary or personal use, has been relatively understudied across the lifespan and particularly in adolescents with propensities for stealing.5 In the present study, we assessed a large sample of public high school students regarding stealing behavior. Although previous research suggests that stealing and antisocial behaviors are linked,1,6 no study has systematically examined the relationship of stealing with a range of behaviors and health functioning. Given the incomplete data on the co-occurrence of stealing and other variables among young people, the purpose of this study was to fill these gaps in knowledge. Specifically, we sought to examine the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of different severity levels of stealing in adolescents, to investigate health correlates in high school students who steal, and to examine the different severity levels and clinical characteristics of stealing and determine differences in students whose stealing merits a diagnosis of kleptomania. Recognizing possible differences in stealing severity among adolescents may have clinical and health implications. It is also important to recognize associations between stealing and health variables, as identifying and treating the stealing behavior may significantly improve the prognosis of other behaviors.</p> <p>Methods</p> <p>Study Procedures and Sampling</p> <p>The study procedure has been published in detail.7 In summary, the study team mailed invitation letters to all public four-year and nonvocational or special education high schools in the state of Connecticut. These letters were followed by phone calls to all principals of schools receiving a letter to assess the school’s interest in participating in the survey. To encourage participation, we offered all schools a report after data collection that outlined the prevalence of stealing and other health-related behaviors in that school. Schools that expressed an interest were contacted to begin the process of obtaining permission from school boards and/or school system superintendents, if approval was needed.</p> <p>In addition, targeted contacts were made to schools that were in geographically underrepresented areas, to ensure that the sample was representative of the state. The final survey therefore contains schools from each geographical region of the state of Connecticut, and it contains schools from each of the three tiers of the state’s district reference groups (DRGs; i.e., groupings of schools based on the socioeconomic status of the families in the school district). Sampling from each of the three tiers of the DRGs was intended to create a more socioeconomically representative sample. Although this was not a random sample of public high school students in Connecticut, the sample obtained is similar in demographics to the sample of Connecticut residents enumerated in the 2000 census, ages 14 to 18.8</p> <p>Once permission was obtained from the necessary parties in each school, letters were sent through the school to parents informing them about the study and outlining the procedure by which they could deny permission for their child to participate in the survey if they wished. In most cases, parents were instructed to call the main office of their child’s high school to deny permission for their child’s participation. From these phone calls, a list of students who were not eligible to participate was compiled for reference on the survey administration day. If no message was received from a parent, parental permission was assumed. These procedures were approved by all participating schools and by the Institutional Review Board of the Yale University School of Medicine.</p> <p>In most cases, the entire student body was targeted for administration of the survey. Some schools conducted an assembly where surveys were administered, while others had students complete the survey in every health or English class throughout the day. In each case, the school was visited on a single day by members of the research staff who explained the study, distributed the surveys, answered questions, and collected the surveys.</p> <p>Students were told that participation was voluntary and that they could refuse to complete the survey if they wished and were also reminded to keep the surveys anonymous by not writing their name or other identifying information anywhere on the survey. Each student was given a pen for participating. Students who were not eligible to participate because a parent had denied permission or who personally declined to participate were allowed to work on schoolwork while the other students completed the survey. The refusal rate was under one percent.</p> <p>Measures</p> <p>The survey consisted of 153 questions concerning demographic characteristics, stealing behavior, other health behaviors including substance use, and functioning variables such as grades and violent behavior.</p> <p>Stealing behavior was assessed by asking how many times the person stole from stores or people in a typical week. Possible answers to this were: never, fewer than 7 times, 7 to 14 times, 15 to 20 times, and 21 or more times. Those who reported any stealing were then asked six additional questions:</p> <p>Have you ever tried to cut back on stealing things?</p> <p>Has a family member ever expressed concern about the amount of time you spend stealing things?</p> <p>Have you ever missed school, work, or other important social activities because you were stealing?</p> <p>Do you think you have a problem with excessive stealing?</p> <p>Have you ever experienced an irresistible urge or uncontrollable need to steal things?</p> <p>Have you ever experienced a growing tension or anxiety that can only be relieved by stealing?</p> <p>Three of the questions are based on the Minnesota Impulse Disorders Interview, a valid and reliable screen for adolescent kleptomania,9 and reflect Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for kleptomania. Trying to cut back on stealing and an irresistible urge to steal reflect Criterion A; growing tension or anxiety that is relieved only by stealing mirrors both Criteria B and C.5 Therefore, students who endorsed all three of these questions were placed in the kleptomania group, while other respondents who reported stealing but did not endorse all three symptoms were placed in the nonkleptomania stealing group.</p> <p>Demographics included gender, race, Hispanic ethnicity, grade, and family structure (live with one or two parents or some other configuration). Health and functioning variables included grade average (A or B, C, and D or F); extracurricular activities (including employment); tobacco use (never, once or twice, occasionally but not regularly, regularly in the past, or regularly now); lifetime marijuana use (any use in the past 30 days); alcohol frequency (none, light (1–5 days), moderate (6–19 days), or heavy (20 days or more)); lifetime use of other drugs (any or none); current caffeine use (none, 1–2 drinks per day, 3 or more drinks per day); a two-week period of feeling sad or hopeless and losing interest in usual activities (assessing for depression symptomatology) in the past 12 months; a history in the past 12 months of getting into a fight requiring medical attention; and a report within the past 12 months of carrying a weapon of any kind to school.</p> <p>Data Analysis</p> <p>Data were double-entered from the paper surveys into an electronic database. Random spot checks of completed surveys and data-cleaning procedures were performed, to ensure that the data were accurate and not out of range.</p> <p>Distribution characteristics of all variables were examined. Only participants with complete data on the dependent variable were included in the analyses. Baseline demographic data were evaluated for differences between those with complete data and those without complete data, using t tests for parametric data and Mann-Whitney U tests for nonparametric data. Participants were divided into three groups: no stealing, nonkleptomania stealing, and kleptomania. Differences between the three groups were examined using Pearson’s chi-square. All comparison tests were two-tailed.</p> <p>Multivariate analyses were conducted by using multinomial logistic regression models with the three-group stealing variable as the dependent variable. The three groups were compared using odds ratios from these models, adjusting for demographic characteristics found to distinguish the three groups in bivariate analyses. Because all pairwise comparisons of three groups were performed, p values were corrected to .02 to allow for multiple comparisons.</p>                                                          \n\nSTEALING AMONG STUDENTS: CAUSES AND REMEDIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STEALING AMONG STUDENTS: CAUSES AND REMEDIES", "id": 73}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE EXAMINATION OF PARENTAL ROLE IN CURBING SUICIDAL ACTIONS IN NIGERIAN TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS</strong></p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <ol><li><ol><li> <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> </li> </ol></li></ol> <p> Few suicides or suicide attempts take place in schools. But the suicide of a student— even if it takes place off campus—will reverberate through a school, causing extreme emotional distress among students, staff, and parents; disrupting normal activities for weeks; and, in rare cases, provoking “copycat” suicides by emotionally vulnerable children. At the same time, schools represent an important opportunity for preventing these tragedies. </p> <p>Suicide is the third leading cause of death in developing countries, for young people between 10 and 19 years of age. In the United States of America Every year, about 125,000 young people are treated in emergency rooms for injuries sustained during suicide attempts. And every year, about 4,000 young people take their own lives (CDC, 2004). Additional young people are treated by family doctors—or not treated at all—for self-inflicted injuries. A still larger group of young people exhibit signs that they are at-risk for suicide. Suicide among children under the age of 14 is rare. Suicide by children under the age of 9 is extremely rare (CDC, 2003b). </p> <p>Many young people who attempt suicide are afflicted by depression or other mood disorders or substance abuse (which itself can be related to depression). Other emotional problems linked to suicide include conduct disorders (especially aggressive behavior), borderline personality disorder, and high levels of hopelessness (Berman, Jobes, and Silverman, 2006). Suicide among younger children is related to depression and other serious psychiatric problems as well as feelings of “expendability”— an exaggerated sense of guilt for family problems combined with low self-esteem (Pfiefer, 2000). It is important to remember that although most young people who commit suicide are affected by mental disorders, only a relatively small proportion of young people troubled by such problems try to take their own lives. In Nigeria we have recorded our own cases of suicide and even though is a tabbo in so many parts of the country, today youths see it as a way to be free from their emotional distresses and sufferings.</p> <p>The role of parental guidance and counselling (G/C) services among youths cannot be overemphasized. Parents have always played a leading role in terms of child‘s development and improvement. For this reason, Parent child relationships are sine qua non to child‘s development. Okobiah and Okorodudu (2006) highlighted that Guidance and Counselling is encompassed by activities of relevant services and also processes of helping persons within and outside the school, to achieve their full potentialities in their emotional, moral, social, academic and vocational developments. Esen (1998) says that guidance and counselling is aimed primarily at assisting the receiver to discover his own hidden strengths and ultimately grow in independence and ability to take his own decisions, make choices or adjustments unaided. </p> <p>People Suicide attempts rarely occur without some warning. Teachers and other professionals who see young people on a daily basis are in a unique position to distinguish \"normal\" adolescent behavior from hints that something is wrong. It is not always possible to tell exactly what is troubling a student and where these troubles may lead. But indications that a young person is in emotional difficulty demand action. School staff cannot assume that a young person’s family especially parents will take positive steps to respond to these problems. Schools may be the last positive social connections for students from dysfunctional families. This project looks critically at the role of parents in curbing suicidal actions in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the problem </strong></p> <p>Recent events in Nigerian society regarding different cases of youth suicide have drawn the attention of government agencies, NGOs, international agencies and society in general to the sad truth that young people no longer receive all the information they need. Support they need emotionally and especially psychologically.</p> <p>Because each individual is unique, there is no single reason for someone to have suicidal thoughts or attempt suicide. Factors that may contribute to having suicidal thoughts are:</p> <ul><li> <p>A major life transition that is very upsetting or disappointing</p> </li> <li> <p>A loss of an important relationship or the death of a loved one</p> </li> <li> <p>Depression, anxiety or other serious emotional troubles</p> </li> <li> <p>Feelings of hopelessness or despair</p> </li> <li> <p>Low self-esteem or shame</p> </li> <li> <p>Failure to live up to one's own or others' expectations</p> </li> <li> <p>Extreme loneliness</p> </li> <li> <p>News of a major medical illness</p> </li> <li> <p>Severe physical or emotional pain</p> </li> <li> <p>Alcohol or drug problems</p> </li> </ul> <p>Parental care, guidance and counseling amongst youths today can aid in the prevention of suicide cases in Nigeria. It is believed that when we talk to people who are depressed and give them all the adequate support then these cases of suicide that is on the rise will gradually become a thing of the past.</p> <p>It is in the light of this that this study seeks to find out parental role in curbing suicidal actions in Nigeria. </p> <p><strong>1.3 Purpose of the study </strong></p> <p>The main purpose of this study was to examine parental role in curbing suicidal actions in tertiary institutes in Nigeria. The specific objectives are to;</p> <ol><li> <p>Have a general overview on the parental role on youth development.</p> </li> <li> <p>Determine how parental guidance and counseling can help to prevent suicide in Nigeria.</p> </li> <li> <p>Identify challenges that deter the effectiveness of parental guidance and counseling services among youths in Nigeria.</p> </li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4 Significance of the study </strong></p> <p>Suicide is a serious issue that many people prefer not to discuss, but it is something that affects many people at some point in their life. Suicide can be a very difficult thing to understand. If someone you know may be suicidal, it’s important to recognize the signs beforehand so they can get the help and counseling they need. With proper education, everyone can be made more aware of the possible risks for suicide as well as the underlying causes. There are many different reasons someone may want to commit suicide, and in many cases, they can be saved if they get the help they need in time.</p> <p><strong>1.5   Scope and delimitation of the study</strong></p> <p>The scope of this study is focused on examining parental role in curbing suicidal actions in tertiary institutes in Nigeria.</p> <p>The researcher encountered some constraints, which limited the scope of the study.
