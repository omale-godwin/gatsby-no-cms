[{"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>1.0 INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Nanoscience has been the subject of substantial research in recent years. It has been explored by researchers in various fields of science and technology (Kholoud et al. 2010). The novel properties of NPs have been exploited in a wide range of potential applications such as in medicine, cosmetics, renewable energies, environmental remediation, biomedical devices (Quang Huy, 2013), electronics, optics, organic catalysis, vector control, sensor, etc., have drawn extensive attention to this field of study (Mousavand et al. 2007). Among the metals, silver nanoparticles have shown potential applications in various fields such as the environment, bio-medicine, catalysis, optics and electronics (Rao et al., 2000). Silver nanoparticles are mostly smaller than 100 nm and consist about 20–15,000 silver atoms. In its nanoscale form, silver exhibits unique physicochemical and biological activities. This has made them useful as sensor, vector control, antimicrobial, anticancer, and antiplasmodial agents, catalysts, among others (Elemike et al. 2014; Vinod et al. 2014; Kathiravan et al. 2014; Saraschandra and Sivakumar 2014; Namita and Soam 2014).</p> <p>Concerted effort has been made to synthesize diverse range of silver nanoparticles varying in size, geometry, and morphology because of their potential applications, particularly in electronics (P. V. Kamat, 2002), electrochemical sensing (L. M. Liz-Marzán, 2006), catalysis (F. Zhang, Y. Pi et al., 2007), and antimicrobial properties (T. Sakai et al., 2006). The size, geometry, dispersion and stability often determine the suitability of the nanoparticles for certain applications. Synthesis may involve physical means such as ultraviolet light, microwaves, photo-reduction, or chemical reduction using hydrazine, ascorbic acid, sodium borohydride, glucose, and organic stabilizers or biological means using plant extract, microorganism or plant sap. Several physical and chemical methods have been used to synthesize and stabilize silver nanoparticles (Senapati et al., 2005, Klaus-Joerger et al., 2001). The most popular chemical approaches, including chemical reduction using a variety of organic and inorganic reducing agents, electrochemical techniques, physicochemical reduction, and radiolysis are widely used for the synthesis of nanoparticles.</p> <p>Although these means are fast and easy, they are either expensive or toxic particularly the chemical method and may lead to non eco-friendly byproducts thus the need for environmental, nontoxic synthetic protocols for nanoparticles synthesis. In the global efforts to reduce generated hazardous waste, “green” chemistry and chemical processes are progressively integrating with modern development in science and industry (Sharma et al., 2009) leading to the developing interest in biological approaches which are free from the use of toxic chemicals as by products. Biological methods can be used to synthesize nanoparticles without the use of any harsh, toxic and expensive chemical substances. The bioreduction of metal ions by combinations of biomolecules found in the extracts of certain organisms (e.g., enzymes/proteins, yeast, fungi, bacteria and plants) is environmentally benign, yet chemically complex (Ankamwar et al., 2005). It has been elucidated that biomolecules with carbonyl, hydroxyl, and amine functional groups have the potential for metal ion reduction and capping of the newly formed particles during their growth processes (Harekrishna et al., 2009, He et al., 2007). Biomolecules in plants and spices extract are essential oils (terpenes, eugenols, e.t.c.), polyphenols, carbohydrates, e.t.c. and can reduce and stabilize Ag+ to Ag0. It provides advancement over chemical and physical methods as it is cost effective and environment friendly.</p> <p>1.1 LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>Disease-causing microbes are becoming resistant to drug therapy and therefore poses great public health problem. Many researchers are now engaged in developing new effective antimicrobial reagents with the emergence and increase of microbial organisms resistant to multiple antibiotics, which will increase the cost of health care. Colloidal silver has been known for a long time to possess antimicrobial properties and also to be non-toxic and environmentally friendly. It has been used for years in the medical field for antimicrobial applications such as burn treatment (Parikh et al. 2005; Ulkur et al 2005), elimination of microorganisms on textile fabrics (Jeong et al. 2005; Lee et al. 2007; Yuranova et al. 2003), disinfection in water treatment (Russell and Hugo 1994; Chou et al. 2005), prevention of bacteria colonization on catheters (Samuel and Guggenbichler 2004; Alt et al. 2004; Rupp et al. 2004), etc. It has also been found to prevent HIV from binding to host cells (Sun et al. 2005). The mechanism of the bacterial effect of AgNP as proposed is due to the attachment of AgNPs to the surface of the cell membrane, thus disrupting permeability and respiration functions of the cell (Kevitec et al. 2008). It is also proposed that AgNPs not only interact with the surface of a membrane but can also penetrate inside the bacteria (Morones et al. 2005), but the effects of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) on microorganisms have not been developed fully. Researchers believe that the potential of colloidal silver is just beginning to be discovered (Dorjnamjin et al., 2008).</p> <p>1.2 Nanotechnology</p> <p>Nanoparticles are viewed as the fundamental building blocks of nanotechnology (Mansoori et al., 2005). They are the starting points for preparing many nanostructured materials and devices and their synthesis is an important component of the rapidly growing research efforts in nanoscience and nanoengineering (Mansoori et al., 2007).</p> <p>In nanotechnology, a nanoparticle is defined as a small object that behaves as a whole unit in terms of its transport and properties. Nanoparticles can equally be called ultrafine particles since their sizes range from 1 to 100 nm. Fine particles ranges from 100 to 2,500 nm, while coarse particles are sized between 2,500 and 10,000 nm (Williams, 2008). A nanometer is one billionth of a meter (10-9 m), roughly the width of three or four atoms, smaller than the wavelength of visible light and a hundred-thousand the width of human hair.</p> <p>Nanoparticles can be made of materials of diverse chemical nature, the most common being metals, metal oxides, silicates, non-oxide ceramics, polymers, organics, carbon and biomolecules. Nanoparticles exist in several different morphologies such as spheres, cylinders, platelets, tubes, flowers, cubes etc. They possess unique physiochemical, optical and biological properties which can be manipulated to suit a desired application. Nanoparticles are of great interest due to their externally small size, and large surface to volume ratio. They exihibit utterly novel characteristics compared to the large particles of the bulk material and have been included in fields of science as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry molecular biology, semi conductor physics, microfabrication, material science, inorganic chemistry and so on.</p> <p>The concepts that seeded nanotechnology were first discussed in 1959 by renowned physicist Richard Feynman in his talk “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom”, in which he described the possibility of synthesis via direct manipulation of atoms. In 1974, “Norio Taniguchi now used the word nanotechnology to describe precision manufacturing materials at the nanometer level which refers to the synthesis, manipulation, and control of matter at nano dimensions that will make most products lighter, stronger, cleaner, less expensive and more precise.</p> <p>1.3 Physiochemical Properties of Nanoparticles</p> <p>Nanoparticles also often possess unexpected optical properties as they are small enough confine their electrons and produce quantum effects e.g. gold nanoparticles appear deep red in dark solutions.</p> <p>A unique property among nanoparticles is quantum confinement in semiconductor particles, surface plasmon resonance in some metal particles and super paramagnetism in magnetic materials. For example, ferroelectric materials smaller than 10 nm can switch their magnetization direction using room temperature thermal energy. Thus this property is not always desired in nanoparticles thus making them unsuitable for memory storage.</p> <p>Suspensions of nanoparticles are possible since the interaction of the particle surface with the solvent is strong enough to overcome density differences, which otherwise usually result in a material either sinking or floating in a liquid.</p> <p>The high surface area to volume ratio of nanoparticles provides a tremendous driving force for diffusion, especially at elevated temperatures. Sintering can take place at lower temperatures, over shorter time scales than for larger particles.</p> <p>1.4 Methods of Nanoparticles Synthesis</p> <p>Currently, many methods have been reported for the synthesis of nanoparticles which include chemical, physical, biological and photo-induced approach.</p> <p>1.4.1 Chemical Approach:</p> <p>The chemical approach is the most used method since it for provides an easy way to synthesize nanoparticles in solution. This consists of the chemical reduction of a metal salt in solution followed by the crystallization of zero-valence metal particles. The particle synthesis is usually conducted in the presence of a stabilizing agent that prevents excessive molecular growth and/or aggregation of the metal nanoparticles. Hence when nanoparticles are produced by chemical synthesis, three main components are needed: a salt (e.g. AgNO3), a reducing agent (e.g. ethylene glycol) and a stabilizer agent (e.g. PVP) to control the growth of the nanoparticles and prevent them from aggregating.</p> <p>In one study, Oliveira and coworkers (2005) prepared dodecanethiol-capped silver NPs, according to Brust procedure (Brust et al., 2002) based on a phase transfer of an Au3+ complex from aqueous to organic phase in a two-phase liquid-liquid system, which was followed by a reduction with sodium borohydride in the presence of dodecanethiol as stabilizing agent, binding onto the NPs surfaces, avoiding their aggregation and making them soluble in certain solvents. They reported that small changes in synthetic factors lead to dramatic modifications in nanoparticle structure, average size, size distribution width, stability and self-assembly patterns.</p> <p>1.4.2 Physical Approach:</p> <p>In physical processes, nanoparticles are synthesized by evaporation-condensation, exploding wire technique, chemical vapour deposition, microwave irradiation, pulsed laser ablation, supercritical fluids, sonochemical reduction, and gamma radiation with evaporation-condensation and laser ablation being the most important physical approaches. The absence of solvent contamination in the prepared thin films and the uniformity of NPs distribution are the advantages of physical synthesis methods in comparison with chemical processes.</p> <p>Siegel and colleagues (2012) demonstrated the synthesis of AgNPs by direct metal sputtering into the liquid medium. The method, combining physical deposition of metal into propane-1, 2, 3-triol (glycerol), provides an interesting alternative to time-consuming, wet-based chemical synthesis techniques. Silver NPs possess round shape with average diameter of about 3.5 nm with standard deviation 2.4 nm. It was observed that the NPs size distribution and uniform particle dispersion remains unchanged for diluted aqueous solutions up to glycerol-to-water ratio 1 : 20.</p> <p>1.4.3 Biological Approach:</p> <p>As stated earlier in the chemical method of synthesis, three main components are needed: a salt (e.g. AgNO3), a reducing agent (e.g. ethylene glycol) and a stabilizer agent (e.g. PVP) to control the growth of the nanoparticles and prevent them from aggregating. In biological synthesis of nanoparticles, the reducing agent and the stabilizer are replaced by molecules produced by living organisms. These reducing and/or stabilizing compounds can be utilized from bacteria, fungi, yeasts, algae or plants.</p> <p>The development of efficient green chemistry methods for synthesis of nanoparticles has become a major focus of researchers. In the global effort to reduce generated waste and toxic materials, “green” chemistry and chemical processes are progressively integrating with modern developments in science and industry. They have investigated in order to find an eco-friendly technique for production of well-characterized nanoparticles. Various approaches using plant extracts have been used for the synthesis of nanoparticles. These approaches have many advantages over chemical, physical, and microbial synthesis because there is no need of the elaborate process of culturing and maintaining the cell, using hazardous chemicals, high-energy and wasteful purifications.</p> <p>The first successfully reported synthesis of nanoparticles assisted by living plants appeared in 2002 when it was shown that gold nanoparticles, ranging in size from 2-20 nm, could form inside alfalfa seedlings. Subsequently it was shown that alfalfa could form silver nanoparticles when exposed to a silver rich medium. Other works on plants and plant parts that have been used for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles are Thevetia peruviana latex (Rupiasih et al. 2013), Wrightia tinctoria (Bharani et al. 2011), Solanum xanthocarpum (Muhammad et al. 2012), Opuntia ficus (Silva-de-Hoyos et al. 2012), Sphaeranthus amaranthoides (Swarnalatha et al. 2012), Punica granatum (Naheed et al. 2012) Citrullus colocynthis (Satyavani et al. 2011), Eucalyptus chapmaniana (Ghassan et al. 2013), Acacia auriculiformis (Nalawade et al. 2014), Ficus benghalensis, Azadirachta indica (Debasis et al. 2015), e.t.c.</p> <p>The biomolecules present in these plants are responsible for the formation and stabilization of silver nanoparticles (Iravani et al. 2014). Nanoparticles produced by plants are more stable and the rate of synthesis is faster than in the case of microorganisms. Moreover, this method is simple, cost effective, energy-saving and reproducible. The nanoparticles are more various in shape and size in comparison with those produced by other organisms. The advantages of using plant and plant-derived materials for biosynthesis of metal nanoparticles have interested researchers to investigate mechanisms of metal ions uptake and bioreduction by plants, and to understand the possible mechanism of metal nanoparticle formation in plants.</p> <p>1.4.4 Photo-induced Approach:</p> <p>The photo-induced synthetic strategies can be categorized into two distinct approaches, that is the photo-physical (top down) and photochemical (bottom up) ones. The former could prepare the NPs via the subdivision of bulk metals and the latter generates the NPs from ionic precursors. The NPs are formed by the direct photo-reduction of a metal source or reduction of metal ions using photo-chemically generated intermediates, such as excited molecules and radicals which are known as photosensitization in the synthesis of NPs.</p> <p>Huang and coworkers (2008) reported the synthesis of silver NPs in an alkaline aqueous solution of AgNO3/carboxymethylated chitosan (CMCTS) using UV light irradiation. CMCTS, a watersoluble and biocompatible chitosan derivative, served simultaneously as a reducing agent for silver cation and a stabilizing agent for the silver NPs. The diameter range of produced silver NPs was 2–8 nm, and they can be dispersed stably in the alkaline CMCTS solution for more than 6 months</p> <p>The main advantages of the photochemical synthesis are;</p> <p>It is a clean process, with high spatial resolution, and convenience of use.</p> <p>It has great versatility; the photochemical synthesis enables one to fabricate the NPs in various mediums including emulsion, surfactant micelles, polymer films, glasses, cells, etc.</p> <p>1.5 Applications of Nanoparticles</p> <p>There is wide applicability of nanoparticles due to their interesting optical, conductive, physio-chemical, electronic, antimicrobial properties.</p> <p>1.5.1 Medical and Pharmaceutical Applications</p> <p>Nanoparticles can be made to control and sustain release of the drug during the transportation and as well as the location of the release since the distribution and subsequent clearance of the drug from the body can be altered. An increase in the therapeutic efficacy and reduction in the side effects can also be achieved. Targeted drugs may be developed.</p> <p>The surface change of protein filled nanoparticles has been shown to affect the ability of the nanoparticles to stimulate immune responses. Researchers are thinking that these nanoparticles may be used in inhalable vaccines. Researchers are developing ways to use carbon nanoparticles called nanodiamonds in medical applications. For example, nanodiamonds with protein molecules attached can be used to increase bone growth around dental or joint implants.</p> <p>Other medical and pharmaceutical applications include; tissue engineering, bio detection of pathogens, tumour destruction via heating (hyperthermia), drug and gene delivery, separation and purification of biological molecules and cells.</p> <p>1.5.2 Biosensing</p> <p>A biosensor is an analytical device used for the detection of an analyte, which combines a biological component with a physicochemical detector (Florinel-Gabriel, 2012). The sensitive biological element can be tissues, microorganisms, organelles, cell receptors, enzymes, antibodies, nucleic acids, e.t.c. or a biologically derived material or biomimetic component that interacts, binds or recognizes the analyte under study. Nanomaterials are exquisitely sensitive chemical and biological sensors. Their large surface area to volume ratio can achieve rapid and low cost reactions, using a variety of designs (Gerald, 2009).</p> <p>Biosensing can have the following applications;</p> <p>Environmental applications e.g. the detection of pesticides and river water contaminants such as heavy metal ions.<br/>Determining the presence of pathogen and food toxins in food analysis.<br/>Determining levels of toxic substances before and after bioremediation.<br/>Determination of drug residues in food, such as antibiotics and growth promoters.<br/>Drug discovery and evaluation of biological activity of new compounds.<br/>1.5.3 Optical Applications</p> <p>The optical properties of noble metals nanoparticles have been of great interest because of many applications in optical devices (optical limiters, solar cells, medicals imaging, surface enhanced spectroscopy, surface plasmonic devices) and bio-applications (Haglund et al. 1993).AFANG LEAF EXTRACT</p> <p>1.5.4 Optoelectronics</p> <p>Optoelectronics is the study and application of electronic devices that source, detect and control light. The light includes invisible forms of radiation such as gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet and infrared, in addition to visible light. Optoelectronic devices are electrical-to-optical or optical-to-electrical transducers, or instruments that use such devices in their operation. It can function as an emitter of optical radiation, such as a light-emitting diode (LED), or as a photovoltaic (PV) device that can be used to convert optical radiation into electrical current, such as a photovoltaic solar cell.AFANG LEAF EXTRACT</p> <p>In optoelectronics;</p> <p>Nanoparticles can be applied in the production of optocouplers, a component that transfers electrical signals between two isolated circuits by using light. They prevent high voltages from affecting the system receiving the signal.AFANG LEAF EXTRACT</p> <p>Nanoparticles are also applied in optical fibers which are used most to transmit light between the two ends of the fiber and find wide usage in fiber-optic communications. They are also used for illumination, and are wrapped in bundles so that they may be used to carry images, thus allowing viewing in confined spaces e.g. fiberscope.AFANG LEAF EXTRACT</p> <p>1.5.5 Energy and Electronic Applications</p> <p>Quantum Dots;</p> <p>A quantum dot (QD) is a nanocrystal made of semiconductor materials that is small enough to exhibit quantum mechanical properties. Specifically, its excitons are confined in all three spatial dimensions. The electronic properties of these materials are intermediate between those of bulk semiconductors and of discrete molecules (Brus, 2007, Norris, 1995, Murray et al., 2000).AFANG LEAF EXTRACT</p> <p>Quantum dots are applied in;</p> <p>In textile technology, various kinds of organic dyes are used but more flexibility is being required of these dyes, and the traditional dyes are often unable to meet the expectations (Walling et al., 2009). To this end, Quantum dots have quickly filled in the role, found to be superior to traditional organic dyes on several counts. One of the most immediately obvious being brightness (owing to the high extinction co-efficient combined with a comparable quantum yield to fluorescent dyes (Michalet et al., 2005) as well as their stability (allowing much less photobleaching).AFANG LEAF EXTRACT</p> <p>Also in biology, the usage of quantum dots for highly sensitive cellular imaging has seen major advances over the past decade (Spie., 2014). Another application that takes advantage of the extraordinary photostability of quantum dot probes is the real-time tracking of molecules and cells over extended periods of time (Dahan et al., 2003).AFANG LEAF EXTRACT</p> <p>In light emitting devices, because Quantum dots naturally produce monochromatic light; they can be more efficient than light sources which must be color filtered. They are used to improve existing light-emitting diode (LED) design.AFANG LEAF EXTRACT</p> <p>1.5.6 Antibacterial Applications</p> <p>Silver nanoparticles serves as an inorganic antibacterial powder and play a critical role in the suppression and killing of pathogenic microorganisms such as S. aureus, E. coli, etc. This innovative anti-infective products has broad spectrum, non-resistance, durable, has a non-oxidized appearance and is unaffected by pH effects. Ag-Nps are incorporated in apparel, foot wears, paints, wound dressings, appliances, cosmetics and plastics for their antibacterial properties. The colloidal silver is capable of disinfecting water through sterilization.AFANG LEAF EXTRACT</p> <p>1.5.7 Other Applications of Nanoparticles</p> <p>Generally, nanoparticles are used or being evaluated for use, in many fields. The list below introduces several of the other uses under development. They include;</p> <p>Applications in Manufacturing and Materials: Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles are commonly used in sunscreen, cosmetics and some food products while silver nanoparticles are used in food packaging, clothing, disinfectants and household appliances. Nano silver and carbon nanotubes are used for stain-resistant textiles; and cerium oxide as a fuel catalyst. Zinc oxides nanoparticles can be dispersed in industrial coating to prevent wood, plastic and textile from exposure to UV rays.AFANG LEAF EXTRACT</p> <p>Applications in Water Purification: Nanotechnology is also being applied to or developed for application to a variety of industrial purification processes. Purification and environmental cleanup applications include the desalination of water, water filtration, wastewater treatment, groundwater treatment, and other nanoremediation.AFANG LEAF EXTRACT</p> <p>Applications in the Environment: Researchers are using photocatalytic copper tungsten oxides nanoparticles to break down oil into biodegradable compounds. The nanoparticles are in a grid that provides high surface area for the reaction. It is activated by sunlight and can work in water, making them useful for cleaning up oil spills.AFANG LEAF EXTRACT</p> <p>1.6 Silver Metal</p> <p>Silver is a chemical element with symbol Ag (Latin name; argentum). It has its electronic configuration as [Kr] 4d10 5s1 (no. of electron per shell; 2, 8, 18, 18, 1) and has an atomic number 47. It is very ductile, malleable metal (slightly less so than gold), with a brilliant white metallic luster that can take a high degree of polish. The electrical conductivity of silver is the highest of all metals, even higher than copper. Pure silver has the highest thermal conductivity of any metal.AFANG LEAF EXTRACT</p> <p>The most common oxidation state of silver is +1 (e.g. silver nitrate, AgNO3), other oxidation states include; +2 compounds (e.g. silver (II) fluoride, AgF2), +3 (e.g. potassium tetrafluoroargentate (III), KAgF4) and even +4 compounds (e.g. potassium hexafluoroargentate (IV), K2AgF6) (Riedel et al., 2009).AFANG LEAF EXTRACT</p> <p>Silver is found in a native form as an alloy with gold (electrum), and in ores containing sulphur, arsenic, antimony or chlorine. Some ores include; argentite (Ag2S), chlorargyrite (AgCl) and pyrargyrite (Ag3SbS3). The metal is primarily produced as a byproduct of electrolytic copper refining, gold, nickel, and zinc refining. Naturally occurring silver is composed of two stable isotopes, 107 Ag and 109 Ag, with 107 Ag being slightly more abundant (51.8% natural abundance).AFANG LEAF EXTRACT</p> <p>1.6.1 Some Uses of Silver</p> <p>Silver is used to make solder and brazing alloys, and as a thin layer on bearing surfaces can provide a significant increase in resistance and reduce wear under heavy load, particularly against steel. It is used in photography, in the form of silver nitrate and silver halides, for the development of coloured films. Some electrical and electronic products use silver for its superior conductivity, even when tarnished. Small devices, such as hearing aids and watches, commonly use silver oxide batteries due to their long life and high energy-to-weight ratio. Silver, in the form of electrum (a gold–silver alloy), was coined to produce money. Silver coins and bullion are also used as an investment to guard against inflation and devaluation.AFANG LEAF EXTRACT</p> <p>Silver salts have been used since the middle ages to produce a yellow or orange color to stain glass. Using a process called sputtering, silver, along with other optically transparent layers, is applied to glass, creating low emissivity coatings used in high-performance insulated glazing. Silver can be alloyed with mercury at room temperature to make amalgams that are widely used for dental fillings. Silver and silver alloys are used in the construction of high-quality musical wind instruments of many types. Flutes, in particular, are commonly constructed of silver alloy or silver plated both for appearance and for the frictional surface properties of silver. Brass instruments, such as trumpets and baritones, are also commonly plated in silver.</p>\n\nANTIBACTERIAL EVALUATION OF AFANG LEAF EXTRACT AND IT'S SYNTHESIZED SILVER NANOPARTICLES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANTIBACTERIAL EVALUATION OF AFANG LEAF EXTRACT AND IT'S SYNTHESIZED SILVER NANOPARTICLES", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div>     <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p><br/>This study evaluated \"the effects of processing methods on the physico-chemical properties of sweet potato and sorghum flour\".

Sweet potatoes are rich in dietary fiber, minerals, vitamins, and anti oxidants such as phenolic acids, anthocyannins, tocopherol and β-carotene. The proximate composition of sweet potato was determined and these include moisture, lipids, ash, protein, carbohydrates and fiber. In carrying out the analysis practically, methods used vary according to the food material.

More than 35% of sorghum is grown for human consumption. The analyses carried out in sweet potatoes are same with sorghum with the exclusion of phenol oxidase.</p> <p><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) is an important food crop in the tropical and sub tropical countries and belongs to the family convolvulaceae. It is cultivated in more than 100 countries. ( Woolfe, 1992). Nigeria is the third largest producer in the world with china leading, followed by Uganda. Sweet potato ranks seventh among the world food crops, third in value of production and fifth in caloric contribution to human diet (Bouwkamp, 1985). Sweet potatoes are rich in dietary fibre, minerals, vitamins and anti oxidants such as phenolic acids, anthocyanins, tocopherol and ß- carotene. Besides acting as anti oxidants, carotenoids and phenolic compounds also provide sweet potatoes with their distinctive flesh colours ( cream, deep yellow, orange and purple). Sweet potato blends with rice, cowpea and plantain in nigerian diets. It is also becoming popular as a substitute to yam and garri. It can be reconstituted into fofoo or blended with other carbohydrate flour sources such as wheat ( Triticum aestivum) and cassava ( Manihot esculenta) for baking bread, biscuits and other confectioneries (Woolfe, 1992).<br/>The leaves are rich in protein and the orange flesh varieties contain high beta carotene and are very important in combating vitamin A deficiency especially in children.<br/>Sorghum (sorghum bicolor (S. bicolor) is a tropical plant belonging to the family of poaceae, is one of the most important crops in Africa, Asia and Latin America. More than 35% of sorghum is grown directly for human consumption. The rest is used primarily for animal feed, alcohol production and industrial products ( FAO, 1995). The current annual production of 60 million tons is increasing due to the introduction of improved varieties and breeding conditions. Several improved sorghum varieties adapted to semi-arid tropic environments are released every year by sorghum breeders. Selection of varieties meeting specific local food and industrial requirements from this great biodiversity is of high importance for food security. In developing countries in general and particularly in West Africa demand for sorghum is increasing. This is due to not only the growing population but also to the countries policy to enhance its processing and industrial utilization.<br/>More than 7000 sorghum varieties have been identified, therefore there is a need of their further characterization to the molecular level with respect to food quality. The acquisition of good quality grain is fundamental to produce acceptable food products from sorghum. Sorghum while playing a crucial role in food security in Africa, it is also a source of income of household . In West Africa, ungerminated sorghum grains are generally used for the preparation of \"to\", porridge and couscous. Malted sorghum is used in the process of local beer \"dolo\" (reddish, cloudy or opaque), infant porridge and non fermented beverages. Sorghum grains like all cereals are comprised primarily of starch.<br/>The aim and objective of this work is to obtain diet low in sugars, with enriched nutrients intended for diabetics.</p> </div> \n\n EFFECTS OF PROCESSING METHODS ON THE PHYSICO-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF SWEET POTATO AND SORGHUM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  EFFECTS OF PROCESSING METHODS ON THE PHYSICO-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF SWEET POTATO AND SORGHUM", "id": 2}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>DETERMINATION OF PH VALUE OF PURE WATER SACHET AND BORE HOLE WATER</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>            This project work focused on the determination of the PH values of pure water sachet and sample of borehole water found in Benin city, Edo State.

Oceans cover wsout 72% of the earth and the average depth is 2.5 miles. The oceans are the source of 97% of all water. The rest consist of 2.1% in glaciers, 0.6% fresh water in lakes and rivers 0.6% ground waters and 0.1% in brine well and brackish waters.</p> <p>            Water is the major components of living things for example, the water content of human adult is 70% the same proportion as the earths surface. Water is a liquid, which is colourless, odourless and tasteless. Human activities and settlements hinge on the availability of water. In man, three quarters of the fluid in him are made of water, water forms the essential medium in which the chemical reactions of his cells processed.</p> <p>IMPORTANCE OF WATER                                                </p> <p>            Our physical biological environment play important role on water. As a vapour, it absorbs radiation to influence the heat balance and temperature of the environment thereby bringing moisture to the containment through the water cycle. Human activities and settlement also generate important role on water availability which is used as a medium into which man disposes his wastes which could be industrial domestic or agricultural. Water is so important that it is involves in almost every activity in man.   </p> <p>1.2         STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>The research her realised that some of the pure water sachets and boreholes water have a lot of problems interms of not using the adequate or sufficient PH value recommended by the NAFDAC. As this has direct effect with the general interest of the consumers positively or negatively which influences the all round achievement in pure water sachets and borehole water. So in doing this, the following questions call for attention.</p> <p>1.            Are pure water sachet companies in Benin City have too much acid content?</p> <p>2.            Are the borehole water have too much acid content</p> <p>3.            Is effluent from sewage plant properly treated?</p> <p>4.            Are all the pure water sachet companies registered with the NAFDAC</p> <p>5.            Does drinking water have taste, odour and colour?</p> <p>1.3         PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The relevance of this research work is to examine and make a report on PH value of sachet water samples and borehole water sample in Benin City. Some of the drinking water has already been contaminated, that is to say, the packaging and that of the nylons used to package the treated water are not properly checked. This research work is also aim to determine to what level pure water sachet and borehole water contained too acid and also to check whether all the pure water sachet companies are registered with NAFDAC (national Agency for food and Drug Administration Company).  </p> <p>1.4         AIMS AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>The aims and objective of this study is to provide possible solutions that will sustain pure water sachet companies and borehole water in Benin City, Edo State.</p> <p>1.            To ensure consumer buy pure water sachet registered with NAFDAC.</p> <p>2.            To encourage consumers to report to the NAFDAC, if they see pure water sachet not registered being sold for drinking.</p> <p>3.            To ensure pure water companies, the PH value of the water produced for consumption are within the standard recommended by the WHO for drinking water.</p> <p>4.            To check packaging and ensuring that the nylons used to package the treated water do not contaminate the water put into it or give it some unwanted odour or taste.</p> <p>5.            To ensure that, the best chemical is been used during the treatment of water.</p> <p>6.            To ensure that sewage water be treated carefully.</p> <p>7.            To sanction all the pure water companies not registered with NAFDAC.    </p> <p>1.5         SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</p> <p>The researcher hopes what this research work will go along way for the society in developing the positive effects and thinking towards the determination of PH value of pure water sachets and bore hole sample.

      Most town and cities in Nigeria are dotted with projects that are being delayed, disrupted, and uncompleted.    Explanations giving for the stages of each buildings projects is varied and sometimes attributed to lack of financial, human and material resources with which to execute the projects.       It is common in Nigeria especially now that the country is suffering from depression in the economy.   It is often bad to see huge capital investments being disrupted and abandoned.</p> <p>        Any attempt to delay and disrupt a construction project, will have terrible consequences on every aspect of the nation’s activities which will be severe and unwelcome.</p> <p>        Delays and disruptive in construction has some effects on its cost and very retrogressive in a developing economy like Nigeria and needs to be properly addressed and tackled with all the courage and effort that we can muster.</p> <p>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>        One of the biggest problems associated with most of the construction projects in Nigeria today is problem of delays and disruptions at both the pre-contract and post-contract stages of construction in building and civil engineering works.</p> <p>        The cost of building increases at the cause of delays and disruption in construction because of variation. many construction project in Enugu needed huge capital outlay and time to execute them and any attempt to delaying and disrupting the construction proper will result to terrible consequences that will affect the economical control and building cost.</p> <p>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>       The purpose of this study is as follows –</p> <p>To investigate into most delayed and disrupted construction projects</p> <p>To ascertain the effects of delays and disruptions on cost of building construction.</p> <p>To examine the effect of fluctuation in prices on construction projects costs.</p> <p>To examine the costs of delayed and disrupted construction project to clients, contractors, the professionals that are engaged and the nation, in particular Enugu state.</p> <p>To examine the effects of variation in design on construction project costs.</p> <p>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTION</p> <p>What are the causes of delays and disruptions in construction projects?</p> <p>What are the effects of delays and disruptions on building construction project cost?</p> <p>Do fluctuations in prices bring about changes in construction project cost?</p> <p>What the costs are of delayed and disrupted construction projects to the clients, contractors, the professionals that are engaged in the field?</p> <p>In what ways can variations in design affect construction cost?</p> <p>1.5   THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>        This study will be beneficial to the most construction industry in Nigeria because once a project is initiated and manage properly it will eliminate high cost of procurement and a lot profit are involved.</p> <p>   Also this will help in planning and execution of future construction project executions, especially the quantity surveyor in the feasibility and planning stages of a proposed scheme and preparation of work method and schedules by the building manager.</p> <p>      The study also intend to bring together, the causes of construction delays and disruptions and also tries to ascertain the costs, which will help the construction firms, Engineers, Surveyors and construction managers to initialize and control their project without lost or poor management.</p> <p>1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS     </p> <p>        From the Oxford advanced learner’s English dictionary, delay implies the process or action of being slow being late or linger and also explain disruption as the action of making it difficult for something to proceed.</p> <p>Delay – delay in construction can be defined as an act whereby projects execution is slow or interrupted one time or the other, thereby leading to unnecessary extension in the programme of work from what was initially scheduled.</p> <p>Disruption – disruption in construction projects can be defined as an act or sites partially or completely deserted at one time or the other for the reasons of certain exigencies which have resulted in prolonged delays which are not in accordance with the programme of work in use extension of time or postponement as initially scheduled.</p> <p>Cost – the estimated amount of money that will be needed for something or the price that should be charged for something.</p> <p>        Also, it implies the effort, loss or damage that is involved in order to do or achieve something.</p> <p>Construction – the process or method of building or making something, especially road, building, bridges etc.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF DELAYS

An unfortunate, but unintended side effect of some research works and papers was the misleading tendency of many investigators to think of dietary phenols, polyphenols, and tannins (PPT)as encompassing only the flavonoids, flavonols, and flavones. More recent epidemiological studies have supported the association between better health and long-term consumption of diets rich in foods of plant origin(Hung et al., 2004 and Jansen et al., 2004).However, whether this is because such diets minimize exposure to deleterious substances (example oxidized cholesterol, pyrolysis mutagens, salt, saturated fat, etc.), or maximize intake of certain beneficial nutrients (example isothiocyanates and other sulfur-containing plant constituents, mono-unsaturated fatty</p> <p>acids, and poly-unsaturated fatty acids, PPT, polyacetylenes, selenium, terpenes, etc.) or some combination as advocated in the ‘‘Polymeal’’ concept, remains unknown (Franco et al., 2004 and Johnson, 2004).An in vitro study indicates that there may be mechanistic basis for true synergy between PPT and isothiocyanates. In contrast, more recent studies seeking to assess the suggested link between the consumption of flavonols and flavones, or other flavonoids, have given much less consistent results. Some studies have suggested a possible protective effect of flavonoids against vascular diseases (Hirvonen et al., 2001 and Mennen et al., 2004) or certain (but not all) cancers(Knekt et al., 1997 and Sun et al., 2002).Interestingly, an investigation of the relationship between the consumption of Hibiscus sabdariffa (zobo) and other cruciferous vegetables and the risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women has to be carried out in order to ascertain the beneficial effects to isothiocyanates and/or the phenolic components of the plants (like the dietary phenols including flavonoids) in the management of cancer growth and initiation of various types of diabetes.</p> <p>In the same time period, various studies have suggested beneficial effect associated with raised consumption of other classes of dietary phenols. For example, increased coffee consumption has been linked with reduced incidence of type II diabetes (van Dam et al., 2002 and Saremi et al., 2003).Similarly, increased consumption of lignans (or at least greater plasma concentrations of their metabolites)has been linked with reduced incidence of estrogen-related cancers in some (Boccardo et al., 2004 and McCann et al., 2004) but not all studies (Kilkkinen et al., 2004 and Zeleniuch –Jacquotte et al., 2004),and a prospective study was equivocal.</p> <p>1.1       SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH</p> <p>The flavonoids in the water extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa should be extracted for further experimental and clinical research in the management of certain ailments and disorders like cancer, diabetes mellitus etc.</p> <p>The mechanisms of flavonoid-protein interactions have been determined; it is my suggestion that such mechanisms should be carried to the in-vivo metabolic and physiological processes aimed at determining the detailed mechanisms involved in cells aging processes and the progression of diseases.</p> <p>1.2       OBJECTIVE OF STUDY</p> <p>    The objective of this study is to determine the physico chemical (biochemical) and water constituent of Zobo produced from dried calyces of Hibiscus sabdariffa (Linn Roselle). Using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS). The biochemical content of the zobo has undesirable effects on human health when consumed.</p>\n\nCHEMICAL/MINERAL COMPOSITIONS OF WATER EXTRACTS OF HIBISCUS SABDARIFFA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CHEMICAL/MINERAL COMPOSITIONS OF WATER EXTRACTS OF HIBISCUS SABDARIFFA", "id": 5}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>TABLE OF CONTENT</p> <p>Title page</p> <p>Approval page</p> <p>Dedication</p> <p>Acknowlegdement</p> <p>Abstract</p> <p>Table of contents</p> <p>List of tables</p> <p>List of figures</p> <p>Abbreviations</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0   Introduction</p> <p>1.1   Objectives of the Study</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>2.0      Literature Review</p> <p>3.0      2.1   Importance of Phytochemicals</p> <p>2.1.1        Mechanism of Action of Tomato Phytochemicals</p> <p>2.1.2        Importance of Tomatoes</p> <p>2.2   Structure of Vitamin C and its Activity</p> <p>2.2.1        Biosynthesis and species-synthetic ability</p> <p>2.2.2        Absorption, Transport and Disposal</p> <p>2.2.3        Deficiency</p> <p>2.2.4        Physiological functions in mammals</p> <p>2.2.5        Daily requirement</p> <p>2.2.6        Therapeutic uses</p> <p>2.2.7        Adverse effects</p> <p>2.3   Structure of Beta Carotene and its Activity</p> <p>2.3.1        Previtamin A activity</p> <p>2.3.2        Symmetric and Asymmetric Cleavage</p> <p>2.3.3        Sources in Diet</p> <p>2.3.4        Side Effects</p> <p>2.3.5        Beta Carotene and lung cancer in smokers</p> <p>2.3.6 Uses based on Scientific Evidence</p> <p>2.4   Structure of Lycopene and Its Chemical Activity</p> <p>2.4.1        Bioavailability of Lycopene</p> <p>2.4.2        Digestion and absorption of Lycopene</p> <p>2.4.3        Roles of Lycopene in Human Health</p> <p>2.5   Structure of Polyphenol and its activity</p> <p>2.5.1        Classification and Nomenclature</p> <p>2.5.2Potential Health Benefits</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>3.0   Materials and Methods</p> <p>3.1   Equipments/Apparatus</p> <p>3.2   Procurement of Raw Materials</p> <p>3.3   Study Design</p> <p>3.4   Sample Processing</p> <p>3.5   Chemical Analysis of Samples</p> <p>3.5.1Vitamin C content determination</p> <p>3.5.2Beta-carotene content Determination</p> <p>3.5.3        Lycopene Content Determination</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>4.0   Results and discussion</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p>5.0   Conclusion</p> <p>Reference</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0       INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Intake of tomato and tomato based-products contributes to the absorption of a wide range of carotenoids in human serum and tissues. The prominent carotenoid in tomatoes is lycopene, a pigment principally responsible for the deep-red colour of tomato fruits and tomato products. Fruits and vegetables contain in excess of 40 carotenoids that are routinely absorbed and metabolized by humans (Khachik, 1992).</p> <p>Tomatoes and tomato products are now being investigated for their potential role in prostate cancer prevention and therapy. This review summarizes the in vitro and invivo evidence as well as the molecular data that show the anticarcinogenic potential of tomatoes.   Raw and processed tomatoes are among the most commonly consumed vegetables. They are rich in the phytochemicals, carotenoids and polyphenols. Lycopene and quercetin are the most abundant carotenoids and flavonols respectively. Canned tomato sauce is the primary source of lycopene whereas the tomato skin is enriched with flavonols. Most epidemiological studies suggest that the consumption of tomatoes and the products in associated with a reduced prostate cancer risk. The health professionals follows-up study found that men who consumed 2 to 4 servings of raw tomatoes per week had a more than 20% reduction in prostate cancer risk compared to men who did not consume tomatoes. High lycopene plasma concentrations were associated with a low incidence of prostate cancer and aggressive prostate cancer in rested case-control study with the physician’s health study. Invitro data show that the compounds found in tomatoes are potent anticarcinogens. Cancer cell growth is inhibited by the polyphenols quercetin, kaempferol and naringerin in a dose dependent manner. These compounds do not have cytotoxic effect. In a rat model of prostate cancer, tomato powder into but not lycopene intake by itself reduced prostate cancer related mortality. This suggests that the compounds in tomatoes have an additive influence on prostate cancer. Lycopenes exist as either the cis or trans isomer. The half-life of lycopene is approximately 10 to 14 days, so it remains in the body during washout period. The trans isomer dominates in tomatoes, between the cis isomer dominates in serum and tissues and during a washout period. Thus, recent intake of lycopenes is reflected in blood concentrations whereas long-term exposure is determined in the tissues. </p> <p>Lycopene is a bioactive carotenoid found in many red fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, watermelon, pink grapefruits etc. Different fruits, vegetable and their products contain different concentrations of lycopene. This natural red pigment is synthesized exclusive by plants and microorganisms (fungi, bacteria and algae). It facilitates the absorption of light during photosynthesis and also provides protection against photosensitization (Adam et al., 1996) Animals including human being, cannot synthesize lycopene therefore, they obtain lycopene exclusively from diet (Tapiero et al. 2004; Omoni and Aluko, 2005).</p> <p>Although, tomato contain a lower concentration of nutrients compared to other commercially grow fruits species, they are a major source of lycopene. Lycopene comprises 83% of the total pigment present in tomatoes (Shi et al., 1990). Therefore, the amount of lycopene present in tomatoes other fruits and vegetables vary with variety, degree of ripeness and other dimatic conditions and agricultural practices.</p> <p>The fraction of vitamin C in the diet that is absorbed and the rate at which the excess is eliminated from the body vary strongly with the dose. Large, randomized clinical trials on the effects of high doses on the general population have not been conducted. Venturi suggested that the antioxidant action of ascorbic acid developed first in the plant kingdom when, about 500 million years ago (mya), plants began to adapt to antioxidant mineral deficient fresh waters of estuaries. Ascorbic acid or vitamin C is a common enzymatic cofactor in mammals used in the synthesis of collagen. Ascorbate is a powerful reducing agent capable of rapidly scavenging a number of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Freshwater fishes also require dietary vitamin C in their diet or they will get scurvy. The most widely recognized symptoms of vitamin C deficiency in fishes are scoliosis, lordosis and dark skin coloration.</p> <p>The name “carotene” was first coined in the early 19th century by the scientist Wachenroder after he crystallized this compound from carrot roots. Beta-carotene is a member of the carotenoids, which are highly pigmented (red, orange, yellow), fat-soluble compounds naturally present in many fruits, grains, oils and vegetables (green plants, carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, spinach, apricots, and green peppers). Alpha, beta and gamma carotene are considered provitamins because they can be converted to active vitamin A. The carotenes possess antioxidant properties. Vitamin A serves several biological functions including involvement in the synthesis of certain glycoproteins. Commercially available beta-carotene produced synthetically or from palm oil, algae, or fungi. Beta-carotene is converted to retinol, which is essential for vision and is subsequently converted to retinoic acid, which is used for processes involving growth and cell differentiation.</p> <p>1.1   Objectives of the study</p> <p>The main objective of this project is to do a comparative analysis (quantitative analysis) on phytochemicals present in tomatoes and some selected tomato products (canned tomato) sold in any common market in Nigeria</p>\n\nPHYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF SELECTED TOMATO PRODUCTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PHYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF SELECTED TOMATO PRODUCTS", "id": 6}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>SERUM CALCIUM LEVEL IN GERIATRIC MEN, COMPERATIVE STUDIES</p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Calcium is the most important mineral in the body. The body needs calcium for normal functioning of nerves and muscles including the most important muscles of all which is the heart. Calcium is also important for healthy bones and teeth. The amount of calcium in the blood is carefully controlled by the body’s hormonal systems. The body gets calcium from diary products, some vegetables (such as broccoli), and some fortified foods. Calcium can also be obtained from taken pills containing calcium. Most of the body’s calcium is stored in the bones and only small amount is found in the blood (serum). Calcium is maintained within a fairly narrow range from 8.5 to 10.5mg/dl (4.3 to 5.3meq/l or 2.2 to 2.7mmol/l). The estimation of serum calcium level is fraught with possible errors. Several means of contamination might lead to false elevations of serum calcium concentration. Before the test is carried out, one does not need to fast or limit ones activity before the test. Rather certain medicine/drugs needed to be avoided before the test, because they might affect the test result. The result of the experiment can be calculated, since the differences in serum calcium is significance with the age differences. Those with the age bracket (50 years &amp; above) have lesser serum calcium level than those in the range of 20 to 30 years.    </p> <p>  TABLE OF CONTENT</p> <p>Title Page ------------------------------------------------------------------i</p> <p>Certification ---------------------------------------------------------------ii</p> <p>Dedication ------------------------------------------------------------------iii</p> <p>Acknowledgement --------------------------------------------------------iv</p> <p>List of table and Figures ------------------------------------------------v</p> <p>Table of content -----------------------------------------------------------vi</p> <p>Abstract ---------------------------------------------------------------vii</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0.0: Introduction ------------------------------------------------------- 1</p> <p>1.1.0: The amount of calcium in the body ---------------------------1</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>2.0.0: Literature review --------------------------------------------------3</p> <p>2.1.0: Reasons for serum calcium test ---------------------------------</p> <p>2.2.0: Techniques for serum calcium test -----------------------------</p> <p>2.3.0: Factors that determines the serum calcium test -------------</p> <p>2.4.0: Values of serum calcium fractions ------------------------------</p> <p>2.5.0: Effects of abnormalities in serum calcium levels -------------</p> <p>2.6.0: Biological functions of inorganic ions ---------------------------</p> <p>2.7.0: Clinical significance of serum calcium --------------------------</p> <p>2.7.1: Causes of hypocalcaemia -------------------------------------------</p> <p>2.7.2: Causes of hypercalceamia ------------------------------------------</p> <p>2.8.0: Effector organs -------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>2.8.1: Sources ------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>2.8.2: Excretion ----------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>2.8.3: The roles of bone -------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>2.8.4: Interaction of calcium with other chemicals ---------------------</p> <p>2.8.5: Regulatory organs -----------------------------------------------------</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>3.0.0: Methodology/ Instruments ------------------------------------</p> <p>3.1.0: Instruments used -------------------------------------------------</p> <p>3.2.0: Collection of specimens ------------------------------------------</p> <p>3.3.0: Methodology --------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>3.3.1: Principle of the test ------------------------------------------------</p> <p>3.3.2: Procedure used -----------------------------------------------------</p> <p>3.3.3: Calculation of the results -----------------------------------------</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>4.0.0: Experimental result----------------------------------------------------</p> <p>4.1.0: Statistical analysis -----------------------------------------------------</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p>5.0.0:Discussion/ conclusion-----------------------------------------------------</p> <p>5.1.0: Discussion --------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>5.2.0: Conclusions ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>5.3.0: References ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>5.4.0: Recommendation ---------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>                                       CHAPTER ONE         </p> <p>1.1.0:                           INTRODUCTION</p> <p>               Serum Calcium level in Geriatric men</p> <p>Calcium is the most common mineral in the body and one of the most important elements.

The artificial sweetener was found out to be the sweetest among the substances experimented and at the percentage of 0.1% and 0.01% saccharin an artificial sweetener was able to mimic the taste of sugar. Research prove that artificial sweetener are non-nutritive they have virtually no calories in contrast to sugar which contains 4 calories at each gram, a teaspoon of sugar is about 4 grams, for weight lose artificial sweetener may be an attractive option to sugar. Artificial sweetener may also be a good alternative for diabetic patient, unlike sugar; artificial sweeteners generally don‟t raise blood sugar levels because they are not carbohydrates.</p> <p><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>A sugar substitute is a food additive that duplicates the effect of sugar in taste, usually with less food energy. Some sugar substitutes are natural and some are synthetic. Those that are not natural are in general, called artificial sweeteners. Artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes are found in a variety of food and beverages marketed as sugar free or diet including soft drinks, chewing gum, jellies, baked goods, candy, fruit juice and ice-cream and yoghurt. [Whitney 2011]<br/>People may not all like the same kind of baked treats but one thing we all agree on is that baked treats should be sweets usually, sugar is used to lend sweetness to foods but would cake taste just as good if the baker used a sugar substitutes instead of sugar? Many people prefer not to use sugar often due to health reasons and instead depend on sugar substitutes to sweeten their foods. But are sugar substitutes the same as sugar? What exactly are the differences between sugar and sugar substitutes?<br/>Sugar also known as sucrose comes from plants like sugar cane and sugar beets and is a carbohydrate. Sugar adds bulk to cakes, cookies and all kinds of treats; sugar also causes browning and caramelizing in foods when it is<br/>heated as when cookies turn golden brown in the oven sugar is a natural substance, something that our bodies can use for energy.<br/>Sugar substitutes come in three categories; artificial sweeteners, sugar alcohols and natural sweeteners. Artificialsweeteners are attractive because they add almost no calories to foods and are sometimes a part of weight loss programs. Also they donot increase blood sugar levels which mean that diabetics can use them. Many artificial sweeteners like sucralose were discovered by accident in the laboratory. In 1976, a scientist in England was studying different compounds made from sugar. The scientist asked a student to test the compounds but instead the student tested them. Another category of sugar substitutes is sugar alcohols. Sugar alcohols are not alcoholic beverages they do not contain ethanol which is found in alcoholic beverages. Sugar alcohols like sugar have calories and energy but not asmuch as sugar. Sugar alcohols like artificial sweeteners do not contribute to tooth decay and affect blood sugar levels slowly so diabetics can use them. Although sugar alcohols like xylitol, sorbitol and erythritol are manufactured products the sources are often natural.</p> </div>\n\nDETERMINATION OF ACTIVE SWEET COMPONENTS OF COMMON ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS THAT ARE USED AS REPLACEMENT FOR SUGAR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DETERMINATION OF ACTIVE SWEET COMPONENTS OF COMMON ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS THAT ARE USED AS REPLACEMENT FOR SUGAR", "id": 8}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT </p> <p>This work was carried out to investigate the effects of Burantashi extract on liver enzymes of albino male and female whistar rats.

Any abnormality involving these systems whether from medications or disease has a significant impact on the ability to develop and sustain erection; ejaculate and experience orgasm. (Laumann et al., 1999).<br/>The physiological process of erection begins in the brain and involves the nervous and vascular system. The chemicals that initiate erection are neurotransmitters present in the brain. Any kind of stimulation physical or psychological, causes nerves to send message to the vascular system which result in significant blood flow to the penis. Two arteries in the penis supply blood to erectile tissues and the corpora cavernous which become engorged and expand as a result of increased blood flow and pressures. Because blood must stay in the penis to maintain rigidity. An erectile tissue is enclosed by tunicae, which is fibrous elastic sheathes cinch which prevents blood leaving he penis during<br/>13<br/>electron. When muscle in the penis contract to stop the inflow of blood and open out flow channels and an electron is reserved.<br/>HORMONAL INVOLVEMENT IN ERECTION<br/> Oestrogen/Progesterone: (These are female hormones that cause clitoral<br/>erection. If the body has two much oestrogen and or too little testost erone, she ca n get very wet but can not erect her clitoral and G-spot. ( Haimen et al., 2002). Estrogen tends to increase the size of the bread, labia minors (inner lips) and clitoral hood, but shrinks the glans clitoris into the clitoral hood making it invisible. It also increases the thickness of the vaginal lining making the G-spot inaccessible. The mechanism of the clitoral and G-spot erection is the same as that of the penis. It is driven by the parasympathetic sexual nerve (The neurotransmitter acetylcholine) through the neurotransmitter. Nitric oxide and the erection dilator cGMP, which is continuously powered by the burning of testosterone without a testosterone burst and burning. She cannot pop the glans Clitoris and G-spot out. If she is on birth control pills there is a chance that her body is over flooded by estrogens and low progesterone. Over loaded liver cannot produce sufficient essential enzymes to synthesize sufficient NO, cGMP and testosterone to support the clitoral and G-spot erection infact excessive estrogen or progesterone in the body will shrink the penis, clitoral and G-spot, but likely increase the breast size (under the excessive estrogen action).</p>\n\n PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION ON EFFECTS OF BURANTASHI EXTRACT ON LIVER ENZYMES OF AIBINO MALE AND FEMALE WHISTAR RATS.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION ON EFFECTS OF BURANTASHI EXTRACT ON LIVER ENZYMES OF AIBINO MALE AND FEMALE WHISTAR RATS.", "id": 9}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>PRODUCTION OF STARCH FROM CASSAVA (M<em>aihot esculanta</em>) AND ITS CROSS LINKED DERIVATIVES</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.0    <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Starch can be obtained from cassava, sorghum, maize, sago and potatoes. But this project focused on the production of starch from cassava. Starch can be cross-linked a product that will be suitable for noodle, salad cream custard making. Normally it is easier to make this product from corn and potatoe starch, but cassava which is readily available and cheap can be employed to meet the demand of the people.</p> <p>Other synthetic starch produced from cassava includes; carboxymethyl starch (which is produced when one of the hydrogen atom of the starch is replaced by carboxymethyl groups, starch acetate, starch xanthate and hydroxyl alkyl starch. These are used as thickening agents, sterbilizer and emulsifier in products. Cassava starch when treated with phosphate are used in frozen products when they are defrosted to prevent them from dripping. This study investigated the production of starch from cassava and preparation of cross-link derivatives.</p> <p><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p>1.1<strong>    MEANING AND COMPOSITION OF STARCH</strong></p> <p>Starch is one of the most abundant substances in nature, a renewable and almost unlimited resource with a chemical formula (C6H10O5)n. It is a polysaccharide, a chain of many glucose molecules. It is the most carbohydrate stored in roots and seeds of plants.[1] There are two types of glucose chain in starch which are the amylose and amyloeptin.</p> <p>1.2.1<strong> COMPLEX BRANCH CHAIN (AMILOPECTIN)</strong></p> <p>Amylopectins are made up of several million glucose units. It forms branched structures with about 30 glucose units in a chain between branches. This makes the molecule somewhat stripped in appearance with the knotted branch point in all rows and smooth chain separating them. These molecules are so large that this stripped appearance show up under a light microscope forming what appears to be ‘growth rings’ in the starch grain.[2]</p><p>  OH   OH  </p> <p>Fig 1.0</p><p>                     </p> <p>1.1.2<strong> AMYLOSE CHAIN</strong></p> <p>Amylose chain tend to curl up into tielice (spirals) with the hydrophobic part inside. This allows them to trap oil and fat inside the helix as well as aroma molecules.[2]</p> <p><strong>Fig 2.0</strong></p> <p>1.1.3<strong> STARCH GELATINIZATION</strong></p> <p><strong>WHAT IS GELATINIZATION?</strong></p> <p>This is a colloidal structure that is, it has interparticle bonds (usually hydrogen bonds) or lower potential energy than starch in true solution[3].</p> <p>Starch gelatinization is a process that breaks down the intermolecular bonds of starch molecules in the presence of water and heat, allowing the hydrogen bonding and oxygen sites (the hydroxyl) to engage more water. This irreversibly dissolves in starch granules. Penetration of water increases randomness in the general granule structure and decreases the number and size of crystalline regions [4]. Hence crystalline region do not allow water entry. Heat causes such region to be diffused so that the chain begin to separate into an amorphous form. This process is used in cooking to make roux sauce, pastery custard or popcorn.[5]</p> <p>1.1.4<strong> GELATINIZATION PROCESS</strong></p> <p>Gelatinization is also known as the thickening of a liquid, the starch or flour granules absorb the liquid. When heated, the grains/granules swell and burst releasing the starch into liquid[6]</p> <p>1.1.5<strong> STARCH RETRO GRADATION</strong></p> <p>This is a reaction that takes place in gelatinized starch when the amylose and amylopectin chain realign themselves causing the liquid to gelatinize.[3]</p> <p>When native starch is heated and dissolves in water, the crystalline structure of amylose and amylopectic molecules are lost and they hydrate to form a viscous solution. If the viscous solution is cooled at lower temperature for long enough period, the linear molecule amylose and the lower part of amylopectin molecule retrograde and rearrange themselves again to a more crystalline structure. Hence, retrogradation can expel water from the polymer network. This is a process known as SYNERESIS. A small amount of water can be seen on top of the gel. Retrogradation is directly related to stalling or aging  of bread [3]</p> <p>1.2.0<strong> SOURCES OF STARCH</strong></p> <p>Cassava starch</p> <p>Maize starch</p> <p>Sorghum starch</p> <p>Sago starch</p> <p>Potatoe starch</p> <p>1.2.1<strong> CASSAVA STARCH (<em>Manihot esculanta)</em></strong></p> <p>Cassava starch has many remarkable characteristics including high paste viscosity, high paste clarity and high freeze-thaw stability which are advantageous to many industries.</p> <p>Several workers have reported the production of starch and its cross linked derivation [7]. This report described the principle of using cassava starch to produce some vital products because cassava are readily available and cheap. Hence, they are available at low cost [8]. Over the years, the ability to produce some synthetic starch from cassava has been reported in literature and this includes crosslinked starch, carboxyl methyl starch, starch acetate, starch xanthate etc.</p> <p>1.2.2<strong> ORIGIN, TYPES AND COMPOSITION OF CASSAVA STARCH</strong></p> <p>Cassava is a staple crop that is particularly important in South America, America and African countries[9]. It is a perennial shrub that grows to approximately 2 meters tall and has the ability to grow on a  marginal land in low-nutrient soil where other crops do not grow well. It is also fairly drought tolerant. It is grown for its enlarged starch rich tuberous roots.</p> <p>Although cassava is a staple crop, it is poisonous in its raw state as the plant contains cyanogenic glucoside. These glucosides are converted to HCN by enzymes called Linamarase which is present in cassava and acts on the glucosides when the plant cell are ruptured during the consumption stage.</p> <p>The amount of cyanide contained in cassava depends on the variety and stage of the cassava. There are two types of cassava [9].</p> <p>Bitter cassava (<em>Manihot utilissiana)</em></p> <p>Sweet Cassava (<em>Manihot patinate)</em></p> <p>The bitter cassava has a higher level of cyanide than the sweet cassava.

The seed is best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe after thoroughly rinsing it, sow stored seed in March in a greenhouse, germination usually takes place within 2-3 weeks at 130C. seedlings are liable to damp off so they must be watered with care and kept well ventilated. <em>Citrus sinensis</em></p> <p>Contains a wide range of active ingredients and research is still underway in finding uses for them. They are rich in vitamin c, flavonoids, acids and volatile oils. They also contain coumarins such as bergapten which sensitizes the skin to sunlight. Bergapten is sometimes added to tanning preparations since it promotes pigmentation in the skin, though it can cause dermatitis or allergy responses in some people. Some of the plants more recent applications are as sources of anti-oxidants and chemical exfoliants in spercified cosmetics. The fruit is an appetizer and blood purifier, it is used to allay thirst in people with fever and also treat catarrh. The fruit juice is useful in treatment of bilious infections and bilious diarrhea. The fruit rind is caminative and tonic cure for acne. The dried peel is used in the treatment of anorexia, cold cough etc.</p> <p>1.1    <strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE RESEARCH</strong></p> <ol><li>To screen the coat and seed of <em>Citrus sinensis </em>for the presence of phyhtochemicals of interest</li> </ol> <p>To determine the antifungal/antibacterial activities of the seed and coat of <em>Citrus sinensis</em></p> <p><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>SCIENTIFIC CLASSIFICATION KINGDOM: PLANTAE</strong></li> </ul> <p>(Unranked)                   –                  Angiosperm</p> <p>(Unranked)                   –                  Eudicot</p> <p>(Unranked)                   –                  Rosids</p> <p>Order                             –                  Sapindales</p> <p>Family                 –                  Rutaceae</p> <p>Genus                 –                  Citrus</p> <p>Species               –        <em>          C. xsinensis</em></p> <p>Bionomial na,e   –                  <em>Citrus Sinensis</em></p> <p>The research into phytochemical and antimicrobial screening of active compounds from natural source has always been of great interest for scientists looking for new sources of useful drugs against infection and diseases [1].</p> <p>Plants are indispensable sources of medicinal importance used in both western type pharmaceutical products and local medicinal preparations. The traditional use of plants materials for treatment of human ailment dates back to prehistoric times [2] according to the world health organizations 80% of the world population relies on traditional medicines to meet their daily health  requirements[3]. However, from the estimated 250 000 species of higher plants described to date, only 5-15% have been studied for their potential therapeutic value[4].</p> <p>Ethiopia is a tropical country with a high floral diversity and endermism[5].

Northeastern India and perhaps Southeastern Asia (formally Indochina). It was carried to the mediterenian area possibly by Italian traders after 1450 of by Portuguese navigators around 1500. Up to that era citrus fruits were valued by Europeans mainly for medicinal purposes, but orange was quickly adopted as a luscidious fruit and wealthy persons grow it in private conservations, called orangeries. By 1646, it had been much publicized and was well known.</p> <p>The orange has become the most commonly grown fruit in the world. It is an important crop in the far east, the union of South Africa, Australia, throughout the Mediteranian area and sub tropical areas of South America and the Caribbean. The United States leads in the world production, with Florida, alone, having an annual yield of more than 200 million boxes, except when freezes occur which may reduce the crop by 20 or even 40%.</p> <p>1.4    <strong>MORPHOLOGY ASPECT OF THE <em>Citrus sinensis</em></strong></p> <p>The orange tree, reaching 25 ft (7.5m) or with great ages up to 50ft (15m) has a rounded crown of slender branches. The twigs are twisted and angled when young and may bear slender semi-flexible, bluntish spines in the leaf axils. There may be faint or conspicuous wings on the petioles of aromatic evergreen, alternate elliptic to ovate, sometimes faintly toothed “leaves” – technically solitary leaflets of compound leaves. These are 21/2 to 6m (6.5-15cm) long 1 to 33/4 in (2.5 – 9.5cm) wide. Brone singly or in clusters of 2 to 6, the sweetly fragrant white flowers, about 2 in (5cm) wide, have a saucer-shaped, 5 pointed calyx and 5 oblong, white petals, and 20 to 25 stamens with conspicuous yellow anthers. The fruit is subglobose oblate or some what oval, 21/2 to 33/4 in (6.5-9.5cm) wide. Dotted with minute glands containing an essential oil, the outer ring (epicarp) is orange or yellow when ripe, the inner ring (mesocarp) is white spongy and nonaromatic, the pulp (endocarp) yellow, orange or more less red, the sweet orange differs physically from sour orange in having  a solid center.</p> <p>1.5    <strong>GENERAL USES AND IMPORTANCE</strong></p> <p>Seeds and coat of the <em>Citrus sinensis</em></p> <p>It is a sunny and radiant oil bringing happiness and warmth to the mind and helps people to relax and helps children to sleep at night.</p> <p>Orange oil can be used effectively in immune system, as well as for colds and flu and to eliminate toxins from the body. It is a good diuretic and is most useful in balancing water retention and obesity. Its lymphatic stimulant action further helps to balance well-being. For the digestive system, orange oil can help with constipation, dyspepsia and as a general tonic, it is also useful in cases of nervous tension and stress.</p>\n\nPRELIMINARY PHYTOCHEMICAL AND ANTIMICROBIAL SCREENING OF SEED AND COAT OF CITRUS SINENSIS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PRELIMINARY PHYTOCHEMICAL AND ANTIMICROBIAL SCREENING OF SEED AND COAT OF CITRUS SINENSIS", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div> PROXIMATE AND PHYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF SOURSOP FROM NSUKKA </div> <div>Abstract: </div> <div> <div> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This study was conducted on the proximate and quantitative analysis of soursop (Annona moricata) fruit.

Foods are not only nutritious to consumers, but are also excellent sources of nutrients for microbial growth. Depending on the microorganisms present, foods may spoil or be preserved by fermentation. Foods can act as a reservoir for disease transmission, and thus detection and control of pathogens and spoilage organisms are important areas of food microbiology. During the entire sequence of food handling from the producer to the final consumer, microorganisms can affect food quality and develop potential health effects for humans. Food spoilage is a metabolic process that causes foods to be undesirable or unacceptable for human consumption due to changes in sensory characteristics (tactile, visual, olfactory or flavour). Chemical reactions that cause offensive sensory changes in foods are mediated by a variety of microbes that use food as a carbon and energy source. These organisms include bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses. Many physical and chemical methods are employed to control the growth of certain microbes on foods thereby preventing their spoilage.</p>\n\nMICROBIAL FOOD SPOILAGE DISORDERS (DISEASES) AND ITS CONTROL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MICROBIAL FOOD SPOILAGE DISORDERS (DISEASES) AND ITS CONTROL", "id": 13}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p> <strong>A COMPARATIVE INVESTIGATION INTO THE LIPID PROFILE OF MORINGA OLEIFERA SEEDS AND LEAVES</strong> </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0     INTRODUCTION                                                                     1</p> <p>1.1     Aims/Objectives of the Study                                                            4</p> <p>1.2     Statement of Problem                                                                4</p> <p>1.4     Scope of Limitation of the Study                                             4</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>2.0     LITERATURE REVIEW                                                         5</p> <p>2.1     Background of the Study                                                          5</p> <p>2.2     Factors that Contribute to the Growth of</p> <p>Moringa Oleifera Plant                                                              6</p> <p>Methods of Propagation                                                           7</p> <p>2.3     Uses of Moringa Oleifera                                                          8</p> <p>2.4     Phytochemical Composition of Moringa Oleifera</p> <p>Seeds and Leaves                                                                                16</p> <p>2.5     Chemical Structures of the Phytochemistry</p> <p>Compositions                                                                            19</p> <p>2.6     Medicinal Uses and Pharmacological Potentials</p> <p>of Moringa Oleifera                                                                   25</p> <p>2.7     Other NaturalS Benefits of Moringa Oleifera                         31</p> <p>2.8     Classes of Lipids                                                                       32</p> <p>2.9     Biochemical Functions of Lipids                                             33</p> <p>2.10   Biochemical Reactions of Lipids                                             34</p> <p>2.11   Methods of Lipids Extraction                                                  36</p> <p>2.12   Tests for Lipids Analysis                                                          37</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>3.0     Materials and Methods                                                             39</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>4.0     Results                                                                                        49</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p>5.0     Discussion, Conclusion and Recommendation                      57</p> <p>References                                                                                  60</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p><em>Moringa Oleifera</em> seed and leaves used in Eastern Nigeria have an impressive range of multipurpose medicinal uses with high nutritional values. However, to be clinically used, more scientific data are needed. The aim of this present study is to extract and characterize the oil content of <em>Moringa Oleifera</em> seeds and leaves. The ground seeds and leaves were extract with n-hexane as the solvent using soxhlet extractor. The seed oil of <em>Moringa Oleifera</em> was analyzed for its iodine values, pH, viscosity, free fatty acids value, peroxide value, saponification value and density using conventional methodies. The maximum percentage extractive yield of oil were found to be seed (20.634%) and leaves (0.00%). The characterization analysis of the seed oil revealed that the tested parameters give these values; specific gravity (0.903), pH (5.60), saponification values (13.99), peroxide values (0.00), viscosity (580.24), free fatty acid value (49.37) and iodine values (0.33). Therefore, the results showed that <em>Moringa Oleifera</em> seed oil is a source of raw material for the industries as a result of its high oil yield.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0     INTRODUCTION</p> <p><em>Moringa Oleifera</em> (synonym: moringa pterygosperma) is the most widely cultivated species of the genus moringa, which is the only genus in the family moringacae English common names include; Moringa, Benzolive tree, (^ab “USDA GRIN Taxonmy”) and west Indian ben. It is also known as drumstick tree, from the appearance of the long, slender, triangular seeds pods, horseradish tree, from the taste of the roots which resembles horseradish, or Ben oil tree from the oil derived from the seeds. The tree itself is rather slender, with drooping branches that grow to approximately 10 meter in height. In cultivation, it is often cut back annually to 1-2 meters and allowed to regrow so the pods and leaves remains within arm’s reach. (^ab “USDA GRIN Taxonomy”).</p> <p><em>Moringa Oleifera</em> lam (syn. Moringa pterygosperma; commonly known as “Miracle Tree”, Horseradish tree”, or “Ben oil tree”) is the best known and most widely distributed species of morignaceae family, having an impressive range of medicinal uses with high nutritional value throughout the world. Native to western and sub-himalayan tracts, India, Pakistan, Asia and Africa, (Somali, et al 1999, and Mughal <em>et al;</em> 1999) this plant is well distributed in the Philippines, Cambodia, America and the Caribbean Islands (Morton, 1991). In some parts of the world, Moringa oleifera is referred to as the “drumstick tree” or the “horseradish tree”, whereas in others it is known as the “kelor tree” (Anwar and Bhanger, 2003). While in the Nile Valley, the name of the tree is ‘shagara al’ Rauwaq, which means tree for purifying (Von, 1996). In pakistan, <em>Moringa Oleifera</em> is locally known as “Sohanjna” and is grown and cultivated all over the country (Qaiser, 1993, and Anwar <em>et al</em>; 2005). It tolerates a wide range of rainfall with minimum annual rainfall requirement estimated at 250mm and maximum at over 3000mm and at pH of 5.0 – 9.0 (Palada and Changl, 2003).</p> <p><em>Moringa Oleifera</em> is an important food commodity which has had enormous attention as the “natural nutrition of the tropics”.</p> <p>The parts of this plant includes; the roots, bark, gum, leaves, fruits (pods), flowers, seeds and seed oil. The leaves, fruits, flowers and immature pods of this plant tree a re used as a highly nutritive vegetable in many countries, particularly in India, Pakistan, Philippines, Hawaii and many parts of Africa (D’ Souza and Kulkarni 1993) (Awar and Bhanger, 2003; Anwar <em>et al</em>; 2005). A number of medicinal properties have been ascribed to various parts of this highly esteemed tree, (Fuglie, 2001; Faizi <em>et al;</em> 1998); Lalas and Tsaknis, 2002, Bhatnargar et al 1991; Siddhuraju and Becker, 2003; Dahot, 1988; Makonne <em>et al</em>; 1997 and the Nealth of India 1962).</p> <p>The lipid profile is the collective term given to the estimation of typically, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lopporetein (LDL) cholesterol ad triacyl glycerides (TAG). Lipid profile can also be defined “lipid panel”. An extend lipid profile may include very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol. This is used to identify hyperlipidemia (various disturbances of cholesterol and triglycerides level). (Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia).</p> <p>1.2     STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>Many works have been reported on the medicinal values and therapeutic properties of <em>Moringa Oleifera</em>, this has prompted the need for a project work to be carried out; to investigate the lipid profile of <em>Moringa Oleifera</em> seeds and leaves.</p>\n\nA COMPARATIVE INVESTIGATION INTO THE LIPID PROFILE OF MORINGA OLEIFERA SEEDS AND LEAVES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A COMPARATIVE INVESTIGATION INTO THE LIPID PROFILE OF MORINGA OLEIFERA SEEDS AND LEAVES", "id": 14}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ANALYSIS THE ALPHA-PROTEIN LEVEL IN HEPATITIS PATIENT AS AN AID IN ACCESSING THE DEGREE IN WHICH IT GENERATES TO HCC</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0       </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer. It accounts for 60% of all cancer world wide (Melissa 2004). The most significance cause is the presence of cirrhosis. HCC has unique geographic sex, age distribution that are likely determined by specific actiology factor. It’s distribution also varies  among ethnic group within the same country (Munoz 1989). A high incidence of hepatitis B and C may have been an important factor contributing to the development of liver disease (HCC and Cirrhosis) in south eastern Nigeria. However, a recent trend which reveals an increase in cases of liver cirrhosis and hepatitis in our environment suggest that there could be other contributory factors perculiar to our environment besides hepatitis B and C which could be possible explanation to the recent trend. In so doing, it would be necessary to look into the various predisposing/causative factors of chronic hepatitis which could lead to increased cases of liver cirrhosis and HCC in our environment. The risk of developing HCC differs depending on the cause of cirrhosis. For example, cirrhosis due to hepatitis B has a high risk of leading to HCC while the risk of HCC in people with primary biliary cirrhosis, although present is very low. All these human hepatitis viruses are RNA viruses except for hepatitis B virus, which is a DNA virus. Although these viruses can be distinguished by their molecular and antigenic properties, all types of viral hepatitis produce clinically similar illnesses. These range from asymptomatic and unapparent to fulminant and fatal acute infections common to all types, on one hand, and from subclinical persistent infections to rapidly progressive liver disease with cirrhosis and even hepatocullular carcinoma (HCC), common to the blood-borne types (HBV and HCV). Without specific virological test, it is not possible to determine which hepatitis virus is responsible for a case of hepatitis. (Kathleen park et al., 2004).</p>\n\nANALYSIS THE ALPHA-PROTEIN LEVEL IN HEPATITIS PATIENT AS AN AID IN ACCESSING THE DEGREE IN WHICH IT GENERATES TO HCC<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANALYSIS THE ALPHA-PROTEIN LEVEL IN HEPATITIS PATIENT AS AN AID IN ACCESSING THE DEGREE IN WHICH IT GENERATES TO HCC", "id": 15}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Micro-organisms are ubiquitous and are found in almost every area around human bodies.  Some are specifically found in certain regions of the body as a normal flora where they live as commensals with man.  This association is important in protecting the body against other infectious diseases.<br/>Each area of the body surface acquires a characteristic flora of organisms well adapted to growth at that particular environment.  These residents (normal flora) tend to suppress the intruders either by competition for space and food supply or by production of metabolites that are antagonistic to the survival of the intruder.<br/>These residents could be dislodged from their environment when sneezing, coughing, belching, yawning or could be destroyed by regular use of antiseptic soaps or creams on the body surfaces.<br/>Handkerchiefs often used in males for wiping face, closing of the mouth and nose when expressing these reflex activities, therefore constitute an abode for bacteria.  Furthermore, bacteria found in handkerchiefs could differ from one individual to another as the bacteria found could be a reflective of the environment and pathological conditions of the individual using the handkerchief.  For instance, individual with upper respiratory tract infection are likely to dislodge strains of pathogenic microbes along sides with the normal flora in these regions.<br/>Enumeration of bacteria on used handkerchief in males can be done using microscopic cell count and viable cell counting.  Microscopic counts can be done on either samples dried on slides or samples in liquid.  A viable cell counting is the one that is able to divide and form offspring.<br/>Viable cell counting is also called plate count and there are at least two ways of performing plate count: the spread plate and pour plate method.<br/>In spread plate method, a volume of appropriately diluted culture is spread over the surface of an agar plate using a sterile glass spreader.  The plate is then incubated until colonies appear, and the number of colonies formed are counted.<br/>In pour plate method, a known volume of culture is pipetted in a sterile petridish plate.  Molten agar medium is then added and mix well by gentle swirling of the plate on the bench top.  Because the sample is mixed with molten agar medium, the bacteria to be counted must be able to withstand brief temperature exposure to the temperature of the molten agar (45 - 50oC).  Here, the colonies formed are counted throughout the plate and not just on the agar surface as in the spread plate method.<br/>In identifying bacteria, the morphological and biochemical characteristics of the bacteria, are evaluated.  The appearance and the microscopic description of the bacteria are examined with the aid of a light compound microscope.<br/>From the growth of the bacteria (pure culture), the specimen to be viewed under the microscope can be prepared as a smear or as a wet mount.  A stain is used to contrast the specimen from the background.  This strain could be basic or acid stain.  Basic stain, example methylene blue and crystal violet, are cationic and have a positive charge.  They are ideal for staining chromosomes and the cell membrane of the bacterial.  The acid stains are anionic and have a negative charge, and are used to stain cytoplasmic material and organelles or inclusions.  Common examples are eosin and picric acid.<br/>There are two types of stains - simple and differential.  A simple stain has a single basic dye that is used to show shapes of cells and structures within a cell while a differential stain consists of two or more dyes and is used in the procedures to identify bacterial.  One of the most commonly used differential stain the gram stain.  Gram positive bacteria stain purple while Gram negative bacteria stain pink.  Other biochemical tests like Indole test, Urease test, Catalase reaction, Oxidase reaction etc will help in further characterization of the bacteria identified from the handkerchief.<br/><strong>            Identification of Gram-Positive Cocci</strong> <br/>Gram-positive cocci can be identified by the growth on blood and chocolate agar and the catalase test.  The catalase test is used to differentiate those bacteria that produce the enzymes catalase, such as staphylococcus from non-catalase producing bacteria such as streptococci.  For catalase positive, gram positive cocci, coagulase test could be used to further differentiate them.  <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> is coagulase positive whereas <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em> is negative to coagulase test.  Streptococci are catalase-negative gram-positive cocci and are further classified on the basis of their type of haemolysis, A (partial) and B (complete) haemolysis on blood agar, Alpha-haemolytic streptococci, <em>streptococca viridians</em> and <em>Streptococoal pneumonia</em> can be differentiated by the optochin disc susceptibility test.  The B-haemolytic streptococci are group according to the lancefield classification.<br/><strong>Identification of Gram-Negative Cocci</strong><br/>Members of this group can be identified using fermentation patterns.  In addition, catalase and oxidase tests can also be performed.  It can further be identified by growing them on Thayer-Martin medium and nutrient agar.</p>\n\nENUMERATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF BACTERIA ON USED HANDKERCHIEFS IN MALES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ENUMERATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF BACTERIA ON USED HANDKERCHIEFS IN MALES", "id": 16}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong> ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This work was carried out to investigate the effects of Burantashi extract on liver enzymes of albino male and female whistar rats.

Any abnormality involving these systems whether from medications or disease has a significant impact on the ability to develop and sustain erection; ejaculate and experience orgasm. (Laumann et al., 1999).</p> <p>The physiological process of erection begins in the brain and involves the nervous and vascular system. The chemicals that initiate erection are neurotransmitters present in the brain. Any kind of stimulation physical or psychological, causes nerves to send message to the vascular system which result in significant blood flow to the penis. Two arteries in the penis supply blood to erectile tissues and the corpora cavernous which become engorged and expand as a result of increased blood flow and pressures. Because blood must stay in the penis to maintain rigidity. An erectile tissue is enclosed by tunicae, which is fibrous elastic sheathes cinch which prevents blood leaving he    penis during electron. When muscle in the penis contract to stop the inflow of blood and open out flow channels and an electron is reserved.</p> <p>1.2  HORMONAL INVOLVEMENT IN ERECTION</p> <ul><li><strong>Oestrogen/Progesterone</strong>: (These are female hormones that cause clitoral erection. If the body has two much oestrogen and or too little testost erone, she ca n get very wet but can not erect her clitoral and G-spot. ( Haimen et al., 2002). Estrogen tends to increase the size of the bread, labia minors (inner lips) and clitoral hood, but shrinks the glans clitoris into the clitoral hood making it invisible. It also increases the thickness of the vaginal lining making the G-spot inaccessible. The mechanism of the clitoral and G-spot erection is the same as that of the penis. It is driven by the parasympathetic sexual nerve (The neurotransmitter acetylcholine) through the neurotransmitter. Nitric oxide and the erection dilator cGMP which is continuously powered by the burning of testosterone without a testosterone burst and burning. She cannot pop the glans Clitoris and G-spot out. If she is on birth control pills there is a chance that her body is over flooded by estrogens and low progesterone. Over loaded liver cannot produce sufficient essential enzymes to synthesize sufficient NO, cGMP and testosterone to support the clitoral and G-spot erection infact excessive estrogen or progesterone in the body will shrink the penis, clitoral and G-spot, but likely increase the breast size (under the excessive estrogen action).</li> </ul> <ul><li><strong>Testosterone:-</strong> Testosterone is a hormone produced by the testicles and is</li> </ul> <p>responsible for the proper development of male sexual characters. The pump helps the penis to become erect while band maintains the erection.</p> <p>Circulating levels of testosterone correlate with NO, production. Testosterone treatment can reduce central adiposity and insulin resistance, which may contribute to its beneficial effects on vascular NO, and ED. Raising low testosterone levels improves ED and can restore erectile function in response to PDE-5 inhibitors.</p> <p>1.3 MECHANISM  OF  ACTION  OF  PDE-5  INHIBITION  IN ERECTILE <strong>DY</strong><strong>SFUNCTION</strong></p> <p>A spinal reflex and the L-arginine nitric oxide guanglyl cyclase-cyclic guanosine monophonsphate (cGMP) pathway mediate smooth muscle relaxation that results in penile erection. Nerves and endothelial cells directly release nitric oxide in the penis, where it stimulates guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP and lowers intracellular calcium level. This triggers relaxation of arterial and trabecular smooth muscle, leading to arterial dilation, venous constriction, and erection. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) is the predominant phosphodiesterase in the corpus cavernosum. The catalytic site of PDE-5 normally degrades cGMP and PDE-5 inhibitors such as sildenafil potentiate endogenous increase in cGMP by inhibiting its breakdown at the catalytic site. Phosphorylation of PDE-5 increases its enzymatic activity as well as the affinity of its allosteric (noncatalytic/GAF domains) sites for  cGMP. Binding of cGMP to the allosteric site further stimulates enzymatic activity. Thus phosphorlation of PDE-5 and binding of cGMP to the non catalytic site mediate negative feed back regulation of  the cGMP pathway.</p> <p>In recent years a deeper understanding of the regulation of penile smooth muscle has led to greater insight into the physiology of normal erectile function and erectile dysfunction (ED), as well as the introduction of phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor for the treatment of ED. The oral PDE-5 inhibitors sidenafil has proved to be a safe and effective treatment for this disorder and has fostered further research into the underlying mechanisms of such drugs. This article will review the biochemical pathways involved in erection. The role of PDE-5 in these pathway and the molecular mechanisms involved in PDE activity.</p> <p>A penile erection result from the relaxation of smooth muscle in the penis .the process is mediated by a spinal reflex and incorporates sensory and mental stimuli. The Balance between factors that stimulate contraction and relaxation determines the tone of penile vasculature and the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum.</p> <p>In primates, including humans the L-arginine nitric oxide guanylyl cyclase cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway is the key mechanism of penile erection. Nitric oxide is produced from oxygen and L-arginine under the control of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Sexual arousal stimulates neural pathways that result in the release of NO from nerves and endothelial cells directly into the penis. NO penetrates into the cytoplasm of smooth muscle cells and binds to guanylyl cyclase. The interaction of NO with guanylyl cyclase causes a conformational change in the enzyme, which results in the catalytic production of 3,5 cyclic guanosine monophosphate from guanosine 5’triphosphate. Cyclic cGMP activities cGMP dependent protein kinase (PKG) which in turn phosphorylates several proteins. These protein kinase interactions results in reduced intraocular calcium levels and a consequent relaxation of arterial and trabecular smooth muscle leading to arterial dilation. Venous constriction and the rigidity of penile erection.</p> <p>Since cGMP plays a key role in this process, potential interventions for inadequate smooth muscle relaxation include increasing the  level  of intracellular cGMP. PDE-5 normally inhibits penile erection by degrading cGMP. This degradation occurs at the catalytic site in the presence of bound zinc. PDE-5 inhibitors lower the activity of PDE-5 by competing with cGMP and consequently raise the level of cGMP. In the absence of stimulation of the NO pathway. PDE-5 inhibition is ineffective in isolated strips of corpus c avernosum, sildenafil relaxes the smooth muscle by amplifying the  effects of the normal, endogenous cGMP- dependent relaxation mechanisms but produces little effect in the absence of a NO donor. Since sexual arousal stimulates this pathway specifically in the penis, PDE-5 inhibitor has a relatively small effect on smooth muscle in other tissues.</p> <p>PDE-5 is the predominant phosphodiesterase in the corpus carvernosum, however, at least 11 families of PDE have been identified in mammals, some</p> <p>PDE types are associated with more than one gene and some mRNA exhibit two or more splice variants. The result is more than 50 species of PDE. Some types of PDE are specific for either cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cGMP) or cGMP, and some degrade both PDE, for example degrades both cGMP and cGMP. Whereas PDE-4 is specific for Camp-5 and PDE-5 is specific for cGMP. The cross reactivity of PDE inhibitors can be attributed largely to similarities of their homologous catalytic domain. Messager RNA has been detected in human corpus cavernosum tissue for the human PDE isoforms-PDE-1A, PDE-1B, PDE- 1C, PDE-2A, PDE-3A, PDE-4A, PDE-4B, PDE-4C, PDE-4D, PDE-5A, PDE-</p> <p>7A, PDE-8A, and PDE-9A. Most mammalian PDEs are dimers but the functional significance of this dimerization is unknown, some like PDE5, have two identical submits (homodimers) and some like PDE-6 have two different submits  (heterodimers).</p> <p>The PDE-5 also differs in the nature of the regulatory domain of the enzyme and in the role of phosphorylation. In all cases, the catalytic domain is located towards the carboxylterminus and the regulatory domain is located towards the amino terminus. A PDE-5 monomeric fragment retains the essential catalytic features of the domain full length enzyme.</p> <p>1.4 NITRIC OXIDE REGULATION OF PENILE ERECTION</p> <p><strong>Biology And Therapeutic Implications</strong></p> <p>For approximately a decade now, substantial evidence has accrued supporting nitric oxide (NO) as the central component of major  signal transduction system that ats in the penis to mediate the erectile response. This molecules subserve a Unique           biochemical   cascade              invading   production of   the   potent      second messenger  molecule,  3’5’  cyclic  guanosine  monophosphate  (cGMP)  and  its activation of protein kinase G (PKG) which induces physiologic penile erection by regulating the state of penile smooth muscle contractility (Burnett, 1997). In fact, current data support the notion that this NO based biochemical cascade represent a convergence of cellular biochemical and molecular inputs, which on the signal transduction regulatory level, is indispensable for the mechanism of penile erection (Hedland et al., 2000). Consistent with the importance of NO radiation of penile erection, its biology in the penis is quite complex, involving multiple                 regulatory interactions,     the   molecule   itself   may  target   several biochemical mechanisms that achieve erectile tissue relaxation     but is also the target of a host of modulatory influences that determines its release and mode of action  in  erectile  tissue. At              the  same time,  premier  signal  transduction mechanism  has  been  exploited  for  therapeutic  purposes,  specifically  in  the clinical management of erectile dysfunction. Discoveries pertaining to the field of NO biology in the penis have, in recent years been rapidly translated into the clinical management of the first orally effective pharmacotherapy for erectile dysfunction, sildenafil citrate (Viagra) (Goldstein et al., 1998).</p> <p>NO BIOLOGY IN THE PENIS</p> <p>Traditional understanding of the action of NO in the penis invokes the constitutive formation of this molecule under normal physiologic conditions with the expression and activities of the enzyme, sources localized to neural and endothelial components of the corporal tissue. The verification that NO derives from the autonomic innervations supplying the penis has directly supported the description of this molecule as a peripheral neurotransmitter of non adrenergic, no cholinergic-1992 mediated penile erection (Kim et al.,1991) the confirmation that the molecule also is produced within vascular and trabecular endothelium comprising the penile vascular supply, has offered additional support for the role of NO serving as an endothelial  relaxation factor of penile erection (kimoto et al., 1990, knispel et al., 1991, azadzoic et al., 1992, Hedlund et al., 2000).</p> <p>1.5 ATIEOLOGY OF ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION</p> <p>Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a sexual dysfunction that affects the reproductive systems of both men and women.</p> <p>According to the definition by national Institute of Health consensus Development (NIHCD) panel on importance (1993) in males. It is sexual dysfunction characterized with the inability to develop or maintain an erection of the penis sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. It is also known as male impotence or Baby D syndrome. While in women according to American psychiatric Association (APA) (1994), it is characterized with the persistant or recurrent inability to attain, or maintain until completion of the sexual activity, an adequate lubrication. Swelling response that otherwise is present during fem ale sexual arousal and sexual activity is thus prevented. Hence it is called woman impotence or female erectile dysfunction. (NIH, 2005).</p> <p>The word importance may also be used to describe other problems that interfere with sexual intercourse and reproduction, such as lack of sexual desire and problems with ejaculation or orgasm. Using the term “erectile dysfunction however, makes it clear that those other problems are not involved (NIH, 2005)</p> <p>An erection occurs as a hydraulic effect due to blood entering and being retained in sponge-like bodies within the penis and clitoris. The process is most often than not initiated as a result of sexual arousal, when signals are transmitted from the brain to nerves in the pelvis erectile dysfunction  is therefore, indicated when an erection is consistently difficult or impossible to produce despite arousal (Laumann  et al., 1999).</p> <p>1.6 PREVALENCE OF ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION IN MEN.</p> <p>Erectile dysfunction ED, varies in severity; some men have a total inability to achieve an erection others have inconsistent ability to achieve an erection, and still others can sustain only brief erection. The variation in severity of erectile dysfunction makes estimating its frequency difficult. Many men also are reluctant to discuss erectile dysfunction with their doctors, and thus, the condition is under diagnosed nevertheless experts have estimated that ED affects 30 million men   in united sates, Again, according to the   statistical research carried out by Adegunloye and Eze in 2002 and 1994 respectively in Nigeria, results show that about 23-26.5% of men suffer from this condition while according to carey in 1990, discovered that about 4.9% of men suffer from the condition in the united states.</p> <p>While erectile dysfunction can occur at any age, it is uncommon among young men and more common in the elderly. By the age of 45, most men have experienced erectile dysfunction at least some of the time. According to Massachusetts, male Aging study, complete impotence increase from 5% among men 40 years of age to 15% men 70 years and older. Population studies conducted in Netherlands found out that some degree of ED occurred in 20% men between 50-54 and in 50% of men between ages 70-78. In 1998, the National Ambulatory Medical care survey (NAMCS) counted 1,520,000 doctor offices visited  for erectile dysfunction (ED).</p> <p>1.7 PREVALENCE OF ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION IN WOMEN.</p> <p>Erection dysfunction which is known as female erectile dysfunction in woman occurs about 43% of American women (NIH consensus conference, 1993). And this medical condition is a persistent or recurrent inability to attain or maintain clitoral erection until completion of the sexual activity, an adequate lubrication. Swelling response that is normally present during female sexual arousal and sexual activity is therefore absent. The individual having the condition  is  said  to  experience  frigidity  (American  Psychiatric  Association, 1994). Again according to Otuba et al in 1989, about 8.7% of women suffer from this very condition in the United States while between 35.3-40%, according t o Adegunloye in 2002 and Eze in 1994 of women in Nigeria suffer from this condition. Spector and carey in 1994 reported 5-10% in the united states.</p> <p>In addition, female erectile dysfunction occurs at any age but majorly in old age. Hence, the most significant age related change is menopause (Karen, 2002) and (Rod et al., 2008).</p> <p>However erectile dysfunction may be caused by diabetes, a atherosclerosis, hormonal imbalance, neurological problems e.t.c (Organic causes) or stress depression e.t.c (Psychological causes).</p> <p>Besides treating the underlying causes (Organic or Psychological), the first line treatment of ED consist of a trail of phosphodiesterase 5’(PDE-5) inhibitor (The first of which was sildenafil or Viagra). In some cases, treatment can involve prostaglandin tablets in the urethra, intracarvenous injection with a fine needle into the penis or clitoris that causes swelling, a penis or Clitoris prosthesis, a penis or clitoris pump or vascular surgery, estrogens replacement therapy for the women e.t.c (Kendric et al., 2005).</p> <p>1.8 AIM OF STUDY</p> <p>The aim of this research is to find out the effects of Barantashi.

Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) is an important food crop in the tropical and sub-tropical countries and belongs to the family convolvulaceae. Sweet potatoes are rich in dietary fiber, minerals, vitamins, and anti oxidants such as phenolic acids, anthocyannins, tocopherol and β-carotene. The proximate composition of sweet potato was determined and these include moisture, lipids, ash, protein, carbohydrates and fiber. In carrying out the analysis practically, methods used vary according to the food material. The anti oxidants were also determined alongside with phenol oxidase, pasting properties, minerals and sugar contents. Sorghum is a tropical plant belonging to the family of poaceae. More than 35% of sorghum is grown for human consumption. The analyses carried out in sweet potatoes are same with sorghum with the exclusion of phenol oxidase.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) is an important food crop in the tropical and sub tropical countries and belongs to the family convolvulaceae. It is cultivated in more than 100 countries. ( Woolfe, 1992). Nigeria is the third largest producer in the world with china leading, followed by Uganda. Sweet potato ranks seventh among the world food crops, third in value of production and fifth in caloric contribution to human diet (Bouwkamp, 1985). Sweet potatoes are rich in dietary fibre, minerals, vitamins and anti oxidants such as phenolic acids, anthocyanins, tocopherol and ß- carotene. Besides acting as anti oxidants, carotenoids and phenolic compounds also provide sweet potatoes with their distinctive flesh colours ( cream, deep yellow, orange and purple). Sweet potato blends with rice, cowpea and plantain in nigerian diets. It is also becoming popular as a substitute to yam and garri. It can be reconstituted into fofoo or blended with other carbohydrate flour sources such as wheat ( Triticum aestivum) and cassava ( Manihot esculenta) for baking bread, biscuits and other confectioneries (Woolfe, 1992).</p> <p>The leaves are rich in protein and the orange flesh varieties contain high beta carotene and are very important in combating vitamin A deficiency especially in children.</p> <p>Sorghum (sorghum bicolor (S. bicolor) is a tropical plant belonging to the family of poaceae, is one of the most important crops in Africa, Asia and Latin America. More than 35% of sorghum is grown directly for human consumption. The rest is used primarily for animal feed, alcohol production and industrial products ( FAO, 1995). The current annual production of 60 million tons is increasing due to the introduction of improved varieties and breeding conditions. Several improved sorghum varieties adapted to semi-arid tropic environments are released every year by sorghum breeders. Selection of varieties meeting specific local food and industrial requirements from this great biodiversity is of high importance for food security. In developing countries in general and particularly in West Africa demand for sorghum is increasing. This is due to not only the growing population but also to the countries policy to enhance its processing and industrial utilization.</p> <p>More than 7000 sorghum varieties have been identified, therefore there is a need of their further characterization to the molecular level with respect to food quality. The acquisition of good quality grain is fundamental to produce acceptable food products from sorghum. Sorghum while playing a crucial role in food security in Africa, it is also a source of income of household . In West Africa, ungerminated sorghum grains are generally used for the preparation of “to”, porridge and couscous. Malted sorghum is used in the process of local beer “dolo” (reddish, cloudy or opaque), infant porridge and non fermented beverages. Sorghum grains like all cereals are comprised primarily of starch.</p> <p>The aim and objective of this work is to obtain diet low in sugars, with enriched nutrients intended for diabetics.</p> \n\nEFFECTS OF PROCESSING METHODS ON THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF SWEET POTATO AND SORGHUM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF PROCESSING METHODS ON THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF SWEET POTATO AND SORGHUM", "id": 18}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  ABSTRACT </p> <p>This work was carried out to investigate the effects of Burantashi extract on liver enzymes of albino male and female whistar rats.

Nitric oxide and the erection dilator cGMP, which is continuously powered by the burning of testosterone without a testosterone burst and burning. She cannot pop the glans Clitoris and G-spot out. If she is on birth control pills there is a chance that her body is over flooded by estrogens and low progesterone. Over loaded liver cannot produce sufficient essential enzymes to synthesize sufficient NO, cGMP and testosterone to support the clitoral and G-spot erection infact excessive estrogen or progesterone in the body will shrink the penis, clitoral and G-spot, but likely increase the breast size (under the excessive estrogen action).</p> <p>Testosterone:- Testosterone is a hormone produced by the testicles and is responsible for the proper development of male sexual characters. The pump helps the penis to become erect while band maintains the erection.</p> <p>Circulating levels of testosterone correlate with NO, production. Testosterone treatment can reduce central adiposity and insulin resistance, which may contribute to its beneficial effects on vascular NO, and ED. Raising low testosterone levels improves ED and can restore erectile function in response to PDE-5 inhibitors.</p> <p><strong>MECHANISM OF ACTION OF PDE-5 INHIBITION IN ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION.</strong><br/>A spinal reflex and the L-arginine nitric oxide guanglyl cyclase-cyclic guanosine monophonsphate (cGMP) pathway mediate smooth muscle relaxation that results in penile erection. Nerves and endothelial cells directly release nitric oxide in the penis, where it stimulates guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP and lowers intracellular calcium level. This triggers relaxation of arterial and trabecular smooth muscle, leading to arterial dilation, venous constriction, and erection. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) is the predominant phosphodiesterase in the corpus cavernosum. The catalytic site of PDE-5 normally degrades cGMP and PDE-5 inhibitors such as sildenafil potentiate endogenous increase in cGMP by inhibiting its breakdown at the catalytic site. Phosphorylation of PDE-5 increases its enzymatic activity as well as the affinity of its allosteric (noncatalytic/GAF domains) sites for cGMP. Binding of cGMP to the allosteric site further stimulates enzymatic activity. Thus phosphorlation of PDE-5 and binding of cGMP to the non catalytic site mediate negative feed back regulation of the cGMP pathway.</p> <p>In recent years a deeper understanding of the regulation of penile smooth muscle has led to greater insight into the physiology of normal erectile function and erectile dysfunction (ED), as well as the introduction of phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor for the treatment of ED. The oral PDE-5 inhibitors sidenafil has proved to be a safe and effective treatment for this disorder and has fostered further research into the underlying mechanisms of such drugs. This article will review the biochemical pathways involved in erection. The role of PDE-5 in these pathway and the molecular mechanisms involved in PDE activity.</p> <p>A penile erection result from the relaxation of smooth muscle in the penis .the process is mediated by a spinal reflex and incorporates sensory and mental stimuli. The Balance between factors that stimulate contraction and relaxation determines the tone of penile vasculature and the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum.</p> <p>In primates, including humans the L-arginine nitric oxide guanylyl cyclase cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway is the key mechanism of penile erection. Nitric oxide is produced from oxygen and L-arginine under the control of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Sexual arousal stimulates neural pathways that result in the release of NO from nerves and endothelial cells directly into the penis. NO penetrates into the cytoplasm of smooth muscle cells and binds to guanylyl cyclase. The interaction of NO with guanylyl cyclase causes a conformational change in the enzyme, which results in the catalytic production of 3,5 cyclic guanosine monophosphate from guanosine 5’triphosphate. Cyclic cGMP activities cGMP dependent protein kinase (PKG) which in turn phosphorylates several proteins. These protein kinase interactions results in reduced intraocular calcium levels and a consequent relaxation of arterial and trabecular smooth muscle leading to arterial dilation. Venous constriction and the rigidity of penile erection.</p> <p>Since cGMP plays a key role in this process, potential interventions for inadequate smooth muscle relaxation include increasing the level of intracellular cGMP. PDE-5 normally inhibits penile erection by degrading cGMP. This degradation occurs at the catalytic site in the presence of bound zinc. PDE-5 inhibitors lower the activity of PDE-5 by competing with cGMP and consequently raise the level of cGMP. In the absence of stimulation of the NO pathway. PDE-5 inhibition is ineffective in isolated strips of corpus c avernosum, sildenafil relaxes the smooth muscle by amplifying the effects of the normal, endogenous cGMP- dependent relaxation mechanisms but produces little effect in the absence of a NO donor. Since sexual arousal stimulates this pathway specifically in the penis, PDE-5 inhibitor has a relatively small effect on smooth muscle in other tissues.</p> <p>PDE-5 is the predominant phosphodiesterase in the corpus carvernosum, however, at least 11 families of PDE have been identified in mammals, some PDE types are associated with more than one gene and some mRNA exhibit two or more splice variants. The result is more than 50 species of PDE. Some types of PDE are specific for either cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cGMP) or cGMP, and some degrade both PDE, for example degrades both cGMP and cGMP. Whereas PDE-4 is specific for Camp-5 and PDE-5 is specific for cGMP. The cross reactivity of PDE inhibitors can be attributed largely to similarities of their homologous catalytic domain. Messager RNA has been detected in human corpus cavernosum tissue for the human PDE isoforms-PDE-1A, PDE-1B, PDE-1C, PDE-2A, PDE-3A, PDE-4A, PDE-4B, PDE-4C, PDE-4D, PDE-5A, PDE-7A, PDE-8A, and PDE-9A. Most mammalian PDEs are dimers but the functional significance of this dimerization is unknown, some like PDE5, have two identical submits (homodimers) and some like PDE-6 have two different submits (heterodimers).</p> <p>The PDE-5 also differs in the nature of the regulatory domain of the enzyme and in the role of phosphorylation. In all cases, the catalytic domain is located towards the carboxylterminus and the regulatory domain is located towards the amino terminus. A PDE-5 monomeric fragment retains the essential catalytic features of the domain full length enzyme.</p>\n\nPRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION ON EFFECTS OF BURANTASHI EXTRACT ON LIVER ENZYMES OF ALBINO MALE AND FEMALE WHISTAR RATS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION ON EFFECTS OF BURANTASHI EXTRACT ON LIVER ENZYMES OF ALBINO MALE AND FEMALE WHISTAR RATS", "id": 20}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p>The research on Mucuna pruriens was to know its ameliorative efficacy on the kidney markers of malaria infected mice. The antimalaria effect was evaluated against Plasmodium berghei stain of 25 mice.The twenty five (25) adult albino mice of both sexes which weighed 20g-36g were grouped into five(1-5) of five mice per group which was used to carry out the experiment. Group 1 which served as negative control received 10ml/kg of 5% tween 80,group 2, which is positive or standard control received 0.95mg/kg of standard drug (ACT), groups 3, 4 and 5 received 100mg/kg, 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg body weight of the extract of Mucuna pruriens respectively. Malaria was induced using Plasmodium berghei in which the malaria infected mice were examined for parasitemia on day 4 and 8 of the treatment. The creatinine, bilirubin and serum urea levels were determined using Randox and Teco kits .The curative percentage of  the animals in groups (1-5) were  recorded. In day 4, The curative percentage were 0%, 41.43%, 39.34%, 46.1% and 67.93% respectively and  day 8 values are as follows 28.13%, 97.19%, 87.70%, 80% and 95.19%. The values for kidney markers in days 4 for Urea were (44.00                    9.79, 36   40  , 35   and 46.67  , creatinine values (0.62   2.62   4.46   3.13  2.53  ) and bilirubin values (21.9  1.41, 21.4  and 22.43   while the values in day 8 for Urea were (40.00   and 45.00   and creatinine values were (24.26  and 23.93   while that of bilirubin were (24.26  and 23.93  for groups (1-5) respectively. The research showed that the extract can cure malaria without affecting the kidney markers and can be added in formulating antimalaria drugs. </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0    </strong><strong>                             INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    </strong><strong>Background of the Study.</strong></p> <p>A medical plant can be described as any plant in which one or more of its organs contains substances that can be used for therapeutic purposes or which are materials for the synthesis of useful drugs (WHO, 2011). Medical plants are very ancient and only true natural medicines have been found useful in several ways. They can be used directly or in other extracted forms for the management of various ailments. They can also be used as agents or starting materials in the synthesis of drugs (Harbone, 2003).</p> <p>Medical herbs and plant extracts are now generally considered as effective medicines to be respected, appreciated and they play a major role in modern pharmacy (Cunningham, 1993)</p> <p>The use of herbs is very common in developing countries, particularly in rural settings. However, during the last decade, an increase in the use of plant has been observed in metropolitan areas of development countries (Harnack ,Jeffery and Boutelle, 2001)</p> <p>Plants are extensively used to treat malaria caused by different species of plasmodium. Malaria is the worldwide most important parasitic disease with an incidence of almost 400-900 millions clinical cases and approximately one to three million death annually (Sachs and Malaney, 2002).</p> <p>       It is endemic in about 100 developing countries. Worse still, malaria parasite have developed defenses against many anti malaria drugs and many insecticide (WHO, 2011). The newly produced effective anti malaria drugs are expensive, especially for most poor Nigerians to afford. Chemotherapy with effective anti malaria drugs remain the main method to control of malaria in the absence of a suitable vaccine treatment (WHO, 2011). Coupled with the human preference for natural therapies, the knowledge of traditional medicine to combat malaria and other fevers was widely diffused among  the needed for these traditional remedies were accessible free at the background or at very cheap rates and can be self prepared at home. Malaria is a disease caused by parasitic microbes (plasmodium species) spread by the female anopheles mosquitoes (Fisher and Bialek, 2002). Plasmodium falciparum resistance to commonly used anti-malaria drugs is rising rapidly in Nigeria and other parts of Africa (Collins and Barnwell, 2009). This has resulted in insurgence in transmission and an increase in adverse outcomes due to therapy failure. In fact, this loss of effectiveness of chemotherapy constitutes the greatest threat to the control of malaria. He world Health Organization has estimated that funding for malaria control alone, including only existing method for vector control, will need to increase to 3.1billion annually by 2015 (WHO, 2004). Effect of plasmodium falciparum varies from a symptomatic to multi organ manifestation, which could lead to death of victim (Zaki, et al., 2013). Malaria has been implicated as one of the factors responsible for renal and hepatic dysfunction in malaria endemic area countries (Mishra et al., 2013, Ogbadoyi et al., 2007, Sharma et al., 2004). The malaria parasites usually affect the kidney, liver and brain (Dzeing-Ella et al., 2005).</p> <p>The level of severity of malaria infection can be determined by both renal and hepatic malfunction. The clinical manifestation of renal involvement is associated with infection by plasmodium falciparum and plasmodium malariae (Naqvi et al., 2003), and may be responsible for an immune complex medicated glomerular disease leading to nephritic syndrome. Other implications range from urinary sediment abnormalities, mild protienuria and electrolyte changes acute renal failure with metabolic acidosis (Padhi and Mishra, 2012).</p> <p>Malaria has been reported to be one of the factor responsible for acute renal failure among children in malaria endemic areas (Mockenhaupt, Beeson and Marsh, 2004), and this adverse effect of malaria parasite on the kidney could lead to an increase in blood urea, hypernareamia, hyper-Kalaemia, low urine specific gravity, metabolic acidosis and low ratio of urinary to blood urea (Padhi and Mishra, 2012)</p> <p>The sudden increase in the urea level and imbalance in the electrolytes level such as sodium, potassium, bicarbonate and chloride in malaria infected people could serve as indicators for kidney dysfunction (Uzuegbu, 2011, Ebele et al., 2010, Jasani, Hellgren and Rombo, 2012).</p> <p>Mucuna pruriens is a tropical legume known as velvet beans, devil beans, Mucuna, Nescafe and buffalo bean. Other common names includes Yerepe (Yoruba) and Agbala (Igbo) (Uzuegbu, 2011)</p> <p> The leaves of Mucuna pruriens are also used in the management of ulcer, cephalgia and general debility. The seeds have been known to contain large amount of protein and  mineral and with high calorific value, but also with high level of antinutritive properties such as phenolics, tannins,L-dopa, trypsin inhibitors, and phytohaemaglutinins. The seed also contain glutathione lecithin, gallic acid, nicotine, prurenidine and 4-tetra isoquinoline alkaloids (Mishra and Wagner, 2004) and as such are used as astringent, laxative, antiheminthic, aphrodisiac in the cotyledon of the seed, was found to increase the brain mitochondria complex activity and thus has been attributed to the effects as such has been useful in the management of parkinson’s disease (Jacobsen, 1993).</p> <p><strong>1.2          Statement of the Problem.</strong></p> <p>Even though pharmacological industries have produced a number of new antimalaria drugs in the last three decades, resistance to these drugs by microorganisms have increased. Current work was undertaken to investigate the ameliorative efficacy of the extract of the leaves of Mucuna pruriens on kidney markers of malaria infected mice.   </p> <p><strong>1.3  Aims/Objectives of the study.</strong></p> <p>This includes to get extract from the leaves of Mucuna pruriens using methanol and subsequently to test the ameliorative efficacy of the extract on the kidney markers of malaria infected mice using different doses of the extract. </p> <p><strong>1.4          Specific Objective.</strong></p> <p>1.  To get extract from the leaves of Mucuna pruriens at Ekwulobia Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State. </p> <p>2. To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Mucuna pruriens methanol leaf extract on malaria infected mice.</p> <p>3.  To investigate the effect of the extract on kidney markers of mice.   </p> <p><strong>1.5   Significance of the study.</strong></p> <p>This research was done to assess therapeutic antimalaria agents from Mucuna pruriens. It was envisaged to lay down the groundwork for enhancing traditional knowledge and practices through modern approaches of drug development. The study is also aimed at contributing to scientific knowledge locally, nationally and internationally in the area of malaria disease. </p> <p>The result of this study will determine the antimalaria activity of Mucuna pruriens to plasmodium species involved in malaria. And if the results are favourable then consumption of Mucuna pruriens will be advocated, which is safer than consumption of medical drugs which often have side effect to the individuals taking them, as a preventive therapy (since it raises the immune system of the individuals involved).  </p> <p><strong>1.6  Scope of the study.</strong></p> <p>This includes obtaining the leaf samples from Ekwulobia Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State, preparing the samples for extraction and extraction using methanol ,subsequently the ameliorative efficacy of the extract will be tested on kidney markers of malaria infected mice using Plasmodium breghei parasite and 25 albino mice. </p> <p><strong>1.7   Research questions.</strong></p> <p>1.  How can extract be obtained from the leaf samples of Mucuna pruriens obtained from Ekwulobia Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State?</p> <p>2.  How can the antimalaria activity of Mucuna pruriens methanol leaf extract on malaria infected mice be evaluated.</p> <p>3.  How can the effect of the extract on kidney markers of mice be investigated? </p>\n\nAMMELIORATIVE PROPERTIES OF METHANOL LEAF EXTRACT OF MUCUNA PRURIENS ON THE KIDNEY MARKERS OF MALARIA INFECTED MICE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AMMELIORATIVE PROPERTIES OF METHANOL LEAF EXTRACT OF MUCUNA PRURIENS ON THE KIDNEY MARKERS OF MALARIA INFECTED MICE", "id": 21}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This work was carried out to investigate the chemical properties of the water extract of zobo (Hibiscus sabdariffa) drink using the modern atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Zobo drink is a popular drink in the Nigeria, especially in the northern part of Nigeria. The result of the analysis indicated that the drink is high in vital mineral nutrients required for the healthy growth by humans and for the proper metabolic processes to be adequately maintained. Zobo drink is high, as indicated in the result, in iron – a major component of the human haemoglobin, when compared with other leaf like the popular vegetable leaf known as awa (Piper methysticum).</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0  INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Toward the end of the 20th century epidemiological studies and associated meta-analyses suggested strongly that long-term consumption of diets rich in plant foods offered some protection against chronic diseases, especially cancer (Wallstromet al., 2000).Because uncontrolled production of free radicals was thought to be significantly implicated in the etiology of cancer (Guyton and Kensler 1993),these observations focused attention on the possible role of radical scavenging and radical suppressing nutrients and non-nutrients in explaining the apparent benefit of such diets (Weisburger, 1991).</p> <p>The realization that free radicals were similarly implicated in the etiology of many other chronic diseases (Kehrer, 1993 and Stohs, 1995), immediately focused attention on flavonoids and the foods and beverages rich therein. An unfortunate, but unintended side effect of some research works and papers was the misleading tendency of many investigators to think of dietary phenols, polyphenols, and tannins (PPT)as encompassing only the flavonoids, flavonols, and flavones. More recent epidemiological studies have supported the association between better health and long-term consumption of diets rich in foods of plant origin(Hung et al., 2004 and Jansen et al., 2004).However, whether this is because such diets minimize exposure to deleterious substances (example oxidized cholesterol, pyrolysis mutagens, salt, saturated fat, etc.), or maximize intake of certain beneficial nutrients (example isothiocyanates and other sulfur-containing plant constituents, mono-unsaturated fattyacids, and poly-unsaturated fatty acids, PPT, polyacetylenes, selenium, terpenes, etc.) or some combination as advocated in the ‘‘Polymeal’’ concept, remains unknown (Franco et al., 2004 and Johnson, 2004).An in vitro study indicates that there may be mechanistic basis for true synergy between PPT and isothiocyanates. In contrast, more recent studies seeking to assess the suggested link between the consumption of flavonols and flavones, or other flavonoids, have given much less consistent results. Some studies have suggested a possible protective effect of flavonoids against vascular diseases (Hirvonen et al., 2001 and Mennen et al., 2004) or certain (but not all) cancers(Knekt et al., 1997 and Sun et al., 2002).Interestingly, an investigation of the relationship between the consumption of Hibiscus sabdariffa (zobo) and other cruciferous vegetables and the risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women has to be carried out in order to ascertain the beneficial effects to isothiocyanates and/or the phenolic components of the plants (like the dietary phenols including flavonoids) in the management of cancer growth and initiation of various types of diabetes.</p> <p>In the same time period, various studies have suggested beneficial effect associated with raised consumption of other classes of dietary phenols. For example, increased coffee consumption has been linked with reduced incidence of type II diabetes (van Dam et al., 2002 and Saremi et al., 2003).Similarly, increased consumption of lignans (or at least greater plasma concentrations of their metabolites)has been linked with reduced incidence of estrogen-related cancers in some (Boccardo et al., 2004 and McCann et al., 2004) but not all studies (Kilkkinen et al., 2004 and Zeleniuch –Jacquotte et al., 2004),and a prospective study was equivocal.</p> <p>1.1       SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH</p> <p>The flavonoids in the water extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa should be extracted for further experimental and clinical research in the management of certain ailments and disorders like cancer, diabetes mellitus etc.</p> <p>The mechanisms of flavonoid-protein interactions have been determined; it is my suggestion that such mechanisms should be carried to the in-vivo metabolic and physiological processes aimed at determining the detailed mechanisms involved in cells aging processes and the progression of diseases.</p> <p>1.2       OBJECTIVE OF STUDY</p> <p>The objective of this study is to determine the physico chemical (biochemical) and water constituent of Zobo produced from dried calyces of Hibiscus sabdariffa (Linn Roselle). Using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS).

The first set of samples labelled (D) was obtained from areas where diesel from the refinery spilled into the environment and the second set of samples labelled (P) was collected from areas where petrol leaked and spilled into the environment. The pH of the soil was found to be 5.9 and 6.2 for D and P samples respectively. The cation exchange capacity (CEC) was higher in sample P than in sample D (32.0 and 30.0 mmol/kg of soil respectively). P has high concentrations of cations ( Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and Na+ with concentration values 3.6, 1.17, 0.50 and 0.22 mol/kg respectively) because of its high CEC while sample D with a lower CEC has a lower concentration of cation (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and Na+ with concentration values 1.20, 0.27, 0.25 and 0.17 mol/kg respectively). The oil (contaminant) was extracted in dichloromethane and a GC-MS analysis was run to determine the nature (composition) of the oil and the concentration of the contaminant was determined using gravimetric method. Results revealed that the total concentration of the contaminant (oil) before treatment was 398 g/kg and 194 g/kg for sample D and P respectively. The GC-MS results obtained showed that in both samples (D and P) linear and branched alkanes(n-Tetratetracontane, 3,6-Dimethyldecane, n-Pentadecane, 2-Bromodecane, n-Heptadecane etc. and n-Tetradecane, 2-Bromododecane, n-Octadecane, 14-Methyl-8-hexadecenal etc. respectively) were the main contaminants. Bioremediation was initiated and examined by applying separately fertilizer (F), bacteria inoculation (B), emulsifier (E) on the contaminated soil and by combining bacteria inoculation and fertilizer (B and F), fertilizer and emulsifier (F and E), bacteria inoculation and emulsifier (B and E) also a combination of bacteria inoculation, emulsifier and fertilizer (B,E and F) on both sample D and P . Bioremediation was determined by weight lost method throughout the 28days of treatment and the trend of degradation is thus: (B, E and F) &gt; B &gt; ( B and E ) &gt; (B and F) &gt; (E and F) &gt; E &gt; F. Results obtained showed that treatment with B,E and F combined together yielded the highest percentage of oil degradation (97%, and 95% for samples P and D respectively), followed by B (96% and 81% for samples D and P respectively). This finding suggests that Bacillus sp is a viable microbial strain for bioremediation of oil-contaminated soil when biostimulated by adding fertilizer combined with emulsification (B, E and F). The percentage of oil degraded in sample P and D are almost the same (97 and 95% respectively) and there is significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) in the trend of degradation for D and P this may be because, even though the samples contained oil (contaminant) with almost the same composition but differ in the number of carbon chain and other physical factors like density, viscosity etc.</p> <p><strong>Background Study</strong></p> <p>One of the major environmental problems in the world today is hydrocarbon contamination resulting from the activities related to the petrochemical industry. In Nigeria, oil pollution problems have been prevalent since the commencement of oil exploration and development of the petroleum industry (Okoh et al., 2001). Accidental release of petroleum products are of particular concern in the environment. Hydrocarbon components have been known to belong to the family of carcinogens and neurotoxic organic pollutants. Currently accepted disposal methods of incineration or burial insecure landfills can become prohibitively expensive when amounts of contaminants are large. The deleterious effect of pollutants on the environment has led to increased awareness and vigilance against contamination of the Niger Delta environment. In relatively recent times in Nigeria, there has been remarkable increase in population, urbanization and industrial activities, (Eze and Okpokwasili, 2010). The release of crude oil into the environment by oil spills is receiving worldwide attention (Millioli et al., 2009). Bioremediation which has been defined as biological response to environmental abuse has continued to receive research attention across the globe (Hammer, 1993). Bioremediation has been described as the use of living microorganisms to degrade environmental pollution. In order words, it is a technology for removing pollutants from the environment thus restoring the original natural environment (Sasikuma and Papmazath, 2003). The long term aim of bioremediation designs is to present cost effective designs which reduces the pollutant to a level referred to as low as reasonable and practicably possible (ALARP). In order to achieve this cost effectiveness, researchers all over the world have begun to pay research attention to the use of organic waste as the source of limiting nutrients for effective bioremediation (Ibiene et al., 2011).</p> <p>Mechanical and chemical methods generally used to remove hydrocarbons from contaminated sites have limited effectiveness and can be expensive (Das and Chandran, 2011). Bioremediation is the promising technology for the treatment of these contaminated sites since it is cost-effective and will lead to complete mineralization. Bioremediation functions basically on biodegradation, which may refer to complete mineralization of organic contaminants into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds, and cell protein or transformation of complex organic contaminants to other simpler organic compounds by biological agents like microorganisms (Das and Preethy, 2010). Many indigenous microorganisms in water and soil are capable of degrading hydrocarbon contaminants.</p>\n\nBIOREMEDIATION OF OIL-CONTAMINATED SOIL USING EMULSIFIER (LIQUID SOAP), NPK FERTILIZER AND MICROBIAL (BACILLUS SP) TREATMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " BIOREMEDIATION OF OIL-CONTAMINATED SOIL USING EMULSIFIER (LIQUID SOAP), NPK FERTILIZER AND MICROBIAL (BACILLUS SP) TREATMENT", "id": 25}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Malaria is a major public health problem and cause of much suffering and premature death in the poorer areas of tropical Africa, Asia and Latin America particularly among young children (Cheesbrough, 2010). Children under five years of age are one of the most vulnerable groups affected by malaria. There was an estimated 438,000 malaria deaths around the world in 2015 of which approximately 69% were in children under five years of age. In high transmission areas, partial immunity to the disease is acquired during childhood. In such settings, the majority of malarial disease and particularly severe disease with rapid progression to death occurs in young children without acquired immunity. Severe anaemia, hypoglycaemia and cerebral malaria are features of malaria more commonly seen in children than in adults (WHO 2016).</p> <p>Malaria is an infection caused by parasites of the <em>Plasmodium </em>species. There are four major species of the parasite that infect man. These are <em>P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale </em>and <em>P. malariae. P.

Diets containing processed finger millet seed (71.4g) per 100g feed were fed to four different groups of weaner rabbit for 56days. Animals’ fed diet containing unprocessed finger millet seed were used as negative  control group and animals’ fed diet containing casein (standard protein) were used as positive control group respectively. Effect of processing methods like soaking, boiling, fermenting and roasting on the finger millet seeds significantly (p&lt;0.05) reduced the anti-nutrient substances like tannins, saponins, phytate and oxalate when compared with their values from the unprocessed finger millet seed. Protein quality parameter’s observed in the animals fed diet containing processed finger millet seeds like True Digestibity (TD), Biological Value (BV) and Net Protein Utilization (NPU) increased in the following order; Roasted finger millet seed (98.41±0.55, 54.85±2.23 and 54.26±2.48), Boiled finger millet seed (95.57±0.93, 52.88±0.96 and 50.13±0.97), Fermented finger millet seed (95.18±0.28, 52.52±1.81 and 49.97±1.67), and Soaked finger millet seed (94.52±0.55, 50.63±0.96 and 47.99±2.46). In conclusion, the results indicated that roasting treatment is the best processing method on finger millet seed for better utilization of its protein content, while fermentation is best in reducing the anti-nutrients contents.</p> <p><strong>1.1 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Finger millet (Eleusine coracana), typically a tropical crop, belongs to the group of minor cereals. It is mainly consumed in India and Africa. It is an important cereal because of the excellent storage properties of the grain and the nutritive value, which ishigher than that of rice and equal to that of wheat (Van Wyk and Gericke, 2000). It is  also a good source of micronutrients like calcium, iron, phosphorus, zinc and potassium.</p> <p>Due to the presence of anti-nutrients in grains such as tannins and phytates, these micronutrients are less bioaccessable (Harris and Burns 1978). Among millets, finger millet was reported to contain high amounts of tannins (Ramachandra et al., 1977), ranging from 0.04 to 3.47 per cent (cataechin equivalent).</p> <p>Poor iron availability (represented by low ionizable iron) in finger millets are due to their high tannin content which adversely affect the nutritional quality of the grains (Udayasekhara Rao and Deosthale, 1988). Tannins reduced apparently digestibility of protein and energy (Jansman et al., 1993). Cyanide readily and reversibly binds to a number of enzymes and proteins containing iron including haemoglobin, myoglobin, catalase and the cytochrome system (Ahmed et al., 1996; Uvere, et al., 2000). Phytate interference with mineral absorption, especially calcium and zinc has been reported (Doherty et al., 1982). Oxalates affect calcium and magnesium metabolism (Oke, 1969), and react with protein to form complexes which have an inhibitory effect on peptic digestion (Oboh, 1986). Saponins act on the cardiovascular and nervous system as well as the digestive system (Gestener, et al., 1966). Another anti-nutritional factor that affect the availability of some nutrients is phytate, a naturally occurring phosphorus compound which significantly influences the functional and nutritional properties of foods. It is the main phosphorus store in mature seeds. Phytate has a strong binding capacity, readily forming complexes with multivalent cations and proteins.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF PROCESSING ON THE NUTRITIONAL VALUE OF FINGER MILLET (ELEUSINE CORACANA) SEED<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF PROCESSING ON THE NUTRITIONAL VALUE OF FINGER MILLET (ELEUSINE CORACANA) SEED", "id": 27}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong> <br/><em>Local production of ash-derived alkali was assessed in this review.

The word “Alkali comes from the arabic “qali’ meaning from the ashes since ashes mixed with water used as cleaning products (such as soaps) are made of Alkali materials. An alkali is where a base is dissolves in water. Often it is the salt of an alkali metal. An alkali is the opposite of an acid and can be neutralized (brought down to PH 7) by adding acid.</p>\n\nDETERMINATION OF ALKALI CONTENT IN SOME AGRICULTURAL WASTE PRODUCT SUCH AS COCOA POD HUSK, PLANTAIN PEEL AND PALM FRUIT BUNCH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DETERMINATION OF ALKALI CONTENT IN SOME AGRICULTURAL WASTE PRODUCT SUCH AS COCOA POD HUSK, PLANTAIN PEEL AND PALM FRUIT BUNCH", "id": 28}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT </p> <p>Calcium is the most important mineral in the body.

However, in this study, the term alcohol used without additional qualifications refers specifically to ethanol. A variety of alcoholic beverages have been consumed by man in the continuing search for euphoria producing stimuli. Among some people, alcohol enjoys a high status as a social lubricant that relieves tension, gives self confidence to the inadequate, blurs the appreciation of uncomfortable realities and serves as an escape from environmental and emotional stress.</p> <p>Alcohol has been loved and hated at different times by different people. Alcohol has been celebrated as healthful especially to the heart (red wine) and most pleasant to the taste buds; and then dismissed as “demon’s rum” and “devil in solution” depen ding on the prevalent view.</p> <p>In spite of the apparent divergent and sometimes conflicting opinions about alcohol, the consensus shared by drinkers and non drinkers alike is that excessive and chronic consumption of alcohol is a disorder. Like any other chronic disorder, it develops insidiously but follows a predictable course. The first or pre-alcoholic symptomatic phase begins with the use of alcohol to relieve tensions. The second (or prodromal) phase is marked by a range of behaviors including preoccupation with alcohol, surreptitious drinking and loss of memory (Hock <em>et al</em>., 1992). In the third (or crucial) phase, the individual loses control over his drinking. This loss of control is the beginning of the disease process of addiction. The individual starts drinking early in the morning and stays up drinking till late in the night. Impairment in biochemical activities becomes manifest as the organs of the alcoholic begin to deteriorate. Other medical problems develop by the time the alcoholic gets into the final (chronic phase). Prolonged intoxications become the rule. Alcoholic psychosis develops, thinking is impaired, and fear and tremors become persistent (Klemin and Sherry, 1981). A previously responsible individual may be transformed into an inebriate – s tereotype alcoholic.</p> <p>Fear-instilling but thought- provoking terms such as the “coming epidemic”, a “miserable trap”, have b een used to show concern for the potential hazard of widespread alcoholism.</p>                                                          \n\nEFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON SOME BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS OF ALCOHOLICS <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON SOME BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS OF ALCOHOLICS ", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>In the present study, the phytochemical composition, immunomodulatory, leukocyte mobilization, haematological and antihepatotoxic effects of the aqueous extract of <em>Senna</em> <em>mimosoides </em>leaves were evaluated. The study also covered the effect of the extract on theactivity of lactase and the assessment of the damaging effect of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and ameliorative effect of the extract on liver tissue using histopathological technique. This study was aimed at validating the traditional use of <em>S. mimosoides</em> leaves in folklore medicine to treat breast milk toxicity in neonates by elucidating its immunological and biochemical nature. The qualitative and quantitative phytochemical composition showed the presence of 2.67 ± 0.0013 mg of flavonoids; 3.43 ± 0.0028 mg of alkaloids; 1.97 ± 0.0030 mg of saponin; 2.32 ± 0.0032 mg of terpenoids; 0.86 ± 0.0023 mg of steroid; 3.61 ± 0.0025 mg of phenol; 8.31 ± 0.0032 mg of reducing sugar; 4.75 ± 0.0034 m g of tannin; 1.61 ± 0.0031 mg of cyanide; 2.75 ± 0.0029 mg of glycoside and 4.68 ± 0 .0033 mg of soluble carbohydrates for every 100 g of the extract. For the animal model experiment, one hundred and thirty (130) albino rats were used. The experimental design was divided into four (4) phases containing five (5) groups of five (5) rats in each group. Rats in group A (control) were administered 0.2 ml of normal saline; rats in groups B, C and D were treated with 50, 100 and 250 mg/kg of the aqueous extract of <em>S. mimosoides</em> leaves respectively; group E rats received levamisol or silymarin (standard drugs) while group F rats were treated with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) only. Administration of 50, 100 and 250 mg/kg of the extract resulted in a dose-dependent significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in primary antibody titre with a value of 6, 8, 13, and secondary antibody titre with a value of 11, 26, 34. Delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response shows that the extract produced a dose- and time-dependent increase in footpad swelling of the rats. The extract (50, 100 and 250 mg/kg) and levamisol (25 mg/kg) at 24 hr after challenge, significantly (p &lt; 0.05) boosted DTH reactions observed respectively as 1.412, 1.504, 1.816 and 1.827 mm difference in thickness of footpad before challenge and 24 hr after challenge while the control ellicited a non-significant (p &gt; 0.05) increase with a difference of 0.614 mm. At 48 hr after challenge, there was an additional increase in footpad swelling observed as 1.908, 1.918, 2.304 and 2.326 mm for the extract and levamisol respectively. The humoural antibody (HA) titre and DTH response compare well with that of levamisol, a standard immunostimulatory drug, at 25 mg/kg. The total leukocyte count of the groups treated with different concentrations of extract increased in a dose-dependent manner while the group treated with indomethacin decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) compared with control. The percentage packed cell volume (PCV) for group B, before and after treatment with cyclophosphamide (CP) and later with (50 mg/kg) was 38.8 ± 1.30, 19.4 ± 0.55 and 34.4</p> <p>± 0.55 respectively. Groups C, D, and E showed the same trend but in the control group decrease by CP was not reversed. In the control, percentage PCV before and after CP and then extract was 35.8 ± 0.45, 19.4 ± 0.55 and 19.8 ± 1.09 respectively. The same trend was observed in haemoglobin concentration, white blood cell count, red blood cell count and its indices. There was increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity of rats in group F (81.20 ± 0.84 IU/L) after CCl4 administration as compared to the normal control A (53.00 ± 1.00 IU/L). The extract (50, 100, 250 mg/kg) and silymarin (25 mg/kg) caused a significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease in the activity of ALT (65.00 ± 1.58, 59.20 ± 0.84, 55.20 ± 1.30 and 57.00 ± 1.00 IU/L) respectively. The levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, malondialdehyde, iron, phosphate followed the same trend as ALT compared to control. Administration of CCl4 decreased the level of reduced glutathione in group F (2.21 ± 0.239 mMol/g tissue). However, treatment with different concentrations of the extract and levamisol augmented this decrease (3.08 ± 0.093, 4.17 ± 0.241, 5.16 ± 0.193 and 4.97 ± 0.273 mMol/g tissue) respectively. Activities of glutathione s-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase and concentrations of sodium, magnesium, potassium, calcium, zinc and selenim showed the same trend. Histopathological studies showed that the extract and levamisol ameliorated centrilobular degeneration of the liver tissues induced by CCl4. Moreover, the extract exhibited higher significant (p &lt; 0.05) activity of lactase in a dose-dependent manner when compared to the control. At 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 µl, the enzyme activity were 17.187, 18.8 22, 20.044, 22.022 and 23.898 IU.The findings of this study show that the vase medicinally important bioactive compounds, present in this extract could be responsible for the immunostimulatory, antihepatotoxic effect, increase in lactase activity and haematological parameters. This justifies the use of this plant in folklore medicine for the treatment of diseases.</p> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Plants are known to contain a variety of secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites or bioactive compounds have definite physiological effects on the human system. According to Yadav and Agarwala (2011), approximately 25 percent of all prescribed medicines today are substances derived from plants. Interestingly, many phytochemicals have been discovered and even isolated from a variety of medicinal plants. However, many more of them are yet to be exploited for clinical use. Phytochemical analysis of plants is importante due to the need for alternative drugs of plant origin, made imperative by the high cost of synthetic drugs. These secondary plant metabolites extractable by various solvents exhibit varied biochemical and pharmacological actions in animals when ingested (Nwogu <em>et al</em>., 2008).</p> <p>The use of <em>Senna mimosoides</em> in folklore medicine, precisely in Ukehe, Nsukka, to treat oedema and breastmilk toxicity in neonates was the rationale behind this work. The anti-inflammatory capacity of the leaf extract of <em>Senna mimosoides</em> and its mechanism of action has been reported by Ekwueme <em>et al</em>. (2011a,b).In Nsukka, immediatly after delivery, breastmilk is usually dropped on the leaves of cocoyam or on ants to check its toxicity.Toxic breastmilk usually burns the leaves of the cocoyam or kills any ants it comes in contact with. The prevalence of industries predisposes mothers to chemicals that might accumulate in breast milk. In this study, the immunomodulatory activity and anti-hepatotoxic effect of the leaf extract of <em>S. mimosoides</em>was investigated because they are the basic mechanism used by the body to prevent or cure diseases. Moreover, the effect of the leaf extract on the activity of lactase,the enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of lactose which is the only carbohydrate present in breast milk was assayed for.</p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>Overview of the Human Immune System</strong></p> <p>Immunology is the study of the methods by which the body defends itself against infectious agents and other foreign substances in its environment (Wotherspoon, 2012). There are thousands of components to the immune system and it would appear that the immune system is far more complicated than necessary for achieving what is, on the surface, a simple task of eliminating a pathogenic organism or abnormal ‘self’ cells (Parkin and Cohen, 2001). </p>                                                         \n\nELUCIDATION OF SOME IMMUNOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL NATURE OF THE LEAVES OF SENNA MIMOSOIDES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ELUCIDATION OF SOME IMMUNOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL NATURE OF THE LEAVES OF SENNA MIMOSOIDES", "id": 31}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p><strong> INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of organic compounds consisting of two or more fused benzene rings (linear, cluster or angular arrangement), or compounds made up of carbon and hydrogen atoms grouped into rings containing five or six carbon atoms. They are called “PAH derivatives” when an alkyl or other radical is introduced to the ring, and heterocyclic aromatic compounds (HACs) when one carbon atom in a ring is replaced by a nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur atoms. PAHs originate mainly from anthropogenic processes particularly from incomplete combustion of organic fuels. PAHs are distributed widely in the atmosphere. Natural processes, such as volcanic eruptions and forest fires, also contribute to an ambient existence of PAHs (Suchanova <em>et al</em>., 2008). PAHs can be present in both particulate and gaseous phases, depending on their volatility. Low molecular weight PAHs (LMW PAHs) that have two or three aromatic rings (molecular weight from 152 to 178g/mol) are emitted in the gaseous phase, while high molecular weight PAHs (HMW PAHs), molecular weight ranging from 228 to 278g/mol, with five or more rings, are emitted in the particulate phase, (ATSDR, 1995) . In the atmosphere, PAHs can undergo photo-degradation and react with other pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and ozone. Due to widespread sources and persistent characteristics, PAHs disperse through atmospheric transport and exist almost everywhere. There are hundreds of PAH compounds in the environment but in practice PAH analysis is restricted to the determination of six (6) to sixteen (16) compounds. Human beings are exposed to PAH mixtures in gaseous or particulate phases in ambient air. Long term exposure to high concentration of PAHs is associated with adverse health problems. Since some PAHs are</p> </div> <div> <p>16</p> <p>considered carcinogens, inhalation of PAHs in particulates is a potentially serious health risk linked to lung cancer (Philips, 1999).</p> <p><strong>1.2. Physical and Chemical Characteristics of PAHs.</strong></p> <p>PAHs are a group of several hundred individual organic compounds which contain two or more aromatic rings and generally occur as complex mixtures rather than single compounds. PAHs are classified by their melting and boiling points, vapour pressure, and water solubility, depending on their structure. Pure PAHs are usually coloured, crystalline solids at ambient temperature. The physical properties of PAHs vary with their molecular weight and structure (Table1). Except for naphthalene, they have very low to low water solubilities, and low to moderately high vapour pressures. Their octanol-water partition coefficients (Kow) are relatively high, indicating a relatively high potential for adsorption to suspended particles in the air and in water, and for bioconcentration in organisms (Sloof <em>et al</em>., 1989). Table 1 shows physical and chemical characteristics of few selected PAHs from the sixteen (16) priority PAHs, listed by the US EPA. (see appendix). Most PAHs, especially as molecular weight increases, are soluble in non-polar organic solvents and are barely soluble in water (ATSDR, 1995).</p> <p>Most PAHs are persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the environment. Many of them are chemically inert. However, PAHs can be photochemically decomposed under strong ultraviolet light or sunlight, and thus some PAHs can be lost during atmospheric sampling. Also, PAHs can react with ozone, hydroxyl radicals, nitrogen and sulfur oxides, and nitric and sulfuric acids which affect the environmental fate or conditions of PAHs (Dennis <em>et al</em>., 1984; Simko, 1991).</p> <p>PAHs possess very characteristic UV absorbance spectra. Each ring structure has a unique UV spectrum, thus each isomer has a different UV absorbance spectrum. This is especially useful in</p> </div> <div> <p>17</p> <p>the identification of PAHs. Most PAHs are also fluorescent, emitting characteristic wavelengths of light when they are excited (when the molecules absorb light). Generally, PAHs only weakly absorb light of infrared wavelengths between 7 and 14µm, the wavelength usually absorbed by chemical involved in global warning (Ramanathan, 1985).</p> <p>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are present in the environment as complex mixtures that are difficult to characterize and measure. They are generally analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or by using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet (UV) and fluorescence dectetors (Slooff <em>et al.,</em> 1989)</p> </div> <div> <p>18</p> <p><strong>Table 1 </strong>Physical and Chemical Characteristics of Some Popular PAHs</p> <p>s/n</p> <p>Names of PAHs</p> <p>Chemical structure/formula</p> <p>Mol</p> <p>Vapour pressure</p> <p>Partition</p> <p>weight</p> <p>coefficient</p> <p>(kow)</p> <p>1</p> <p>Naphthalene</p> <p>C10H8</p> <p>128.17</p> <p>0.087mmHg</p> <p>3.29</p> <p>2</p> <p>Fluorine</p> <p>166.2</p> <p>3.2x10-4mmHg</p> <p>4.18</p> <p>C13H10</p> <p>3 Fluoranthene</p> <p>202.26</p> <p>5.0 x10-6mmHg4.90</p> <p>C16H10</p> <p>4 Pyrene</p> <p>202.3</p> <p>2.5 x10-6mmHg4.88</p> <p>C16H10</p> <p>5</p> <p>Benzo(a)anthracene</p> <p>228.29</p> <p>5.61</p> <p>C20H12</p> <p>2.5 x10-6mmHg</p> <p>6</p> <p>Benzo(k)fluoranthene</p> <p>6.06</p> <p>C20H12</p> <p>252.3</p> <p>9.59x10-11mmHg</p> <p>7 Benzo(a)pyrene</p> <p>C20H12</p> <p>252.3</p> <p>5.6x10-9mmHg6.06</p> <p>8 Indeno(1,2,3-c,d)pyrene</p> <p>276.3 10x10-16mmHG 6.58</p> <p>C22H12</p> <p>Sources: (ATSDR, 1995)</p> </div> <div> <p>19</p> <p><strong>Source and Emission of PAHs</strong></p> <p>PAHs are mainly derived from anthropogenic activities related to pyrolysis and incomplete combustion of organic matter. Sources of PAHs affect their characterization and distribution, as well as their toxicity. Major sources of PAH emissions may be divided into four classes: stationary sources (including domestic and industrial sources), mobile emission, agriculture activities, and natural sources (Wania <em>et al,</em> 1996).</p> <p><strong>1.3. Stationary Sources</strong></p> <p>Some PAHs are emitted from point sources and this is hardly shifted (moved) for a long period of time. Stationary sources are further subdivided into two main sources: domestic and industrial.</p> <p><strong>1.3.1. Domestic Sources</strong></p> <p>Heating and cooking are dominant domestic sources of PAHs. The burning and pyrolysis of coal, oil, gas, garbage, wood, or other substances are the main domestic sources. Domestic sources are important contributors to the total PAHs emitted into the environment. Difference in climate patterns and domestic heating systems produce large geographic variations in domestic emission. PAH emissions from these sources may be a major health concern because of their prevalence in indoor environments (Ravindra <em>et al</em>., 2008). According to a recent World Health Organization (WHO) report, more than 75% of people in China, India, and South East Asia and 50-75% of people in parts of South America and Africa use combustion of solid fuel, such as wood, charcoal for daily cooking.</p> <p>Main indoor PAH sources are cooking and heating and infiltration from outdoors. PAH emissions from cooking account for 32.8% of total indoor PAHs (Zhu <em>et al</em>., 2009). LMW PAHs which originate from indoor sources are the predominant proportion of the total PAHs identified</p> </div> <div> <p>20</p> <p>in residential non-smoking air. Toxicity of PAH mixtures from indoor sources is lower than mixtures which contain large amounts of high molecular weight PAHs. Cigarette smoke is also a dominant sources of PAHs in indoor environments. In many studies, PAHs in the indoor air of smoking residences tend to be higher than those of non-smoking residences.</p> <p><strong>1.3.2. Industrial Sources</strong></p> <p>Sources of PAHs include emission from industrial activities, such as primary aluminum and coke production, petrochemical industries, rubber tire and cement manufacturing, bitumen and asphalt industries, wood preservation, commercial heat and power generation, and waste incineration (Fabbri and Vassura , 2006).</p> <p><strong>1.3.3. Mobile Sources</strong></p> <p>Mobile sources are major causes of PAHs emissions in urban areas. PAHs are mainly emitted from exhaust fumes of vehicles, including automobile, railways, ships, aircrafts, and other motor vehicles. PAHs emissions from mobile sources are associated with use of diesel, coal, gasoline, oils, and lubricant oil. Exhaust emissions of PAHs from motor vehicles are formed by three mechanisms: (1) synthesis from smaller molecules and aromatic compounds in fuel; (2) storage in engine deposits and in fuel; (3) pyrolysis of lubricants (Baek <em>et al</em>., 1991). One of the major influences on the production of PAHs from gasoline automobiles is the air-to-fuel ratio.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br/>Heavy metal pollution occurs in many industrial waste waters such as those produce by metals plating facilities mining operation, battery manufacturing processes, the production of plant and pigment and the glass production industries. This waste water commonly contains chromium, cadmium, mercy, sernic and leads etc. These heavy metals are not biodegradable and their presence in streams and lakes leads to bioaccumulation in living organisms causing health problem animals, plants and human beings (Adejoh, et al 2015).<br/> Heavy metals are naturally componente of th earth crust, they cannot be degraded or destroyed, to a small extent they enter our bodies via food, drinking water and air. Examples of heavy metals include mercury (Hg), cadnium (cd) arsemic (As), chronium (Cr) thailium (Ti) and lead (pb) (akponsh, 2017). As trace elements, some heavy metals (e.g copper, selenium,  zinc) are essentials to maintain the metabolism of the human body. However at higher concentration the can lead to poisoning. Heavy metal poisoning could result for instance from drinking a contaminated water. (E.g lead pipe contaminated water). (David, 2018). <br/>Heavy metals are dangerous because they tend to bioaccumulation and enter a water supply by industrial and consumer waste or even from acidic rain breaking down soils and releasing heavy metals into streams, lake, rivers and ground water. (Ouemeh et al 2013). <br/>    Excessive human intake of chromium leads to severe muscular irritation and corrosion, wide spread capillary damage, hepatic and renal damage and central nervous system irritation followed by depression (faramarzi, 2018). Some metals are also known as carcinogen therefore some heavy metals are also known as carcinogen therefore the removal of excessive heavy metals ion from waste water is essential to protect human and environment heath. As a result, the removal of toxic heavy metals ions from sewage and from industrial effluent have been widely studied in recent years (Diarra, 2014). Several technologies are presently being utilized for the removal of these metals from industrial waste in order to present their release into the environment. Conventional technologies used include, chemical precipitation, coagulation, electronic chemical reduction, solvent extraction and electrolysis (Igwe, 2016). These method of treatment surfer several limitations based on their technical and economical viability and they do not posses removal efficiency which are sufficient for meeting the ever increasing environment requirement being sought by regulatory bodies. Also, the possibility of secondary pollutions is a subject of concern when utilizing these converntional techniques (Dizadji et all, 2016).<br/>    Adsorption technology especially those carried out in the biosorption model, using non-living biomass have been shown to be promisinmg alternative technology for waste water treatment. major advantages includes the minimal cost associated with obtaining and preparing a possible environmental nuisance into a material of economics importance (Igwe, 2016). <br/>    There is an exponential increase in the growth rate of the worlds population which calls for an aggressive approach towards food production to feed the already high human population to amehorate inadequate food supply and consequent malnutrition (Feramarzi et al; 2018). In Nigeria, large quantities of tubers are produced and they form an important energy source for human and livestock feeding the peels of these tubers are really available at cheap costs in many parts of the country because they are thought to have limited or no human food value (Diarra et al 2014). The use of biomass as adsorbent for heavy metal remediation has been demonstrated by several researcher (okoro and Abii, Zoll, Owgmah et all; 2013 and Eniola, 2012 etc).<br/>This renewed intrest in research into the use of Agricultural by-product as adsorptions is informed by inherent disadvantage in the use of conventional method for heavy metal remediation. Grains constitute of high percentage of edible crops produced in Nigeria. The higher volume of these grains when processed and consumed result in the production of large quantities of by-product which are discarded indiscriminately thereby constituting environmental hazards. The utilization of these wastes in adsorption process will not only be of great scientist value but will also help in environmental sanitation. Maize cobs, Rice husk, cassava peels and groundnut shells are abundant agricultural naiste products with millions of tons generated annually polluting the environment in Nigeria.<br/>    Agricultural by-products are less expensive, easily available, the do not produce chemical and biological sludge, simple to use and environmental friendly (hossain et al; 2017). The adsorption capacities od agricultural by-product have been shown to be dependent concentration and other physicochemical properties. (adejoh et al 2015).<br/>Heavy metals cannot be destroyed through biological degradation, as in the case with most organic pollutions therefore, it is important to take protective measure against excessive exposures (Igwe, 2016).<br/>1.2    PROBLEM STATEMENT AND JUSTIFICATION<br/>Heavy metals are classes of pollutions often toxic and dangerous, widely preset in industrial and household waste water. Electroplating and metal finishing operation. Electronic circuit production, steel and aluminum processes. Industries produce large quantity of waste water containing metals. The production, processing and consumption of agricultural products is often accompanied with production of by-products which are considered to be of low or no  nutritional or economic value. These products are often discarded in the environment thereby constituting environmental pollution. It thereby becomes unperative for these waste materials to the properly disposed of the use of these waste in bioremediation of heavy metals from waste waters will therefore serue a dual purpose of ensuring clean water and environmental sanitation.<br/>AIM<br/>The aim of the project therefore is to determine the impact of EDTA modification on the adsorption of chronum by some agricultural waste as a function of pH, adsorption does, contect time, initial ion concentration and particle size.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF CONTACT TIME, ADSORBENT DOSE,INITIALION CONCENTRATION AND PH ON THE ADSORPTION CAPACITY OF EDTA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF CONTACT TIME, ADSORBENT DOSE,INITIALION CONCENTRATION AND PH ON THE ADSORPTION CAPACITY OF EDTA", "id": 33}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>BIOSORPTIVE POTENTIALS OF UNMODIFIES, CHEMICALLY MODIFIED AND CARBONIZED SAWDUST FROM SOME WOODY </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>\n<p><em>Adsorption can be applied for solution containing low concentration of heavy metals in which helps to investigate the influence of chemical modifications and carbonization of the adsorptive capacities of sawdust foe zinc copper and nickel.

Natural sources includes, volcanic eruptions, forests fire, deep sea, vent and greyer, which anthropogenic sources include mining and smelting, painting and coating etc. (Abdillahi, 2013) metals exhibits health uses like the problems in the synthesis of hemoglobin effect on the kidney, gastro intestinal track, reproductive system and acute or chronic damage to the nervous system (Berman, 2016).</p>\n<p>Agricultural waste have been recognized as cheap material for the removal of toxic metals (Azza et al, 2014).

It is used in heater purification, food industry, oil and gas production chemical industry medicine etc. (Eyiyceme, 2018).</p>\n<p>The adsorption capacity of agricultural by products have been shown to be dependent on various factors such as ph, temperature, adsorbent type, Adsorbentr concentration and other physiologic chemical properties (Agada, et al 2015). Heavy metals cannot be destroyed through biological degradation as in the case with most organic pollutants, therefore, it is important to enhance the adsorption capacities of agricultural wasted through modifications (Igwe, 2017). Sawdust is widely produced through sawing of woods in various locations. Most of this are discarded as waste, the use of these materials for adsorption purposes will also enhanced environmental dealiness.       </p>\n<p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p>\n<p>Metals exhibits health issues like in the problems in the synthesis of hemoglobin, effects on the kidney, gastro intestinal frack, reproductive system and acute or chromic damage to the nervous system (Berman, 2016). The heavy metals hazardous to human includes copper, zinc, etc. Such metals are found naturally in the food in trace amount which pose few problem which concentrated in a particular area however, they presents a second damage when in high concentrations (Barker 2015)</p>\n<p><strong>1.2    NEED FOR THE REMOVAL OF HEAVY METALS</strong></p>\n<p>continues discharge of industrial domestic and agricultural waste in rivers and lakes cause deposit of pollutants in sediment such pollutants includes heavy metals which endanger public health after being incorporated in food chain. Excessive amount of some heavy metals can be toxic through direct action of the metals or through their inorganic salts or via organic compound from which the metal can become easily detached or introduce into the cell (c faisal, 2013).</p>\n<p><strong>1.3 AIM OF THE STUDY</strong></p>\n<p>The aim of the project is to investigate the influence of chemical modification and carbonization of on the adsorptive capacities of sawdust obtained from different woody materials for zonic, copper and nucleic from aqueous solutions.</p>\n<p>1.

Water samples from Points A, B and C were screened for microbiological analysis. The results revealed that the level of pollution varied depending on season and that the water quality was acceptable at the upstream (Point A) but became impaired at Points B and C, indicating significant pollution from detergent effluent discharges. The analysis of the microbiological characteristics of water samples from the three points revealed high microbial and faecal contamination with microbial load in the order of 105 and MPN of ≤ 1800. The detergent effluents discharged into Points B and C were found to support the growth of micro organisms such as Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Enterobacter species that are pathogenic in nature with higher loads. The results showed that water samples from the river contained toxic substances with higher microbial loads. The detrimental effects of the discharge effluent on the aspect of water quality of Ntamiri River River were discussed.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT  <br/>1.0    CHAPTER ONE<br/> Introduction       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -      <br/>1.1    Aims / objectives of the study       -       -       -       -       -       -       -      <br/>1.2    Statement of problems -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -      <br/>1.3    Hypothesis         -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -      <br/>1.4    Scope of limitation               -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -              <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0    Literature review         -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -      <br/>2.1    The major group of biological Pollutions of water              -       -       -      <br/>2.2    Source of water supply -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -      <br/>2.3    Source of water pollution              -       -       -       -       -       -       -      <br/>2.4    Treatment of water sample          <br/>International standard for drinking water -       -       -       -       -       -      <br/>Diseases from water    -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -                              <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0    Materials &amp; methods<br/>3.0    Materials                                           <br/>3.1    Media preparation                              <br/>3.2    Collection of samples                          <br/>3.3    Collection of samples                          <br/>3.4    Methods of water analysis                    <br/>3.5    Determination of PH                            <br/>Determination of bacteria of the coliform                                       <br/>Culture techniques                              <br/>Plate count technique                          <br/>Presumption coliform (multiple tube fermebtation            <br/>3.5.4 Confirmatory test                               <br/>3.5.5 Completed test                                   <br/>3.5.6 Test for indole                                    <br/>3.5.7 Methyl red test                                   <br/>3.5.8 Sugar test                                         <br/>3.5.9 Oxidase test                                              <br/>3.5.10 Catakase test                                   <br/>3.5.11 The slide cougulase test                     <br/>3.5.12 Gram stain techniques                       <br/>3.5.13 Detection of faecal stredtococci  <br/>3.5.14 Detection of escherichi coli test   <br/>3.5.15 Organism suspected after gram staining                                       <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>RESULTS                   <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>Discussion<br/>CHAPTER SIX<br/>6.1    Conclusion<br/>6.2    Recommendation<br/>References<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>Water is a liquid mineral. It consists of two atoms of hydrogen combined with one atom of oxygen. Water is a tasteless, odourless and colourless mobile liquid except in large volume where it appears blue.  It has a melting point of OoC (320f) and a boiling point of 1000C (2120f).  Water is a basic necessity of life; in the absence higher animals survive only but a few hours or days.  It has several uses such as washing cooking, food processing, swimming, and among others. Out  of   these  uses, drinking  of  water  seems  to  be  the  most   sensitive  as  it  could  have  a  direct   deleterious  impact  on  health  of  human  beings.<br/>Therefore, drinking water should be potable free diseases, or toxic substance (Beren 1991). Water is portable when it is colourless.  Odourless, or tasteless and also free from poisonous, corroding, staining substances as well as disease casuiong oirganisms (Cruich 1972).  The problem of providing safe and adequate water is as old as life on earth.  Water can be made unifit or unsafe for drinking it contamination occurs either by nature or activities of human beings.    <br/>Perhaps the greatest danger associated with drinking water is contamination by human  excrement (Forest 1979).  In most cases, the pollution/contamination is hardly severe and is not particularly detrimental to health.<br/>Thus a few substances and microbes that are health hazard do occur in water, and can cause illness or even death.  From microbiological point of view, the pathogens most frequently transmitted through water supply ranges from ultrasmall virus to the microscopic bacteria and relatively large cysts entemoeba instolytica.  These organisms cense infections of intestinal track, when consumed censing amebic dysentery, and Gardia lamblia is a protozoa responsible for Giadiasis.  Defective plumbing for example was the cause of out break during the world fair in Chicago 1933 (Garelick 1987) water borne disease cause acute diarrhea, often last 2-3 months.  The most common water borne disease can be by bacteria includes typhoid fever, paratyphoid.  Asiatic cholera and bacteria dysentery.<br/>Other diseases that may be transmitted by water include brucellosis, shige /losis, these diseases are consuming.  Untreated water (Hetolett 1921) various countries of the world and the world Health organization (WHO) has set up standards for water quality against which the level of pollution can be assessed.  The world Health organization (WHO) National Agency for food and Drug Administration control (NAFDAC), standard for potable water include the following, that in 100ml of water coliform bacteria should be absent, total plate count of bacteria growth should be 100 CFU/ML of water.  Hence the sanitary Quality of water should not be over looked since contaminated water can cause health hazards when consumed.<br/>According to guideline for drinking water quality of WHO (1998)<br/>TABLE 1<br/>WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION STANDARD FOR DRINKING WATER<br/>PH<br/>     COLOUR<br/>     Dissolved solids<br/>     Total Hardness<br/>     Calcium<br/>     Iron<br/>     Chloride<br/>     Nitrate<br/>     Coliform<br/> 5.0 – 9.0<br/>     15 Hazen unit<br/>     500 mg/l<br/>     500 mg/l<br/>     75 mg/l<br/>     0.3 mg/l<br/>     200 mg/l<br/>     45 mg/l<br/>     10 colonies<br/> 1.1    AIMS / OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>        The objective of this project is to make Microbiological study of Ntamiri Rivers along Umuagwo axis.<br/>To identify contamination microbial advice on measures to control pollution of water bodies etc.<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>The treated water produced by Ntamiri Rivers could be contaminated by defective plumbing which cause the rush of water out of the pipe forming pull mixed with sewage matters.  The pull eventually sucks back through the burst pipe into the pipe line being distributed to various locations and collected as drinking water.<br/>1.3    HYPOTHESIS<br/>H.O:  there is difference in the microbial load of water from Ntamiri River at point of production against the load as the point of supply and consumption.<br/>HI:    There is a statistical difference between the microbial load of water from the Ntamiri Rivers as the production point against the load as supply and consumption point.<br/>1.4    SCOPE OF LIMITATION<br/>The  project is set to identify only microbial pollutants  the method of microbial analysis is limited to the techniques and materials available in our laboratory as against high tech equipment which may be found else where.<br/><br/>\n\nMICROBIOLOGICAL STUDY OF NTAMIRI ALONG UMUAGWO AXIS OF THE STREAM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MICROBIOLOGICAL STUDY OF NTAMIRI ALONG UMUAGWO AXIS OF THE STREAM", "id": 35}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE BODY MASS INDEX AND PERCENT BODY FAT OF YOUNG MALE ADOLESCENTS AS A PREDICTOR OF ADULT OBESITY<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>In the recent past, it was thought that Obesity is a disease associated to adults, leaving the young (children) out of it.  In studies carried out by Guo et al.

Variables such as age, height, weight, hip circumference and waist circumference were measured and all used in the presentation and analysis. In conclusion: This study was undertaken to evaluate the Body Mass Index and Percent Body Fat of young male adolescents as a predictor of adult obesity.<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/> INTRODUCTION<br/>In recent times, obesity seems to have reached epidemic proportions.  Its astronomical increase has been a singular factor to the cause of many premature deaths in the society (Webb, 2002) mortality rate is in the increase and life expectancy reduced. It possess many health problems that in turn leads to death.<br/> According to stage up America (2000), obesity is associated with five of the top leading causes of death and disability in U.S; heart disease, some form of cancer, type II diabetes, stroke and high blood pressure.<br/>Similarly, Heyward (2002) stated that overweight and obesity increases ones risk of developing serious cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic diseases and disorders.<br/> In the recent past, it was thought that Obesity is a disease associated to adults, leaving the young (children) out of it.  In studies carried out by Guo et al. (1994) &amp; Must et al (1992), it was reported that adolescent weight is a good predictor of adult Obesity, so also did Telama et al (1997) that active children became active adults.  It can be inferred that lifestyle adopted when young, goes a long way in determining ones health status in adulthood.<br/> According to life insurance studies, the health effects of obesity seems to be greater in males than in females because of the site of fat accumulation (abdominal area).<br/>However pathetic, the high occurrence in male adolescents gives a startling statistics.  In contrast to the past, the present occurrence surfaced as an aftermath of a sustained practice of an un-ideal health lifestyle such as poor eating habit coupled with sedentary living.  The decline in physical activity is strongly implicated as an important cause of the rapid increase in overweight and obesity (Prentice &amp; Jebb, 1995)<br/>So also, does an uncontrollably eating habit (Schachter &amp; Rodin, 1974) and automation contribute to obesity (Webb, 2002)<br/> Furthermore, in a bid to correct this, some anthropometric indexes such as Body Mass Index (BMI) and Waist-to- hip ratio (WHR) have been developed to identify individuals at risk in order to promptly effect a redress before it worsens.  Many individuals have displayed mixed reactions on the choice of assessment to be used in ascertaining obesity.  It was argued that the waist-to-hip ratio seems to be best in determining the health risk associated with obesity because it estimates the fat at the abdominal region poised to be the most dangerous fat site in the human body as it is associated with a lot of disease (Hoeger &amp; Hoeger, 2002)<br/>In like manner, it has been argued that BMI may not be a good assessment of the health risk associated with obesity, remains an important and convenient means of assessing body weight (Irish Heart Foundation &amp; Irish Nutrition and Dietic institution).<br/> Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the body mass index and percent body fat of young male adolescents as a predictor of adult obesity.<br/> RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>In the cause of study, the following research questions were generated;<br/>1.     Will the weight of male adolescents be within low risk range for the onset of obesity?<br/>2.     Will the BMI of male adolescents be within low risk range for the onset of obesity?<br/>3.     Will the waist-to-hip ratio of male adolescents be within the low risk range?<br/>4.     Will the waist circumference be within the low risk range?<br/>5.     Will the hip circumference be within the low risk range?<br/> HYPOTHESES:<br/>It was hypothesized that:<br/>1.     The weight of male adolescents will be within the normal range.<br/>2.     The BMI of male adolescents will be within low risk range for the onset of obesity.<br/>3.     The waist-to-hip ratio of male adolescents will be within the low risk range.<br/>4.     The waist circumference will be within the low risk range.<br/>5.     The hip circumference will be within the low risk range.<br/> SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study may be useful in the under-listed areas.<br/>1.     it may enable college students to measure their weight and height.<br/>2.     It may enable college students to known their BMI status and determine their level of risk to obesity.<br/>3.     It may enlighten the participant of the inherent risk factors of obesity, thereby adopting a healthy lifestyle.<br/>4.     The study may help improve the health of the public through maintaining a healthy weight.<br/>5.     The study may help see the importance of physical activity and enable the curriculum developers to re-enforce Physical and Health Education in the curriculum.<br/>6.     The study may be of great importance to the Federal Ministry of Health and other organizations as it will give the current statistics of obsessed male adolescents, thereby easing their work.<br/> LIMITATION<br/>It was difficult for the researcher to get the consent of the school authority to conduct the research.  Participants were also unwilling to indicate their real age.<br/> DE-LIMITATION<br/>The study is de-limited to 100 young male adolescent within the age bracket of 11-16 years from Bellina College Akoka-Lagos.<br/> DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.     BMI: Body Mass Index of male adolescent of age bracket 11-16years.<br/>2.     WHR: Waist-to-hip ratio of male adolescent of age bracket 11-16 years.<br/>3.     OBESITY:  Body fat in excess of normal.   BMI of above 30kg/m² among male adolescents.<br/>4.     PHYSICAL ACTIVITY:  An act of engaging in activities that is demanding on the muscles and energy consuming by male adolescents.<br/>5.     HEALTHY LIFESTYLE:  A behaviour that aids wellness and healthy living<br/>6.     ADOLESCENTS:  Male children between ages 11 – 16 years.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE BODY MASS INDEX AND PERCENT BODY FAT OF YOUNG MALE ADOLESCENTS AS A PREDICTOR OF ADULT OBESITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE BODY MASS INDEX AND PERCENT BODY FAT OF YOUNG MALE ADOLESCENTS AS A PREDICTOR OF ADULT OBESITY", "id": 36}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EVALUATION OF THE CHEMICAL COMPONENT OF DOGOYARO LIQUID (AZADIRACHTA INDICA) FOR ANTI-MALARIA.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The global scenario is now supporting the development of malaria drug from less toxic plant products with proven medicinal properties. Each part of the neem plant (Azadirachtaindica A. Juss) reportedly has various medicinal properties and has been in use in many continents for centuries. In this project work, water extract from Neem leaves (Azadirachtaindica A Juss) with the modern atomic absorption spectrophotometer was presented. The chemical properties in the water extract of Neem leaf were studied. Results showed that the neem leaf contains some essential minerals needed for malaria. It is obvious that the water extract of Azadirachtaindica is significantly high in sodium ion (Na+) and potassium ion (K+) concentrations which are responsible in the conduction of impulses along the axons of the central nervous system. Iron is another element determined. This element is significantly low in the water extract of the sample used (neem leaf). <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Malaria infections are characterized by defective immune responses with poor efficacy against infection, and in some cases, with immunopathology. Severe malaria is a complex multisystem disorder. Complications such as cerebral malaria, anemia, acidosis, jaundice, respiratory distress, renal insufficiency, coagulation anomalies and hyperparasitemia can occur in severe malaria[2]. About 300-500 million clinical cases and 1.2–2.8 million deaths due to malaria occur each year[3,4]. The rising problem of resistance to the classical drugs (chloroquine and sulphadoxinepyrimethamine)[5–7] and the problem of recrudescence of malaria after treatment with artemisinin stress the need for new antimalarial agents[8].<br/>The malaria drugs quinine and artemisinin are both plant derivatives and are obtained from Cinchona species[9,10] and Artemisia annua[11,12] respectively, suggesting that other effective malaria drugs might be plant-derived. Azadirachtaindica plants from the Meliaceae family are extensively used as traditional remedies against malaria in the tropics[9,13,14]. Several studies demonstrated that A. indica leaf, seed and stem bark extracts possess in vitro inhibitory activity on Plasmodium falciparum asexual stages[15–17]. In vitro screening of purified limonoids from Neem revealed that gedunin and nimbolide are the most active molecules against P. falciparum.<br/>MacKinnon et al. examined 60 extracts from 22 species of Meliaceae by characterizing their in vitro antiplasmodial activity against chloroquine-sensitive (D6) and chloroquine-resistant (W2) malaria clones (Dd2, Indochina)[15,19]. Twelve extracts were found to have activity against P. falciparum, especially extracts of Cedrelaodorata wood and Azadirachtaindica leaves, both containing the limonoid, gedunin[20]. Gedunin has been repeatedly re-isolated as an active antimalarial principle, most recently from Khayagrandifoliola[21]. The antimalarial properties of several plant extracts have been studied in mice[22]. Therefore, we sought to examine the anti-plasmodial activity of Azadirachtaindica, commonly known as Neem, a plant used in Sudan, India and other countries as a folk medicine, in a human malaria investigation of malaria produced in Plasmodium berghei ANKA infected mice.<br/>To examine the effects of an antimalarial treatment, we measured physiological and morphological responses. We also examined cerebral malaria. Neuronal ischemia and inflammation from malaria, depending on the acuteness and intensity of the symptoms, can lead to cellular necrosis or apoptosis[23]. Caspases play important roles in the commitment and execution phases of apoptosis[24]. Importantly, caspase-3 acts as a major downstream effector mediating neuronal apoptosis. We examined protection from caspase-dependent apoptosis as a mechanism of malaria treatment effectiveness.<br/>1.1    AIM OF PROJECT<br/>Many researches have been carried out on neem plant (Azadirachtaindica) and results have shown that it has both medicinal and pharmacological properties against malaria. However, there are no documented information relating the mineral properties inherent in the leaf of the plant. Consequently, this work was aimed at determining some chemical component present in the water extract of neem leaf using the modern atomic absorption spectrophotometric analysis.<br/> 1.2    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>Extracts from neem tree (Azadirachtaindica A. Juss) also called “dogonyaro” in Nigeria are most consistently recommended in ancient medical texts for gastrointestinal upsets, diarrhea and intestinal infections, skin ulcers and infections, and malaria (Schmutterer,1995). India encouraged scientific investigations of neem tree as part of his program to revitalize Indian tradition and also increase commercial interest on neem (Stix, 1992) and presently some authors believe that no other plant or tree in the world has been so extensively researchedor used, in all possible capacities so far. In Africaextracts from Neem leaves have provided various medicinal preparations (Ekanem, 1971 and Udeinya, 1993).<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>Development of modern non-toxic drugs from neem has earlier been suggested (Biswas et al, 2002) and IRAB represents such dream. This fractionated acetone/water neem leaf extract is the only drug reported to have activities against Malaria. Recent in-vivo studies have substantiated the earlier in-vitro reports of pharmacological properties.<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>Main Objective<br/>Evaluation of the chemical component of dogoyaro liquid (azadirachtaindica) for anti-malaria<br/> <br/>Specific Objective<br/>To examine the chemical component of dogoyaro leafwhich serve as drug to many illness especially Malaria<br/><br/>\n\nEVALUATION OF THE CHEMICAL COMPONENT OF DOGOYARO LIQUID (AZADIRACHTA INDICA) FOR ANTI-MALARIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EVALUATION OF THE CHEMICAL COMPONENT OF DOGOYARO LIQUID (AZADIRACHTA INDICA) FOR ANTI-MALARIA", "id": 37}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>DETERMINATION OF ACTIVE SWEET COMPONENTS OF COMMON ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS THAT ARE USED AS REPLACEMENT FOR SUGAR<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/> This research investigated how the sweetness of sugar substitute compares to the sweetness of sugar.

Some sugar substitutes are natural and some are synthetic. Those that are not natural are in general, called artificial sweeteners. Artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes are found in a variety of food and beverages marketed as sugar free or diet including soft drinks, chewing gum, jellies, baked goods, candy, fruit juice and ice-cream and yoghurt. [Whitney 2011]<br/> People may not all like the same kind of baked treats but one thing we all agree on is that baked treats should be sweets usually, sugar is used to lend sweetness to foods but would cake taste just as good if the baker used a sugar substitutes instead of sugar? Many people prefer not to use sugar often due to health reasons and instead depend on sugar substitutes to sweeten their foods. But are sugar substitutes the same as sugar? What exactly are the differences between sugar and sugar substitutes?<br/> Sugar also known as sucrose comes from plants like sugar cane and sugar beets and is a carbohydrate. Sugar adds bulk to cakes, cookies and all kinds of treats; sugar also causes browning and caramelizing in foods when it is<br/> heated as when cookies turn golden brown in the oven sugar is a natural substance, something that our bodies can use for energy.<br/> Sugar substitutes come in three categories; artificial sweeteners, sugar alcohols and natural sweeteners. Artificialsweeteners are attractive because they add almost no calories to foods and are sometimes a part of weight loss programs. Also they donot increase blood sugar levels which mean that diabetics can use them. Many artificial sweeteners like sucralose were discovered by accident in the laboratory. In 1976, a scientist in England was studying different compounds made from sugar. The scientist asked a student to test the compounds but instead the student tested them. Another category of sugar substitutes is sugar alcohols. Sugar alcohols are not alcoholic beverages they do not contain ethanol which is found in alcoholic beverages. Sugar alcohols like sugar have calories and energy but not asmuch as sugar. Sugar alcohols like artificial sweeteners do not contribute to tooth decay and affect blood sugar levels slowly so diabetics can use them. Although sugar alcohols like xylitol, sorbitol and erythritol are manufactured products the sources are often natural.<br/> The last category of sugar substitutes is called natural substitutes. The categories include maple syrup, agave nectar and honey. These substances<br/> are absorbed by our digestive system and contain calories and nutrients that our bodies can use.

In this research sugar and sugar substitutes will be tested and the sweetness will be compare in relation to sugar.<br/>  To compare the availability and affordability of the active components in the artificial sweetener and sugar<br/>  To know the components of this artificial sweetener and what makes them taste sweet<br/> 1.2 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/> Artificial sweetener mimicking the taste of sugar will be a better alternative to people who are suffering from diabetics. Unlike sugar, artificial sweeteners generally don?t raise blo carbohydrates.<br/> CHAPTER TWO<br/> REVIEW OF LITERATURE<br/> 2.0   TABLE SUGAR (SUCROSE): Sugar was brought to the Americas by Christopher Columbus. At the time, sugar was processed by boiling the cane juice and then harvesting the crystals left behind after the water evaporated. These crystals contained protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals. Sugar is generally extracted from plants sugar beet and sugar cane or a main ingredient in many foods and recipes available as sucrose or saccharose (household sugar), lactose (milk sugar), fructose (fruit sugar), glucose (dextrose). [Abishak, 2009].<br/> 2.1  CLASSIFICATION OF SUGAR: <br/>  Raw sugar: It is interesting to note that raw sugar is already refined. Only sugars from evaporated cane juice can be classified as truly raw or unrefined sugars. Sugars can come from other sources as well such as beets and fruit, once the cane juice crystals are harvested; they are washed, boiled, centrifuged, filtered and dried. The purpose of this is to remove all the original plant materials (stalk, fiber etc.) to produce pure sugar.<br/> This process removes most of the fiber and nutrients that existed in the original crystals. The sugar then becomes refined and is now a food high in calories with little nutritional value.<br/>  Refined sugar: several centuries ago, refined sugars were expensive to produce and were also taxed at a higher rate. Refined sugar is derived from cane juice but is extremely processed with many of the natural enzymes, vitamins, minerals and fiber removed.<br/>  Natural sugar: natural sweeteners include; barley malt, evaporated cane juice before it is refined, fruit juice, rice, syrup honey and sugar alcohols. [Wikipedia 2013]<br/> 2.1.1 MECHANISM OF ACTION IN THE BODY<br/> Sucrose is the organic compound commonly known as table sugar and sometimes called saccharose. A white, odorless, crystalline powder with a sweet taste. The molecule is a disaccharide composed of the monosaccharide, glucose and fructose. Glucose is a carbohydrate and is the most important simple sugar in human metabolism. In living organisms the oxidation of<br/> glucose contributes to a series of complex biochemical reactions which provide the energy needed by cells. The first step in the breakdown of glucose in all cells is glycolysis, producing pyruvate which is the starting point for all other processes in cellular respiration. In cells where oxygen is present (aerobic respiration) these processes have been modeled in the TCA cycle. A major part of the use of the energy from glucose oxidation is the conversion of ADP to ATP with the energy rich molecule. ATP being subsequently used as the energy currency of the cell. [Jeremy, 2013].<br/> 2.1.2 SUGAR ALCOHOLS AND NOVEL SWEETENER<br/>  Sugar  alcohols  (polyols)  are  carbohydrates  that  occur  naturally  in<br/> certain fruits and vegetables, but they are also manufactured. They?re not considered intense sweeteners, becaus some are less sweet than sugar.<br/> Sugar alcohols aren?t considered non because they contain calories,.Despitetheir but t name sugar alcohols aren?t alcoholic found in alcoholic beverages.<br/>Novel sweeteners are combinations of various types of sweeteners. Novels sweeteners such as stevia are hardtop fit into one particular category because of what they?re made from and how the are considered novel sweeteners because of their chemical structure.<br/> Tagatose is a low carbohydrate sweetener similar to fructose that occurs naturally but is also manufactured from lactose in dairy products.<br/> [Mayo, 2012]<br/>  USES OF SUGAR ALCOHOL<br/>  Sugar alcohols generally aren?t used they are found in many processed foods and other product including chocolate, candy, baked goods etc. usually replacing sugar on an equal basis. When added to foods sugar alcohols add sweetness, bulk and texture.<br/> They also help food stay moist, prevent browning when heated and add a cooling sensation to products. Sugar alcohols are often combined with artificial sweeteners to enhance sweetness. [Mayo,2013].<br/> 2.1.3 ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF SUGAR<br/> ADVANTAGES: Natural sugar is a direct form of glucose, which is required for the body to function. Insulin breaks down glucose or blood sugar and converts it into energy for the body to use, sugar in its natural or refined form is an easily digestible carbohydrate and a quick source of energy for the body.<br/> DISAVANTAGES: There are many health concerns over sugar. Large amounts of sugar are required to make food sweet and because sugar contains a lot of calories, the body absorbs more calories and fat into its system. Similarly regularly eating food containing natural, refined or processed sugar increases the blood sugar intake and can result in type II diabetes, where the insulin in the body is inadequate to break up the amount of sugar in the bloodstream [Mayo, 2012].<br/> 2.2 ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS<br/>Artificial sweeteners are synthetic sugar substitutes but may be derived from naturally occurring substances including herbs or sugar itself. Artificial sweeteners are also known as intense sweeteners because they are many times sweeter than regular sugar. Artificial sweeteners are chemical compositions and are not naturally in foods or naturally produced or extracted. There are a variety of artificial sweeteners available such as aspartame, saccharin, sucralose, neotame which are sold under brand names but can be identified by the chemical name on food packages. All artificial sweeteners must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration. [Whitney et al, 2011].<br/>2.2.1 ADVANTAGES AND DISAVANTAGES<br/>ADVANTAGES: Artificial sweetener can be chemically composed to be low in calories. Natural, refined or processed sugar is generally full of calories and large amounts of sugar are required to sweeten food, artificial sweetener, however is much sweeter than sugar up to 400 times sweeter and low in calories therefore less artificial sweetener is needed to make food sweet.<br/>DISADVANTAGES:  Artificial  sweetener  is  a  chemical  compound  and<br/>there has been concern about the bo compounds to natural sugar. Artificial sweeteners despite being lower in<br/> calories also provide less energy for the body to use. There are also concerns of side effects from consumingartificial sweeteners; aspartame for example contains 50 percent phenylalanine, 40 percent aspartic acid and 10 percent methanol which are considered dangerous neurotoxins. [Mayo, 2011].<br/>2.2.2 REASONS FOR USE<br/> To assist in weight loss: Some people chose to limit their food energy intake by replacing high energy. Sugar or corn syrup with other sweeteners having little or no food energy. This allows them to eat the same foods they normally would, while allowing them to lose weight and avoid other problems associated with excessive calorie<br/> <br/>\n\nDETERMINATION OF ACTIVE SWEET COMPONENTS OF COMMON ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS THAT ARE USED AS REPLACEMENT FOR SUGAR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DETERMINATION OF ACTIVE SWEET COMPONENTS OF COMMON ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS THAT ARE USED AS REPLACEMENT FOR SUGAR", "id": 38}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EVALUATION OF ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL OF MONODORA MYRISTICA (AFRICAN NUTMEG)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This work evaluates the antioxidant potential of Monodora myristica (African nutmeg). Monodora myristica extract was obtained by solvent extraction using n-hexane and used as treatment on freshly prepared crude palm kernel oil and palm oil. Equal volume of oil samples were subjected to different concentration of extract treatment (0.2ml,0.4ml, 0.6ml, 0.8ml, 1.0ml using syringe. These oil samples were equally divided into two groups SS and SR. Group SS was stored under the sun and group SR  was stored in the room for three weeks. These treated oil samples were analyzed on weekly basis at two different parameters: Acid value (AV) of free fatty acid and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value, using standard methods. The main effect of extract was determined using ANOVA. For the two varieties of oil, the acid value of free fatty acid increased significantly (P&lt;0.05) as the period extends for group SS without extract while those for group SR showed no significant increase. But AV of oil samples treated with higher extract concentration decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05) for both groups SS and SR. TBA value also showed the same trend of AV. Hence, monodora myristica extract yielded reducing effect in the oxidative level of the oil varieties.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>            Lipid oxidation is one of the major reasons that food deteriorate and is caused by the reaction of fat and oil with molecular oxygen, leading to off-flavours that are generally called rancidity(Basturk et al., 2007). Exposure to light, pro-oxidants and elevated temperature will accelerate the reaction (Kubow, 2009). Lipid oxidation and resultant flavour impairment has seriously limited the storage potential of most fat containing foods (Ihekoronye and Ngoddy, 1985).<br/>            Rancidity covers a wide range of biological activities where the effect is to “make things worse” and thus adversely affect man’s economy. Free radicals and microorganisms are known to cause chemical characteristics that lead to oxidation and deterioration in quality of vegetable oils derived from the seeds or fruits pulps of plants (Basturk et al, 2007). The keeping quality of the oils is basically dependent on their chemical compositions, for instance, the percentages of the degree of unsaturation. Rancidity is associated with off-flavour and odour of the oil. There are two causes of rancidity. One occurs when oil reacts with oxygen and is called oxidative rancidity. The other cause of rancidity is by the combination of enzymes and moisture. Enzymes such as lipase liberate fatty acids from the triglyceride to form di and/or monoglycerides and free fatty acids and such liberation of fatty acid is called hydrolysis, hence hydrolytic rancidity.<br/>The oxidation of fats is an important deteriorative reaction with significant commercial implications in term of product value. The initial oxidation products that accumulate are hydroperoxides, which may subsequently break down to form lower-molecular weight compounds such as alcohols, aldehydes, free fatty acids and ketones, leading to autoxidative rancidity. The peroxide content present in alimentary fats attests to its state of primary oxidation and thus its tendency to go rancid. Unsaturated fatty acids, in fact, react with oxygen forming peroxides, which determine a series of chain reactions whose end result is volatile substances having the characteristic smell of rancidness. These reactions are accelerated by high temperatures and by exposure to light and oxygen (Yildiz et al., 2002). The lower the peroxide and acid values, the better the quality of the alimentary fats and their state of preservation.<br/>Although simple, procedures of  acid value (AV) or peroxide value (PV) determination are cumbersome, destructive to the sample, costly, require potentially hazardous solvents, substantial personnel time, glassware and accurate preparation of reagents and are dependent on a visual endpoint (Ismail et al., 1993; Van de Voort et al., 1994).<br/>            Oxidation is concerned mainly with unsaturated fatty acids. Oxidative rancidity is of special interest as it leads to the development of off-flavour that can be detected early on in the development of rancidity (Basturk et al., 2007)<br/>Some slight deterioration at least is to expected in any commercial oil-bearing material and is, in fact, inherent in the process by which fat is formed (Morel,1997). In the living plants and animals, fats, carbohydrates and proteins are synthesized in a complicated series of steps with the aid of certain enzymes. These enzymes are capable of assisting the reverse as well as the forward reactions and hence under proper conditions may promote the oxidation and degradation of the very substances that, they have previously been instrumental in synthesizing (Basturk et al., 2007)<br/>            Oils in general are known to be susceptible to oxidation and microbial attack. The composition of the various oils determines the extent of oxidation and type of organisms likely to thrive in them (Chow et al., 2000). Several studies have demonstrated that environment factors affect not only the fatty acid composition of vegetable oil, but also, although apparently indirectly, the spatial arrangement of those acids on the triacylglycerol molecule (Tay et al., 2002). Triacylglycerol composition and structure are important in the areas of nutrition, oil stability and possible physiological effects.<br/>            Palm oil is extracted from the mesocarp of the fruit of the oil palm, Elaeis guineensis. crude palm oil (CPO) has a deep orange-red colour due to the high content of carotenoids and is a rich source of vitamin E consisting of tocopherols and tocotrienols (Nesaretnam and Muhammad, 1999). Both beta carotenes and vitamin E are well known nutritional antioxidants.<br/>            Palm oil is known to support the growth of fungi and bacteria especially when it contains moisture (Cornellus, 2001).. Their lipolytic enzymes are so active that even under unfavorable conditions palm oil is seldom produced with a free fatty acid content (FFA) of less than 2% and under favorable conditions of processing, the free fatty acid content of this oil reaches 20%and higher. When the fruit is bruised, lipolytic action occurs and a near maximum FFA (8-10%) is reached within 40 minutes. The FFA of unbruised fruits may increase only 0.2% or less in the course of 4 days (Cornellus, 2001).<br/>            The exposure in the sun is made under radiations of weak temperatures, varying daily, creating an environment favourable to the chemical and enzymatic reactions of hydrolysis and oxidation (Tan et al., 2002).<br/>This study is aimed at examining the oxidative and biodeteriogenic effects of free radicals contaminating the oils from the varieties of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) and palm kernel oil and the chemical components of the oils and the effect of solvent extract of ehuru (African nutmeg).<br/>            Oil palm is indigenous to the Nigerian coastal area. It was discovered by European explorers in the early 1400’s and was distributed throughout tropical Africa by humans who practiced shifting agriculture about 5000 years ago. The palm plant originated from the jungle forest of East Africa and about 5000 years ago, palm oil was used by the pharaohs for cooking and lighting. The cultivation of oil palm is restricted to the eastern sub zones where its growth is favoured environmentally and climatically. Besides, it is a major cash crop in this region. The first oil palm plantation was established at Sumatra in 1911 and at Malaysia in 1917. About this time it was simultaneously established in West Africa and tropical America.<br/>Over the years, a little attention was paid to the industrial use of palm kernel oil. Nevertheless, recent studies have indicated that apart from their domestic uses that they can be used as engine lubricants, as replacement for biodiesel if their properties are enhanced.<br/>Although high in saturated fats, it is a different oil to extract from the nut or kernel of palms which has a yellowish white colour and a pleasantly mild flavor similar to coconut oil in fatty oil acid composition and properties.  Crude palm kernel oil (CPKO) is extracted from palm kernels with palm kernel cake as a by-product. The physical and chemical properties of the various palm oil products have been reviewed by Nesaretnam and Muhammad, (1999).<br/>            Monodora myristica is a widespread and attractive small tree with very decorative flowers appearing just before the leaves. The fruit is suspended on a long green stalk with numerous seeds embedded in whitish sweet smelling pulp. The seed is oblong and pale brown when fresh with a thin seed coat and hard kernel (Nesaretnam and Muhammad, 1999). The seed production is seasonal occurring between April to June. The fruits are globular and ovoid; 3-4 inch long and about 3-5 inch diameter. The wood is hard. The seeds are contained in a hard shell and have a very strong aroma . This plant is commonly called Orchid flower tree in English, Ehuru Ofia in lgbo (Okafor, 2003). Monodora myristica is a specie of calabash nutmeg, the edible seeds yield a nutmeg-flavoured oil which is used in West Africa for cooking (Eggeling, 2002). Plants that belong to Annonaceae family are rich in flavonoids and bioflavonoids and are known to have antioxidant activity (Shahidi et al., 2009). Monodora myristica seed extract contains important pharmacological compounds, alkaloids, flavonoids, and vitamins A and E as well as many important lipids; arhinolipids, free fatty acids, glycolipids, phospholipids and sterols. The plant is widely used in ethnomedicine, especially to relieve toothache as well as in the treatment of dysentery. When roasted and ground, the seeds are rubbed on the skin for (unspecified) skin diseases (Irvine, 2000). This suggests that the seeds of Monodora myristica plant could be germicidal or antiseptic. The roasted ground seeds are chewed, then spat into the hand and then rubbed across the forehead to relieve headache. The seeds are also crushed and used as insecticide, while the root relieves toothache when crushed (Ogtinein unet al., 1999).<br/>Monodora myristica seeds are also used for the treatment of constipation and as a stimulant (Irvine, 2000). The essential oil from Monodora myristica seed is used in pharmaceutical and dental preparation (Talalaji, 1999).<br/>In this study, we have monitored characteristic parameter, namely acid value and thiobarbituric acid value during storage of palm kernel oil and palm oil at different environmental conditions treated with different concentration of seed extract of Monodora myristica. Whereby, the acid value and thiobarbituric acid value, were assessed by the conventional method and the UV-spectra were registered for each sample. Although simple, procedures of acid value (AV) or peroxide value (PV) determination are cumbersome, destructive to the sample, costly, require potentially hazardous solvents, substantial personnel time, glassware and accurate preparation of reagents and are dependent on a visual endpoint (Ismail et al., 1993; Van de Voort et al., 1994).<br/> 1.1      SIGNIFICANCE  OF RESEARCH<br/>The aim and objective of this research is to:<br/>1.         To carryout solvent extraction of Monodora myristica <br/>2.         To  investigate the antioxidant effect of Monodora myristica extract on palm kernel oil and palm oil at different environmental conditions.<br/><br/> \n\nEVALUATION OF ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL OF MONODORA MYRISTICA (AFRICAN NUTMEG)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EVALUATION OF ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL OF MONODORA MYRISTICA (AFRICAN NUTMEG)", "id": 39}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PHYTOCHEMICAL AND ANTI INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES OF METHANOL EXTRACT OF CRATEVA ADANSONII STEM BARK<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>  This research investigated the phytochemical and anti-inflammatory properties of methanol extract of Crateva adansonii stem bark. Although several edible and non-edible plants parts are used in inflammatory treatment, many record has been found of the use of Crateva adansonii stem bark. For this research, fresh stem bark of Crateva adansonii were collected from Asata village in Enugu State. The cuttings were authenticated at the Bioresource development centre. They were then dried at room temperature for one month in an open lab space, grounded into powder and weighed on a beam balance as 460.6g. The powder was soaked for twenty-four to fourty-eight hours in methanol to get a methanol extract and then concentrated into paste at a set temperature range of 30-550C in a water bath. A population of twenty adult wistar Albino rats was used for anti-inflammatory test. The rats were divided into five (5) groups of four (4) albino rats each. They were administered 3% tween-80 mixed with dichloromethane extract of Crateva adansonii and the control was administered with 0.5ml of 3% tween-80. Acute inflammation was induced an hour after test substances were administered by injecting egg albumin in the subplanter region of the right hind paw and edema assessed by mercury displacement for a period of 0-180 minutes. Anti-inflammatory effect was significant within 30 minutes of induced edema with inhibition occurring in three phases of 0-30, 30-60, 60-90. 90-120 to 180 minutes.

It is a complex biological response of vascular tissue to harmful stimuli such as pathogens, damaged cells irritant. Inflammation is the reaction of vascularized tissue to local injury caused by certain stimuli like infections, chemicals and biochemical agents, thermal or other physical trauma, antigen-antibody interaction etc (Carol, 1994). Without inflammatory response, wounds will not heal and minor infections would be over weening. Though inflammation aims at limiting damage and restoring function, some enzymes and toxic products within phagocytic cells are released to the extend of damaging the tissue. The advent of anti-inflammatory agents has made inflammation which as been a threat to human life due to its complex, multicontent, to loose its power. These anti-inflammatory agents or drugs help reduce, pain by inhibiting inflammation as opposed to opioids, which affects the central nervous system. It also prevent repairs, prevent and stop the consequences of inflammation by acting on the body responses without directly antagonizing the causative agent (Stedman, 2000). These anti-inflammatory process involves the process of balancing pro-inflammatory acute-phase reactants (Russell et al. 2000), altering biochemical pathway forming prostaglandins by inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzyme from catalyzing the reaction, as a result, suppress, compensate and correct the mechanical and structural abnormalities by assistive device. (Masumoto et al.2009).<br/>The inflammatory reaction is phylogenetically and ontogenetically the oldest defense mechanism. The cells of immune system are widely distributed throughout the body, but if an infection or tissue damage occurs. It is necessary to concentrate them and their products at the site of damage.<br/>Three major events occurring during this response:<br/>1.                 An increased blood supply to the damaged tissue . It is performed by vasodilation. The inflamed tissue look like containing greater number of vessels.<br/>2.                 Increased capillary permeability caused by retraction of the endothelial cells. This permits larger molecules than usual to escape from the capillaries, and thus allows the soluble mediators of immunity to reach the site of inflammation.<br/> 3.                 Leukocytes migrates out of the capillaries into the surrounding tissues. In the earliest stages of inflammation, neutrophils are particularly<br/> prevalent, but later monocytes and lymphocytes migrate towards the site of infection (Ashcroft et al.1999).<br/>For the possibility of surrounding tissue damage, inflammatory responses must be well ordered and controlled. The body must be able to act quickly in some situations, for example to reduce or stop the lost of blood, whereas tissue repair can begin later. Therefore a wide variety of interconnected cellular and humoral (soluble) mechanisms are activated when tissue damage and infections occur. On the other hand, if injury is negligible, the body must have mechanisms which are able to stop tissue damage when the agent is removed. The development of inflammatory reactions is controlled by cytokines, products of plasma enzymes (complement, the coagulation clotting, kinin and fibrolytic pathways), by lipid mediators (prostaglandin and leukotrienes) released from different cells/ and by vasoactive mediators from the mast cells, basophils and platelets. These anti-inflammatory reactions differ. Fast-acting mediators such as vasoactive amines and the product of the kininsystem, modulate the immediate response. Later, newly synthesized mediators such as leukotrienes are involved in the accumulation and activation of other cells. However, in inflammatory reactions initiated by the immune system, the ultimate control is exerted by the antigen itself in the same ways it controls the immune response itself. For this reason, the cellular accumulation at the site of chronic infection or auto-immune reactions where antigen cannot ultimately be eradicated, is quiet different from the sites were antigenic stimulus can be rapidly cleared.<br/> The nervous system can also participate in the control of inflammation especially axon reflexes, but inflammation may be realized in non-nervous tissues as well.Inflammation may become chronic in certain settings where the acute process characterized by neutrophil infiltration and swelling gives way to predominance of mononuclear phagocytes and lymphocytes.This probably occurs to some degree with the normal healing process but becomesexaggerated and chronic when there’s materials as in certain infections (e.g tuberculosis) or following introduction<br/>of foreign bodies (example asbestos) or deposition of crystals (example urate crystals). Chronic inflammation is often associated with fussion of mononuclear cells to form multinucleated gigantic cells, which eventually become granuloma. Chronic inflammation is seen under of delayed hypersensitivity (Nathan, 2002).<br/>1.2            CRATEVA ADANSONII AS A PLANT. <br/>The flowering tree crateva religiosa (syn crateva adansonii) is called the sacred garlic pear and temple plant, and many other names in a variety of dialets, including Balai, lamok, abiyuch, barna, varuna and bidasi. The tree is sometimes called the spider tree because the showy flower bear long, spidery stamens. It is native to Japan, Australia, much of South East Asia and several South east Asia and several South pacific islands. It is grown elsewhere for fruit especially in part of African continent.<br/>The crateva adansonii plant is a moderate sized, spreading unarmed, deciduous tree growing to a height of 15 meters. Bark is grey, the wood yellowish-white turning light brown when old. Leaves are clustered at the end of the branchlets with a common petiole 5-10 centimeter long, at the summit of which are three leaflets. Leaflets are ovate-lanceolate or ovate 7.5-12 centimeter long, 4-6 centimeter wide. Pointed at the base rather slender pointer at the tip. Flower occur in terminal corymbs, about 5 centimeters in diameter, greenish yellow, and at length purplish.<br/> Petals are ovate or oblong with the claw haft as long as the limb. Fruit is ovoid or rounded, 3-5 centimeter in diameters, with a hard and rough rind.<br/> Seeds  are  about  10  centimeter  in  length,  numerous  kidney-shaped,  and embedded in a yellow pulp.<br/> 1.3            DISTRIBUTION <br/>1.                 In waste places, along streams and in thickets near the sea.<br/> 2.                 Occurs in India, Myanmar, Sri lanka, Malasia, Indonesia and China.

Leaves considered stomachic and tonic. <br/>Roots and bark considered laxative, lithotriptic and alternative, promoting appetite and increasing biliary sections.<br/>Leaves are rubifacient, tonic and febrifugal.<br/> 1.6            RESEARCH AIM AND OBJECTIVES <br/>This research aim at investigating the anti-inflammatory properties of methanol extract of crateva adasonii stem bark. And as objectives, to compare the therapeutic potential, (i.e. anti-inflammatory effect ) of the methanol extract of crateva adansonii bark against the experimental standard indomethacin. <br/>1.7            BACKGROUND OF STUDY <br/>The plant crateva adansonii also known as or also called sacred garlic pear and temple plant. Apart from its medicinal properties which allows the plants to be used as laxative, it is also an edible plant especially the fruits,<br/>berry and young shoot. The plant is used in herbal treatment of tympanites, convulsion, treatment of fever, rheumatism, urinary calculi etc.<br/> Crateva adansonii is capable of suppressing the free radicals, production, it is been suggested to have anti-inflammatory properties which counter the synthesis of inflammatory mediators thus forming the background of this research.<br/> CHAPTER TWO<br/>  LITERATURE REVIEW<br/> 2.0      DEFINITION OF INFLAMMATION<br/>Inflammation (Latin word “inflammo,”I setmeaninglight,“ the body attempt at self-protection; the aim being to remove harmful stimuli, including damaged cells; irritants (Stedman, 1990). Inflammation is part of the body’s immuneInitially,it is beneficialresponsewhen,for.example, your knee sustains a blow and tissues need care and protection. However, sometimes inflammation can cause further inflammation; it can become self-perpetuating. More inflammation is created in response to existing inflammation (Guyton, 1990).<br/>2.1            PRINCIPLE OF INFLAMMATION <br/> Inflammation is a complex stereotypical reaction of the body expressing the response to damage of its cells and vascularized tissues, e.g. in normal cornea, the true inflammation does not occur (Smith, 2000).<br/> The discovery of the detailed processes of inflammation has revealed a close relationship between inflammation and the immune response.<br/>The five basic symptoms of inflammation – redness (rubor), swelling (tumor), heat (calor), pain (dolor) and deranged function (funtiolaesa) have been known since the ancient Greek and Roman era (Nathan, 2002). These signs are due to extravasation of plasma and infiltration of leukocytes into the site of inflammation. Early investigators considered inflammation a primary host defence system. From this point of view inflammation is the key reaction of the innate immune response but in fact, but inflammation is more than this, since it can lead to death, as an anaphylactic shock or delibitating diseases, asin arthritis and gout (Lentsch &amp; Ward, 2000).<br/> According to different criteria, inflammatory responses can be divided into several categories. The criteria includes:<br/>1.                 time- hyperacute (peracute), acute, sub acute, and chronic inflammation;<br/>2.                 the main inflammatory manifestation- alteration, exudation, proliferation;<br/>3.                the degree of tissue damage –superficial, profound (bordered, not bordered);<br/>4.                 characteristics picture- nonspecific, specific;<br/>5.                 Immunopathological mechanisms allergic (reaginic) inflammation,<br/>inflammation mediated by cytotoxic antibodies, inflammation mediated by immune complexes, delayed- type hypersensitivity reactions. (Serhan, 2008)<br/>2.2 TYPES OF INFLAMMATION<br/> There are two basic types of inflammation- acute and chronic inflammation.<br/> Acute inflammation: is of short duration, which could be anything from a few minutes to a few days. Such inflammation is caused by foreign substance entering the body, or by physical damage. A viral infection may also precipitate acute inflammation.<br/>Chronic inflammation, on the other hand, is long lasting. It may persist for weeks, months or even years. Chronic inflammation may be brought on by acute inflammation or maybe the result of an auto immune disease.<br/>Two other, less common types of inflammation are sub-acute inflammation and granulomatous chronic inflammation.<br/>Sub- acute inflammation has clinical features of acute and chronic inflammation- it is an intermediary stages between the two. Granulomatous chronic inflammation: This is a special type of chronic inflammation that is associated with tuberculosis and some lesser known diseases<br/><br/>\n\nPHYTOCHEMICAL AND ANTI INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES OF METHANOL EXTRACT OF CRATEVA ADANSONII STEM BARK<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PHYTOCHEMICAL AND ANTI INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES OF METHANOL EXTRACT OF CRATEVA ADANSONII STEM BARK", "id": 40}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PHYTOCHEMICAL AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES OF METHANOL EXTRACT OF CRATEVA ADANSONII STEM BARK<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Inflammation is a complex biological response of vascular tissue to harmful stimuli such as pathogen, damage cells or irritants.

Anti –inflammatory drugs make up about half of analgesics, reducing pain by inhibiting inflammation as opposed to opioids, which affect the central nervous system published by Artemis Morris, molly Rossiter.<br/> Inflammation (Latin, inflammo, “ the complex biological response of vascular tissues to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants. The classical signs of inflammation are pain, heat, redness, swelling and loss of function by Dr Weil. Inflammation is a protective attempt by the organism to remove the injurious stimuli and initiate the healing process.<br/>Inflammation is not a synonym for infection, even in cases where inflammation is caused by infection. Although infection is caused by a microorganism, and organism pathogen.<br/> Inflammation is a setereotyped response and is considered as a mechanism of innate immunity by Dr. Weil.<br/> 1.1            TYPES OF INFLAMMATION <br/>  Inflammation can be classified as either acute or chronic. Acute inflammation, is the initial response of the body to harmful stimuli and is achieved by the increased movement of plasma and leukocytes (especially granulocytes) from the blood into the injured tissues.<br/> <br/>Prolonged inflammation, known as chronic inflammation, leads to a progressive shift in the type of cells present at the site of inflammation and is characterized by simultaneous destruction and healing of the tissues from the inflammatory process from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br/> 1.2.         AIMS AND OBJECTIVES.<br/> Evaluation of the anti –inflammatory activity of crateva adansonii (plant).

Zobo drink is a popular drink in the Nigeria, especially in the northern part of Nigeria. The result of the analysis indicated that the drink is high in vital mineral nutrients required for the healthy growth by humans and for the proper metabolic processes to be adequately maintained. Zobo drink is high, as indicated in the result, in iron – a major component of the human haemoglobin, when compared with other leaf like the popular vegetable leaf known as awa (Piper methysticum).<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0                                                       INTRODUCTION<br/>            Toward the end of the 20th century, epidemiological studies and associated meta-analyses suggested strongly that long-term consumption of diets rich in plant foods offered some protection against chronic diseases, especially cancer (Wallstromet al., 2000).Because uncontrolled production of free radicals was thought to be significantly implicated in the etiology of cancer (Guyton and Kensler 1993),these observations focused attention on the possible role of radical scavenging and radical suppressing nutrients and non-nutrients in explaining the apparent benefit of such diets (Weisburger, 1991).<br/>The realization that free radicals were similarly implicated in the etiology of many other chronic diseases (Kehrer, 1993 and Stohs, 1995), immediately focused attention on flavonoids and the foods and beverages rich therein. An unfortunate, but unintended side effect of some research works and papers was the misleading tendency of many investigators to think of dietary phenols, polyphenols, and tannins (PPT)as encompassing only the flavonoids, flavonols, and flavones. More recent epidemiological studies have supported the association between better health and long-term consumption of diets rich in foods of plant origin(Hung et al., 2004 and Jansen et al., 2004).However, whether this is because such diets minimize exposure to deleterious substances (example oxidized cholesterol, pyrolysis mutagens, salt, saturated fat, etc.), or maximize intake of certain beneficial nutrients (example isothiocyanates and other sulfur-containing plant constituents, mono-unsaturated fatty<br/>acids, and poly-unsaturated fatty acids, PPT, polyacetylenes, selenium, terpenes, etc.) or some combination as advocated in the ‘‘Polymeal’’ concept, remains unknown (Franco et al., 2004 and Johnson, 2004).An in vitro study indicates that there may be mechanistic basis for true synergy between PPT and isothiocyanates. In contrast, more recent studies seeking to assess the suggested link between the consumption of flavonols and flavones, or other flavonoids, have given much less consistent results. Some studies have suggested a possible protective effect of flavonoids against vascular diseases (Hirvonen et al., 2001 and Mennen et al., 2004) or certain (but not all) cancers(Knekt et al., 1997 and Sun et al., 2002).Interestingly, an investigation of the relationship between the consumption of Hibiscus sabdariffa (zobo) and other cruciferous vegetables and the risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women has to be carried out in order to ascertain the beneficial effects to isothiocyanates and/or the phenolic components of the plants (like the dietary phenols including flavonoids) in the management of cancer growth and initiation of various types of diabetes.<br/>In the same time period, various studies have suggested beneficial effect associated with raised consumption of other classes of dietary phenols. For example, increased coffee consumption has been linked with reduced incidence of type II diabetes (van Dam et al., 2002 and Saremi et al., 2003).Similarly, increased consumption of lignans (or at least greater plasma concentrations of their metabolites)has been linked with reduced incidence of estrogen-related cancers in some (Boccardo et al., 2004 and McCann et al., 2004) but not all studies (Kilkkinen et al., 2004 and Zeleniuch –Jacquotte et al., 2004),and a prospective study was equivocal.<br/>1.1       SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH<br/>The flavonoids in the water extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa should be extracted for further experimental and clinical research in the management of certain ailments and disorders like cancer, diabetes mellitus etc.<br/>The mechanisms of flavonoid-protein interactions have been determined; it is my suggestion that such mechanisms should be carried to the in-vivo metabolic and physiological processes aimed at determining the detailed mechanisms involved in cells aging processes and the progression of diseases.<br/>1.2       OBJECTIVE OF STUDY<br/>    The objective of this study is to determine the physico chemical (biochemical) and water constituent of Zobo produced from dried calyces of Hibiscus sabdariffa (Linn Roselle).

The most widely accepted risk factors for ED are discussed.<br/>The research is focused on human data and the safety and effectiveness of Burantashi stem as a Phosphodiesterase - 5 inhibitors (PDE5) used to treat Erectile Dysfunction.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/> 1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>Erectile dysfunction, ED, is a sexual dysfunction that affects the reproductive systems of both men and women. By definition according to National Institute of Health Consensus Developmental panel on Impotence (1993), in males, it is a sexual dysfunction characterized with the inability to develop or maintain an erection of the penis sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. It is also known as male impotence or Baby D Syndrome. While in women, according to American psychiatric Association (1994), it is characterized with the persistent or recurrent inability to attain, or maintain until completion of the sexual activity, an adequate lubrication-swelling response that otherwise is present during female sexual arousal and sexual activity is thus prevented. Hence, it is called women impotence or female erectile dysfunction. The word impotence may also be used to describe other problems that interfere with sexual intercourse and reproduction, such as lack of sexual desire and problems with ejaculation or orgasm. Using the term “erectile dysfunction”, however, makes it clear that those other problems are not involved (NIH, 2005).<br/>An erection occurs as a hydraulic effect due to blood entering and being retained in sponge-like bodies within the penis and clitoris. The process is most often than not initiated as a result of sexual arousal, when signals are transmitted from the brain to nerves in the pelvis. Erectile dysfunction is, therefore, indicated when an erection is consistently difficult or impossible to produce, despite arousal (laumann et al, 1999).<br/> 1.1  Prevalence of erectile dysfunction in men<br/>        Erectile dysfunction, ED, varies in severity; some men have a total inability to achieve an erection, others have inconsistent ability to achieve an erection, and still others can sustain only brief erection. The variation in severity of erectile dysfunction makes estimating its frequency difficult. Many men also are reluctant to discuss erectile dysfunction with their doctors, and thus, the condition is under-diagnosed. Nevertheless, experts have estimated that ED affects 30 million men in the United States. Again, according to the statistical research carried out by Adegunloye and Eze, in 2002 and 1994 respectively in Nigeria, results show that about 23-26.4% of men suffer from this condition while according to Spector and Carey in 1999, discovered that about 4-9% of men suffer from the condition in the United States.<br/>       While erectile dysfunction can occur at any age, it is uncommon among young men and more common in the elderly. By the age of 45, most men have experienced erectile dysfunction at least some of the time. According to the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, complete impotence increases from 5% among men 40 years of age to 15% among men 70 years and older. Population studies conducted in the Netherlands found out that some degree of ED occurred in 20% of men between 50-54 and in 50% of men between ages 70-78. In 1998, the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey counted 1,520,000 doctor offices visited for ED.<br/> 1.2   Prevalence of erectile dysfunction in women<br/>Erectile dysfunction which is known as female erectile dysfunction in women occurs in about 43% of American women (NIH Consensus Conference, 1993). And this medical condition is a persistent or recurrent inability to attain or maintain clitoral erection until completion of the sexual activity, an adequate lubrication-swelling response that is normally present during female sexual arousal and sexual activity is therefore, absent. The individual having the condition is said to experience frigidity (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Again, according to Otubu et al., in 1989, about 8.7% of women suffer from this very condition in the United States while between 35.3-40%, according to Adegunloye in 2002 and Eze in 1994, of women in Nigeria suffer from this condition. Spector and Carey in 1994 reported 5-10% in the United States.<br/>In addition, female erectile dysfunction occurs at any age but majorly in old age. Hence, the most significant age related change is menopause (Karen, 2000) and (Rod et al., 2008). However, erectile dysfunction may be caused by diabetes, atherosclerosis, hormonal imbalances, neurological problems etc. (organic causes) or stress, depression etc.<br/>        Besides treating the underlying causes (organic or psychological), the first line treatment of ED consists of a trial of PDE5 inhibitor (the first of which was sildenafil or Viagra). In some cases, treatments can involve prostaglandin tablets in the urethra, intracarvenous injection with a fine needle into the penis or clitoris  that cause swelling, a penis or clitoris prosthesis, a penis or clitoris pump or vascular surgery, estrogen replacement therapy for the women etc (Kendric et al., 2005).<br/>         Although there are various methods and techniques that are used to treat this very condition, however, for the purpose of this project, the treatment is restricted to yohimbine, an extract from Pausinystalia yohimbe.<br/>  <br/><br/>\n\nTHE PHYTOCHEMICAL AND PROXIMATE ANALYSIS OF BURANTASHI STEM ON ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PHYTOCHEMICAL AND PROXIMATE ANALYSIS OF BURANTASHI STEM ON ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION", "id": 43}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PHYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS AND THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITIES OF DICHLOROMETHANE FRACTION OF METHHANOL EXTRACT OF CRATEVA ADANSONII<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Inflammation is a complex biological response of vascular tissue to harmful stimuli such as pathogen, damage cells or irritants (Ryan &amp; Majno, 1983).

It is also an essential reaction of the body to infection. Too little of an inflammatory response, and the body is unable to repel microbial invasions or heal injuries. Too much of an inflammatory response, and the immune system begins attacking the eventually leading to chronic disease (Sears, 2000).<br/>Anti-Inflammatory refers to the property of a substance or treatment that reduces inflammation. There are obvious clinical markers of inflammation which include pain, redness, fever, swelling and loss of function (Pai et al. 2004). However if inflammation is allowed to continue unchecked it may results in neurodegenerative disease or cancer (Pai et al. 2004). A variety of safe and effective anti-inflammatory agents are available including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids.<br/>  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID are usually indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic inflammation. NSAIDS work by reducing the production of prostaglandins (Bayness &amp; Marek, 2005). Prostaglandins are chemicals that promote inflammation, pain and fever. The enzymes that produce prostaglandins are phospholipaseA2, PGH2synthase and Cyclooxygenase (Cox). There are two types of COX enzymes, cyclooxygenase-1 (Cox-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2). NSAIDS reduce the production of prostaglandin by inhibiting COX enzymes resultant effect is that, therefore, inflammation, pain and fever are reduced.

The leaves are applied externally to relieve pain in joint, the fresh juice of leaves is used for the relief of ear-ache, eye infection and anodyne in toothache. Powder of bark is used in rheumatism, itch, epilepsy and asthma (Sivarajan &amp; Balachandran, 1994).<br/> 1.2 Crateva adansonii as a plant.<br/>The flowering tree Crateva adansonii is called the sacred garlic pear and temple plant. The tree is sometimes called the spider tree because the showy flowers bear long, spidery stamens. It is native to Japan, Australia, much of south East Asia and several south pacific Islands. It grows in forest and savanna woodland, often on river-banks from Senegal to N Nigeria, and across Africa to Zaire, Tanganyika and Madagascar. The plants common name is amakarode in Igbo, In Yoruba, it is egun-orun and in Hausa, it is ungududu. The tree attains approximately 15m height. The trunk is irregular, seldom straight, but is worthy of cultivation as an ornamental for its dense masses of white flowers borne at the ends of all the shoots. In the bush, owing to grass burning which it survives and repeated stripping of its leaves, the tree is often stunted. The wood is soft and yellow and strong-smelling when cut. The leaves are however eaten in soups or mixed with cereals. They are boiled and added to mixture called containing a paste of locust beans, Parkia Spp. (Leguminosae Mimisoideae). The Yoruba consumes the leaves as a potherb.<br/>In upper volt they are the ingredient of sauces. To some people the leaves are taken only in time of dearth and they are sold in northern markets. The bark is widely used for stomach-troubles in Nigeria. In Jebel Marra a bark-paste is used as a poultice on swellings.<br/>Crateva adansonii is a decidious plant with three-palmate leaves.

It is cultivated in more than 100 countries. ( Woolfe, 1992). Nigeria is the third largest producer in the world with china leading, followed by Uganda. Sweet potato ranks seventh among the world food crops, third in value of production and fifth in caloric contribution to human diet (Bouwkamp, 1985). Sweet potatoes are rich in dietary fibre, minerals, vitamins and anti oxidants such as phenolic acids, anthocyanins, tocopherol and ß- carotene. Besides acting as anti oxidants, carotenoids and phenolic compounds also provide sweet potatoes with their distinctive flesh colours ( cream, deep yellow, orange and purple). Sweet potato blends with rice, cowpea and plantain in nigerian diets. It is also becoming popular as a substitute to yam and garri. It can be reconstituted into fofoo or blended with other carbohydrate flour sources such as wheat ( Triticum aestivum) and cassava ( Manihot esculenta) for baking bread, biscuits and other confectioneries (Woolfe, 1992).<br/> The leaves are rich in protein and the orange flesh varieties contain high beta carotene and are very important in combating vitamin A deficiency especially in children.<br/>Sorghum (sorghum bicolor (S. bicolor) is a tropical plant belonging to the family of poaceae, is one of the most important crops in Africa, Asia and Latin America. More than 35% of sorghum is grown directly for human consumption. The rest is used primarily for animal feed, alcohol production and industrial products ( FAO, 1995). The current annual production of 60 million tons is increasing due to the introduction of improved varieties and breeding conditions. Several improved sorghum varieties adapted to semi-arid tropic environments are released every year by sorghum breeders. Selection of varieties meeting specific local food and industrial requirements from this great biodiversity is of high importance for food security. In developing countries in general and particularly in West Africa demand for sorghum is increasing. This is due to not only the growing population but also to the countries policy to enhance its processing and industrial utilization.<br/> More than 7000 sorghum varieties have been identified, therefore there is a need of their further characterization to the molecular level with respect to food quality. The acquisition of good quality grain is fundamental to produce acceptable food products from sorghum. Sorghum while playing a crucial role in food security in Africa, it is also a source of income of household . In West Africa, ungerminated sorghum grains are generally used for the preparation of \"to\", porridge and couscous. Malted sorghum is used in the process of local beer \"dolo\" (reddish, cloudy or opaque), infant porridge and non fermented beverages. Sorghum grains like all cereals are comprised primarily of starch.<br/>The aim and objective of this work is to obtain diet low in sugars, with enriched nutrients intended for diabetics.<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>2.1.            ORIGIN AND DISTRIBUTION OF SWEET POTATO <br/>Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) is a member of the convolvulaceae family (purseglove, 1972). Approximately 900 different species of convolvulaceae in 400 genera have been identified around the world. Yen, (1974) and Austin (1978,1988) recognized 11 species in the batatas, which includes sweet potato. The closest relatives of the sweet potato appears to be ipomoea trifida that is found wild in maxico, and ipomoeto tabascana. Sweet potato has a chromosomes number for the genus ipomoea is 15, sweet potato is considered to be a hexaploid. Most sweet potato cultivars are self-incompatible, which means that when self pollinated, the cannot produce viable seed. It is accepted that cultivated sweet potato originated in central America or tropical south America. Sweet potatoes are cultivated where ever there is enough water to support their growth: optimal annual rainfall for growth range between 750-2000mm. sweet potato is a warm season annual, requiring 20-25°C average temperatures and full sunlight for optimal development. Sweet potato thrives in well drained loamy soils with high humus content that provides warm and moist environment to the roots.<br/> 2.1.1.  DESCRIPTION OF SWEET POTATO A. THE ROOT SYSTEM <br/> When sweet potato is planted from stem cuttings, adventitious roots arise from the cutting in a day or two. These roots grow rapidly and form the root system of the plant. Research has shown the roots of sweet potato can penetrate the soil to a depth of over 2m, the exact depth attained being dependent on the soil condition (Onwueme, 1978 and Kays, 1985). Based on its origin, the root system of sweet potato is divided into the adventitious roots arising from subterranean nodes of a vine cutting and lateral roots arising from existing roots. Kays (1985) subdivided the adventitious roots into storage, fibrous and pencil roots. The lateral roots are subdivided into primary, secondary and tertiary roots.<br/>During the early ontogeny of young adventitious roots emerging from the stem,     they   are   often   separated   into   (Togari, 1950). According to Wilson (1982) and Kays (1985), thin roots are typically tetrarch in the arrangement of their primary vascular tissue, i.e. four xylem and phloem poles found within the vascular cylinder. The most important functional differences between these root types are their capacity for storage root initiation in a specific region of the thick roots. Several factors such as exposure of potential storage roots to long photoperiod (Bonsi et al, 1992), water logged soil conditions (Kays, 1985), high levels of nitrogen supply (Chua &amp; Kays, 1981), gibberellic acid application (McDavid<br/>&amp;    Alamu, 1980), as well as exposing the plant to long days (McDavid &amp; Alamu, 1980; Du Plooy, 1989) encourage lignification and inhibit storage root development. Alternatively high potassium supply (Isuno, 1971, Hahn<br/>&amp;   Hozyo, 1984), the absence of light (Wilson, 1982), as well as well aerated soil conditions, low temperature and short days been demonstrated to encourage storage root formation (Du Plooy, 1989).<br/> a. Storage Roots<br/> Storage roots arise from pentarch or hexarch thick young roots if the cells between the protoxylem point and the central metaxylem cell do not become lignified, or if only a slight proportion of these cells are lignified (Togari, 1950). The increase in storage root size is attributed to the activity of the vascular cambium as well as the activity of the anomalous cambia (Wilson, 1982). The initial sign of storage root formation is the accumulation of photosynthetic consisting predominantly of starch (Chua &amp; Kays, 1982). Storage root initiation is reported to occur between the periods of 35 to 60 days after planting (Agata, 1982, Wilson 1982). But the work of Du Plooy (1989) indicated that storage root initiation might occur as early as 7 days after planting. These conflicting results suggest the need for further research on the storage root formation in sweet potato.<br/>Agata (1982) reported that storage root formation started about 30 to 35 days after planting and the roots dry weight increased linearly until harvest.<br/> b. Pencil Roots<br/> Pencil roots are generally between 5 and 15mm in diameter, they are the least well defined of the adventitious root emerging from the subterranean node of the culting. They develop mainly from young thick adventitious roots under conditions not conducive for the development of storage roots. In pencil roots lignification is not total, but result in uniform thickening of the entire root.<br/> c. Fibrous Roots<br/> According to Chua and Kays (1981), fibrous roots develop mainly from tetrarch, thin adventitious roots. The fibrous roots are generally less than 5mm in diameter and are branched with lateral roots forming a dense network throughout the root zone constituting the water and nutrient absorbing system of the plants. Fibrous roots have heavily lignified steels and very low levels of vascular cambial activity. High nitrogen and low oxygen within the root zone favors their formation (Chua &amp; Kays, 1981).<br/>d. Lateral roots<br/> The lateral roots of sweet potato emerge from existing roots adventitious roots (storage, pencil and fibrous) have a profusion of lateral roots at varying<br/>  densities along their axis. The primary lateral roots emerge from adventitious roots. Lateral emerging from the primary laterals are called secondary lateral and those emerging from the secondary laterals are named tertiary laterals (Kays, 1985).<br/> B. ABOVE GROUND PLANT ORGANS<br/> a. Vines<br/> Sweets potato has long thin stems that trail along the soil surface and can produce roots at the nodes. Sweet potato genotypes are classified as either erect, bushy, intermediate, or spreading, based on the length of their vines (Yen, 1974, Kays, 1985). Stem length varies with cultivar, and highly variable, ranging from a few centimeters up to 10cm in length. Planting density has pronounced effect on the internode length as well as on vine length (Somda &amp; Kays, 1990a). The stem is circular or slightly angular. Stem color is predominantly green, but purplish pigmentation is often present.<br/> Branching is cultivar dependent (Yen, 1974) and branches vary in number and length. Normally, sweet potato produces three types of branches, primary, secondary and tertiary, at different periods of growth.

Each part of the neem plant (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) reportedly has various medicinal properties and has been in use in many continents for centuries. In this project work, water extract from Neem leaves (Azadirachta indica A Juss) with the modern atomic absorption spectrophotometer was presented. The mineral and chemical properties in the water extract of Neem leaf were studied. Results showed that the neem leaf contains some essential minerals needed by the biochemical system. It is obvious that the water extract of Azadirachta indica is significantly high in sodium ion (Na+) and potassium ion (K+) concentrations which are responsible in the conduction of impulses along the axons of the central nervous system. Iron is another element determined. This element is significantly low in the water extract of the sample used (neem leaf). <br/>   CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0       INTRODUCTION<br/>Neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) is one of the very few trees known in the Indian subcontinent (Puri, 1999). This tree belonged to Meliceae family, and grows rapidly in the tropic and semi-tropic climate. It is also observed that this tree could survive in very dry and arid conditions. (Puri, 1999). The Neem Tree is an incredible plant that has been declared the Tree of the 21st century by the United Nations (Puri, 1999). In India, it is variously known as ‘Divine Tree’, ‘Life giving tree’, ‘Nature’s Drugstore’, ‘Village Pharmacy’ and ‘Panacea for all diseases’. It is one of the major components in Ayurvedic medicine, which has been practiced in India since many centuries.<br/>Extracts from the Neem tree (Azadirachta indica A Juss) also called ‘Dogonyaro’ in Nigeria are most consistently recommended in ancient medical texts for gastrointestinal upsets, diarrhoea and intestinal infections, skin ulcers and malaria (Schmutterer, 1995).  All parts of Neem plant such as leaves, bark, flower, fruit, seed and root have advantages in medical treatment and industrial products. Its leaves can be used as drug for diabetes, eczema and reduce fever. Barks of Neem can be used to make toothbrush and the roots has an ability to heal diseases and against insects. (Puri, 1999). The seed of Neem tree has a high concentration of oil. Neem oil is widely used as insecticides, lubricant, drugs for variety of diseases such as diabetes and tuberculosis (Puri, 1999; Ragasa et al., 1996).<br/>India encouraged scientific investigations on neem tree as part of his program to revitalise India tradition and also increase commercial interest on neem (Stix, 1992) and presently some authors believe that no other plant or tree in the world has been so extensively researched or used in all possible capacities so far. In Africa, extracts from neem leaves have provided various medicinal preparations (Ekanem, 1971; Udeinya, 1993). Neem plant (Azadirachta indica) has been of great benefit in human health due to its biochemical, pharmacological, and medicinal properties.<br/>1.1       AIM OF PROJECT<br/>Many researches have been carried out on neem plant (Azadirachta indica) and results have shown that it has both medicinal and pharmacological properties. However, there are no documented information relating the mineral properties inherent in the leaf of the plant. Consequently, this work was aimed at determining some minerals present in the water extract of neem leaf using the modern atomic absorption spectrophotometric analysis.<br/> CHAPTER TWO<br/>LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>2.1       HISTORY OF NEEM TREE<br/>Neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) is thought to have originated in Assam in northeast India, and Myanmar, where it is common throughout the central dry zone. Later it became naturally distributed throughout much of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in drier areas. Neem name was derived from the Sanskrit Nimba, and it was known as the curer of all illness. The neem tree was intimately connected with the everyday life of Indians.<br/>The neem tree has been used for more than 4,500 years in the Indian sub- continent. The Indian physicians charaka (2nd century AD) and susruta (4th century AD), whose books provided the foundation of the Indian system of natural treatment, the Ayurveda, also mention the tree and its medical use. In Ayurveda the neem tree was called the ‘Sarva Roga Nivarini’ (one that could cure all ailments and ills). At the beginning of this century the neem tree was still highly estimed by Indian emigrants and they took it along to the places where they settled. Thus, the neem tree was introduced in places like Australia, East and sub- Sahelian Africa, South East Asia, and South America. Pioneering work in the possible commercial use of Neem oil and cake had been done by the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore as early as the 1920s.<br/>Pioneering work in the possible commercial use of Neem oil and cake had been done by the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore as early as the 1920s. In the last two decades research on neem has been intensified and many of the trees agricultural and medical properties were rediscovered. Today, Neem plays a major role in the rural industry of India and projects for the commercial use of Neem have been successfully introduced in other countries. The green pinnate leaves of neem have a very bitter taste and garlic- like smell.<br/>2.2 SCIENTIFIC CLASSIFICATION<br/>Kingdom:        Plantae<br/>Division:          Magnoliophyta<br/>Order:  Sapindales<br/>Family:            Meliceae<br/>Genus: Azadirachta<br/>Species:           A. indica<br/>Binomial name: Azadirachta indica<br/>2.3 DESCRIPTION OF THE NEEM TREE.<br/>The neem tree (Azadirachta indica), is a tropical evergreen with a wide adaptability, native to India and Burma, it has been transplanted to Africa, the Middle East, South America and Australia. It is especially suited to semi-arid conditions and thrives even in the poorest soil with rainfalls as little as 18 inches (450 mm) per year and temperatures up to 50° C (120° F). Neem can grow into a big tree to a height of about 20 to 35 m. Its canopy of leaves makes it a useful shade tree. It is planted along roads and avenues in the towns and villages of India The lifespan of the Neem tree is described to be anywhere between 150 to 300 years. Its blossoms are small, white flowers with a very sweet, jasmine-like scent. Its edible fruit is about 3/4 of an inch (2 cm) long, with white kernels. A neem tree generally begins bearing fruits at three to five years of age, and can produce up to 50 kg of fruit annually when mature. The pinnate leaves have a very bitter taste and a garlic-like smell Trunk: The trunk is relatively short, straight and may reach a diameter of 1.2 m (about 4 feet). It is classified as a bush.<br/>Leaves: The opposite pinnate leaves are 20-40 cm (8 to 16 inch) long, with 20 to 31 medium to dark green leaflets about 3-8 cm (1 to 3 inch) long. The petioles are short. Very young leaves are reddish to purplish in colour. The shape of mature leaflets is more or less asymmetric and their margins are dentate with the exception of the base of their basiscopal half, which is normally very strongly reduced and cuneate or wedge-shaped. (Ganguli, 2002).<br/>Flowers: The (white and fragrant) flowers are arranged axillary, normally in more-or-less drooping panicles which are up to 25 cm (10 in.) long. The inflorescences, which branch up to the third degree, bear from 150 to 250 flowers. An individual flower is 5-6 mm long and 8-11 mm wide. Protandrous, bisexual flowers and male flowers exist on the same individual. Flowers are used to make a curry called ugadi pachadi.<br/>Fruit: The fruit is a smooth (glabrous) olive-like drupe which varies in shape from elongate oval to nearly roundish. The fruit skin (exocarp) is thin and the bitter-sweet pulp (mesocarp) is yellowish-white and very fibrous. The mesocarp is 0.3-0.5 cm thick. The white, hard inner shell (endocarp) of the fruit encloses one, rarely two or three, elongated seeds (kernels) having a brown seed coat (Ganguli, 2002). Seeds usually fall to the ground and might stay there or be carried away with rain water. Occasionally they are dispersed away from the parent tree by birds which give them a greater chance of growing into a healthy new plant. Neem oil is obtained from the seeds.<br/>2.4 NEEM OIL<br/>Neem oil is a vegetable oil pressed from the fruits and seeds of neem plant (Azadirachta indica). Neem oil is generally light to dark brown, bitter and has a rather strong odour that is said to combine the odours of peanut and garlic. It comprises mainly triglycerides and large amounts of triterpenoid compounds, which are responsible for the bitter taste. It is hydrophobic in nature and in order to emulsify it in water for application purposes, it must be formulated with appropriate surfactants (Rajeev Seenappa, 2009).<br/>Neem oil also contains steroids (campesterol, beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol) and a plethora of triterpenoids of which azadirachtin is the most well-known and studied. The azadirachtin content of neem oil varies from 300ppm to over 2500ppm depending on the extraction technoloy and quality of the neem seeds crushed (Puri,1999).<br/> Methods of extraction of neem oil<br/>There are several methods to obtain Neem oil from the seeds like mechanical pressing, supercritical fluid extraction, and solvent extraction (Puri, 1999). Mechanical extraction is the most widely used method to extract neem oil from Neem seed. However, the oil produced with this method usually has a low price, since it turbid and contains a significant amount of water and metals contents. Extraction using supercritical fluid, the oil produced has very high purity; however the operating and investment cost is high. Extraction using solvent has several advantages. It gives higher yield and less turbid oil than mechanical extraction, and relative low operating cost compared with supercritical fluid extraction. The oil can also be obtained through pressing (crushing) of the seed kernel both through cold pressing and through a process incorporating temperature controls. A large industry in India extracts the oil remaining in the seed cake using hexane. This solvent-extracted oil is of a lower quality as compared to the cold pressed oil and is mostly used for soap manufacturing. Neem cake is a by-product obtained in the solvent extraction process for neem oil. (Puri, 1999).<br/> 2.5 NEEM GUM<br/>Neem Gum is a clear, bright and brown-coloured gum obtained from the trunk of neem. This is as a result of certain metabolic mechanism of plants and trees. The gum is a multipurpose by product either water soluble or absorbs water to form a viscous solution.<br/>2.6 NEEM HONEY<br/>In India, neem trees are a major source of honey bee forage. Honey obtained from the Neem tree has more medicinal properties. Neem honey is composed primarily of water, fructose and glucose (22.88%), sucrose (7.46%), ash (0.06%), free acid (20.8 meg/kg). The honey is light amber in colour and its viscosity is low. The taste is good although slightly bitter.  Neem honey improves eye sight and is harmless for diabetic patients. It is also used to treat eye disorder by applying as netranjan (eye-liner). It is very beneficial in care of burning sensation of the body. Since Neem is believed to be a great blood purifier and good for the eyes, Neem honey is highly valued.<br/>2.7 CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS IN NEEM.<br/>The late Pakistani scientist Salimuzzaman Siddiqui was the first scientist to bring the plant to the attention of phytopharmacologists. In 1942 while working at the Scientific and Industrial Research Laboratory at Delhi University, India, he extracted three bitter compounds from neem oil, which he named nimbin, nimbinin, and nimbidin respectively (Ganguli, 2002). The seeds contain a complex secondary metabolite azadirachtin. Several chemical compounds have been identified and scientists feel that there are many more compounds yet to be identified in neem. Other than sodium, potassium, salts, it contains chloriphyle, calcium, phosphorus, iron, thiamine, riboflasium, nicocin, vitamin C, carotene, and oxalic acid. The chemicals classified are:<br/>•        Nimbin: anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, anti-histamine, anti-fungal<br/>•        Nimbidin: anti-bacterial, anti-ulcer, analgesic, anti-arrhythmic, anti-fungal<br/>•        Ninbidol: anti-tubercular, anti-protozoan, anti-pyretic<br/>•        Gedunin: vasodilator, anti-malarial, anti-fungal<br/>•        Sodium nimbinate: diuretic, spermicide, anti-arthritic<br/>•        Quercetin: anti-protozoal<br/>•        Salannin: insect repellent<br/>•        Azadirachtin: insect repellent, anti-feedant, anti-hormonal<br/>Other chemicals that form its therapeutic value are:<br/>•        Limonoids<br/>•        Terpenoids and steroids<br/>•        Tetranortarpenoids<br/>•        Fatty acid derivatives like margosinone and margosinolone<br/>•        Coumarins like scopoletin, dihydrosocoumarins<br/>•        Hydrocarbons like docosane, pentacosane, hetacosane, octacosane etc.<br/>•        Sulphur compounds<br/>•        Phenolics<br/>•        Flavonoglycosides<br/>•        Tannins<br/>The highest concentrations of the active ingredients are found in the seed and oil, however the active ingredients are also found in lesser amounts in the bark and the leaves.<br/>2.8 MEDICINAL PROPERTIES OF NEEM.<br/>For thousands of years the beneficial properties of Neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) have been recognized in the Indian tradition. Each part of the neem tree has some medicinal properties (Biswas et al., 2002).<br/>Traditionally Neem was used in Ayurveda for a number of conditions. It is one of the main ingredients in every blood purification formula used in Ayurveda and it appears in most diabetic formulas as well. It is also used for arthritis, rheumatism, the removal of external and internal parasites, including malaria and fevers and as an insect repellent.<br/>Leaf: Leprosy, skin problems, skin ulcers, intestine worms, anorexia, eye problems, epistaxis, biliousness<br/>Bark: Analgesic, curative of fever<br/>Flower: Elimination of intestine worms, phlegm, bile suppression,<br/>Fruit: Diabetes, eye problem, piles, intestine worms, urinary disorder, wounds, leprosy, epistaxis<br/>Twig: Asthma, cough, piles, intestine worms, obstinate urinary disorder, phantom tumor, spermatorrhoea<br/>Gum: Scabies, wounds, ulcer, skin diseases<br/>Seed: Intestine worms and leprosy<br/>Oil: Intestine worms, skin diseases and leprosy<br/>Root: Refrigerant, diuretics<br/>(Sri, 2009).<br/>2.9 MODERN RESEARCHES ON THE EFFECTS OF NEEM.<br/>Neem leaf extract has been prescribed for oral use for the treatment of malaria by Indian Ayurvedic practitioners from time immemorial. Recently, a clinical trial has been carried out to see the efficacy of neem extract to control hyperlipidemia in a group of malarial patients severely infected with P. falciparum. The lipid level, especially cholesterol, was found to be lower during therapy when compared to non-malaria patients. Reports are available regarding the use of neem to treat patients suffering from various forms of cancer. One patient with parotid tumour and another with epidermoid carcinoma have responded successfully when treated with neem seed oi1 Neem leaf aqueous extract effectively suppresses oral squamous cell carcinoma induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a] anthracene (DMBA), as revealed by reduced incidence of neoplasm. Neem may exert its chemopreventive effect in the oral mucosa by modulation of glutathione and its metabolizing enzymes.<br/>NIM- 76, a refined product from neem oil, was studied in 10 human volunteers, where intra-vaginal application before sexual intercourse could prevent pregnancy with no adverse effect on vagina, cervix and uterus. The data suggested that intrauterine treatment is safe (Kausik, 2002).<br/>2.9.1 NEEMS EFFECT AGAINST MICROORGANISMS.<br/>There have been a number of clinical studies showing that Neem has significant effects on several bacterial strains. Among some of the more prominent strains studied were staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, cornebacterium, E. coli, and Salmonella typhosa.  These bacteria’s can cause meningitis, cystitis, sore throats, typhoid, blood poisoning, and food poisoning. Neem's ability to exert significant effects over the above mentioned bacterial strains indicates its ability to resolve the aforementioned conditions.<br/>There are certain compounds in Neem that demonstrate a unique ability to surround viruses, which prevents them from causing infection. Neem also inhibits viral multiplication by interacting with the surface of the cells to prevent the cell from becoming infected by the virus. Neem has been observed to be effective against a number of viral pathogens in various clinical studies demonstrating it contains unique properties to inhibit viral disease. Neem is one of just a few known antiviral agents. Chickenpox, shingles, herpes, and hepatitis are viral conditions, which have been successfully treated, in clinical studies by Neem’s therapeutic compounds. The uncomfortable symptoms of colds and flu’s can be relieved during seasonal changes by the regular consumption of Neem Leaf capsules, extract, or tea.<br/>India's tropical climate especially in the coastal regions creates the kind of humid hot house atmosphere that funguses thrive in. Traditionally, in Ayurveda, Neem seed oil, aqueous extracts of Neem leaf, Neem leaf powder, the smoke from burning dried Neem leaves, and Neem leaf pastes have been used for the prevention and treatment of fungal conditions in India. Athlete's foot, ringworm, and Candida, which causes vaginal yeast infections and thrush, are some of the more common fungi that attack humans. There are two medicinal compounds in the Neem leaf, gedunin and nimbidol, which have been clinically proven to control these fungi. Jock itch, other fungi that attacks humans, has been treated traditionally in India for thousands of years with Neem seed oil and aqueous extracts of Neem leaf. A clinical study found that smoke from burning dried Neem leaves exerted an extreme suppression of fungal growth and germination.<br/>Also Ayurveda has recommended the use of Neem to rid the body of all forms of parasites. Simple aqueous extracts of Neem leaves have been the standard treatment for external parasitic infestation without any side effects throughout India. Neem’s effectiveness against parasites is due to compounds that mimic hormones. This activity interrupts the life cycle of parasites by inhibiting the ability of the parasites to feed, and preventing parasite eggs from hatching. Neem has demonstrated these effects against lice, and against itch mites which cause scabies. Neem has both curative and preventative effects on the Malaria parasite the methods for accomplishing this are as varied as the active ingredients in Neem. There are two compounds in Neem, which are clinically proven to be as effective against the malarial parasite as both quinine and chloroquine; they are gedunin, a limonoid and quercetin, a flavonoid. There is still another study, which shows that Neem leaf extracts prevent the normal development of the malarial plasmodia by increasing the state of oxidation in the red blood cells.<br/>2.9.2 NEEM'S EFFECT AGAINST AILMENTS<br/>Studies have shown that neem has effects against certain diseases like eczema, acne, and some skin problems like dry Skin, wrinkles, dandruff, itchy Scalp, skin ulcers and warts are other conditions that can be effectively resolved by the use of soaps, lotions, and creams, containing neem leaf extracts and oil.<br/>In the case of eczema clinical studies demonstrate that even the application of weaker Neem leaf extracts effectively cured acute conditions of eczema. Using a Soap or shampoo containing Neem oil can easily relieve the itching and redness of eczema.  Neem effectively kills the bacteria that cause Acne and studies prove that Neem will reduce inflammation, even the inflammation produced by Acne (Uday Bandyopadhyay, 2002).<br/>Throughout India village people use Neem twigs and leaves to brush their teeth, and keep their gums free of disease and infection even though they have limited access to modern dental care. The ancient Ayurvedic practice of using Neem to heal and rejuvenate gum tissue and to prevent cavities and gum disease is verified in modern clinical studies.<br/>According to the ancient healing system of Ayurveda the bark of the Neem tree will strengthen an individual’s resistance to disease. Modern clinical studies have identified a number of compounds in the Neem tree that effectively regulate immune system functions. There are immunomodulatory polysaccharide compounds, especially present in Neem bark, that apparently increase antibody production. (Mukherjee, 1996)<br/>2.9.3 TOXICITY OF NEEM<br/>Neem oil is nonmutagenic in the Ames mutagenicity assay. Neem oil has traditionally been considered to be a relatively safe product in adults. The LD50 of neem oil is 14 ml/kg in rats and 24 ml/kg in rabbits. In rats, a dose of up to 80 ml/kg caused stupor, respiratory distress, depression of activity, diarrhea, convulsions and death. Gross examination of all organs except the lungs was normal after acute dosing.<br/>The seeds of neem, which are poisonous in large doses, resemble the more toxic drupes of M. Azadarach and are sometimes confused. Severe poisoning in 13 infants who had received 5 ml to 30 ml doses of margosa (neem) oil has been reported. Toxicity was characterized by metabolic acidosis, drowsiness, seizures, loss of consciousness, coma and death in two infants. These infants exhibited Reye's syndrome-like symptoms, with death from hepatoencephalopathy. Neem oil administered to mice can induce mitochrondrial injury, resulting in similar hepatic damage. The toxin has not been identified, but may be a long-chain monounsaturated free acid, to which infants and small children are particularly vulnera.<br/>2.9.4 NEEM AS A VEGETABLE<br/>The tender shoots and flowers of the neem tree are eaten as a vegetable in India. Neem flowers are very popular for their use in Ugadi Pachhadi (soup-like pickle), which is made on Ugadi day in the South Indian States of Andhra Pradesh, Tamilnadu and Karnataka. A soup like dish called Veppampoo Rasam (Tamil) translated as ‘neem flower rasam’ made of the flower of neem is prepared in Tamil Nadu. Neem is also used in parts of mainland Southeast Asia, particularly in Cambodia, Laos (where it is called kadao), Thailand (where it is known as sadao or sdao), Myanmar (where it is known as tamar) and Vietnam (where it is known as sau dau and is used to cook the salad: goi sau dau). Even lightly cooked, the flavour is quite bitter and thus the food is not enjoyed by all inhabitants of these nations, though it is believed to be good for one's health. Neem Gum is a rich source of protein. In Myanmar, young neem leaves and flower buds are boiled with tamarind fruit to soften its bitterness and eaten as a vegetable. Pickled neem leaves are also eaten with tomato and fish paste sauce in Myanmar.<br/><br/>\n\nTRACE ELEMENTS CONTENT OF NEEM LEAVES (AZADIRACHTA INDICA)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " TRACE ELEMENTS CONTENT OF NEEM LEAVES (AZADIRACHTA INDICA)", "id": 46}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b> ANTILIPIDEMIC EFFECT OF WATER (H20) EXTRACT OF DESMODIUM VELUTINUM LEAVES ON ALBINO WISTAR RATS <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/> This study evaluated the antilipidemic activity of water extracts from leaves of Desmodium velutinum on albino wistar rats. The phytochemical analysis of the leaf extract showed the presence of tannins, saponins, alkaloids, soluble carbohydrates, flavonoids, reducing sugar, steroids, cyanide and terpenoids. The animals were treated with known drugs (atorvastatin 2ml). There were significantly reductions in HDL 13.00 1.41 mg/dl LDL 1.20 0.14 mg/dl and triglyceride 39.00 0.14 mg/dl, compared with water extract of Desmodium velutinum (0.5ml). when administered was found to significantly reduce lipid plasma which was LDL 1.90 0.00mg/dl, triglyceride 50.00 0.00mg/dl and increase HDL 25.00 0.00 mg/dl which is the good cholesterol. The water extract of Desmodium velutinum leaf can possibly normalize the plasma lipid when compared with the group given atorvastatin. The phytochemicals analysis showed that the association between these complexes and compounds and other constituent play an important role in the biological activity of the leaf. This study suggested that the water extract of D.velutinum leaf posses hypolipidemic as well as antilipidemic effect.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1            BACKGROUND OF STUDY <br/> Lipid  and  lipoprotein  abnormalities  play  a  major  role  in  the  development and progression of coronary artery diseases. Low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterols have been identified as independent coronary risk factors (Rodrigue et al., 2010). High level of blood cholesterol is responsible for circulatory system disorder. Increase level of low density lipoprotein (LDL) is alarming for cardiovascular diseases and their risk is increased many times (Harman et al., 2011).<br/>In developing countries, the occurrence of heart diseases increases rapidly (Nordestgard et al., 2010). Medical studies show that about 70% of adults over 50 years old suffer atherosclerosis. (Sherien and Azza, 2009). A large number of synthetic hypolipidemic drugs are available in market. Long term use of these drugs cause serious side effects, and are costly.<br/>A medicinal plant is any plant which in one or more of its organ, contains substance that can be used for therapeutic purpose or which is a precursor for synthesis of useful drugs (Sivakumar et al., 2007). Plant contains a large number of bioactive phytochemicals that are responsible for pharmacological action of plants and used for development of drugs. Many medicinal plants have shown their antilipidemic effect and proved their efficacy in cardiovascular diseases (Nordestgard et al., 2010; Wang, 1999).<br/>One of such plants used very often in the management of the disease by the traditional medicine practitioners of Eastern Nigeria is Desmodium velutium, a perennial plant erect or semi-erect shrub or sub-shrub up to 3m light. It is widely distributed in subtropical Asia and tropical Africa. (Amowi and Azode, 2012).<br/>Extracts of Desmodium velutium are used traditionally in some disease conditions particularly aphrodisiac and headache. Hence,<br/>Desomdium velutium may be a source of a pharmacological active agent useful in the treatment of aches, pains and diarrhoea. In Ghana, native doctors mix the root of Desmodium lasincarpum with some hot peppers and use it as enema to cure blood in urine. In Eastern States of Nigeria, the plant locally knowngwuani”(Onyegbuleas.“Ikeaetal.,2012). In these present studies, I investigated the antilipidemic activity of the water (H2O) extract of<br/>Desmodium velutinum Leaves on albino wistar rats.<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0            LITEFATURE REVIEW <br/> 2.1            DESMODIUM VELUTIMUM <br/> Desmodium velutinum is an upright woody perennial herb, sub-shrub  or shrub, up to 3m tall (Onyegbule, et al., 2012).<br/> Leaflets are light green to blue, green or darker above, paler beneath and with prominent pallid veins, roundish to elliptic to rhombic ovate, 3-9.4cm long , 2-7cm wide, entire or repaid (indented at the termination of the lateral veins) and ciliate, think, mostly soft velvety on both Surface with long stiff golden, reddish or white hairs. Inflorescence arises in left axis, and at the end of branches. They are densely flowered racemes up to 10cm or mere long; at least the terminal ones often paniculately branched. Flowers are white pink to blue, mauve or brilliant purple, usually appearing whitish or pale when dry.<br/>Common names –velvet leaf D, villous LD<br/> Hind: Jagru, Lagavang, Lippa-Pank<br/> Malayalam:   Orial, Sanskrit, Prasnipani<br/> Tamil: Akilametaki, Amcapatayilni, Ankachupati<br/> Telugu: Cliua madu, chimanduri<br/> India:Chilkiboota<br/> India: Lalkan while local name: Ikeagwuani (Igbos)<br/> Botanical Name: Desmodium velutinum<br/> Family: Fabaceae (Pea family)<br/>Order: Fabales Class: Magnoliopsida, Division: Magnoliophyta, Genus:<br/> Desmodium (Garg, 2006)<br/>Other species of Desmodium include Desmodium lasiocarpum, Desmodium gangeticm, Desmodium repandum, Desmodium styracitolium, Desmodium diffusum, Desmodium heterophyllum, Desmodium triflorum, etc.<br/>Desmodium velutinum can adapt to a wide range of soil PH, from very acid (pH 4.0) to alkaline. It also prefers more humidity climates of &gt;1000&gt;3000mm rainfall 1 year, tolerates up to 5 months dry season. It grows at altitudes from 0.1-500m with average temperature above 200C and has some shade tolerances as it grows in forest verges in New Guinea.<br/>2.1.1  BIOLOGICAL  AND  MEDICINAL  USE  OF  DESMODIUM<br/> VELUTINUM<br/> The water extract of Desmodium velutinum is use as an aphrodisiac (a substance that increases sexual desire, example of such plants includes tumera aphrodisiac, zingibar Offieinale, Mucuna Pruriens etc).<br/>In South-East Asia, they are considered other prominent uses are the treatment of diarrhea, dysentery and stomach ache. Desmodium velutinum may be a source of pharmacological active agent useful in the treatment of aches, pains and pyretic. It is also have diuretic effects (a substance that causes an increase in the flow of urine)<br/>2.1.2 USES OF OTHER SPECIES OF DESMODIUM:<br/>Desmodium shows a wide range of medicinal uses. In Ghana, native doctors mix the roots of Desmodium lasiocarpum with some hot-peppers and use it as enema to cure blood in urine. In the Philippines, a decoction of Desmodium triflorum is used as a mouth wash and as a expectorant (a cough medicine that helps you to get rid of thick liquid from the lungs). In India, fresh leaves of Desmodium triflorum are used internally as a galactagogue (a substance that increases lactation milk supply), some of the most commonly used herbal galactagogues are fenugreek, blessed thistle, alfalfa; and in Taiwan, the whole plant is used against fever, rheumatism, Jaundice and gonorrhea. Desmodium incanum is used as a diuretic, stomachic, Febrifuge and hemostatic in Central America. Desmodium heterocarpon are primarily forages, but are also used medicinally in Malesia. The boiled roots of<br/>Desmodium heterocarpon are used in Malaysia to poultice sore breasts, and a decoction of the plant is regarded as a tonic and a bechic (a cough suppressant). In Cambodia, the stems of Desmodium heterocarpon are applied to fracture and snake bite. In Taiwan, a decoction of the root is used against rickets in children.<br/>Desmodium heterophyllum is applied in Malaysia to treat sores, earache, stomach-ache and abdominal complaints. In India, the roots are considered carminative (a herb that either prevents formation of gas in the gastrointestinal tract or facilitates the expulsion of gas, thereby combating flatulence), tonic and diuretic, the leaves are used as a galactagogue and a decoction of the whole part plant is used to treat stomach-ache and abdominal problems. Desmodium gangeticum, Desmodium sequax, Desmodium styracifolium, Desmodium repandum are use in treating wounds, ulcers, toothache, stones in the gall bladder, kidneys or bladder and other skin problems.<br/>2.2            PLANTS FOR ANTILIPIDEMIC <br/>Other plants for lowering lipoprotein level in the body.<br/>Terminalia Arjuna: Botanical name<br/>Terminalia arjuna is a big evergreen tree up to 25meters high, bark grey, smooth leaves, flower small and fruits are 2.3-2.5m long. It has great importance due to its curative properties in heart problems. Phytochemicals belonging to different classes are present in the bark of terminalia arjuna including tannins, triterpenoids, saponina, arjunic acid, arjunolic acid, arjungenin (Manna et al., 2007).<br/>Experimental studies revealed its dark shaved significant antioxidant (Vaidya et al., 2008; Shridhar and Gopal, 2009), antidiabetic (Raghavan and Kumari, 2006) antigastric ulcer (Devi et al., 2007), antimutagenic (Vaidya et al., 2008), anthelmintic, (Bachaya et al., 2009) activities.<br/>The bark is useful in cardiovascular diseases, especially in disturbed cardial rhythm angina or myocardial infraction. Clinical studies suggested that it improves the blood circulation to heart, regulate blood pressure<br/>(Nammi et al., 2003) is used for treatment of hypercholesterolemia (Jiwari et al., 1990; Ram et al., 1997; Chander et al., 2004) and inhibit the platelet aggregation (Namita et al., 2009). It protects liver and kidneys against the harmful effect of free radicals.<br/>Botanical Name- Trigonella foenum- graecum.<br/>Trigonella foenum- graecum commonly know as fenugreek (methi) is a widely cultivated aromatic herb varying in height from thirty or sixty centimeter and used both as vegetable (leaves) and spice (seeds) (Toppo et al., 2009). The seeds are known as “Maithr pickles, curry powders. The young leaves are eaten as vegetable and dried<br/>leaves (called Kasuri methi) have a bitter taste and strong characteristic smell.<br/>Experimental studies revealed that trigonella foenum seed and leaves extracts possess strong antidiabetic activity (Sharma et al., 2009; Vats et al.,<br/>2002). Fenugreek seeds contain high quantity of saponins and glactosamine, whose cholesterol lowering effect is well established (Bahram et al., 2005;Xue et al., 2007).<br/>Cardioprotective and immunomodulatory potential of this important plant is need to be explored.<br/>Botanical Name: Rheum emodi Rheum emodi is commonly known as rhubarb, revand chini. It is a perennial plant that grows from Rhizomes. Rhubarb is an important herb used in ayurvedic medicines. It is a very important hepatoprotective and showed very good results against chemically induced elevated level of AST, ALT and ALP in serum (Ibrahim et al., 2008, Akhtar et al., 2009). Antibacterial (Babu et al., 2003), antifungal (Agarwal et al., 2000), hypoglycemic (Li and Wang, 1997) nephroprotective (Alam et al., 2005), Laxative, appetite stimulant, diuretic and anthelminthic activities.<br/> Cardioprotective and immunomodulatory potential of this plant need to be explored.<br/>Other  examples  of  antilipidemic  plants  include  coriandrum  sativum, Euophorbia tirvealli, cyperus rotundus etc.<br/>2.2.1  ADVANTAGE  OF  MEDICINAL  PLANT  (ANTILIPIDEMIC PLANTS)  OVER SYNTHETIC DRUGS:<br/>Medicinal plant is any plant which in one or more of its organ, contains substance that can be used for therapeutic purpose or which is a precursor for synthesis of useful drugs. Plants contains a large number of bioactive phytochemicals that are responsible for pharmacological action of plants and used for development of known drugs or a cheap source of known drugs such as reserpine from ravwolfia species.<br/>Medicinal plants (Antilipidemic plant) are receiving extra ordinary importance and popularity as safe, efficacious and cost effective medicines with extraordinary benefits due to combination of medicinal ingredients with vitamins and minerals for antilipidemic activity. Many medicinal plants have shown their antilipidemic effects and proved their efficacy in cardiovascular diseases (Jain et al., 2007; Wang, 1999).<br/>Synthetic drugs are those drugs with properties and effects similar to a known hallucinogen or narcotic but having a slightly altered chemical structure, especially such a drug created in order to evade restrictions against illegal substance. In synthetic drugs, the efficacy is not 100% guarantee. The frequent use of some drugs has severe side effects for example, in atorvastatin (Lipitor) drug, its side effect is diarrhea, headache etc. while<br/>Desmodium velutinum is use in treating of diarrhea, headache and reduces pain etc. In synthetic drugs, the costly of the latter is increased by modern health technology which in many cases is inappropriate or irrelevant to the immediate needs of people in developing countries.<br/>2.3       LIPIDS AND LIPOPROTEIN:<br/>Definition of Lipid:<br/><br/>\n\n ANTILIPIDEMIC EFFECT OF WATER (H20) EXTRACT OF DESMODIUM VELUTINUM LEAVES ON ALBINO WISTAR RATS <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  ANTILIPIDEMIC EFFECT OF WATER (H20) EXTRACT OF DESMODIUM VELUTINUM LEAVES ON ALBINO WISTAR RATS ", "id": 47}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CARDIO PROTECTIVE ACTIVITIES OF N-HEXANE EXTRACT OF DESMODIUM VELUTINUM STEM ON ALBINO WISTER RAT<br/>ABTRACT</b><br/>This study evaluates the cardio protactive effect of N-hexane extract of Desmodium Velutinum stem on albino wister rat.

The heart begins beating some few weeks following conception and beats throughout life (Khader, 2004). It is also the strongest muscle in the human body and functions to maintain a constant circulation of blood throughout the body, it also acts as a pump and its action is composed of a series of events known as the cardiac cycle. The heart is composes of three layers of tissue which are; the pericardium, the myocardium and the Endocardium. The heart acts as a pump which drives blood into and through the arteries, but the right and the left side of the heart functions separately from one another some of the diseases associated with the cardiovascular system includes coronary heart diseases (CHD) which is the most common of heart diseases and it occurs when the arteries supplying blood to the heart narrow or harden from the build-up of plaque (Gina, 1996.),Ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease( CeVD),peripheral vascular disease, Heart Failure etc and some of the pharmacological treatment includes Angiotesin commonly prescribes includes Benazepril, Captopril, Moexipril, Beta Blockers which includes, Acebutolol, Betaxolol,etc.<br/> The heart marker enzymes includes creatine kinasse(CK-MB)which is the enzyme used as the definitive serum marker for the diagnosis or exclusion of acute myocardial infarction (Andreas,2009).<br/>Troponin 1 Rapid test which is a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of cardiac Troponin 1(CTn1)and its complex in human serum or plasma at the level equal or higher than 1ng/ml. Myoglobin which is also designed for qualitative determination of myoglobin in human whole blood serum or plasma as an aid in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) and myoglobin is also a low molecular weight cytoplasm protein which is released into the blood stream when muscle cells are damaged and this protein is released into the blood stream more rapidly than any other myocardial marker and elevated levels can be detected as early as one (1) hour after the onset of AMI(Penttila,2002). Demodium velutinum has been suggested to have some therapeutic effect in the treatment of cardiovascular disorder and in the reducing of high cholesterol content in the body.<br/> Demodium Velutinum is one of the few shrubs species that has been identified as a well adapted to acid tropical soil and a good nutritive value(Schultze-Kraft, 2002).Every culture has relied on the variety of natural medicines found in healing plants for the therapeutic properties<br/>(Armstrong,2004).Researchers find that food and their individual constituents perform similar fashion to modern drugs and sometimes better without the dreaded side effect. The leaves and young stems are rich in crude protein and mineral elements and can provide higher levels of some nutrient (Bakker, 1994). Natural plants have been valuable sources of mineral agent with proven potential of treating infectious diseases and with lesser side effects compared to the synthetic drug agents(Guyton, 2002).Hence potentially useful drugs can often be recognized from their relative importance and uses in folk medicine. Extract of Desmodium velutinum stem are used traditionally in some diseases condition particularly headache and may be a source of a pharmacological active agent useful in the treatment of aches and pain(Anowi,2012). This work aimed at investigating any hypocholesterolemic activity in the N-hexane extract of Desmodium Velutinum stem.<br/> CHAPTER TWO<br/>LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>2.0 The Heart<br/> The human heart is the size of fist. However, it works relentlessly from before birth to death. The heart being beating by 21 to 28 days after conception and beats throughout life. It is also the strongest muscle in the human ( Anaya 1996).The average heart beats about 100,000 times over a seventy year lifetime. With each beat, the heart pumps blood through the blood vessels or arteries to all parts of the body. It beats approximately 70 to 80 times a minute; this rate can double during exercise or at time of emotion. General structure of the heart<br/> The heart is composed of the three layers of tissues<br/> The pericardium;<br/>This is the outer part that covers the heart and consist of two layers or sacs- the outer layer or fibrous pericardium is securely attached to the diaphragm, the outer coat of the great vessels and the posterior surface of the sternum and therefore maintains the heart in its position. Its fibrous nature prevents over distension of the heart. The inner layer the serous pericardium consist of two layers the outer or parietal layer lines the outer fibrous sac and the inner or visceral layer covers the heart muscle.<br/>The serous membrane secrets serous fluid into the space between the visceral and parental layers that allows smooth movement between the layers, when the heart beats. Myocardium;<br/>This is the middle layer of the heart and is compose of specialized muscle tissue called the cardiac muscle, on which the circulation of blood depends. It varies in thickness, being thickest in the left ventricle, thinner in the right ventricle and thinnest in the artrium.<br/> Endocardium<br/>The inner linging of the heart is thin, smooth, glistening membrane consisting of flattened epithelial cells which is continuous with the valves and with the lining of the blood vessels.<br/>Interior of the heart.<br/>The heart is divided into a right and left side by a muscular partition called as the septum. The two sides of the heart have no communication with each other. Each side is sub-divided into an upper and lower chamber, the upper chamber on each side is called the auricle or atrium and is the receiving chamber on each side is called the ventricle and is the discharging chamber from which the blood is driven into the arteries.<br/>Each atrium communicates with the ventricles below it on the same side of the heart through an opening, guarded by a valve called artrio-velntricular valve. The valve separating the right atrium from the right ventricle is known as the right artrio-ventricular valve (tricuspid valve) and is made up of three flaps or cusps. Similarly, the valve separating the left atrium from the left ventricle is called left artrio-ventriclar valve (mitral Valve) and is composed of two flaps of cusps.<br/> Functions of the heart<br/> The main function of heart is to maintain a constant circulation of blood throughout the body and also to act as a pump and its action is to compose of a series of events known as the cardiac cycle.<br/>Cardiovascular system of the heart<br/> The blood from the heart travels from the left side of the heart and is rich in oxygen. It travels via arteries of ever-decreasing size till it reaches the narrowest of arteries called capillaries in all the organs and parts of the body and having delivered its oxygen and nutrients and having collected waste products, blood is brought back to the right side of the heart through a system of progressively enlarging vein called circulating system or cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular system literally means cardio or heart and vascular or a system or network of blood vessels (American heart Association, 2009).<br/> 2.0.1 Cardiovascular Disorder<br/>Cardiovascular disorders (CVD);this includes dysfunctional conditions of the heart, arteries ,and veins that supply oxygen to vital life-sustaining areas<br/>of the brain, the heart itself, and other vital organs. if oxygen doesn’ the tissue or organ will die. Ischemic heart disorder is the technical term for<br/>obstruction of blood flow to the heart. In general this results because excess fat or plaque deposits are narrowing the veins that supply oxygenated blood to the heart(Matyal,2008). Excess buildup of fat or plaque is respectively term arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis.<br/>2.0.2 Diseases associated with cardiovascular system are.<br/>   Coronary Heart Diseases (CHD) is the most common form of heart disease. It occurs when the arteries supplying blood to the heart narrow or harden from the build-up of plaque. Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol and other substances founding the blood(WU,2002). This plaque build-up is known as atherosclerosis and the site of the plaque determines the type of heart disorder such as.<br/>Coronary artery disease; this is the build-up of plaque in the arteries supplying blood to the heart.<br/>Peripheral artery disease, This is the build- up of plaque in the arteries supplying blood to the arms and legs.<br/>Carotid artery diseases; This is the build-up of plaque in the arteries that supply blood to the brain.<br/>Coronary heart disease can be caused due to risk factors like high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, tobacco use, obesity, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, diabetes advancing age (Nissen, 2005).<br/> Ischemic heart disease.

Some sugar substitutes are natural and some are synthetic. Those that are not natural are in general, called artificial sweeteners. Artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes are found in a variety of food and beverages marketed as sugar free or diet including soft drinks, chewing gum, jellies, baked goods, candy, fruit juice and ice-cream and yoghurt. [Whitney 2011]<br/> People may not all like the same kind of baked treats but one thing we all agree on is that baked treats should be sweets usually, sugar is used to lend sweetness to foods but would cake taste just as good if the baker used a sugar substitutes instead of sugar? Many people prefer not to use sugar often due to health reasons and instead depend on sugar substitutes to sweeten their foods. But are sugar substitutes the same as sugar? What exactly are the differences between sugar and sugar substitutes?<br/> Sugar also known as sucrose comes from plants like sugar cane and sugar beets and is a carbohydrate. Sugar adds bulk to cakes, cookies and all kinds of treats; sugar also causes browning and caramelizing in foods when it is heated as when cookies turn golden brown in the oven sugar is a natural substance, something that our bodies can use for energy.<br/> Sugar substitutes come in three categories; artificial sweeteners, sugar alcohols and natural sweeteners. Artificialsweeteners are attractive because they add almost no calories to foods and are sometimes a part of weight loss programs. Also they donot increase blood sugar levels which mean that diabetics can use them. Many artificial sweeteners like sucralose were discovered by accident in the laboratory. In 1976, a scientist in England was studying different compounds made from sugar. The scientist asked a student to test the compounds but instead the student tested them. Another category of sugar substitutes is sugar alcohols. Sugar alcohols are not alcoholic beverages they do not contain ethanol which is found in alcoholic beverages. Sugar alcohols like sugar have calories and energy but not asmuch as sugar. Sugar alcohols like artificial sweeteners do not contribute to tooth decay and affect blood sugar levels slowly so diabetics can use them. Although sugar alcohols like xylitol, sorbitol and erythritol are manufactured products the sources are often natural.<br/> The last category of sugar substitutes is called natural substitutes. The categories include maple syrup, agave nectar and honey. These substances are absorbed by our digestive system and contain calories and nutrients that our bodies can use.

In this research sugar and sugar substitutes will be tested and the sweetness will be compare in relation to sugar.<br/>  To compare the availability and affordability of the active components in the artificial sweetener and sugar<br/>  To know the components of this artificial sweetener and what makes them taste sweet<br/> 1.2 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/> Artificial sweetener mimicking the taste of sugar will be a better alternative to people who are suffering from diabetics. Unlike sugar, artificial sweeteners generally don‟t raise blo carbohydrates.<br/> CHAPTER TWO<br/> REVIEW OF LITERATURE<br/> 2.0   TABLE SUGAR (SUCROSE): Sugar was brought to the Americas by Christopher Columbus. At the time, sugar was processed by boiling the cane juice and then harvesting the crystals left behind after the water evaporated. These crystals contained protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals. Sugar is generally extracted from plants sugar beet and sugar cane or a main ingredient in many foods and recipes available as sucrose or saccharose (household sugar), lactose (milk sugar), fructose (fruit sugar), glucose (dextrose). [Abishak, 2009]. <br/> 2.1  CLASSIFICATION OF SUGAR: <br/>   Raw sugar: It is interesting to note that raw sugar is already refined. Only sugars from evaporated cane juice can be classified as truly raw or unrefined sugars. Sugars can come from other sources as well such as beets and fruit, once the cane juice crystals are harvested; they are washed, boiled, centrifuged, filtered and dried. The purpose of this is to remove all the original plant materials (stalk, fiber etc.) to produce pure sugar.<br/> This process removes most of the fiber and nutrients that existed in the original crystals. The sugar then becomes refined and is now a food high in calories with little nutritional value.<br/>  Refined sugar: several centuries ago, refined sugars were expensive to produce and were also taxed at a higher rate. Refined sugar is derived from cane juice but is extremely processed with many of the natural enzymes, vitamins, minerals and fiber removed.<br/>  Natural sugar: natural sweeteners include; barley malt, evaporated cane juice before it is refined, fruit juice, rice, syrup honey and sugar alcohols. [Wikipedia 2013]<br/> 2.1.1 MECHANISM OF ACTION IN THE BODY<br/> Sucrose is the organic compound commonly known as table sugar and sometimes called saccharose. A white, odorless, crystalline powder with a sweet taste. The molecule is a disaccharide composed of the monosaccharide, glucose and fructose. Glucose is a carbohydrate and is the most important simple sugar in human metabolism. In living organisms the oxidation of glucose contributes to a series of complex biochemical reactions which provide the energy needed by cells. The first step in the breakdown of glucose in all cells is glycolysis, producing pyruvate which is the starting point for all other processes in cellular respiration. In cells where oxygen is present (aerobic respiration) these processes have been modeled in the TCA cycle. A major part of the use of the energy from glucose oxidation is the conversion of ADP to ATP with the energy rich molecule. ATP being subsequently used as the energy currency of the cell. [Jeremy, 2013].<br/> 2.1.2 SUGAR ALCOHOLS AND NOVEL SWEETENER<br/>  Sugar  alcohols  (polyols)  are  carbohydrates  that  occur  naturally  in<br/> certain fruits and vegetables, but they are also manufactured. They‟re not considered intense sweeteners, becaus some are less sweet than sugar.<br/> Sugar alcohols aren‟t considered non because they contain calories,.Despitetheir but t name sugar alcohols aren‟t alcoholic found in alcoholic beverages.<br/>Novel sweeteners are combinations of various types of sweeteners. Novels sweeteners such as stevia are hardtop fit into one particular category because of what they‟re made from and how the are considered novel sweeteners because of their chemical structure.<br/> Tagatose is a low carbohydrate sweetener similar to fructose that occurs naturally but is also manufactured from lactose in dairy products.<br/> [Mayo, 2012]<br/>  USES OF SUGAR ALCOHOL<br/>  Sugar alcohols generally aren‟t used they are found in many processed foods and other product including chocolate, candy, baked goods etc. usually replacing sugar on an equal basis. When added to foods sugar alcohols add sweetness, bulk and texture.<br/> They also help food stay moist, prevent browning when heated and add a cooling sensation to products. Sugar alcohols are often combined with artificial sweeteners to enhance sweetness. [Mayo,2013].<br/> 2.1.3 ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF SUGAR<br/> ADVANTAGES: Natural sugar is a direct form of glucose, which is required for the body to function. Insulin breaks down glucose or blood sugar and converts it into energy for the body to use, sugar in its natural or refined form is an easily digestible carbohydrate and a quick source of energy for the body.<br/> DISAVANTAGES: There are many health concerns over sugar. Large amounts of sugar are required to make food sweet and because sugar contains a lot of calories, the body absorbs more calories and fat into its system. Similarly regularly eating food containing natural, refined or processed sugar increases the blood sugar intake and can result in type II diabetes, where the insulin in the body is inadequate to break up the amount of sugar in the bloodstream [Mayo, 2012].<br/> 2.2 ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS<br/> Artificial sweeteners are synthetic sugar substitutes but may be derived from naturally occurring substances including herbs or sugar itself. Artificial sweeteners are also known as intense sweeteners because they are many times sweeter than regular sugar. Artificial sweeteners are chemical compositions and are not naturally in foods or naturally produced or extracted. There are a variety of artificial sweeteners available such as aspartame, saccharin, sucralose, neotame which are sold under brand names but can be identified by the chemical name on food packages. All artificial sweeteners must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration. [Whitney et al, 2011].<br/> 2.2.1 ADVANTAGES AND DISAVANTAGES<br/> ADVANTAGES: Artificial sweetener can be chemically composed to be low in calories. Natural, refined or processed sugar is generally full of calories and large amounts of sugar are required to sweeten food, artificial sweetener, however is much sweeter than sugar up to 400 times sweeter and low in calories therefore less artificial sweetener is needed to make food sweet.<br/> DISADVANTAGES:  Artificial  sweetener  is  a  chemical  compound  and there has been concern about the bo compounds to natural sugar. Artificial sweeteners despite being lower in calories also provide less energy for the body to use. There are also concerns of side effects from consumingartificial sweeteners; aspartame for example contains 50 percent phenylalanine, 40 percent aspartic acid and 10 percent methanol which are considered dangerous neurotoxins. [Mayo, 2011].<br/> 2.2.2 REASONS FOR USE<br/>  To assist in weight loss: Some people chose to limit their food energy intake by replacing high energy. Sugar or corn syrup with other sweeteners having little or no food energy. This allows them to eat the same foods they normally would, while allowing them to lose weight and avoid other problems associated with excessive calorie <br/><br/> \n\nDETERMINATION OF ACTIVE SWEET COMPONENTS OF COMMON ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS THAT ARE USED AS REPLACEMENT FOR SUGAR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DETERMINATION OF ACTIVE SWEET COMPONENTS OF COMMON ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS THAT ARE USED AS REPLACEMENT FOR SUGAR", "id": 49}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECT OF ETHANOL EXTRACT OF DESMODIUM VELUTINUM STEM ON SOME MARKER EMZYME IN LIVER OF ALBINO WISTAR RATS<br/>Abstract</b><br/>Present investigations were carried out on the effect of ethanol extract of Desmodium velutinum stem on some liver enzymes of albino wistar rats fed with high fat from cow‟s brain. Twelve healthy albin groups. Group I rats were fed with balanced diet ( mash) and tap water. Group II rats wer alone.

The rats were sacrificed at the end of the experimental (two weeks) period. The plant extract was screened for its phytochemical constituents, using standard procedures. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of tannins, flavonoids, saponins and alkaloids. The liver function tests was assessed by measuring the total bilirubin, total serum protein, direct and indirect bilirubin and liver enzymes such as Alanine amino transferase (ALT), Aspartate amino transferase (AST), Alkaline phosphate (ALP), Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) on the liver of the albino wistar rat. The serum, ALT, ALP, AST and bilirubin concentration of the albino wistar rat increased significantly (P&gt;0.05) compared to their total protein concentration. The result obtained indicate that the ethanol extract of Desmodium Velutinum stem possess hepatoprotective activity on the fatty liver of albino wistar rat fed with fat from cow‟s brain. The studied amount of phytochemicals including flavonoid, alkaloid, saponin, tannins, terpenoid which were determined quantitatively using literature methods. The significant effect of the Desmodium velutinum stem ethanol extract was compared with standard drug, atorvastatin. The result in the present study suggest that the ethanol extract of Desmodium velutinum stem can be used in treating liver diseases.<br/> TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/> CHAPTER ONE                                             <br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION                                   <br/>CHAPTER TWO                                             <br/>2.0    LITERATURE REVIEW                              <br/>2.1    TAXONOMY OF PLANT (DESMODIUM VELUTINUM)     <br/>2.2    LIVER-                                             <br/>2.3    WHAT THE LIVER DOES                              <br/>2.4    LIVER FUNCTION TEST/MARKER ENZYMES               <br/>2.5            LIVER MARKERS ENZYMES (AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, LDH)<br/> 2.6    USES OF LIVER FUNCTION TEST -                    <br/>2.7    ATORVASTATIN                                   <br/>2.8    PHYTOCHEMICALS                                   <br/>2.9    TYPES OF PHYTOCHEMICALS    -                    <br/> <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/> 3.0     MATERIALS AND METHODS       <br/> 3.1            IDENTIFICATION AND EXTRACTION OF DESMODIUM VELUTINUM<br/>      PLANTS    -                                        <br/>3.2    PHYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS                         <br/>3.3    EXPERIMENTAL ANIMAL MODEL                    <br/>3.4    COLLECTION OF BLOOD SAMPLES                    <br/> 3.5            PROCEDURES FOR CARRYING OUT LIVER FUNCTION<br/> TESTS        <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/> 4.0            QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS (PHYTOCHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF<br/> SAMPLES) -                         <br/>4.1    QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS (QUALITATIVE PHYTOCHEMISTRY)     <br/>4.2            LIVER FUNCTION TEST OF RATS FEED WITH VARIOUS SAMPLES <br/>      CHAPTER FIVE                                             <br/>5.0    DISCUSSION                                        <br/>5.2    CONCLUSION                                        <br/>     REFERENCES                                        <br/> LIST OF TABLES<br/>TABLE I       QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF ETHANOL EXTRACT OF<br/> DESMODIUM VELUTINUM STEM<br/> TABLE II   QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF ETHANOL EXTRACT<br/> DESMODIUM VELUTINUM STEM<br/> TABLE III  LIVER FUNCTION TESTS OF ALBINO WISTAR RATS FED<br/> WITH VARIOUS SAMPLES<br/>  LIST OF FIGURE<br/>FIGURE I                DESMODIUM VELUTINUM PLANT<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/> INTRODUCTION<br/> The liver is the largest and most complex internal organ in the body. It plays an important role in the maintenance of internal environment through its multiple and diverse functions. Liver is involved in several vital functions such as metabolism, secretion and storage. Hepatitis or inflammatory disorder involves inflammation and change to the hepatocytes. Hepatitis is one of the most prevalent diseases in the world. Every year 18,000 people had been reported to die due to liver cirrhosis caused by viral hepatitis (Wang et al., 2008). Ectopic fat storage occurs in obesity, particularly in the liver leading to a condition termed non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) characterized by varying degree of liver injury that progresses from steatosis to tratohepatitis, fibrosis and necrosis. Due to its prominent association with insulin resistance/obesity, NAFLD is regarded as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Liver has great capacity to detoxicate toxic substance and synthesizes useful principles. Therefore damage to liver inflicted by hepatotoxic agents is of grave consequences. Experimental studies have reported that animal fed a high fat diet (HFD) for more than two months develop weight, hyperlipidemic, hyperglycemia, oxidative stress and insulin resistance (IR). Besides, consumption of a calorie-rich diet results in lipid accumulation, excess production of inflammatory cytokines and macrophage infiltration that favours the<br/>progression of liver disease. Many medicinal plant/indigenous plant have been mentioned and well established as hepatoprotective agents.<br/>Desmodium velutinum is a medicinal plant around the world. The extract of<br/>Desmodium velutinum showed significant anti-pyretic activity on experimental rats used. Desmodium velutinum is very rich in alkaloids and related amino compounds. It is a source of flavonoid, saponins and pharmacological active agent useful in the treatment of aches and pains. It also showed that one of the uses is for erectile enhancing property. Desmodium velutinum being one of the important medicinal plant in the world may have effect on the liver. However limited studies are available on the effect of Desmodium velutinum treatment on hepatoprotective effect of its extract on high fat diet fed animal. In this regard, the present study was aimed to investigate the effect of ethanol extract of Desmodium velutinum stem on<br/>liver function tests on albino wistar rats fed with high fatrelated from to different hepatoprotective effect by comparing it to a known drug, atorvastatin<br/>treatment which is used to lower the level of cholesterol in blood. Since changes in the concentration and composition of plasma lipid and lipoproteins occur frequently in liver disease, these findings may be useful in following the clinical course of patient with liver diseases of various causes.<br/>Liver disease is associated with characteristic changes in the lipid composition of the surface coat of plasma lipoprotein particles. Cholesterol accumulate as hepatic secretion of lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase decreases, such abnormal circulating lipoproteins tend to induce corresponding changes in cell membrane lipid composition. Studies in both human and experimental liver disease confirm that this does occur and that it is wide-spread. Low density lipoproteins, which are rich in cholesterol can also be taken up by the liver or extrahepatic tissues by a receptor mediated endocytosis that specially recognizes apolipoproteins. It can be predicted that extra hepatic membrane dysfunction might be a general feature of severe liver disease. It is proposed that many of the cellular disturbances and metabolic abnormalities accompanying hepatic disease result from, or are exacerbated by lipoprotein induced changes in membrane lipid composition and function. Hence<br/>Desmodium velutinum may be a source of a pharmacological active agent useful in the treatment of high level cholesterol in the blood which has got both liver protecting and nutritional value.<br/> CHAPTER TWO<br/> 2.0            LITERATURE REVIEW <br/> The use of herbs and medicinal plants as the first medicine is a universal phenomenon. Every culture on earth, through written or oral traditions has relied on the vast variety of natural medicine found in healing plants for their therapeutic properties. All drugs of the past were substances with a particular therapeutic action extracted from plants. This, natural plants have been valuable sources of medicinal agent with proven potential of treating infectious disease and with lesser side effects compared to the synthetic drug agents. Hence potentially useful drugs can often be recognized from their relative importance and use in folk medicine. Desmodium velutinum has been reported in traditional medicine to have medicinal properties Extracts of Desmodium velutinum are used traditionally in some disease, hence may be as sources of a pharmacological active agent in the treatment of aches and pains.

Branches often dark red, yellow- brown when young, velutinuous and short hooked-hairy. Leaves 1- foliolate, rarely 3- foliolate, ovate, ovate- lanceolate, triangular-ovate, or broadly ovate, 4-20 cm long and 2.5-13cm wide, chartaceous to coriaceous, upper surface continuously oppressed-pubescent, lower surface densely velutinous. Inflorescence often dense, terminal or auxiliary racemose or paniculate, 4-20cm long, with 2-5 flowers at each node, flowers purple to pink. Pods narrowly oblong, 1-2.5 cm long, 2-3 mm wide, with dense yellow straight hairs inter mixed with short hooked hairs, 5-7 jointed. Seeds ovate, flat, 1.3-1.6mm x 1.8-2.5mm, yellow when ripe. Depending on the genotype, there are 320,000-830,000 seeds per kg. Desmodium velutinum belongs to the botanical family fabacea. It is a perennial, erect or semi-erect shrub up to 3m high. The plant is generally called<br/> “Ikeagwuani”,sareused thefor controlleaveofnon-specific diarrhoea. About 30 grams of whole leaves may be boiled in about 150-200ml of water and 20-50ml of the extract taken depending on the severity of the diarrhoea. The dose may be taken once but not more than two doses may be taken in a day. Children may take lower doses. It is also claimed that the water extract of the leaves is used as an aphrodisiac.<br/> GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE PLANT<br/> Sub-tropical Asia (China, Taiwan, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Sri-Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam) and tropical Africa.<br/> Other Species of Desmodium Include<br/> Desmodium lasiocarpum (P.

Beau.) kuntze<br/>GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT<br/> Desmodium appears to be predominantly self-pollinating. However, when flowers are touched, they spring open and release pollen which makes outcrossing possible.<br/>ECOLOGY<br/> Desmodium is mainly found humid to sub-humid regions of the tropics and subtropics, on acid soils (pH &lt;6.5). The usual habitats are open wood land and forest clearings. In equitorial regions, desmodium species are found from sea-level up to 3000m attitude. The photoperiod sensitivity varies with the specie.<br/>PROPAGATION AND PLANTING<br/> Propagation of desmodium is by seed. The degree of scarification necessary for successful germination varies between species.<br/>DISEASES AND PESTS<br/> Desmodium is affected by a range of diseases. Pathogens like the fungi synchytrium<br/> desmodii  and  phanerochaeta  salmonicolor,  causing  wart  and  pink    disease<br/> respectively, the root-knot nematodes meloidogyne arenaria, meloidogyne hapla,<br/> meloidogyne incognita and meloidogyne javanica and the stem gall nematode pterotylendius cecidogenus.<br/>USES OF DESMODIUM<br/>Desmodium shows a broad range of traditional medicinal uses. In South-East Asia they are considered diuretic. It is used in the treatment of diarrhoea, dysentery and stomach-ache, wound, ulcers and other skin problems, stones in the gall bladder, kidney, headache and toothache. In Philippines, a decotion of desmodium triflorum is use as a month wash and as an expectorant and also used internally as a galactagogue. In Taiwan, the whole part is used against fever, rheumatism, jaundice and gonorrhea. The boiled roots of desmodium heterocapon are used in Malaysia to poultice sore breast and a decotion of the plant is regarded as a tonic and a bechic. In Cambodia, the stem are applied to fractures and snaked bites. In India, the whole plant is used to treat stomach ache and abdominal problems. Desmodium contains a considerable number of species used as pasture and fodder crops, species used for ground cover and green manure, some of these have<br/>medicinal applications as well. A decotion of the roots is used against rickets in children in Taiwan.<br/>  PROPERTIES<br/>Desmodium is very rich in alkaloids and related amino compounds, biosynthetically derived from different precursors. Compounds like hyypaphorine-N, N-dimethyl tryptamine; hordenine is known to increase the urinary flow, and to be a remedy for diarrhoea and dysentery. Others are isoflavonoids, desmodin and gangetin which is isolated from the roots of Desmodium gangeticum that adversely affect the fertility and reproductive system of male rats. It reduce the vaginal sperm count and enhance pre-implantation losses. It also cause a dose dependent impairment of fertility. Aqueous root extract shows mild diurectic action, relaxant effects on intestine muscles of rats and dogs and anti-bacterial, anti fungal and anti-inflammatory activity. The alkaloid fraction of stems and leaves has shown relaxant (curariform) effects on frog rectal muscles while the methanolic extract of Nigeria Desmodium gangeticum plants has in vitro anti leishmanial activity.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF ETHANOL EXTRACT OF DESMODIUM VELUTINUM STEM ON SOME MARKER EMZYME IN LIVER OF ALBINO WISTAR RATS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF ETHANOL EXTRACT OF DESMODIUM VELUTINUM STEM ON SOME MARKER EMZYME IN LIVER OF ALBINO WISTAR RATS", "id": 50}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b> THE EFFECT OF N-HEXANE EXTRACT OF KOLA NITIDA BARK ON LIVER FUNCTION TEST<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/> Kola bark extract have been widely used in tradition medicine for thousand of year, it improves liver functions and provides protection against high fat fed metabolic rats. Present investigations were carried out on the hepatoprotective role of Kola bark extract meal treatment to high fat fed wistar rat. Healthy adult male wistar rats were divided into four groups Group I: rats were fed a standard Laboratory diet (groups match) (20g/rat/day), Group II: rats were fed a high-fat diet alone (3.6g/rat/day), Group III: rats were fed with combined mixture of 70% of high-fat diet with 30% Kola bark meal (9.8g/rat /day), Group/ V: rats were fed with high fat diet and was administered with Lipitor (Atovastatin) (10mg/rat/day) . The rats were sacrificed at the end of the experiment (two weeks) period. The high fat fed rat substantially elevated its serum and liver tissue AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin with decreased in total protein levels. Where as the levels of all parameters significantly restored towards normalization by the kola bark husk meal treatment. The results obtained suggest that the Kola bark meal have potent hepatoprotective action on high fat fed rats. A companion of the performance in both Kola bark meal and Lipitor treatment on high fat fed rat in respect of hepatoprotective role is clearly indicator that the Kola bark meal treatment was more and related to the result of Lipitor as well as to the normal level.<br/>  List of tables<br/>Table 1: Test for Cholesterol (TC)<br/> Table 2: Test for Triglyceride (TG)<br/> Table 3: Qualitative Analysis: Phytochemical Composition of samples<br/> Table 4: Qualitative Analysis: Quantitative Phytochemistry<br/> Table 5: Liver Function Test of rats fed with various samples<br/>      TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>       CHAPTER ONE     <br/>1.0 Introduction     <br/>CHAPTER TWO     <br/> 2.0  Literature review<br/>2.1       Origin of kola <br/>2.1.2 Strategies for enhancing investment opportunities in kola production-<br/>2.2 Lipid metabolism<br/> 2.2.1 Lipid and lipoproteins –definition and classification<br/> 2.2.2.

It plays an important role in the maintenance of internal environment through its multiple and diverse functions. Liver is involved in several vital functions such as metabolism, secretion and storage. Hepatitis or inflammatory disorder involves inflammation and damage to the hepatocytes. Hepatitis is one of the most prevalent diseases in the world. Every year 18,000 people had been reported to die due to liver cirrhosis caused by viral hepatitis [L] Ectopic fat storage occurs in obesity particularly in the liver leading to a condition termed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD] characterized by varying degree of liver injury that progresses from steatosis to tratohepatitis, fibrosis and necrosis Due to its prominent association with IR (insulin resistance). Obesity, NAFLD is regarded as the hepatic manifestation of metabolite [3] syndrome. Liver has great capacity to detoxicate toxic substances.<br/>Kola pod is the traditional health food around the world. Kola pod Husk meal is the residue after grinding the pod of kola and filtration, and it is an excellent source in slightly high in fiber (16.74%), low in crude protein (9.98%), moderate NFE (42.391) and metabolizable energy 2497 kcal/kg, and ash content is relatively high. (13.26%). when companied with the values reported by (Oluokun, 1999) ;(Hamzat and Babatunde, 2001). These differences might be due to varietals differenced and shelf life of the test ingredient before analysis. However, the crude protein content fairly put kola pod husk meal (KPHM) with feed ingredients like Sorghum while the fibre content put it in same proximate com being one of the important pods for medical treatment in the world. The kola pod husk provides some essential materials for doth drying. The pod bark, when mixed with some ingredients is used in traditional medicine to reduce Labour pains. The bark is used in treating swellings and fresh wounds. The roots provide excellent chewing sticks for cleaning the teeth and the wood is used in local carvings coachwork and boatbuilding. Lipid refers to the different kind of fats present in the bodies of human plasma include triglyceride (TG), phospholipids (PL), cholesterol esters (CE), and free cholesterol (FC) and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA. Each lipid plays a different role in our bodies yet all of them except free cholesterol (FC) contain esters of long chain fatty acid in their structures. Lipids are insoluble in plasma due to their non- polar structures thus; they need some carriers that are soluble in polar and non- polar environment. Lipids are packaged and carried in the form of lipoprotein, which is a molecule that contains both protein (i.e. apolipoprotein) and lipids.<br/>Statins (lipitor) are group of drugs approved for their Cholesterol reduction properties and are commonly used to treat atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. These drugs inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-COA) reductase. The rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis; which converts HMG.CoA to mevalonate. Apart from cholesterol, mevalonate is also the substrate for the synthesis of nonsteroid, isoprenoids such as coenzyme Q. Depletion of these isoprenoids results in the so called plelotropic effects of statins which are independent of cholesterol.<br/>Lowering effect.These plelotropic effects of anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and ant-proliferative effect. In addition, data from experimental and observational studies indicated that statins have neuroprotective effects and be a treatment option for neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system and the ocular structures particularly the retina (schemer, 2007). Statins (Atorvastatin) is widely used in the treatment of hepatic diseases. They have been widely used in chinning proactive as cholesterol lowering agents to reduce mobility and mortality from coronary artery diseases. It also has an effect in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis.<br/>However, limited studies are available on the effect of kola pod husk meal treatment on hepatoprotective effect in high fat diet fed animal in this regard, the present study was aimed to investigate the effect of kola pod meal on high-fat fed rats related to different hepatoprotective effect by comparing Lipitor Treatment.<br/> CHAPTER TWO<br/> LITERATURE REVIEW<br/> 2.1  Origin of kola<br/> The gems Kola of the family sterculiaceae (Russel, 1955), is indigenous to tropical Africa and has its centre of greatest diversity in west Africa in the forest areas of west Africa, kola is perhaps second only to palm oil in importance in the list of indigenous cash crops. About 40 kola species have been described in West Africa. However, in Nigeria, the kola species of real importance are kola acuminate and kola nitida<br/> (Quarcoo,1973;(Daramola,1978) Kola acuminate and Kola nitida are important economic crops in the forest areas of west and central Africa, carribean islands, mauritivs, Sri Lanka and Malaysia (Eijnatten,1969);( Oladokun, 1985). The cultivation of cola nitida in Nigeria began sometime in the 19th century. The nitida―goro)wasobservednut‖tobe (kolagrowing abundantly in the otta bush in 1854 while its cultivation was noted in Egba Division in 1902 and in Labochi and envious in 1901. From Agege, kola nitida cultivation presumably spread to the forest areas following first the course of the railway line into Abeokuta, Ibadan and Offa replacing the local kola acuminata and penetrating later along streams and river banks into the Guinea savannah and at present, south and Eastern state (Eijnatte, 1969).<br/>Kola nuts have for hundreds of years served as an important article of internal trade in Nigeria and other parts of Africa (Nzekwu, 1961). It has been an item of trade in West Africa and in the Trans-saharan trade routes for many countries (Egbe and Sobamiwa, 1989).<br/>Kola nut is used as a masticatory stimulant by Africans and has numerous uses in social, religious, ritual and ceremonial functions by the natives in the forest region of Africa it is used during ceremonies related to marriage, child naming, installation of chiefs, funeral and sacrifices made to the various gods of Africa Mythology (Nzekwu, 1967) ;( Daramola, 1978) ;(Opeke, 1992). There is also increasing demand for its usage in pharmaceuticals industries and for production of soft drinks, wines, and candles (Beattie, 1970); Ogutuga, 1975). Its uses have inevitably created a high demand in excess of its production (Oladokun, 1985).<br/>Kola nut has been used as abuse for a now brand of chocolate and wine (Kola chocolate and kola wine) which were developed by CRIN researchers (famuyima, 1987). Eka, (1971), has also reported the possible use of pulverized kola nuts for the preparation of non-alcoholic beverages.<br/>Kola pod husk has also been utilized for the production of liquid soap. The most recent and remarkable advancement is kola by-product utilization is the use of kola pod husk in the replacement of up to 60% of the maize used in<br/>pottery feed formulations (yahayaet al, 2001); (Hamzat, 2001);( Hamzat and Babatunde, 2001) ;( Hamzat and longe, 2002) ;( Hamzatet al; 2000) ;( Olubamimaet al, 2002). Other uses of kola according to Nzekwu (1961) are as follows: - (1) It provides some essential materials for doth dying. (2) The pod bark, when mixed with some ingredients is used in traditional medicine to induce labour pains. (3) The bark is used in treating swellings and fresh wounds. Research on the improvement of productivity of kola is carried out at the cocoa research institute of Nigeria (CRIN) with the mandate in Nigeria for research into production and extension aspects of cocoa, kola, coffee, cashew and tea.<br/>2.1  Strategies for enhancing investment opportunities in kola production. <br/>1.      The first step is to improve the quality and quantity of kola nut production in the country. This can be achieved by two approaches.<br/>2.      Rehabilitation of kola orchards: a more efficient utilization of land can be achieved by the cutting down of unproductive trees and replacing them with proven materials.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF N-HEXANE EXTRACT OF KOLA NITIDA BARK ON LIVER FUNCTION TEST<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF N-HEXANE EXTRACT OF KOLA NITIDA BARK ON LIVER FUNCTION TEST", "id": 51}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECT OF PTEROCARPUS MILDBREADII SEED ON PLASMA HDL CHOLESTEROL OF ALBINO RAT<br/>ABSRACT</b><br/>This work was carried out to investigate the effects of pterocarpus mildbreadii seed on the HDL- level of albino rats.High density lipoprotein(HDL) is a fraction of cholesterol,which helps to transport cholesterol from peripheral of cell to the liver.High density lipoprotein is carried out to investigate cardio vascular diseases.Fresh oha seed (pterocarpus mildbreadii seed) was collected from Amokwe in udi local government Area Enugu state.

Pterocarpus mildbreadii being the major case study both the vegetable and the seeds.<br/>The vegetable is majorly used in our various home for cooking. Pterocarpus mildbreadii (Oha seed) are not consumed by the people from the eastern part of Nigeria. So it cannot be majorly stated the content of this oha seed.<br/>The demand for vegetable oils as a result of diminishing source of oils and fats creates the needs for new sources as well as exploiting sources that are currently unexploited in order to supplement the existing ones (Minzangi et al. 2011).<br/>As industrialists continues to rely mostly on the popular vegetable oil like coconut oil, soyabeans oil, ground nut oil, palm oil etc. for the preparation and production of their various products.<br/>Plant lipids also posses nutritive value and have an impact on human nutrition and the world economy.more than three quarters of the edible and industrial oils marketed annually are derived from seed and fruit triglycerol (Schimid &amp; Ohlrogge, 2002). Seeds have nutritive and calorific value which makes them necessary in diets. They are good sources of edible oils and fats. The amount of energy provide by 1g of fat and oil when fully digested is more than twice as many joules of protein and carbohydrate do. Fats makes meals more satisfying, enrich its flavor and delay the unset of hunger (Odoemelan, 2005). Unfortunately, insufficient availability of animal protein and the costliness of available plant protein sources have also increased the need for research on revealing lesser known under-utilized legumes and oil seeds of nutritive value (Schimid &amp; Ohlrogge, 2002).<br/>          CHAPTER TWO          <br/>               LITERATURE REVIEW          <br/>2.0    The    fats and oils    used almost universally as    stored    form of<br/>     energy in    living organisms are derivatives of fatty acids (Nelson    &amp; Cox,<br/>     2005). The natural fat and oil are mixtures of glycerides and fatty acids<br/>     belonging to a large group of water insoluble substances called lipids.<br/>     Plants   produced   the   majority   of   t<br/>     including humans depends on these lipids as a major source of calories<br/>     and fatty acids plant lipid also have substantial impact  on the world<br/>     economy    and human nutrition. More than three-quarters of the edible<br/>     and industrial oils marketed annually are derived from seed and fruit<br/>     triglycerols.               <br/>     This figures are particularly impressive given that on a whole organism<br/>     basis, plants store more carbon as carbohydrates than as lipids. Some<br/>     plants are not mobile and since photosynthesis provide fixed carbon on<br/>     regular basis, plant requirement for storage lipids as an efficient, light<br/>     weight energy reserve are less acute than that of animals (Schmid &amp;<br/>     Ohlrogge, 2002). World supplies of fats and oil are reported to come<br/>     from vegetable sources    (68.1%) animal fats (28.2%)    and marine fats<br/>(3.8%). In Nigeria, there are abundant sources of lipids such as palm oil, coconut oil, cotton seed oil, soya bean oil, groundnut oil, etc. (Akpan et al. 2006). <br/> 2.1     LIPIDS<br/> Lipids are important biological molecules. These compounds are sparingly soluble in water and highly soluble in organic solvents such as ether, chloroform, turpentine, Benzene. E.t.c. They are divers in both structures and functions therefore do not share a common molecular structure. Lipids may be broadly defined as hydrophobic or amphiphilic small molecules; the amphiphilic nature of some lipids allows them to form structures such as vesicles, liposomes, or membranes in an aqueous environment. Lipids function in energy storage, cell membrane structure, protective of living surfaces and chemical signals.<br/> 2.2     CLASSIFICATION OF LIPIDS<br/> Lipids classification based on their chemical nature includes the simple lipids, compound lipids, derived lipids and lipids complexed to other compounds.<br/>SIMPLE LIPIDS:- Are those containing fatty acids and glycerol or other higher alcohols. Compounds that exist under this class are the<br/> A.               Neutral fats –Triglycerides<br/>  B.               Waxes<br/>  1.                 True waxes<br/>  2.                 Cholesterol esters<br/>  3.                 Vitamin A esters<br/>  4.                 Vitamin D esters<br/>COMPOUNDS LIPIDS: These are fatty acids esterifies with an alcohol but in addition they contain other groups like the sulfate, nitrogen. Etc. common examples includes<br/> A.               phospholipids - Contain a phosphoric molecule and a fat molecules<br/>  B.               Cerebroside –Contain a carbohydrates and a fat molecule.<br/>  C.               Sulfolipids –Contain a sulfate radical.<br/>  DERIVED LIPIDS:- These compounds are derived from lipids or precursor of lipids. They include<br/>A.               fatty acids<br/>  B.               fatty aldehydes<br/>  C.               fatty alcohols<br/>  D.               vitamins A,D,E,K<br/>  E.                Hydrocarbons<br/>  2.3            TRIGLYCERIDES<br/> Triglycerides results from the reaction between glycerol and fatty acid. They are the major energy reserve and the principal neutral derivative of glycerol found in animals. These molecules consist of glycerol esterifies with three fatty acids. If all the three fatty acids group are the same, the molecule is called a simple triglycerides. Eg tristerylgcerol and trioleoylglycerol. Mixed triglycerol contain two or more different fatty acids. Monoacylglycerol and Diacylglycerol also exist, but they are less common than the triglycerol. A significant number of fatty acids in plants and animals exist in the form triglycendes. These are the most abundant class of lipids. Most animal and plant fats are composed of mixtures of simple and mixed triglycerides. Triglycerol are stored as oil in seeds of many types of plants, providing energy and<br/>biosynthetic precursors during seed germination (Nelson &amp;S Cox, 2005). Triglycerides are rich in high reduced carbons and thus yield large amount of energy in oxidative reaction of metabolism. Complete oxidation of 1 gram of triglyceride yield about 17 kg /g (Grisham &amp; Garrett, 2005). <br/> 2.4            WAXES <br/> Waxes are alcohol-based lipids that are extremely insoluble in water. If you have ever spilled your beverages on the wax paper wrapping of your sandwich, you have probably observed the way the liquid is repelled by the wax and forms beads. Because wax dose not dissolve in water, they form a thin layer over all the green tissue of plants that is both a chemical and physical barrier. This layer serve many purposes, for example to limit the diffusion of water and solutes, while permitting a controlled release of a volatiles that may deter pests or attract pollinating insects it provides protection from diseases and insects, and helps the plants resist drought. Waxes also have a water proofing and protective roles for insects.<br/>Waxes can have a storage function, as in marine organisms and for example in the seeds of the jojoba plants. Bees use wax to produce the rigid structures of honey combs. The uropygial glands of birds secrets waxes, which they use to provide water-proofing for feathers (Christie, 2011).<br/> 2.5            PHOSPHOLIPIDS <br/>These are the second most abundant class of lipids usually found in animal and plant cell membrane. Phospholipids contain a glycerol and fatty acids plus phosphoric acid and a low molecular weight alcohol. While fatty acids are typically composed of three fatty acids, phospholipids have two fatty acids. Phospholipids have water-hating “fails” -lovingandwater„heads “so that they helps protects our cellular machinery from the outside world. Examples of phospholipids found in the biological membrane are phosphatidylcholine (also known as PC, Gpcho or lecithin), phosphafidylethano lamine (Pt or Gpftn) and phosphatidylserine cps or Gpser).<br/> 2.6            FATTY ACIDS <br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF PTEROCARPUS MILDBREADII SEED ON PLASMA HDL CHOLESTEROL OF ALBINO RAT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF PTEROCARPUS MILDBREADII SEED ON PLASMA HDL CHOLESTEROL OF ALBINO RAT", "id": 52}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECT OF WATER EXTRACT OF COLA NITIDA POD ON LIPOPROTEIN CONCENTRATIONS OF ALBINO WISTAR RATS<br/>CHAPTER ONE </b>                                       <br/>1.0 Introduction -                                        <br/>CHAPTER TWO                                        <br/>2.0    Literature Review -                              <br/>2.1    Kola Nut Powered (Cola Nitida) -                    <br/>2.2    Kola pod components -                              <br/>2.3    Geography and distribution -                         <br/>2.4    Lipoprotein -                                   <br/>2.5    High cholesterol diagnosis -                         <br/>2.6    Low cholesterol -                                   <br/>2.7    Changes during circulation -                         <br/>2.8    Liver -                                        <br/>CHAPTER THREE    Materials and methods               <br/>3.1    Identification and Extraction plant material -               <br/>3.2    Phytochemical Analysis -                              <br/>3.3    Experimental Animal model -                         <br/>3.4    Collection of Blood samples -                         <br/>3.5    Lipid profile Analysis -                              <br/>CHAPTER FOUR    Results                              <br/>Phytochemical composition of samples -                    <br/>CHAPTER FIVE         Discussion and conclusion               <br/>5.1    Discussion - -                                   <br/>5.2    Conclusion --                                   <br/> Reference -<br/>ABSTRACT<br/>Cola nitida has been in use in the eastern parts of Nigeria for the management of certain ailments and as an aphrodisiac in the management of some sexual dysfunctions. However the effects of this extract in some health parameters in human objects have not been reported. This work, then, was aimed at investigating the effect of water extracts of kola pods on lipoprotein concentrations on albino wistar rats.<br/> Rats were used in this study and they were divided into several groups and fed with a high calorietoincreasethe food ( blood lipoprotein concentration in the rat models. The effect of the water extracts of the sample used was compared with a known drug and the results statistically compared to ascertain the effect of the water extract on the rat models.<br/>The results of this work indicate that water extracts of cola nitida pods can be used in the management of mild lipoprotein dysfunctions thus substantiating the reasons for its use in sexual erectile functions.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1            INTRODUCTION <br/>Cola Nitida has been used in folk medicine as an aphrodisiac,  an appetite suppressant, to treat morning sickness, migraine headache, and indigestion (Esimone et al., 2007). It has also been applied directly to the skin to treat wounds and inflammation (Newall et al.,1996)on the teeth and gums. There has also been speculations as to its use in the treatment of peptic ulcer, however, in Nigeria there is no record of the incidence of peptic ulcer.<br/>According to Esimone (2007), cola nitida tree is native to West Africa. Cola nuts are obtained from cola trees. Cola nitida belongs to the genus cola and family steriliaceae. They are commonly used to counteract hunger and thirst; in some cases it is used to control vomiting in pregnant woman and also as a principal stimulant to keep awake and withstand fatigue by students, drivers, and other menial workers.<br/>Lipoproteins are found in the liver and cells. The liver is the largest organ inside the body. The liver is dark reddish-brown and consists of two main lobes. There are over 300 billion specialized cells in the liver that are connected by a well organized system of “bile”            ductssels calledandthe biliarybloodsystem.  ves<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>LITERATURE REVIEW<br/> Cola husk pod has great potentials as feed ingredients (Hamzat et al., 2003). Cola tree is a tropical tree which belongs to the family of steriliaceae. It is mostly common in the rain forest region of West Africa. This crop is of socio-economic importance; there is a variety of kola species, out of which cola nitida and cola accuminata are of major economic and social importance in Nigeria. (Babafunde et al.,2001.)<br/> According to Russelu (2005) the tree is a robust tree usually from 12m high. In South Western Nigeria where large plantation is established, I discovered that kola nitida pod husk shares several similarities with coco pod husk; both have high crude protein and low crude fibre content. Kola pod husk contains the highest value of calcium (0.60%), chloride ion (0.44%) and molybdenum (9.4ppm) (lowest value of this nutrient is observed in kola test (0.7ppm). The seeds of both cola nitida and cola accuminata, its nutritive quality have been reported cogutuga.<br/>2.1                KOLA POD COMPONENTS <br/> The kola pod components were found to have supportive effect on fat accumulation. Sayami et al., 2010, described that 2% caffeine powder suppresses body weight gain and fat accumulation. It also reduces triacylglycerol (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) in the liver and as well as (TG) in serum, without reducing food intake (in mice). As a result, it was shown that the combination of caffeine and catechin might be the most effective of all green tea components in suppressing fat accumulation. Body fat gain in mice fed with a high-fat diet was significantly suppressed. Catechins and MRNA expressions of acyl-con oxidase (ACO) and medium chain acyl-con dehydrogenase (MCAD), which are related to B-oxidation within the liver were upregulated. It was also demonstrated that weight gain, body fat, accumulation, TG and TC in the liver, and TG in serum were suppressed in rats fed on normal diet and water containing 0.5% catechins. Additionally, a diet containing 1% catechins decreased TG levels and enzymatic activities of fatty acid synthesis (F &amp; S) on enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis in rat liver. Rats fed with a high-fat diet with 0.05% or 0.14% caffeine demonstrated a reduction in body fat mass as well as hepatic and serum TC and TG levels. Moreover, serum catecholamine concentrations were increased in rat that were orally administered 5mg/kg of caffeine.<br/> Taxonomy<br/> Class:           Equisetopsida<br/>Subclass:                 Magnolidae<br/>Superorder:            Rosanae<br/> Order:          Malvales<br/> Family:        Malvaleae<br/> Genus:         cola<br/> Common name (s):          Kola  nut,  cola,  kola,  siffer  kola  (English)<br/> Abata cola, Gbaja cola, goro cola, labozlic kola (traditional names).<br/> 2.3            GEOGRAPHY &amp; DISTRIBUTION <br/>Cola nitida is native to West Africa (from Guinea to Ghana)  and has been introduced throughout the forested areas of West and Central  Africa.  Commercial  crops  are  grown  mainly  in  Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d’ivoireSierra Leoneandand also to some extent in India, Brazil and Jamaica.<br/> 2.4            LIPOPROTEIN <br/>A  lipoprotein  is  a  biochemical  assembly  that  contains  both proteins and lipids. Many enzymes, transporters, antigens, adhesions, structural proteins and toxins are lipoproteins. The trans membrane proteins of the mitochondrion and the chloroplast, and bacterial lipoprotein functions of lipoprotein particles is to transport water insoluble lipids (fats) and cholesterol around the body in the blood. The various types of lipoprotein in the body enable fats to be carried in the blood stream. The lipoproteins have hydrophilic groups of phospholipids, cholesterol and apoproteins directed outward. Such characteristics make them soluble in the salt water based blood pool.

It is produced mainly from sorghum grain (Sorghum vulgare ) and the process of brewing involves malting, mashing, souring, fermentation and packaging. Locally brewed beer without hops has a short shelf-life. The aqueous extract of a tropical plant, bitter-leaf was used as the hop .Two type of drink were produced, one with hops and another without hops. Chemical analyses were carried out on both drinks, which gave a significant (p≤0.05) difference. Sorghum beer with hops has a total acidity of 0.562±0.03, fixed acidity of 0.203±0.001, Volatile acidity 0.360±0.02, PH 3.93, specific gravity 1.042±0.003, total dissolved solids 1.12×105ppm, total suspended solids 1.65×105ppm, ethanol content of 3.43±0.03 respectively. While sorghum beer without hops has a total acidity of 0.652 ±0.002, fixed acidity of  0.176±0.002, volatile acidity of 0.476±0.03, PH of 3.50 specific gravity of 1.021±0.003,  total dissolved solid of 1.15×105ppm, total suspended solids of 1.5×105ppm and an ethanol content  of 3.65±0.02. The microbial count for sorghum beer with hop had no growth of E.coli, streptococcus and staphylococcus but aspergillus was present from the 4th day and heaviest on the 8th day. While the drink without hop had growth of staphylococcus and aspergillus which was seen from the 2nd day and heaviest on the 4th day but E.coli and streptococcus was absent. From the results, the drink with hops could keep for a longer period of time than the other drink without hops. Thus, the aqueous extract of Vernonia amygdalina could extend the shelf-life of locally brewed sorghum beer.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0   INTRODUCTION<br/>The word beer derives from the Latin word bibere meaning to drink (Okafor, 2007). Beer is the world’s oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic beverage and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea. Grossman (1995) defined beer as a general name given to beverages resulting from the germination of a malt or cereal grain. The process of brewing beer is called brewing. It is produced by the brewing and fermentation of starches mainly derived from cereal grains most commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used (Gutcho, 1976). In Nigeria today, barley has been replaced by some locally grown cereals such as sorghum or guinea corn, millet and maize as the principal raw materials. The tropical beers (African local beers) are known by different names in different part of the world; burukutu, otika and pito in Nigeria, maujek among the Nandi’s in Kenya, mowa in Malawi, kaffir beer in South Africa, merisa in Sudan, bouza in Ethiopia and pombe in some parts of East Africa (Okafor, 2007).<br/>Burukutu is an indigenous alcoholic beverage. Burukutu, a popular alcoholic drink among indigenes of the middle belt region of Nigeria, is a local brew made from fermented sorghum and other protein enriched grains (Ekundayo, 1969). The age long drink, also known as BKT, serves as a source of alcohol for those who lack the financial means to patronize refined brew like beer and other foreign or imported drinks it is produced mainly from the grains of guinea corn (Sorghum vulgare and<br/>Sorghum bicolor). The process of production of burukutu involves malting, mashing, fermentation and maturation as described by Ekundayo (1969).The production process of these indigineous drinks involves fermentation at its initial production stage and comes out as an alcoholic drink. The microorganisms associated with fermentation include Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces chavelieria and Leuconostocmesteroides (Faparusi et al., 1973).<br/> Sorghum is a large variable genus with many cultivars (Ettasoe, 1972). The method employed in brewing sorghum beer here involves, malting, mashing, wort boiling with hops, fermentation, (using brewer’s yeast and bakers yeast) and packaging. The tropical sourced hop extracts used here is Vernonia amygdalina (Bitter leaf) which have been found to contain an anti bactericidal agent which is capable of extending the useful life of these indigenous beers (Okoh et al., 1999).<br/>Chemical analysis on the prepared sorghum beer such as; ethanol content, PH value, specific gravity, fixed acidity, total acidity, total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids(TSS) were analysed quantitatively, using different methods.<br/>1.1 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>The aim of the project is itemized into the following objectives;<br/>1.  To determine the shelf-life of locally brewed sorghum beer.<br/>2.  To check the effect of bitter-leaf  (Vernonia amygdalina) extract  on the locally brewed sorghum beer.<br/>3.

It is rich in protein and is obtained by a solid state fermentation of the seed of African oil bean tree (Pentaclethra macrophylla Benth).<br/> The natural fermentation of the seed which at present is still done at the house-hold level, renders the production nutritious, palatable and non-toxic (Enujiugha, 2002).<br/> Its production, like many African fermented foods depends, entirely on mixed fermentation by microorganism from diverse source.<br/> Pentaclethra macrophylla Benth is a large woody plant abundant in the rain forest areas of west and central Africa. It’s 1937 (Ladipo, 1984); where it is found in the South Nigeria, (Mbajunwa et al.,1998).<br/>―Ugba‖Pentaclethra macrophylla Benth belongs to the Family Leguminosae and sub-family Microsoideae (Keay, 1989 and NFTA, 1995).<br/> Ugba seeds are irregular and oval; they are flat, black and hard pods. It is composed of oil, protein and small amounts of carbohydrate (Obeta, 1982).<br/> 1.1            AIM AND OBJECTIVES <br/>(i)                To determine the concentration of Malondialdehyde (MDA, which indicates the peroxidation status) and<br/>(ii)                The activity of Catalase (a marker of antioxidant status) in the serum of rats fed graded doses of African oil bean seed meal<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/> 2.0.         LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>The oil bean seeds are obtained from the African oil bean tree (Pentaclethra macrophylla Bentham) a large perennial leguminous plant that grows to a height of 25m. The leaves are small and reddish when Young and but gradually turn to dark green (Enujiugha and Agbade, 2005).<br/>The trees are planted along the sides of roads as shade trees and around communities as cash crops. The fruit is black, hard and woody pod measuring about 35-36cm long and 5-10cm broad. When mature it splits open explosively to release about eight diameters and weighing about 15-20grams (Keay et al., 1964; Odunfan, 1986).<br/>The compound leaves are usually about 20-45cm long and covered with rusty hairs giving a scurfy effect particularly along the upper surface but this eventually falls off. There are 10-12 pairs of stout pinnae, the middle pairs are 7-13cm long and also have rusty hairs along the central grove. There are usually 12 –15 pairs of opposite stalk less pinnules (leaflets) each 12 –15cm long and 5 –10mm broad,<br/>  with the middle pairs longest. Leaflets often have a rounded tip but are sometimes notched, the base is unequal.<br/>Flowers are creamy yellow or pinkish-white and sweat smelling, flowering commences at variable periods within West Africa. The main flowering season is between March to April with smaller flushes in June and November. Fruits are available at most periods of the year because the large woody pods are persistent. The pods are 40-50cm long and 5-10 wide. Fruits splits open explosively with the valves curling up. This is the form in which they appear on most trees, usually pods contain between 6-10 flat glossy brown seeds and are up to 7cm long. This is the      edible   product   and   sources   of   the<br/> Ville, 1959).<br/> The fermented seed is called UGBA by the Igbo’s while the Efiks in the southern Nigeria call it UKANA. It is consumed by an<br/> estimate of about 15 million people in the eastern part of Nigeria majority of who are Igbo’s (Odunfa85) and Oyeyola, 19<br/>2.1      CLASSIFICATION OF OIL BEAN<br/> Kingdom:    Plantae<br/>Order:                        Fabales<br/>  Family:       Fabaceae<br/>  Subfamily: Mimosoideae<br/>  Tribe:          Mimoseae<br/>  Genus:        Pentaclethra<br/>  Species       Pentaclethra macrophylla<br/>2.2            COMPOSITION OF SEED: <br/>The oilbean seeds contain 4-17% carbohydrate, 44-47% oil which has been found to be rich in oleic acid  (Nwokedi, 1975; Odoemelam, 2005) and linoleic acid  (Onwuliri et al., 2004).  Onwuliri et al. (2004) also found out that the saturated  fatty acid, lignoceric acid, occurred in high amounts constituting about 10% of the total  fatty acid concentration. Some workers said that the oil content could be as low as 38%  (Kar and Okechukwu, 1978). They also reported that the oil contains about 75% saturated  fatty acids and 25% unsaturated  fatty acids. (Achinewhu,  1983) showed the  fatty acid content of the seeds. Both saturated and unsaturated  fatty acids are found in the seeds. For the saturated  fatty acids, lignoceric acid appears to be present in the largest amount constituting about 12% while palmitic acid is the least with 3.4%. Behemic acid is also present with 5.2%. The major<br/>unsaturated  fatty acid in the seeds is linoleic acid constituting 42.8%. Oleic acid is<br/> also present in appreciable amounts (29.0%).

Oceans cover wsout 72% of the earth and the average depth is 2.5 miles. The oceans are the source of 97% of all water. The rest consist of 2.1% in glaciers, 0.6% fresh water in lakes and rivers 0.6% ground waters and 0.1% in brine well and brackish waters. <br/>            Water is the major components of living things for example, the water content of human adult is 70% the same proportion as the earths surface. Water is a liquid, which is colourless, odourless and tasteless. Human activities and settlements hinge on the availability of water. In man, three quarters of the fluid in him are made of water, water forms the essential medium in which the chemical reactions of his cells processed. <br/>IMPORTANCE OF WATER                                                 <br/>            Our physical biological environment play important role on water. As a vapour, it absorbs radiation to influence the heat balance and temperature of the environment thereby bringing moisture to the containment through the water cycle. Human activities and settlement also generate important role on water availability which is used as a medium into which man disposes his wastes which could be industrial domestic or agricultural. Water is so important that it is involves in almost every activity in man.    <br/>1.2         STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>The research her realised that some of the pure water sachets and boreholes water have a lot of problems interms of not using the adequate or sufficient PH value recommended by the NAFDAC. As this has direct effect with the general interest of the consumers positively or negatively which influences the all round achievement in pure water sachets and borehole water. So in doing this, the following questions call for attention. <br/>1.            Are pure water sachet companies in Benin City have too much acid content? <br/>2.            Are the borehole water have too much acid content<br/>3.            Is effluent from sewage plant properly treated? <br/>4.            Are all the pure water sachet companies registered with the NAFDAC<br/>5.            Does drinking water have taste, odour and colour? <br/>1.3         PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>The relevance of this research work is to examine and make a report on PH value of sachet water samples and borehole water sample in Benin City. Some of the drinking water has already been contaminated, that is to say, the packaging and that of the nylons used to package the treated water are not properly checked. This research work is also aim to determine to what level pure water sachet and borehole water contained too acid and also to check whether all the pure water sachet companies are registered with NAFDAC (national Agency for food and Drug Administration Company).   <br/>1.4         AIMS AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY  <br/>The aims and objective of this study is to provide possible solutions that will sustain pure water sachet companies and borehole water in Benin City, Edo State. <br/>1.            To ensure consumer buy pure water sachet registered with NAFDAC. <br/>2.            To encourage consumers to report to the NAFDAC, if they see pure water sachet not registered being sold for drinking. <br/>3.            To ensure pure water companies, the PH value of the water produced for consumption are within the standard recommended by the WHO for drinking water. <br/>4.            To check packaging and ensuring that the nylons used to package the treated water do not contaminate the water put into it or give it some unwanted odour or taste. <br/>5.            To ensure that, the best chemical is been used during the treatment of water. <br/>6.            To ensure that sewage water be treated carefully. <br/>7.            To sanction all the pure water companies not registered with NAFDAC.     <br/>1.5         SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY <br/>The researcher hopes what this research work will go along way for the society in developing the positive effects and thinking towards the determination of PH value of pure water sachets and bore hole sample. The research work is considered on believe to make the treatment more inclined to pure water sachet and bore hole water and greatly helps the companies in formulating a well planned programmer that will inculcate the right attitude towards the PH value of pure water sachet and borehole water in Benin City.<br/>The research study is believed will make reforms of the present greatly increasingly emphasis on providing the treatment equipment for the pure water sachet and borehole water. The researcher study is to make all the pure water sachets and borehole water to be properly checked before drinking in order to improve good health. <br/>Finally, the research work is believed to make an effort so that all the effluence from sewage plant is treated with chloride before drinking.    <br/>1.6         HYPOTHESIS <br/>1.            Some of the pure water sachet companies in Benin City have too much acid content. <br/>2.            Some of the bore hole water have too much acid content <br/>3.            The effluent from sewage plant is not properly treated. <br/>4.            Some of the pure water sachet companies is not registered with NAFDAC. <br/>5.            Some drinking water has taste, odour and colour. <br/>1.7         SCOPE OF STUDY <br/>This research study covers five selected pure water sachets companies and five of many different type of borehole water were looked into to see if there PH is in line with the recommendation for drinking water from the world health organisation WHO standard in respect to PH of each water sample. <br/>PURE WATER SAMPLE <br/>1.            Uniben pure water <br/>2.            Maria pure water <br/>3.            Ages pure water <br/>4.            Faith mark pure water  <br/>5.            Uncle Sam pure water <br/>BOREHOLE SAMPLE <br/>1.            No 8 Edo Street off technical road <br/>2.            Black 25 technical estate <br/>3.            No 46 Jonathan Akpobaries street <br/>4.            No 3 15th Street off estate junction <br/>5.            No. 8 Otahoigbogie Street, off Adolor College. <br/>1.8         DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Water: This is a liquid without colour, taste or odour that falls as rain, is in lake, rivers, and seas, is used for drinking, washing and so on. <br/>Pollution: It is a change in physical, chemical, or Biological conditions in the environment of the air.

dotted with projects that are being delayed, disrupted, and uncompleted.    Explanations giving for the stages of each buildings projects is varied and sometimes attributed to lack of financial, human and material resources with which to execute the projects.       It is common in Nigeria especially now that the country is suffering from depression in the economy.   It is often bad to see huge capital investments being disrupted and abandoned.<br/>        Any attempt to delay and disrupt a construction project, will have terrible consequences on every aspect of the nation’s activities which will be severe and unwelcome.<br/>        Delays and disruptive in construction has some effects on its cost and very retrogressive in a developing economy like Nigeria and needs to be properly addressed and tackled with all the courage and effort that we can muster.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>        One of the biggest problems associated with most of the construction projects in Nigeria today is problem of delays and disruptions at both the pre-contract and post-contract stages of construction in building and civil engineering works.<br/>        The cost of building increases at the cause of delays and disruption in construction because of variation. many construction project in Enugu needed huge capital outlay and time to execute them and any attempt to delaying and disrupting the construction proper will result to terrible consequences that will affect the economical control and building cost.<br/>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>       The purpose of this study is as follows –<br/>To investigate into most delayed and disrupted construction projects<br/>To ascertain the effects of delays and disruptions on cost of building construction.<br/>To examine the effect of fluctuation in prices on construction projects costs.<br/>To examine the costs of delayed and disrupted construction project to clients, contractors, the professionals that are engaged and the nation, in particular Enugu state.<br/>To examine the effects of variation in design on construction project costs.<br/>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>What are the causes of delays and disruptions in construction projects?<br/>What are the effects of delays and disruptions on building construction project cost?<br/>Do fluctuations in prices bring about changes in construction project cost?<br/>What the costs are of delayed and disrupted construction projects to the clients, contractors, the professionals that are engaged in the field?<br/>In what ways can variations in design affect construction cost?<br/>1.5   THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>        This study will be beneficial to the most construction industry in Nigeria because once a project is initiated and manage properly it will eliminate high cost of procurement and a lot profit are involved.<br/>   Also this will help in planning and execution of future construction project executions, especially the quantity surveyor in the feasibility and planning stages of a proposed scheme and preparation of work method and schedules by the building manager.<br/>      The study also intend to bring together, the causes of construction delays and disruptions and also tries to ascertain the costs, which will help the construction firms, Engineers, Surveyors and construction managers to initialize and control their project without lost or poor management.<br/>1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS      <br/>        From the Oxford advanced learner’s English dictionary, delay implies the process or action of being slow being late or linger and also explain disruption as the action of making it difficult for something to proceed.<br/>Delay – delay in construction can be defined as an act whereby projects execution is slow or interrupted one time or the other, thereby leading to unnecessary extension in the programme of work from what was initially scheduled.<br/>Disruption – disruption in construction projects can be defined as an act or sites partially or completely deserted at one time or the other for the reasons of certain exigencies which have resulted in prolonged delays which are not in accordance with the programme of work in use extension of time or postponement as initially scheduled.<br/>Cost – the estimated amount of money that will be needed for something or the price that should be charged for something.<br/>        Also, it implies the effort, loss or damage that is involved in order to do or achieve something.<br/>Construction – the process or method of building or making something, especially road, building, bridges etc.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF DELAYS AND DISRUPTION \r\nON THE COST OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN NIGERIA\r\n<div

of carotenoids in human serum and tissues. The prominent carotenoid in tomatoes is lycopene, a pigment principally responsible for the deep-red colour of tomato fruits and tomato products. Fruits and vegetables contain in excess of 40 carotenoids that are routinely absorbed and metabolized by humans (Khachik, 1992).<br/>Tomatoes and tomato products are now being investigated for their potential role in prostate cancer prevention and therapy. This review summarizes the in vitro and invivo evidence as well as the molecular data that show the anticarcinogenic potential of tomatoes.   Raw and processed tomatoes are among the most commonly consumed vegetables. They are rich in the phytochemicals, carotenoids and polyphenols. Lycopene and quercetin are the most abundant carotenoids and flavonols respectively. Canned tomato sauce is the primary source of lycopene whereas the tomato skin is enriched with flavonols. Most epidemiological studies suggest that the consumption of tomatoes and the products in associated with a reduced prostate cancer risk. The health professionals follows-up study found that men who consumed 2 to 4 servings of raw tomatoes per week had a more than 20% reduction in prostate cancer risk compared to men who did not consume tomatoes. High lycopene plasma concentrations were associated with a low incidence of prostate cancer and aggressive prostate cancer in rested case-control study with the physician’s health study. Invitro data show that the compounds found in tomatoes are potent anticarcinogens. Cancer cell growth is inhibited by the polyphenols quercetin, kaempferol and naringerin in a dose dependent manner. These compounds do not have cytotoxic effect. In a rat model of prostate cancer, tomato powder into but not lycopene intake by itself reduced prostate cancer related mortality. This suggests that the compounds in tomatoes have an additive influence on prostate cancer. Lycopenes exist as either the cis or trans isomer. The half-life of lycopene is approximately 10 to 14 days, so it remains in the body during washout period. The trans isomer dominates in tomatoes, between the cis isomer dominates in serum and tissues and during a washout period. Thus, recent intake of lycopenes is reflected in blood concentrations whereas long-term exposure is determined in the tissues.  <br/>Lycopene is a bioactive carotenoid found in many red fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, watermelon, pink grapefruits etc. Different fruits, vegetable and their products contain different concentrations of lycopene. This natural red pigment is synthesized exclusive by plants and microorganisms (fungi, bacteria and algae). It facilitates the absorption of light during photosynthesis and also provides protection against photosensitization (Adam et al., 1996) Animals including human being, cannot synthesize lycopene therefore, they obtain lycopene exclusively from diet (Tapiero et al. 2004; Omoni and Aluko, 2005). <br/>Although, tomato contain a lower concentration of nutrients compared to other commercially grow fruits species, they are a major source of lycopene. Lycopene comprises 83% of the total pigment present in tomatoes (Shi et al., 1990). Therefore, the amount of lycopene present in tomatoes other fruits and vegetables vary with variety, degree of ripeness and other dimatic conditions and agricultural practices.<br/>The fraction of vitamin C in the diet that is absorbed and the rate at which the excess is eliminated from the body vary strongly with the dose. Large, randomized clinical trials on the effects of high doses on the general population have not been conducted. Venturi suggested that the antioxidant action of ascorbic acid developed first in the plant kingdom when, about 500 million years ago (mya), plants began to adapt to antioxidant mineral deficient fresh waters of estuaries. Ascorbic acid or vitamin C is a common enzymatic cofactor in mammals used in the synthesis of collagen. Ascorbate is a powerful reducing agent capable of rapidly scavenging a number of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Freshwater fishes also require dietary vitamin C in their diet or they will get scurvy. The most widely recognized symptoms of vitamin C deficiency in fishes are scoliosis, lordosis and dark skin coloration.<br/>The name “carotene” was first coined in the early 19th century by the scientist Wachenroder after he crystallized this compound from carrot roots. Beta-carotene is a member of the carotenoids, which are highly pigmented (red, orange, yellow), fat-soluble compounds naturally present in many fruits, grains, oils and vegetables (green plants, carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, spinach, apricots, and green peppers). Alpha, beta and gamma carotene are considered provitamins because they can be converted to active vitamin A. The carotenes possess antioxidant properties. Vitamin A serves several biological functions including involvement in the synthesis of certain glycoproteins. Commercially available beta-carotene produced synthetically or from palm oil, algae, or fungi. Beta-carotene is converted to retinol, which is essential for vision and is subsequently converted to retinoic acid, which is used for processes involving growth and cell differentiation. <br/> 1.1   Objectives of the study<br/>The main objective of this project is to do a comparative analysis (quantitative analysis) on phytochemicals present in tomatoes and some selected tomato products (canned tomato) sold in any common market in Nigeria.<br/>   <br/>\n\n PHYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF SELECTED TOMATO PRODUCTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  PHYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF SELECTED TOMATO PRODUCTS", "id": 58}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EVALUATION OF ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL OF MONODORA MYRISTICA (AFRICAN NUTMEG)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This work evaluates the antioxidant potential of Monodora myristica (African nutmeg). Monodora myristica extract was obtained by solvent extraction using n-hexane and used as treatment on freshly prepared crude palm kernel oil and palm oil. Equal volume of oil samples were subjected to different concentration of extract treatment (0.2ml,0.4ml, 0.6ml, 0.8ml, 1.0ml using syringe. These oil samples were equally divided into two groups SS and SR. Group SS was stored under the sun and group SR  was stored in the room for three weeks. These treated oil samples were analyzed on weekly basis at two different parameters: Acid value (AV) of free fatty acid and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value, using standard methods. The main effect of extract was determined using ANOVA. For the two varieties of oil, the acid value of free fatty acid increased significantly (P&lt;0.05) as the period extends for group SS without extract while those for group SR showed no significant increase. But AV of oil samples treated with higher extract concentration decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05) for both groups SS and SR. TBA value also showed the same trend of AV. Hence, monodora myristica extract yielded reducing effect in the oxidative level of the oil varieties.<br/> TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE     <br/>1.0       Introduction<br/>1.1       Significance of study<br/> CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0       Literature Review   <br/>2.1       African nutmeg (Monodora myristica)<br/>2.1.1   Scientific classification<br/>2.1.2      Habitat/ ecology of Mondora myristica<br/>2.1.3   Characteristics/morphology of monodora myristica <br/>2.2       Oil Palm                    <br/>2.2.1   Scientific classification<br/>2.2.2   Origin and description of palm oil<br/>2.2.3   The Chemical composition of palm oil<br/>2.2.4   Physical characteristics of palm oil products <br/>2.3       Palm kernel oil<br/>2.3.1   The chemical composition of palm kernel oil<br/>2.4       Modern uses of palm oil and palm kernel oil<br/>2.5       Lipid oxidation<br/>2.5.1   Lipid oxidation pathway<br/>2.5.2   Mechanism of oxidation<br/>2.6       General antioxidant action<br/>2.6.1   Mechanism of antioxidant action<br/>2.6.2   Antioxidant molecules<br/>2.7       General review of photochemistry of monodra myristica <br/>2.7.1   Alkaloids<br/>2.7.2   Flavonoids<br/>2.7.3   Glycosids<br/>2.7.4   Saponins<br/>2.7.5   Tannins<br/>2.8       Application of vegetable oils<br/>2.8.1   Factors that cause oxidative rancidity in vegetable oil<br/>2.9       Nutritional signification<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0       Materials and methods<br/>3.1       Equipment/apparatus<br/>3.2       procedurement  of raw materials<br/>3.3       Study design<br/>3.4       Sample preparation<br/>3.5       Chemical analysis<br/>3.5.1   Determination of acid value (Av)<br/>3.5.2   Determination of thiobarbituric acid number<br/>3.6       Statistical analysis<br/> CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.0       Result and Discussion<br/>4.1       Changes in Acid value of Palm Kernel and palm oil<br/>4.2       Changes thiobarbituric acid value of palm kernel and palm oil<br/>4.3       Effect of monodora myristica extract on the                                                      <br/> chemical indices of oil on storage   <br/> CHAPTER FIVE<br/> 5.0      Summary and conclusion<br/>5.1       limitations<br/>5.3       Future recommendation<br/> References<br/>Appendix I<br/>Appendix II<br/>Appenedix III<br/> LIST OFF TABLES<br/> Table 1:          Fatty acid composition of palm oil (palm oil)<br/> Table 2:         Fatty acid profile of palm kernel oil (palm kernel )<br/>Table 3:          Acid value for palm kernel  oil<br/>Table 4:          Acid value for palm oil<br/>Table 5:          Thiobarbituric acid value for palm kernel oil<br/>Table 6:          Thiobarbituric acid value for palm oil <br/> LIST OF FIGURES<br/>Figure 1:  African nutmeg  seeds (Monodora myristica)<br/>Figure 2:  Africa Oil palm fruits (Elaeis guinesis)<br/>Figure 3:  Lipid oxidation pathway<br/>Figure 4:  Dried seed kernels  of Afican nut meg.<br/>Figure 5:  Transverse section of palm fruit<br/>Figure 6:  n-Hexane extract of Monodora mystica<br/>Figure 7:  Crude palm oil<br/>Figure 8:  Crude palm kernel oil<br/> ABBRERVIATIONS<br/>AOCS:            Association of America Chemistry Society<br/>AV:                 Acid value<br/>FFA:               Free fatty acid <br/>PV:                  Peroxide value<br/>PKO:               Palm kernel oil<br/>PO:                  Palm oil<br/>PUFA:           Polyunsaturated fatty acid<br/>ROS:              Reactive oxygen specie<br/>SR:                  Storage in room<br/>SS:                  Storage in sun<br/>TBA:               Thiobarbituric acid  <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>            Lipid oxidation is one of the major reasons that food deteriorate and is caused by the reaction of fat and oil with molecular oxygen, leading to off-flavours that are generally called rancidity(Basturk et al., 2007). Exposure to light, pro-oxidants and elevated temperature will accelerate the reaction (Kubow, 2009). Lipid oxidation and resultant flavour impairment has seriously limited the storage potential of most fat containing foods (Ihekoronye and Ngoddy, 1985).<br/>            Rancidity covers a wide range of biological activities where the effect is to “make things worse” and thus adversely affect man’s economy. Free radicals and microorganisms are known to cause chemical characteristics that lead to oxidation and deterioration in quality of vegetable oils derived from the seeds or fruits pulps of plants (Basturk et al, 2007). The keeping quality of the oils is basically dependent on their chemical compositions, for instance, the percentages of the degree of unsaturation. Rancidity is associated with off-flavour and odour of the oil. There are two causes of rancidity. One occurs when oil reacts with oxygen and is called oxidative rancidity. The other cause of rancidity is by the combination of enzymes and moisture. Enzymes such as lipase liberate fatty acids from the triglyceride to form di and/or monoglycerides and free fatty acids and such liberation of fatty acid is called hydrolysis, hence hydrolytic rancidity.<br/>The oxidation of fats is an important deteriorative reaction with significant commercial implications in term of product value. The initial oxidation products that accumulate are hydroperoxides, which may subsequently break down to form lower-molecular weight compounds such as alcohols, aldehydes, free fatty acids and ketones, leading to autoxidative rancidity. The peroxide content present in alimentary fats attests to its state of primary oxidation and thus its tendency to go rancid. Unsaturated fatty acids, in fact, react with oxygen forming peroxides, which determine a series of chain reactions whose end result is volatile substances having the characteristic smell of rancidness. These reactions are accelerated by high temperatures and by exposure to light and oxygen (Yildiz et al., 2002). The lower the peroxide and acid values, the better the quality of the alimentary fats and their state of preservation.<br/>Although simple, procedures of  acid value (AV) or peroxide value (PV) determination are cumbersome, destructive to the sample, costly, require potentially hazardous solvents, substantial personnel time, glassware and accurate preparation of reagents and are dependent on a visual endpoint (Ismail et al., 1993; Van de Voort et al., 1994).<br/>            Oxidation is concerned mainly with unsaturated fatty acids. Oxidative rancidity is of special interest as it leads to the development of off-flavour that can be detected early on in the development of rancidity (Basturk et al., 2007)<br/>Some slight deterioration at least is to expected in any commercial oil-bearing material and is, in fact, inherent in the process by which fat is formed (Morel,1997). In the living plants and animals, fats, carbohydrates and proteins are synthesized in a complicated series of steps with the aid of certain enzymes. These enzymes are capable of assisting the reverse as well as the forward reactions and hence under proper conditions may promote the oxidation and degradation of the very substances that, they have previously been instrumental in synthesizing (Basturk et al., 2007)<br/>            Oils in general are known to be susceptible to oxidation and microbial attack. The composition of the various oils determines the extent of oxidation and type of organisms likely to thrive in them (Chow et al., 2000). Several studies have demonstrated that environment factors affect not only the fatty acid composition of vegetable oil, but also, although apparently indirectly, the spatial arrangement of those acids on the triacylglycerol molecule (Tay et al., 2002). Triacylglycerol composition and structure are important in the areas of nutrition, oil stability and possible physiological effects.<br/>            Palm oil is extracted from the mesocarp of the fruit of the oil palm, Elaeis guineensis. crude palm oil (CPO) has a deep orange-red colour due to the high content of carotenoids and is a rich source of vitamin E consisting of tocopherols and tocotrienols (Nesaretnam and Muhammad, 1999). Both beta carotenes and vitamin E are well known nutritional antioxidants.<br/>            Palm oil is known to support the growth of fungi and bacteria especially when it contains moisture (Cornellus, 2001).. Their lipolytic enzymes are so active that even under unfavorable conditions palm oil is seldom produced with a free fatty acid content (FFA) of less than 2% and under favorable conditions of processing, the free fatty acid content of this oil reaches 20%and higher. When the fruit is bruised, lipolytic action occurs and a near maximum FFA (8-10%) is reached within 40 minutes. The FFA of unbruised fruits may increase only 0.2% or less in the course of 4 days (Cornellus, 2001).<br/>            The exposure in the sun is made under radiations of weak temperatures, varying daily, creating an environment favourable to the chemical and enzymatic reactions of hydrolysis and oxidation (Tan et al., 2002).<br/>This study is aimed at examining the oxidative and biodeteriogenic effects of free radicals contaminating the oils from the varieties of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) and palm kernel oil and the chemical components of the oils and the effect of solvent extract of ehuru (African nutmeg).<br/>            Oil palm is indigenous to the Nigerian coastal area. It was discovered by European explorers in the early 1400’s and was distributed throughout tropical Africa by humans who practiced shifting agriculture about 5000 years ago. The palm plant originated from the jungle forest of East Africa and about 5000 years ago, palm oil was used by the pharaohs for cooking and lighting. The cultivation of oil palm is restricted to the eastern sub zones where its growth is favoured environmentally and climatically. Besides, it is a major cash crop in this region. The first oil palm plantation was established at Sumatra in 1911 and at Malaysia in 1917. About this time it was simultaneously established in West Africa and tropical America.<br/>Over the years, a little attention was paid to the industrial use of palm kernel oil. Nevertheless, recent studies have indicated that apart from their domestic uses that they can be used as engine lubricants, as replacement for biodiesel if their properties are enhanced.<br/>Although high in saturated fats, it is a different oil to extract from the nut or kernel of palms which has a yellowish white colour and a pleasantly mild flavor similar to coconut oil in fatty oil acid composition and properties.  Crude palm kernel oil (CPKO) is extracted from palm kernels with palm kernel cake as a by-product. The physical and chemical properties of the various palm oil products have been reviewed by Nesaretnam and Muhammad, (1999).<br/>            Monodora myristica is a widespread and attractive small tree with very decorative flowers appearing just before the leaves. The fruit is suspended on a long green stalk with numerous seeds embedded in whitish sweet smelling pulp. The seed is oblong and pale brown when fresh with a thin seed coat and hard kernel (Nesaretnam and Muhammad, 1999). The seed production is seasonal occurring between April to June. The fruits are globular and ovoid; 3-4 inch long and about 3-5 inch diameter. The wood is hard. The seeds are contained in a hard shell and have a very strong aroma . This plant is commonly called Orchid flower tree in English, Ehuru Ofia in lgbo (Okafor, 2003). Monodora myristica is a specie of calabash nutmeg, the edible seeds yield a nutmeg-flavoured oil which is used in West Africa for cooking (Eggeling, 2002). Plants that belong to Annonaceae family are rich in flavonoids and bioflavonoids and are known to have antioxidant activity (Shahidi et al., 2009). Monodora myristica seed extract contains important pharmacological compounds, alkaloids, flavonoids, and vitamins A and E as well as many important lipids; arhinolipids, free fatty acids, glycolipids, phospholipids and sterols. The plant is widely used in ethnomedicine, especially to relieve toothache as well as in the treatment of dysentery. When roasted and ground, the seeds are rubbed on the skin for (unspecified) skin diseases (Irvine, 2000). This suggests that the seeds of Monodora myristica plant could be germicidal or antiseptic. The roasted ground seeds are chewed, then spat into the hand and then rubbed across the forehead to relieve headache. The seeds are also crushed and used as insecticide, while the root relieves toothache when crushed (Ogtinein unet al., 1999).<br/>Monodora myristica seeds are also used for the treatment of constipation and as a stimulant (Irvine, 2000). The essential oil from Monodora myristica seed is used in pharmaceutical and dental preparation (Talalaji, 1999).<br/>In this study, we have monitored characteristic parameter, namely acid value and thiobarbituric acid value during storage of palm kernel oil and palm oil at different environmental conditions treated with different concentration of seed extract of Monodora myristica. Whereby, the acid value and thiobarbituric acid value, were assessed by the conventional method and the UV-spectra were registered for each sample. Although simple, procedures of acid value (AV) or peroxide value (PV) determination are cumbersome, destructive to the sample, costly, require potentially hazardous solvents, substantial personnel time, glassware and accurate preparation of reagents and are dependent on a visual endpoint (Ismail et al., 1993; Van de Voort et al., 1994).<br/> 1.1       SIGNIFICANCE  OF RESEARCH<br/>The aim and objective of this research is to:<br/>1.         To carryout solvent extraction of Monodora myristica <br/>2.         To  investigate the antioxidant effect of Monodora myristica extract on palm kernel oil and palm oil at different environmental conditions.<br/><br/>\n\nEVALUATION OF ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL OF MONODORA MYRISTICA (AFRICAN NUTMEG)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EVALUATION OF ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL OF MONODORA MYRISTICA (AFRICAN NUTMEG)", "id": 59}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CHEMICAL/MINERAL COMPOSITIONS OF WATER EXTRACTS OF Hibiscus sabdariffa<br/> ABSTRACT</b><br/>This work was carried out to investigate the chemical properties of the water extract of zobo (Hibiscus sabdariffa) drink using the modern atomic absorption spectrophotometer.

An unfortunate, but unintended side effect of some research works and papers was the misleading tendency of many investigators to think of dietary phenols, polyphenols, and tannins (PPT)as encompassing only the flavonoids, flavonols, and flavones. More recent epidemiological studies have supported the association between better health and long-term consumption of diets rich in foods of plant origin(Hung et al., 2004 and Jansen et al., 2004).However, whether this is because such diets minimize exposure to deleterious substances (example oxidized cholesterol, pyrolysis mutagens, salt, saturated fat, etc.), or maximize intake of certain beneficial nutrients (example isothiocyanates and other sulfur-containing plant constituents, mono-unsaturated fatty<br/>acids, and poly-unsaturated fatty acids, PPT, polyacetylenes, selenium, terpenes, etc.) or some combination as advocated in the ‘‘Polymeal’’ concept, remains unknown (Franco et al., 2004 and Johnson, 2004).An in vitro study indicates that there may be mechanistic basis for true synergy between PPT and isothiocyanates. In contrast, more recent studies seeking to assess the suggested link between the consumption of flavonols and flavones, or other flavonoids, have given much less consistent results. Some studies have suggested a possible protective effect of flavonoids against vascular diseases (Hirvonen et al., 2001 and Mennen et al., 2004) or certain (but not all) cancers(Knekt et al., 1997 and Sun et al., 2002).Interestingly, an investigation of the relationship between the consumption of Hibiscus sabdariffa (zobo) and other cruciferous vegetables and the risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women has to be carried out in order to ascertain the beneficial effects to isothiocyanates and/or the phenolic components of the plants (like the dietary phenols including flavonoids) in the management of cancer growth and initiation of various types of diabetes.<br/>In the same time period, various studies have suggested beneficial effect associated with raised consumption of other classes of dietary phenols. For example, increased coffee consumption has been linked with reduced incidence of type II diabetes (van Dam et al., 2002 and Saremi et al., 2003).Similarly, increased consumption of lignans (or at least greater plasma concentrations of their metabolites)has been linked with reduced incidence of estrogen-related cancers in some (Boccardo et al., 2004 and McCann et al., 2004) but not all studies (Kilkkinen et al., 2004 and Zeleniuch –Jacquotte et al., 2004),and a prospective study was equivocal.<br/>1.1       SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH<br/>The flavonoids in the water extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa should be extracted for further experimental and clinical research in the management of certain ailments and disorders like cancer, diabetes mellitus etc.<br/>The mechanisms of flavonoid-protein interactions have been determined; it is my suggestion that such mechanisms should be carried to the in-vivo metabolic and physiological processes aimed at determining the detailed mechanisms involved in cells aging processes and the progression of diseases.<br/> 1.2       OBJECTIVE OF STUDY <br/>    The objective of this study is to determine the physico chemical (biochemical) and water constituent of Zobo produced from dried calyces of Hibiscus sabdariffa (Linn Roselle). Using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS). The biochemical content of the zobo has undesirable effects on human health when consumed.<br/><br/>\n\nCHEMICAL/MINERAL COMPOSITIONS OF WATER EXTRACTS OF Hibiscus sabdariffa<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CHEMICAL/MINERAL COMPOSITIONS OF WATER EXTRACTS OF Hibiscus sabdariffa", "id": 60}]
