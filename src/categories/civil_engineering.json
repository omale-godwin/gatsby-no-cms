It consist of two layers the cement slab and the snobs of granular material or stabilized soil.</p> <p>These two large are sprees I n separate construction operation.</p> <p>1.10           ADVANTAGE OF RIGID PAVEMENT</p> <p>This types of pavement has long life, when properly design constructed.</p> <p>It has low maintenance cost</p> <p>The reinforcement made it not flexible</p> <p>1.11           DISADVANTAGE OF RIGID PAVEMENT</p> <p>(i)                 Trans cracking of concrete paving slab under combined flexural and direct tensile stress is inevitable.</p> <p>(ii)               Longitudinal crack slab more than one lone wide is also inevitable </p> <p>1.12           FUNCTION OF PARTS OF THE PAVEMENT STRUCTURES</p> <p>SUB-GRADE:           This bears the load of pavement and traffic load in other to reduce the effective thickness, the bearing capacity is reduced by</p> <p>(a)        Proper Compaction     (b)        Stabilization</p> <p>(c)                Proper drainage </p> <p>1.13           THE SUB – BASE</p> <p>This is introduced due to poor bearing capacity of the sub grade soil or high traffic density. It is made to improve earths its function is to transmits the traffic load from the road and spreading as jet over a large area of the sub grade formation level.</p> <p>1.14           ROAD BASE</p> <p>The function of the base is bearing the late load from the traffic and long heed from the over wearing surface and spreading it uniformly over a large area of the sub grade or sub-base.</p> <p>1.15          SURFACING (WEARING COURSE)</p> <p>The weary course is to spread the wheel load to the road base against surface water. The presence of bitumen improves the water proofing property. It also provide skid resistance.</p> <p>1.16          PAVEMENT FAILURE</p> <p>Pavement is bound to fail for many reasons not ably localized depression or settlement, but the most but the most common is lack of maintenance. From the day one pavement is exposed to traffic, the pavement is subjected to destructive forces. Temptation change settlement, precipitation and run – off and other natural phenomenous that stress the pavement structure increase addition of the load of traffic on the pavement increases the rate of failure. The serviceability or rider quality of a new pavement declines shallowly at first but as years pass rider quality begins to deteriorate mush more rapidly if maintenance is neglected and the situation is been worsen. The cost of rehabilitation must surly increase visual inspection can be used to determine pavement condition and degree of failure.</p> <p>1.17           RUTTING</p> <p>A known depression in the pavement parallel to the side is sevialy slight when the depression measures less than ½ + 1 inch deep, but not deep enough to pavement steering usually water accommodate in the depression,  promoting pavement failure. This depression can also be caused by traffic loading more than the bearing capacity of the pavement or by poor construction method.</p> <p>1.18           CORRUGATION</p> <p>The corrugation or coach boarding is a form of plastic movement.  Ripples and visible in the pavement perpendicular to this direction of traffic. The condition is slightly with barely visible sever when the ripples are so prevalent that they require the diver to reduce speed.</p> <p>1.19          REVEALING</p> <p>A braking of the visible loose particles or pieces of aggregates considered slightly when only a few piece of aggregate are dislodged from the pavement and are loosely silting above the street surface. Moderate when enough piece of loose aggregate are present to cover wide area of the surface and survey when the loose aggregate is so prevalent that they make the surface rough.</p> <p>1.20          FLUSHING</p> <p>This occurs when asphalt covers the aggregate on the pavement. It is slight the covering is noticeable moderate when long areas are covered and serves when asphalt is totally covering the aggregate.</p> <p>1.21           ALIGATOR CRACKING</p> <p>This occurs when crack is like skin of alligator. The crack are said to be slight when barely visible, moderate when the cracks are more than 6.25mm wide in some place but side and cracks not fully separated. They are usually associated with a gianular untreated base that has failed with a resident sub grade.</p> <p>1.22           POT HOLE</p> <p>These are bower or cup shaped holl of various sizes in the pavement resulting from localized disintegration. They are usually caused by weakness in the pavement resulting from too little asphalt or too tin asphalt or too many fine too few fire or poor drainage.</p> <p>1.23          DISTORTIONS</p> <p>These are normally caused by too little compaction or too many fines in the surface course or settlement like cracks distortion take a number of different forms channeling, corruption, shoring, depression and uphaueaved pavement distortion is any change in the pavement surface from its original shape.</p> <p>1.24           UPHEAVAL</p> <p>Localized upward displacement that is due to swelling of the sub-grade on some portion of the pavement. It is commonly cause by ice penetration in the sub-grade it may also be caused by swelling effects or moisture on exposed soils.</p> <p>1.25           SPALLING EDGES</p> <p>This is a result of the vehicle travelling along the edge of the carriage way or to the continual absorption of surface water. These are deep potholes shallow pot holes which constitutes a very dangerous treat to both life and property including passing traffic on the road. It is normally experienced at the edge of a flexible carriage way where a separate channel course. </p> <p>1.26           SUMMARY OF PAVEMENT FAILURE</p> <p>The pavement fails because the sub-grade, base course wearing surface course has failed. Sub-grade failure results when the applied load on soil expells all then water and air pressure in pores of the sub grade combined with the force produce by the applied force such as plastic deformation si progressively under repetition of load and is the major course of road failure. Insufficient stability of soil which may be as a result of excessive moisture, improper compaction of soil itself may be another coarse of pavement failure.</p> <p> BASE FAILURE</p> <p>(a)                Poor  materials used in the base course</p> <p>(b)               Loss of binding or inter locking properties of the materials.</p> <p>(c)                Loose of material from base course</p> <p>(d)               Loose of factual support to the base course</p> <p>(e)                Poor drainage both for surface and sub surface improper and inadequate compaction</p> <p>(f)                Poor proportions of the materials</p> <p>1.27           WEARING COURSE MAY FAIL DUE TO</p> <p>(a)                Improper quality of binding in the mix</p> <p>(b)               Inferior quality of binding used</p> <p>(c)                More than required quality of binder</p> <p>(d)               Inadequate of binding used</p> <p>(e)                Volatilization and oxidation of binder which make bitumenous stalling brittle and course cracking of the surface.</p> <p>1.28          RECONNAISSANCE SURVEY</p> <p>A visual survey was carried out to investigate the following</p> <p>(a)                The topography and feature along the road</p> <p>(b)               The nature and types of pavement materials</p> <p>(c)                The drainage pattern in relation to expected run off</p> <p>(d)               The pavement profile, sup--- elevation, depth and construction material</p> <p>(e)                The pavement is of flexible type, made of asphalt with crush stone.]</p> <p>(f)                Poor drainage system – the installed drainage system is not available and so causes water to percolate around the pavement.</p> </div>\n\nINVESTIGATION ON THE CAUSES OF PAVEMENT FAILURE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INVESTIGATION ON THE CAUSES OF PAVEMENT FAILURE", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>PREFACE</p> <p>In structural detailing, the project is initiated by the structural engineer.

A structural project is initiated by the Engineer (civil Engineer).</p> <p>The process of designing begins with the enginer’s appreciation of the client’s requirements. After the specification given to the engineer by architect according to the requirement of the client, the engineer develops different structural schem from the architectural plan and calculated the ultimate bending moment and designed load, which will help him to know te axid C load and neutral axis where the structure is liable to settle and develops sagging or hpgging due to improper use of reinforcement bar. Having considered the use of material and erection methods and then comes up with the final work of full structural analysis and detailed design.</p> <p>Structural detailing can be defined as the process by which the design of a structural system is drafted in a form that a builder can use for construction for easy establishment.</p> <p>Also structural drawings are the principle means by which the designer communicates his requirements in a clean and unambiguois manner to the builder.</p> <p>This project outlines the important components and basic techniques and methods required for structural detailing of a reinforced concrete duplex.</p> <p>The structural drawing is simple to interprete, dimensions are clear. Bar bending schedules showing now the reinforcement bars are to be bend are also provided. This is essential to the quantity survey or cost estimates of the project and to the steel to supply and also to the iron bender to determine the bends dimension.</p> <p>A summary of design specification’s information and structural consideration are provided standard scales and abbreviation are used to ensure the uniforimity. The structural elements, beams, column, slabs, foundations have been detailed and shown in plans, elevations and sections.</p> <p>It is therefore believed that this project will fulfil its requirements and serve its purpose of guiding the reader through the process of basic structural detailing.</p> </div>\n\nSTRUCTURAL DETAILING IN REINFORCED CONCRETE OF A THREE BEDROOM DETACH DUPLEX<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STRUCTURAL DETAILING IN REINFORCED CONCRETE OF A THREE BEDROOM DETACH DUPLEX", "id": 2}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> ABSTRACT <p>            The project covers a view and detailed explanation of the route survey which in chider reconnaissance surrey, theologize traversing and levelling operation as well as soil tests which includes compaction test, mechanical analysis, plastic and liquid limits and CBR test.</p> <p>            The project also covers the design of pavement   and the geometric design of the road way</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENT</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0              INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1       AIM OF THE PROJECT</p> <p>1.2              RECONNAISSANCE SURVEY</p> <p>1.3              FACTORS CONSIDERED IN RECONNAISSANCE SURVEY</p> <p>1.4              GEOMETRIC DESIGN</p> <p>1.5              FACTORS WHICH FAVOUR THE SELECTION OF A ROUTD OR ROAD ALIGNMENT</p> <p>1.6              SCOPE OF THE PROJECT</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>2.0       LEVELLING</p> <p>2.1       EARTH WORK</p> <p>2.2       SECTIONING</p> <p>2.3              LONGITUDINAL SECTIONS</p> <p>2.4              CROSSECTIONS</p> <p>2.5              NEED FOR SECTIONS</p> <p>2.6              THE PURPOSE, USES AND IMPORTANCE OF LEVELCING</p> <p>2.7               INSTRUMENT USED IN LEVELLING</p> <p>2.8              TERMINOLOGUES USED IN LEVELLING</p> <p>2.9              TYPES OF LEVECS</p> <p>2.10          FIELD LEVELLING OPERATION</p> <p>2.11          TABULATION OF LEVELLING RESULTS</p> <p>2.12          EARTH WORK COMPUTATION</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>3.0  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE THEODOLITE</p> <p>3.1  THEODOLITE TRAVERSING</p> <p>3.2  TRAVERSING INSTRUMENTS</p> <p>3.3  FIELD TRAVERSING OPERATION</p> <p>3.4  TRAVERSE PESULT / COMPUTATION</p> <p>CHAPER FOUR</p> <p>4.0              COLLECTION OF SAMPLES</p> <p>4.1       LABORATORY SOIL TEST</p> <p>4.2              TYPES OF LABORATORY TEST TO BE CARRIED OUT</p> <p>4.3              COMPACTION TEST</p> <p>4.4              CALIFORNIA BEARING RAYIO TEST</p> <p>4.5              COMPUTATION OF CBR TEST RESULTS</p> <p>4.6              MECHANICAL ANALYSIS</p> <p>4.7              COMPUTATION OF SCEVE ANALYSIS RESULTS</p> <p>4.8              AYTERBERGE LIMIT TEST</p> <p>4.9              LIQUID LIMIT TEST</p> <p>4.10          PLASTIC LIMIT TEST</p> <p>4.11          PAVEMET DESIGN</p> <p>4.12          RIGD PAVEMENT</p> <p>4.13          FLEXI BLE PAVEMENT</p> <p>4.14          GROUD USDEX METHOD OF MANAGEMENT DESIGN</p> <p>4.15          CBR METHOD OF PAVEMENT DESIGN</p> <p>4.16          DRAINAGE WORKS</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p>5.0              CURVES</p> <p>5.1       SIMPLE CURVES</p> <p>5.2              COMPOUND CURVE</p> <p>5.3              REVERSE CURVES</p> <p>5.4              TRANSITION</p> <p>5.5              FUNCTIONS OF A TRANSITION CURVE</p> <p>5.6              SURPER ELEVATION</p> <p>5.7              CURVE ELEMENT AND FORMULAE</p> <p>5.8              STAGES OF WORK IN ACTUAL ROAD CONSTRUCTIOON EQUIPMENT USED FOR THE ACTURAL ROAD</p> <p>5.9              CONSTRUCTION</p> <p>5.10          RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>5.11          CONCLUSION</p> <p>5.12          BIBLIOGRAPHY</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>The importance of road to a community and its activities cannot be over emphasized. Road is as ole as man and plays a vital role in the movement of people and goods from one state to another. Good road network is one of the basic requirement that enhances the social, political and economic growth of a nation. It is obvious that life would have been very difficult without the existence of roads.</p> <p>Nigeria for instance acknowledged the importance of good road network such that the local, state and federal government are all involved in the provision, development and maintance of roads in the country in other to boost economic aquaculture and commercial activities in the nation</p> <p>History has shown that provision of grod road network is an important tool for civilization. Roads are of optinman benefit to the people in the sense that it brings about industrialization, commercialization in a community and also ease traffic cevgestion and facilitates the movement of agicultural products from the nrel areas to urban centers.</p> <p>            AIM OF THE PROJECT</p> <p>            The aim of the project is to pwide the student with the practical knowledge in the design of a road way with a bid to help the student execute such related project in real practice in tntive</p> <p>            It is also aimed at marrying they with practice and also at during information on the nature and effectiveness of the subgrade material and suggort what should done with the aid of test results to alleriate parement failine</p> <p>            RECONNAISSANCE SURVEY</p> <p>            This is a quick type of survey or rapid examination of the ground and its adjacent natural features usually made without survey instruments to limit the alterate route in terms of cost to one or two</p> <p>FACTORS NORMALLY CONSIDERED IN RECONNAISSANCE SURVEY</p> <p>-          over all cartage of goods</p> <p>-          Nearness to road material quauires</p> <p>-          Traffic conditions</p> <p>-          Soil condtions</p> <p>-          Right of way or road land</p> <p>-          Ruling gradient</p> <p>-          Type of road surface</p> <p>-          Number of major and minmor buildges</p> <p>-          Approximate length and cost</p> <p>-          Curvature along the alignment</p> <p>GEOMETRIC DESIGN</p> <p>This is the aspect of the high way design that is solely meant to take care of the road user and level of service rendered to him. The paramount factor of consideration include; expected traffic design speed and volume. Elaharty E.A. in his book “High way Traffic planning and Engineering states that proper geometric design will inevitably reduce the number and seventy of highway accidents while ensuring high traffic flow with minimum delay. He continued by saying that improper design would result in the early deterioration of the new high way with constant economic loss to the community.</p> <p>            FACTORS, WHICH FAVOUR THE SELECTION OF ROUTE OR ROAD ALIGNMENT</p> <p>            There are a number of factors, which favour the selection of a rounte or toad alignment for constriction and they include;</p> <p>-          The route should be as straight as possible.

Generally the task of maintaining a heating environment through good sanitary disposal or waste has a become increasing difficult in west Africa and  most developing countries of the world. This is due to such factors as population explanation rapid urbanization, industrialization increased use prepared (package products, changing lifestyle towards out door recreation etc (WAHEB) 1999. a close study of solid waste management has clearly shown that these factors have generated corresponding problems such as  blocked gutters and drainage channels, traffic congestions. overcrowdings, over flooding air pollution and even ineffective refuse management, poor refuse management in out cities has been as associated with other  problems  such as sporadic fireboat breaks, spread of  diseases and distortion of aesthetic value of our environment (Lucas and Giles1990).</p> <p>            Varies types waste are generated in Enugu, namely solid waste, liquid waste (sewage ad industrial waste (chemical fluent).</p> <p>            This study is concerned with solid waste which comprises refuse from homes offices and market places. Enugu from its statue as the state capital ,has now become an international commercial center with the recent development in the state (ie the new international center which attracts larger influx of residents and tourists.</p> <p>            Various attempts have been put in place by the state and local government in the past to enforce refuse management scheme. These effort failed because of poor implementation of these lifting policies the problem of refuse management has assumed a social problem in Enugu, today especially as the Enugu state environment sanitation agency (ENSEPA) appears in capable of handling the task and members of the public appear ignorant and  not ready to co-operate with the authority in keeping Enugu clean like in other cities in Nigeria, the problems of refuse management in Enugu metropolis have defied realistic refuse management solution. This poses gave concern to well meaning citizen of the state</p> <p>1.2 STATEMENTS OF PROBLEMS</p> <p>            The one- time held historical and cultural reputation the Enugu city was the cleanest city in Nigeria is fast fading away. in its place great Pyramids of  refuse are found at every junction and street corner begging for removal despite of public out cry, public enlightenment programmes on personal hygiene and environmental health. The refuse heaps blocks the gutters and drain, obstruct traffic flow,, pollute the air encourage instead and trident breeding and the spread of  disease.</p> <p>            The National sanitation exercise which was introduce  by the head of state General Mohammed Buhari (1984) had then help to check indiscrimate differing of refuse along the streets, but today the story is different since the assumption of chief Olusugn Obasnjo as the president of Nigeria he put an end to it.</p> <p>            Even with the  introduction of monthly environmental sanitation any the state government it is still unable to meet the standard.</p> <p>            Refuse was formally collected from house  to house and transferred into a open van. but today the ones that are  still use are put in smaller vehicles and not properly covered, as the vehicle moves on almost all of it spill on the street.</p> <p>            In view of all the above problem of refuse manager in Enugu metropolis, appear enormous with the local government inadequately positive to tackle it.</p> <p>            It is the focus of this research project to come up with findings and possible solution to the problem  refuse management in Enugu metropolis.</p> <p>1.3              OBJECTIVE OF STUDY</p> <p>The general objective of this study is to critically examine the refuse management problems in Engu metropolis in terms of patterns, storage and final disposal with a view to findings solution to Len.</p> <p>The specific objectives, however include</p> <p>1.                  To identify the various methods of refuse management applied in Enugu metropolis</p> <p>2.                  To asses the effectiveness or adequacy of the existing system of refuse management in Enugu metropolis</p> <p>3.                  To  identify eh specific problems associated with refuse management</p> <p>1.4              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The study is significant to the extent that the findings will ascertain the problems arising from effective and inadequate refuse management  and its implication on public health, the study is also important as it findings will beneficial to the state and local government public health sector in their planning of refuse management programs.</p> <p>1.5              DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>For purpose of under standing of this study definition of certain terms as are applicable to this study will be advance.</p> <p>1.                  REFUSE: These consists of heterogeneous mass of deposited waste particle from the house hold, office, market places etc as well as homogenous accumulation of agricultural industrial and mineral waste. it therefore include all participle and non-particle solid waste with the exception of bar waste (exceeta) (Wahab 1991).</p> <p>2.                  MANAGEMENT: As a process by which responsible persons in an organization (managers or executives at all  levels of management) combine resources (men.

Permeability is an important engineering property, which governs the rate of flow of aquifer. Hence, permeability in its simplest term is the ease with which water can flow through soil.</p> <p>1.1.2.         Sewage effluent</p> <p>Sewage is the wastewater of a community consisting of human excreta, urine and sullage. Solid forms a very small percentage (0.1%) of fresh sewage. Sewage may contain pathogenic organisms, organics and nutrients. Hence, sewage must be treated before discharge in order to prevent pollution of surface and underground water source. Sewage exerts biological oxygen demand in rivers, which depletes oxygen. Besides, being rich in nutrients (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus), sewage causes in receiving water algal bloom and autrophication. Generally, supplying it with oxygen treats wastewater, so that bacteria may utilize the waste as food.</p> <p>1.1.3.         Compaction:</p> <p>Compaction means processing the soil particle close to each other by mechanical methods. Air during compaction, is expelled from the void space in the soil mass and, therefore, the mass density is increased. Compaction of soil mass is done to improve its engineering properties. Compaction generally increases the shear strength of the soil, and hence the stability and bearing capacity. It is also useful in reducing the compressibility and permeability of the soil.</p> <p>Compaction of soil is required for the construction of earth damage canal embankments, highways, runaway, and in many other engineering applications.</p> <p>1.1.4.                   Failure:</p> <p>Dense sand shows initially a volume decrease in a drained test, but as the strain increases, the volume starts increasing. The loose sand shows a volume decrease throughout.</p> <p>In case of loose sand, the specimen bulges and ultimately fails by sliding simultaneously on numerous planes. The failure in this case is known as brittle failure.</p> <p>1.2    Aims and objectives </p> <p>Most ancient structures collapse, mainly due to lack of knowledge on permeability. Properties such as permeability help an engineer, to determine the suitability of soil for some engineering works.</p> <p>Hence, modern civil engineering works allows for site investigation, which includes the determination of the permeability relative to the soil which would be used for the work.</p> <p>The main aims of this research are.</p> <p>·         To determine the maximum dry density (MDD) of soil, thus increasing its shear strength and bearing capacity.</p> <p>·         To determine the rate of seepage of water through a given soil sample.</p> <p>·         To determine how permeability of soil is affected by sewage effluent of different levels of pollutal strength.</p> <p>1.3 Scope of the research</p> <p> This research will be carried out using soil sample, collected by digging one meter below the ground level, from a farm land located nearby the junior staff quarters. The sewage effluent will be   collected from the university of Nigeria treatment tank, by varying the quantity of sewage used. </p> </div>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF SEWAGE EFFLUENT ON THE PERMEABILITY OF SOIL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF SEWAGE EFFLUENT ON THE PERMEABILITY OF SOIL", "id": 5}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>            This case study is “comparing the strength of blocks made from: cement stabilized laterite blocks, cement stabilized red earth blocks and sand,  red earth and laterite blocks and mud blocks dried in the kiln.</p> <p>            This project implement the following analysis</p> <p>(1)               To  effect  reduction to the  rise in market price of sand (fine aggregate), cement blocks to substitute literate blocks.</p> <p>(2)               To determine the strength of the cement stabilized blocks of literate soil in the soil laboratory with a view to have an alternative in the building industry.</p> <p>(3)               To analyse the existing laterite soil and evaluate it’s suitability for use as a good building material by means of various tests.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>PROJECT BUILDING MATERIALS</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>PREPARATION OF MATERIALS</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>PREPARATION OF CUBE</p> <p>CASTING OF THE STABILIZED MATERIALS</p> <p>CURING OF SPECIMENS</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>FIRING OF BLOCKS IN KILN</p> <p>TESTING OF BLOCKS</p> <p>COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH TEST</p> <p>CALCULATION OF RESULTS</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p>DISCUSSION OF RESULT</p> <p>COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH TABLE WITHT EH CMENT MORTAR BLOCKS</p> <p>CHAPTER SIX</p> <p>RECOMMENDATION</p> <p>CONCLUSION</p> <p>REFERENCES</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>            This project was obligated to present in o n e volume of the fundamental and practical information in the field of comparing the strength of blocks made from: cement and lateritec soil, cement and red earth and sand, red earth and lateritic soil and mud blocks fired in the kiln which may be useful to people involved in civil and structural engineering and particularly those that found pleasure in the design and construction of buildings, bridges and culverts and related structures.</p> <p>            Due to high cost of sand in the market, the comparative analysis of stabilized laterite blocks, red earth blocks and sand blocks have revealed t hat one can definitely substitute the stabilized laterite blocks and mud blocks in place of sand blocks to reduce the cost of the entire building or used stabilized laterite blocks where there are no sand in such an area where the work is going to be sited.  A great have been done throughout this work, although it is limited in scope to assess their suitability as standard concrete aggregates.</p> <p>THE PROJECT BUILDING MATERIALS</p> <p>            To obtain the materials used for these project such as red earth, laterite, sharp sand, and cement, we had to move to the outskirts of Enugu State.  Cement was bought from the famous Keyatta market in Enugu.  The market is well known for the sales of building materials in the state.  Cement was added to the mixture during mixing, to give the mixture a good binding when in shape and also increases the strength of the blocks.  The brand of cement used was ROCK CEMENT.</p> <p>            The red earth material known as mud was obtained at 9th mile corner in Ngwo, at the outskirts of Enugu.  It was dug from a depth, to make sure that it has not been mixed with foreign or any other material.

Wash – basins, water closets and sinks together with rain and discharges into public sewers, septic tanks, soakaways or cesspools.</p> <p>The construction of drain is therefore principally concerned of the Manson. It is accomplished by constructing the road so that it has a crown and by sloping the shoulders and adjacent areas so as to control the flow of water either towards existing natural drainage, such as open ditches, or into a storm drainage system of catch basin and underground pipes. If a storm drainage system is used as it would be with city streets, the design Engineer must give consideration to the total area drainage unto the street, the maximum rate of run-off expected, the duration of the design storm, the amount of ponding allowable at each catchments area and the proposed spacing of catch basin along the street. From this information the desired capacity of the individual catch basin and the size of the underground piping network are calculated.</p> <p>In designing facilities to carry run-offs from pavements, the Engineers must determine the area to be drained, the maximum probable precipitation over the drainage basin, the highest expected run-off rate, and then using this information must calculate the required capacity of the drainage structure.</p> <p>Generally designs are made adequate to accommodate not only the largest flow ever recorded for that may be expected under the most adverse conditions for a given number of years.</p> <p>Factors considered in calculating the expected flow through a culvert opening include the size, length and shape of the entrance and down stream end of the conduit, the maximum allowable height of water at the entrance, and the water level at the outlet.</p> <p>There is a trend to use designs that permit drainage structure yard. Such procedures permit better control of the work. For example with recast concrete pipe section, it is often possible to avoid building small box culverts in the field. Circular culverts of large diameter are now also constructed in the same way.</p> <p>1.1       IMPORTANCE OF WATER DRAINAGE</p> <p>Water drainage as an elemental part of Civil Engineering Construction plays an importance role which makes it very significant when it comes to the act of practicing maintenance culture.</p> <p>To this end in every construction process, drainage should be given due consideration. In residential buildings, water drainage system is very importance so as to get rid of waste water and storm water from the building and thereby preventing the building from excessive dampness and by so doing providing good maintenance for the building.</p> <p>Aside the fact that drainage system in residential building prevents excessive dampness, it also prevents excessive flooding.</p> <p>Another area in construction where drainage system can highly be appreciated is road and embankment construction. In road construction, water drainage are primarily designed to prevent excessive flooding of the paved surface thereby preventing wearing away of the surface and also make it more accessible during and after storm.</p> <p>In the light of all these significant roles played by water drainage system, necessity has made it mandatory for any existing structure or proposed structure to have a water drainage system.</p> <p>Resolving a water drainage system involves a lot of activities especially where the water drainage is to control excessive flooding or where it is to be designed for water logged area. The designing water drainage system there is need to anticipate the position of future structure erections so as not to hinder the aesthetic nature of future construction process.</p> <p>Another importance fact is that for good effective water drainage system to be developed, there is need to construct a filter along the drainage channels because of the retention capacity of the soil within the campus area. The soil consist mostly later tic clay which has the ability to retain water for a long period of time. As this will be detrimental to the life span of the water drainage channel to be constructed, it is that masonry lining for the water drainage channels be constructed also. </p> <p>1.2              OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The objectives of the study work shall cover all the vital aspect of the drainage problems system. The first stage of this project work shall include the reconnaissance survey of the area covered by the campus, nothing the land scope and modal points ways, the effects of flood and erosion more prevalent, the catchments area and tributaries of the storms water that constitute the major part of the erosion and flood because it is quite noticeable that during the raining seasons that most of the road leading to campus and within the campus becomes in-accessible for motorists and part of the building, lecture rooms are highly flooded.</p> <p>The next is to found out which type of the drainage system exists and the orientation, direction of the drainage channel.</p> <p>Another objective where the study is going to lover is the type of hydraulic drainage design, the study shall also highlight the serviceability and cost effectiveness of the method adopted that is to say whether the design is made of press-stressed concrete or in-site concrete.</p> <p>On the reasonable part of it, this study shall highlight more on the solution to this water drainage problems</p> </div>\n\nTHE WATER DRAINAGE PROBLEMS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\"

because their appear to be a level of ignorance surrounding their existing properties and implications. This project was conceived for the purpose of comparing the crushed aggregate deposits in Isi-Agu Abia State and mac-Daniels Abakiliki. One sample each were obtained from different location mentioned above and transported to ministry of works laboratory Enugu, Enugu State. These two aggregate samples were tested for sieve analysis test, relative density test, water absorption test,  ten percent fine test, aggregate crushing value test (ACV), Aggregate impact value test (AIV), and Abrasion value test. Findings revealed that the best aggregate for road construction is the aggregate from Isi-Agu. It also revealed that the standard strength for Abrasion is between 20 – 30 percent comparison were made between the results, precautions, procedures and observations. And this coarse aggregate should be tested and analyzed before using in any constructional purposes to ensure durability of engineering products.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The basic thing in investigation into the quality of aggregate in road construction is that aggregates serves as reinforcement to add strength to the overall composite material. Due to the relatively high hydraulic conductivity value as compared to most soils, aggregates are widely used in drainage application such as foundation and French drains, septic drain fields, retaining wall drains and road side edge drains. Also the quality of aggregates helps to prevent differential setting under the road that binds with more expensive asphalt. Furthermore, aggregates feature at all levels of road construction up to the surface which includes aggregates resistant to polishing, ensuring skid resistance. The quality plan or system should cover all quality aspect of source material handling aggregate processing, stockpiling and transportation including methods and frequency of sampling and testing to be used, and should also identify key responsibilities.</p> <p><strong>1.6      </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It involves the analysis of the quality of Aggregates used in road construction in respect to its strength, properties of aggregates and application of aggregates in construction field. Also it explained why Aggregates can be defined as Natural aggregates, manufactured aggregates and Recycled aggregates. It reveals the difference between primary aggregates and secondary aggregates during the study. This study examines the practical uses and laboratory testing of the aggregates using different methods and the problem arising during the research. Also recommendation for developing and implementing a quality plan or system are covered during the research.</p> <p><strong>1.7      </strong><strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>THE GENERAL AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY IS AS FOLLOWS</strong></p> <p>1.  To identify the key factors affecting the strength of aggregate structure which are aggregate shape, angularity and texture?</p> <p>2.  To ensure that the specifications for aggregates angularity are included in the super pave mixture design system.</p> <p>3.  To obtain a material sufficiently durable to last the design life of the road in order that its performance is not affected by deterioration or degradation of the material.</p> <p>4.  To determine the aggregate abrasion resistance and breakdown of particles and tests that address aggregate weathering when exposed to freezing and thawing.</p> <p>5.  To determine the different properties of aggregates</p> <p>6.  To examine the different quality plan or system to controlling the sources of aggregate</p> <p><strong>1.8      </strong><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It covers the systems and procedures recommended by Roading New Zealand (RNZ) for the quality assurance of aggregates for roads. The guideline was developed by quality Association of New Zealand. It reveals that the aggregate producer should have a formal quality plan system in operation in each quarry detailing the quality control producers to be used for sourcing rock and for controlling quality of each of the aggregate produced. Also the quality plan or system should cover all quality aspects of source material handling aggregate processing, stock pilling and transportation, including methods and frequency of sampling of sampling and testing to be used.</p>\n\nAN INVESTIGATION INTO QUALITY OF AGGREGATE IN ROAD CONSTRUCTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN INVESTIGATION INTO QUALITY OF AGGREGATE IN ROAD CONSTRUCTION", "id": 10}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p> <p>This project, aimed at investigating the anaerobic processes in septic tank as a waste water treatment option using waste water from septic tank and Soakaway as sample A and B respectively. It was observed that after the  analysis, sample A (septic tank which has fresh waste water) has higher value in conductivity =1708us/ cm3, Total slid = 17490mg/l, Dissolved solid (16420mg/l), COD = (106mg/l), DO = (0.6883mg/l) and BOD = (106.6883mg/l) compared to sample B (Soakaway which contains waste water that has under gone anaerobic treatment) with values in conductivity =1170us/cm3, total solid = 14870mg/l dissolved solid = 12310mg/l COD = 68mg/l BOD = 68.4917mg/l. This is presented table 4.1. This indicates that there are more contaminant is septic tank than in the soakoway which has under gone anaerobic waste water treatment. From this present study, it was observed that septic tank is a rehable waste water treatment plant. </p> <p> <strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong> <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong> <strong>1.1   Background of the Study</strong> </p> <p>Human waste or more technically referred to as ‘excreta’ is defined by Chamber’s Concise 20th Century Dictionary as “useless matter discharged by animal alimentary”, animals being humans in this context. Excreta is made up of a solid matter, feces, and a liquid matter, urine and is essentially an organic compound. The constituents making up the compound are carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulphur and hydrogen. Also present are fats, carbohydrates, enzymes, proteins, trace elements, pathogens and many different bacteria.</p> <p>Sewage is a type of wastewater that comprises domestic wastewater and is therefore contaminated with feces or urine from people's toilets, but the word sewage is also used to mean any type of waste water.Sewage is the physical infrastructure, including pipes, pumps, and screens, channels etc. used to convey sewage from its origin to the point of eventual treatment or disposal. Wastewater can come from (indicates likely inclusions or contaminants)</p> <p>·           Human waste (feces, used toilet paper, urine or other bodily fluids) also known as black water usually from lavatories.</p> <p>•            Cesspit leakage</p> <p>•            Septic tank discharge</p> <p>•            Sewage treatment plant discharge</p> <p>•            Wasting water (personal, clothes, floors, dishes etc) also known as greywater or sludge.</p> <p>•            The home Rainfall   collected   on   roofs,   yards,   hard-sandugsetc (generally clean with traces of oils and fuel).   </p> <p>•            A Groundwater infiltrated into sewage.</p> <p>•            Industrial waste.</p> <p>•            Toxic waste (metal plating, cyanide production, pesticide manufacturing; etc)</p> <p>The composition of wastewater varies widely. This is a partial list of what it may contain.</p> <p>·        Water  (more than 95  percent),  which is  often  added during flushing to carry waste down a drain</p> <p>·        Pathogens    such   as   bacteria,   viruses,   proteins   and parasitic worms.</p> <p>·        Non pathogenic bacteria.</p> <p>·        Organic   particles   such   as   feces,   hairs, food, vomit, paper, fibers, plant materials, humans etc,</p> <p>·        Inorganic particles such as sand, grit, metal particles, ceramics, etc.</p> <p>·        Gases    such    as   hydrogen    sulfide,    carbon    dioxide, methane etc.</p> <p>·        Pharmaceuticals  and  hormones </p><p> <strong>1.1.2        Waste Water Quality Indicators</strong> </p> <p>Anti-oxidizable material present in a natural waterway or in an industrial wastewater will be oxidized both by biochemical (bacterial) or chemical processes. The result is that the oxygen content of the water will be decreased. Basically, the reaction for biochemical oxidation may be written as.</p> <p>Oxidizable material + bacteria +nutrient + O    CO2 +H20 +</p> <p>Oxidized   inorganic   such   as   NO3   or   SO2.</p> <p>Oxygen consumption by reducing chemicals such as sulfides and nitrites is typified as follows:</p> <p>S2 + 202           SO42-</p> <p>NO2- + I/202        NO3-</p> <p>Since all natural waterways contain bacteria and nutrients, almost any waste compounds introduced into such waterways will initiate biochemical reactions (such as shown above).</p> <p>Those biochemical reactions create what is measured in the laboratory as the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Such chemicals are also liable to be broken down using strong oxidizing agents and these chemical reactions create what is measured in the laboratory as the chemical oxygen demand (COD). Both the BOD and, COD tests are a measure of the relative oxygen-depletion effect of a waste contaminant. Both have been widely adopted as a measure of pollution effect.</p> <p>The BOD test measures the oxygen demand of biodegradable pollutants whereas the COD test measures the oxygen demand of oxidizable  pollutants.</p> <p>Wastewater treatments are numerous processes that can be used to clean up wastewaters depending on the type and extent of contamination. Wastewater can be treated in wastewater treatment plants which include. Physical, chemical and biological treatment processes. Municipal wastewater is treated in sewage treatment plant (which may also be referred to as wastewater treatment plant), Agricultural wastewater may be treated in agricultural wastewater treatment processes, whereas industrial wastewater is treated in industrial wastewater   treatment processes.</p> <p>Treated wastewater can be reused as drinking water in industry (cooling towers), in artificial recharge of aquifers, in agriculture and in the rehabilitation of natural ecosystems (for example in Florida's everglades).</p> <p>There are numerous benefits of using recycled water for irrigation, including the low cost when compared to other-sources, particularly in an urban area, consistency of supply (regardless of season, climatic conditions and associated, water restrictions) and general consistency of quality. Irrigation of recycled wastewater is also considered as a means for plant   fertilization and particularly nutrients supplementation.

To this end, several research tools including questionnaires, pilot scale study and model formulation were employed. Questionnaires were used to conduct a preliminary study with a view to ascertaining people‟s perception with regard to septic tank design, use and maintenance. This preliminary study revealed that the septic tank is a poorly designed and grossly overlooked but indispensable waste management facility. Pilot scale studies were conducted to monitor physicochemical and microbial parameters. A sludge accumulation model was formulated from first principles by applying material balance to a model septic tank. The model was calibrated using data from three different septic tank audits spanning 3 years, 5 years and 8 years respectively and involving over 1000 septic tanks. A correlation coefficient of R = 0.98 was obtained between measured and calculated sludge accumulation data. The sludge accumulation model showed that sludge does not accumulate at a constant rate as is usually assumed but rather at a reduced rate over time. The sludge accumulation model was compared with two existing but purely empirical models namely: Weibel‟s model derived in 1955 for the US Public Health Service and Bound‟s (1995) model. Finally a rational approach to septic tank design was developed. Design charts and a Microsoft Excel based design programme were produced to aid the unlearned designer and the computer literate designer respectively.</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The septic tank system is the most widely used onsite treatment system for domestic wastewater. In fact, most developing countries (Nigeria inclusive) lack the technology and economic power to construct and operate sewerage systems for conveyance of domestic wastewater to central sewage treatment facilities, so a greater population rely on the septic tank system for sewage treatment. It is an enclosed receptacle designed to collect wastewater, segregate settleable and floatable solids (sludge and scum), accumulate, consolidate and store solids, digest organic matter and discharge treated effluent (Bounds, 1997). In the United States only, over 50 million people use the septic system (Collick et al., 2006). According to Fidelia (2004, in Burubai et al., 2007), over 46% of the Nigerian population use the septic tank system. The septic tank system was once thought to be a temporary solution to domestic wastewater treatment and disposal. This was true until 1997 when the United States Environmental Protection Agency and Congress officially recognized the system as a sustainable, long-term solution for treating wastewater.</p> <p><strong>The septic tank</strong> is an anaerobic reactor due to the insufficiency of oxygen concentration to act as electron acceptor. The wastewater is degraded by micro-organisms aerobically while the C, CO2 SO4 act as electron acceptors to form CO2, H2, CH4 and S2- (sulphides). At the same time, most of the organic N is converted to NH+4 (inorganic). The effluent flows into the drain field where aerobic degradation occurs due to abundance of oxygen in the unsaturated soil layer. The C in the wastewater is now oxidized to CO2 while NH4+ is oxidized to NO2- thus raising the nitrate level of the sewage to about seven times the limit acceptable for dumping water (10mg/l). The H+ released from the oxidation of NH4+ now reduces the pH of the effluent.</p>\n\nIMPROVING SEPTIC TANK PERFORMANCE BY A NEW RATIONAL DESIGN APPROACH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPROVING SEPTIC TANK PERFORMANCE BY A NEW RATIONAL DESIGN APPROACH", "id": 13}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>A significant revolution with computers’ usage in civil engineering business and construction process has been presented.

Then it is necessary to have standard environmental sanitation. Next to air terms of importance is water. Water is a basic necessity to man existence and environmental sanitation condition.</div> <div>          One does not necessarily has to be a philosopher to agree with the view that the environment play a major role on mans health bearing in mind that apart from the direct effect the physical environment has on health, the type of diseases found in an area have a direct relationship with the nature of the physical environment thus mans environment has to be properly sanitized.</div> <div>          It can therefore be said that next to air, water is very important to man existence. According to a great philosopher PRINDER in the century B.C he said “ water is the best of all things” this could perhaps be an overstatement but it is an undisputed fact that man relies on it.</div> <div>Apart from mans day to day activities and demand for water drinking, cooking and general sanitation purposes, water is also useful in regards and respect to irrigation, power generation (Kanji dam) industrial (Breweries etc) and recreational facilities (water foundations).</div> <div>          In Africa in general in regards to settlement portable water is not readily available to the people. 80% as estimated have no access to portable water which is especially more dominant in the rural areas due to in adequate planning. Due to this there is a great demand for portable water supply in the rural community.</div> <div>          Thus therefore brings forth the concept to design mini-water schemes for rural communities. The provision of economical and adequate increased water supply is particularly acute in rural communities. Therefore portable water to the rural population is undoubtedly a major benefit of water development. It immediately reduces the health hazards significantly and further contributes to the major directs and indirect benefits i.e it will have a spoil over effect on the other associated problems, that are associated with health in any community which is fortunately the form of attention of the present day government and the aim of this project.</div> <div>          Hence the fundamental question that should be asked is not whether there should be water development but rather how do we meet the basic human needs and aspirations of the consumers without simultaneously destroying the resources base?</div> <div>          The require the conception, planning design construction and operation of facilities to control and utilize water in other to achieve an economical and cost effective system which should be such that would meet the requirement of many other rural areas throughout the country with only slight.</div> <div>          Modification and upgrading. Although it is basically the function of civil engineers but the service of specialist from other fields are required and water resources problems are also the concern of economists, scientist, geologist and others.</div> <div>          It should be noted that a project this nature will meet ones immediate needs in this country and making the dream of “ HEALTH FOR ALL BY THE YEAR 2020” a reality and improved of portable water for consumption in adequate quantity.</div> <div>          A typical water supply scheme consists of obtaining natural sources of water supply and treating to purify the water and also eventually to the premises</div> <div>          A conventional water works comprises of the following:</div> <div>       i.            Collection works</div> <div>     ii.            Purification or treatment works</div> <div>  iii.            Transmission works</div> <div>  iv.            Distribution works</div> <div>The treatment works converts raw and usually contaminated surface water regardless of water quality. Effluents of desired safty, clarify and chemical composition can produced by suitable treatment methods into clean and safe drinking water which would meet the world health organization standard. For drinking water.</div> <div>          The treatment plant comprises of treatment with chemicals mixing coagulation, fluctuation, settlement, filtration and sterilization. Because the surface water contains suspended and dissolved impurities and is generally contaminated. It should be properly treated before it can be supplied to the community.</div> <div><strong>1.2     HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE</strong></div> <div>          The cycle movement of water from the sea to the atmosphere is hence by precipitation to the earth and is collected in streams and runs back to the sea. The cycle may short circuit at several stances like for example, the precipitation may fall directly or river courses.</div> <div>Water from the sea evaporates under solar radiation, clouds of water vapour more over land areas; precipitation occurs as show, hail and rain over the land and water begins to flow back to the sea. Some of the water infiltrates into saturated ground zone beneath the water table water which infiltrates feeds surfaces plants life and some sets drain up into this vegetable where transpiration takes place from leaf, plant surfaces. The remaining water evaporates partially water runoffs into the river channels.</div>\n\nWATER TREATMENT PLANT MODEL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " WATER TREATMENT PLANT MODEL", "id": 15}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The Reliability Analysis of a Prestressed Concrete Beam (PCB) was presented using First Order Reliability Method and Eurocode 2 procedures to carry out the analysis. The results show that the safety of the PCBin bending decreasedfrom 2.9 to 1.0 and 3.1 to 2.6 as prestress force and the depth from the extreme compressive fiber to the neutral axis of the beam increased from 20kN to 100kN and 150mm to 350mm respectively, therefore the PCB is safer at low prestress force and depth to the bottom layer of the beam. The safety of the PCB increased from 1.52 to 2.5, 1.52 to 2.5 and 0.1 to 2.0 respectively as depth to the neutral axis, area of the compressive reinforcement and eccentricity increased from 150mm to 350mm, 800mm2 to 1200mm2 and 100mm to 300mm respectively. The safety of the prestressed concrete beam remained constant at 0.1 with eccentricity of 100mm, 0.8 with eccentricity of 150mm, 1.3 with eccentricity of 200mm, 1.7 with eccentricity of 250mm and 1.95 with eccentricity of 300mmas effective widths and load ratios of the beam increased from 100mm to 300mm and 0.2 to 1.0 respectively in shear. Increase in dead load and span resulted to a corresponding increase in the safety of the beam in deflection. The best value of eccentricity for a reliable prestressed beam is within the range of 200mm to 300mm. It was also observed that the variation of depth to the bottom layer and prestressing force of the prestressed beam in bending are at equilibrium at 60kN and the safety index is 1.83. Also, the target safety indices considering bending, shear and deflection failure criteria of the prestressed beam were obtained to be 2.01, 1.526 and 4.716 respectively.</p> <p>20</p> <p> <strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong> <strong>PREAMBLE</strong></p> <p>Prestressed concrete beam is one of the most widely used construction element in bridge projects around the world. It has rent itself to an enormous array of structural applications, including buildings, bridges, nuclear power vessels, Television towers and offshore drilling platform (Antonie,2004).</p> <p>Prestressing involves inducing compressive stresses in the zone which will tend to become tensile under external loads. Thesecompressive stresses neutralize the tensile stresses so that no resultant tension exists (or in only very small values). Cracking is therefore eliminated under working load and all of the concrete may be assumed effective in carrying load. Therefore lighter sections may be used to carry a given bending moment and over much longer spans than reinforced concrete.</p> <p>The prestressing force also reduces the magnitude of principal tensile stress in the web so that thin webbed I sections may be used without the risk of diagonal tension failures and with further savings in self weight.</p> <p>21</p> <p>The prestressing force has to be produced by high tensile steel and it is necessary to use high quality concrete to resist the higher compressive stresses that are developed(Mosley and Bungey, 2002).</p> <p>In the design and construction of the prestressed concrete, there are many sources of uncertainties which are put into consideration during the construction in order for the structure to serve its intended purpose. Consequently, structures must be designed to serve their functions with a finite probability of failure (Nowak and Colins, 2002).</p> <p>In order to treat these uncertainties in the construction processes of the prestressed concrete, reliability analysis comes into play. Reliability is the probability that the structure will perform its required function without failure under a specified limit state during a specified reference period (Thoft-Christensen and Baker, 1982). The probability of structural failure from all possible causes is inevitable. However, the uncertainties and their significance on the structural safety and performance can be analyzed systematically only through methods of probability.</p> <p>The development of structural reliability methods during the last three to four decades have provided a more rational basis for the design of structures in the sense that the method facilitate a consistent basis of comparison between</p> <p>22</p> <p>the reliability of a well-tested structural design and the reliability of new types of structures. For this reason the methods of structural reliability have been applied increasingly in connection with the development of new design codes (Sorenson et,al., 2002). In recent years design codes have been continuously revised to include limit states based on probabilistic methods. In fact the limit state design approach has been used nearly in all the recent advances in codified design (Ellingwood, 1996). The use of structural reliability methods for design can lead to structures that have a more consistent level of risk (Zimmerman et, al., 1992). Therefore, to account for the system effect in structural assessment and design, the safety importance of structural members must be quantified (Gharaibeh, et, al., 2001)</p> <p><strong>1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT AND JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The way in which civil engineering systems fail, the occurrence and frequency of failure, its economics and social consequences, demonstrate considerable differences between hypothetical and actual systems. Induced loading, site characterization, material properties, developed formulations and procedures and adequacy of predicted sizes and shapes of the system and its elements are far from certain. All these factors are subject to complex inter relationships, materials defects, structural deficiencies, human errors and hence to varying degrees of randomness. Reliability analysis of structures is required</p> <p>23</p> <p>as a result of these problems. Failure of a system is assessed by its inability to perform its intended function adequately on demand for a period of time and under specified condition, while its antithesis, the measure of success, is called reliability (Milton 1987).</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong> <strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p><strong>1.3.1 Aim</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research is to carry out a reliability analysisof a prestressed concrete beam using First Order Reliability Method (FORM) and Eurocode 2 (2004) design procedure.</p> <p><strong>1.3.2 Objectives</strong></p> <p>The objectives of this research are to:</p> <ul><li> <p>identify the various modes of failure due to ultimate limit state of a prestressed concrete beam.</p> </li> </ul> <ul><li> <p>compute the probabilities of failure associated with the various modes of failure of theprestressed concrete beam.</p> </li> </ul> <ul><li> <p>determine the implied safety indices related to the probabilities of failure.</p> </li> </ul> <ul><li> <p>compute the mean safety index for each mode of failure.</p> </li> </ul> <ul><li> <p>establish a target safety indices associated with the modes of failure of the Prestressed concrete beam.</p> </li> </ul> <p>24</p> <ul><li> <p> design a typical Prestressed concrete beam to meet a target safety level.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>1.4 SCOPE OF RESEARCH</strong></p> <p>The scope of this research was limited to the reliability analysis of a simply supported Prestressed concrete beam in accordance with the recommendation of Eurocode 2 (2004).</p>\n\nRELIABILITY ANALYSIS OF A PRESTRESSED CONCRETE BEAM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RELIABILITY ANALYSIS OF A PRESTRESSED CONCRETE BEAM", "id": 16}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>The quest for economy in asphalt production using locally available materials necessitated this research which is aimed at evaluating the suitability of Saw Dust Ash (SDA) as mineral filler in asphalt mixture.Chemical analysis, sieve analysis, specific gravity and plasticity index tests were performed on SDA. Asphalt briquettes prepared using Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) without saw dust as filler serve as the control. SDA was used to replace the Portland cement at 0% to 100% at an interval of 10% by weight. Marshall Test was conducted on all briquettes produced with SDA and OPC. Results of tests show that increase in SDA resulted in reduction in the value of bulk density. It was also observed that the total voids in the mix increased with SDA content, while the values of stability and flow decreased with SDA. The optimum bitumen content of 6.0% was used to prepare specimens. The flow value of asphalt decreased from 2.0mm when only the cement was used as filler to 1.0mm when the cement was completely replaced with 100% SDA. Voids in mineral aggregate increased from 18.28% when 100 % cement was used as filler to 26.32% when cement was completely replaced with SDA. Based on results of tests, the use of cement partially replaced with 10% SDA at 6% bitumen content is recommended for use in asphalt production.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>Preamble</strong></div> <div>Continuous generation of wastes arising from industrial by-products and agricultural residue, create acute environmental problems both in terms of their treatment and disposal. The construction industry has been identified as one of the areas where the waste can be absorbed, with the majority of such materials used as filler in concrete (Antihos <em>et al.,</em> 2005). If these fillers have pozzolanic properties, they impart technical advantages to the resulting concrete and also enable larger quantities of cement replacement to be achieved (Hossain, 2003). Approximate utilization of these materials brings ecological and economic benefits. Waste material recycling into useful products has been the current method of solving waste problems (Ahmed, 2006). Material recycling has been a common practice for most of human history with record as far back as Plato in 400 BC (Grosse, 2010). Recycling is a process to change waste materials into new products to prevent hazards associated with waste, reduces the consumption of fresh raw materials, and it also reduces greenhouse gas emissions arising from the conventional method of disposing such wastes (Grosse, 2010).</div>\n\nEVALUATION OF SAW DUST ASH AS MINERAL FILLER IN ASPHALT MIXTURE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EVALUATION OF SAW DUST ASH AS MINERAL FILLER IN ASPHALT MIXTURE", "id": 17}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>The concept of public participation and how it can be incorporated in transport planning was studied.

Data were collected and processed via the following: questionnaires, discussions, and interviews with the local communities. Community Masterplans were developed with GIS coordinates in Google Earth maps with precision and accuracy. Accessibility database was developed for the studied communities, using MYSQL, a computer program that manages database. A number of queries were performed which included trip frequency of females in Turunku, and the number of male travelers in Wusono with a modal option of bicycles, e.t.c. Additional accessibility indicators were determined, for example 150,600 for access to portable water supply and for other facilities like Healthcare Centers, Local Govt. Offices, e.t.c. Prioritization instructions were also updated in the community master plan. The study concluded by recommending the use of Participatory Approach to Transport Planning, and to diligently follow the necessary steps to achieve a proper and cost effective rural accessibility through participatory approach.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div>1.1 <strong>Background</strong></div> <div>Planning, design and construction of rural roads espeacially in the region of reference in this study is based on traditional methods mainly determined by the client and often dictated by eventualities and circumstances of funding. The appraisal process is normally based on cost-benefit analysis in some cases where international agencies and bodies like the World Bank are involved, while in others it is based on political and social considerations. However, there exist some associated problems with the current methods of planning, design and construction of rural roads, which include public acceptance, prioritization, funding/cash flow issues, resource allocation and maintenance to mention but a few. According to Riverson, et.al. (2001) rural roads investment has generally not received the correct emphasis in overall planning efforts. Resource allocation for instance, has usually been subject to ad-hoc decisions with lack of continuity, and fragmentation through separate projects. Designs often deviate from standards partly due to land availability issues and the level of priority given to such class of roads. On the other hand, construction is faced with poor workmanship by in-experienced contractors, lack of proper supervision and quality assurance programs among many other issues.</div> <div>Rural roads are the tertiary road system which provides access to villages and farm lands from the main roads and various centers of activities. In developing countries like Nigeria, rural roads are termed as roads passing through rural and agricultural areas, connecting villages to main roads and/or a town/market centre. Traffic on such roads are relatively low, comprising of mixed modes of transportation like bullock carts, bicycle.</div>\n\nA FRAMEWORK FOR RURAL ROADS ACCESSIBILITY PLANNING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A FRAMEWORK FOR RURAL ROADS ACCESSIBILITY PLANNING", "id": 18}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This research is focused at designing of water storage facilities of size 875,000 litres (750,000 litres for underground water storage, and 125,000 Litres for elevated steel tank) of treated wastewater and its transmission system for the storage and re-use of treated wastewater. The project is aimed to structurally design water storage facilities and its transmission system from the reservoir to the overhead tank for the re-use of treated wastewater in Covenant University. The design works was divided into two major parts namely: Transmission system design, and water storage facility Design. Transmission design was divided into two, which are the field activities, and the software activities. Magellan eXplorist 350H North America GPS (Global Positioning System) was used for the field activities, it was used to determine coordinates (Longitudinal and Latitudinal) of various location of points in the university campus, its key usage was to determine the lowest and the highest elevation points on campus, the highest elevated coordinate point was located in between the male postgraduate hall of residence and the postgraduate cafeteria, and the lowest elevated point was at the existing wetland which is directly opposite Daniel’s hall in the campus. The software used for transmission system is WaterCAD, which was used to design the flow path network from the lowest elevation to the highest elevation point. The water storage facility design software used are Staad pro., Orion, and AutoCAD. Staad pro. Was used to analyse and design for the underground water tank, and the elevated steel water tank, while Orion software was used for concrete design and it was used to detail the underground water tank.

A simply supported (single span) reinforced concrete bridge deck was specifically used for the investigation. The statistical models of capacity loss were derived. The uncertainties in structural resistance and the applied loadings were fully accommodated using probabilistic method. The limit state function(Failure Modes) for the flexural capacity of the deck slab, shear capacity of the deck beam and flexural capacity of the deck beam girder was developed and evaluated using the First Order Reliability Method(FORM). The entire process was implemented through a developed MATLAB program “dc_fatigue.m”. Analysis was carried out on all the failure modes considered by varying the geometrical and material properties of the system and their respective safety indices were determined. Failure due to shear in the deck beam gave the least safety index range of 6.06 to -2.11 at 3cycles/min for 10years and 40years respectively indicating the most critical section, when compared to the flexural failure with a safety index range value of 7.59 to 0.25 at 3cycles/min for 10years and 40years respectively. It was generally observed that the reliability index increased as the depth of section and concrete grade increased. Also, the coefficient of variation due to the concrete strength and depth of section decreased with increase in reliability index, from a safety index range of 7.61 to - 0.47 at 5% covariance and from 3.47 to -0.23 at 20% covariance under stress load of 3cycles/min. This trend is expected as quality control plays a very important role in achieving this level of safety in the system. Thus, for a single span bridge of 15m and less under high level of traffic load, a deck beam depth of 1200mm, deck slab of 250mm and concrete strength class of 30-35 are adequate for design and construction.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1 Preamble</strong></div> <div>Researches on fatigue behaviour of concrete materials started at the end of the 19th century, due to failure in many concrete structures caused by fatigue rupture of the concrete (Rteil et.al, 2011). Results of experimental and theoretical studies of the fatigue properties of plain concrete, reinforcing bars, prestressing tendons, and also of structural concrete members, have been accumulating steadily over the past thirty years.</div> <div>The assessment of existing structures will become a more frequent task for engineers in the near future due to the increasing age of existing infrastructure. These may be due to reasons such as(Jansen, 1996); Change in intended use of the structure, new regulations with higher load requirements for the structure, indications of ongoing deterioration in the structure, unusual incidents during use (e.g. vehicle impact, fire, earthquakes), inadequate serviceability, discovery of design or construction errors.</div> <div>The purpose of reliability analysis in this research is to verify the overall stability and establishment of action effects, i.e. the distribution of internal forces and moments. In turn, this will enable the calculation of stresses, strains, curvature, rotation and displacements. In certain complex structures, the type of analysis used (e.g. finite-element analysis) will yield internal stresses and strains and displacements directly.</div>\n\nRELIABILITY ANALYSIS OF REINFORCED CONCRETE BRIDGE DECKS SUBJECT TO FATIGUE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RELIABILITY ANALYSIS OF REINFORCED CONCRETE BRIDGE DECKS SUBJECT TO FATIGUE", "id": 20}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This research work focuses on the development of Iso-safety design charts for flexural design of flat slabs at predefined reliability levels in accordance with Eurocode 2 (2004) design criteria. Constitutive models for reinforcing steel and concrete were selected in accordance with the Eurocode 2 design requirements and subsequently the flexural limit state function was derived. Charts were developed for the flexural design of rectangular reinforced concrete sections with respect to the position of neutral axis ( ) for each concrete grade (<em>f</em><em>ck</em>) and steel grade (<em>f</em><em>yk</em>). Uncertainties in loading and geometrical properties were obtained and a program was developed taken into consideration EC2 design requirements, a safety index β value of 1.81 was achieved for various points on each of the generated curve using First Order Reliability Method (FORM). Reliability-based design charts called Iso-safety charts were produced to target safety indices; βT of 3.3, 3.8 and 4.3 as the minimum recommended for the three failure consequence classes by Eurocode 0 (2002). This recommendation shows that Eurocode 2 design of flat slabs considering flexural failure with safety index value of 1.81 provides designs that are below the recommended target safety indices. A flat slab was there after designed using the charts and was shown that for the same loading and geometrical considerations, the area of flexural reinforcement required increased by 40%, 55% and 75% over Eurocode 2 design for corresponding target safety indices of 3.3, 3.8 and 4.3 respectively. Sensitivity analysis of these provided reinforcements was carried out on other flat slab failure modes and was observed that at low reinforcement ratios punching shear safety is dependent majorly on the effective depths rather than the flexural reinforcement.</div> <p><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1 GENERAL</strong></div> <div>Flat-slab system of construction is one in which the beams used in the conventional methods of constructions are done away with. The slab directly rests on the columns and load from the slab is directly transferred to the columns and then to the foundation (Anitha <em>et al.,</em> 2007).</div> <div>The Common practice of design and construction is to support the slabs by beams and support the beams by columns. This may be called beam-slab construction. The beams reduce the available net clear ceiling height. Hence in warehouses, offices and public halls sometimes beams are avoided and slabs are directly supported by columns. This type of construction is also aesthetically appealing. The slabs which are directly supported by columns are called flat slabs.</div> <div>For many years, it has been assumed in the design of structural systems that all loads and strengths are deterministic. The strength of an element is determined in such a way that it exceeded the load with a certain margin. The ratio between the strength and the load was denoted as the safety factor which is considered as a measure of the reliability of the structure. In codes of practice for structural systems, values for loads, strengths as well as safety factors are prescribed (Sorensen, 2004).</div> <div>The safety factors are traditionally determined on the basis of experience and engineering judgment. However, in recent codes such as Eurocode 2 partial safety factors are used. Characteristic values of the uncertain loads and resistance are specified and partial safety.</div>\n\nISO-SAFETY DESIGN OF FLAT SLABS IN ACCORDANCE WITH EUROCODE 2<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ISO-SAFETY DESIGN OF FLAT SLABS IN ACCORDANCE WITH EUROCODE 2", "id": 21}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Black cotton soil classified as an A-7-6 (24) soil on AASHTO classification collected from new Marte area of Borno state was modified with up to 4% cement and LBWA up to 8% by weight of the soil.

It is sometimes necessary to treat these soils, termed expansive soils to give a stable sub-grade or working platforms for the construction of the pavement. Treatment of soil are generally classified into two processes: soil modification or soil stabilization. The purpose of sub-grade modification is to provide a working platform for construction equipment, while sub-grade stabilization is meant to increase the strength and durability of the soil.</div> <div><strong>1.1.1       </strong><strong>Black cotton soil</strong></div> <div>Expansive soil can be found almost any where in the world but they are basically confined to semi arid regions of the tropical /temperate zones. These areas are usually characterized by marked dry and wet seasons with low rainfall, poor drainage and exceedingly great heat. The precipitation is such that the annual evaporation exceeds the precipitation (Chen, 1988).</div> <div>Two groups of parent rock materials have been associated with the formation of expansive soils.

Although the blocks are preferred to other similar walling material such as bricks and concrete blocks due to the availability of the dominant material (sand) in the country and the ease of manufacture, the material is known to have several drawbacks: it has a low compressive strength which could be a factor for structural failure in buildings. Apart from the compressive strength, little is known about the other strength and permeation properties of the material. Thirdly, little research has been conducted into the influence of water-cement ratio which is known <em>to wield </em>a strong influence on the strength and permeation properties of cementitious materials. On the basis of a thorough review of the literature, a detailed experimental programme was designed and carried out in Nigeria on the factors that influence the strength and permeation properties of the material using over 10 destructive test methods. Over 1500 sandcrete blocks were moulded and tested. The literature review also indicated that lack of quality control in the Nigeria sandcrete blocks manufacturing industry which accounts for the poor quality of the material in the country. The results of the experimental programme indicate that with the right constituent materials,   manufacturing   and   curing   processes,   it   is   possible   to   improve   the compressive strength of sandcrete blocks to over 7.0N/mm2 (the minimum specfied by the British Standards) with a lean mix of 1:12 cement/sand ratio. The compressive strength of the material was found to have a strong relationship with other strength properties of the material and could therefore be used as the main criterion for determining its quality. The inclusion of quarry dust and coarse aggregate (sharp sand) significantly improved the strength and permeation properties of the blocks. Compared with normal concrete, sandcrete; was found to have a relatively high permeability. Through this study, a data base on several strength and permeation properties has been developed which can assist engineers to estimate these properties. Finally recommendations were made on ways of improving the quality of sandcrete blocks in the country.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1.            </strong><strong>Research Background</strong></p> <p>Sandcrete blocks are produced from a lean mix of Portland cement, natural sand and water and are the main masonry unit used in the urban and peri-urban areas of Nigeria, West Africa and many parts of the developing world. Unlike other masonry units such as concrete blocks and burn bricks which are used in other civil engineering infrastructure, they are predominantly used as walling units in the construction of shelter: both as external cladding and for partitions. They have an appeal to the construction industry due mainly to its ease of manufacture and the widespread availability of the main constituent material (sand).</p> <p>A number of studies including the project National de Recherche/Development (Sablocrete) (1994) carried out in France have designated sandcrete as a member of a family of concretes, which can be used when environmental and economic constrictions restrict the use of coarse aggregate. This project carried out in France (Sablocrete) revealed the economical and mechanical advantages of this material and showed typical applications in public works and building.</p> <p>In researching into the properties of sandcrete blocks as defined by this study, one is faced with a delimma, little material exists in the technical literature on certain properties of sandcrete blocks such as its durability, tensile, transverse and flexural strength and the value of elastic constants. One way of overcoming this problem is to compare sandcrete with some of its closest relatives such as concrete and mortar. In fact as a material, sandcrete can be considered as a form of zero-slump concrete or mortar. This three materials share many common characteristics even though their properties diverge at a point. For this reason, extensive references are made in this study to concrete and mortar.</p> <p>Sandcrete blocks are mostly produced in Nigeria by the small scale manufacturers who as business people have profit as their main motive and therefore often use sub-standard materials and improper procedures in the production of the blocks. This results in the output of poor quality blocks with poor strength properties. Whereas Nigerian burnt bricks are reported to have compressive strength in the range of 11.5N/mm2 to 26.0N/mm2, the corresponding range for sandcrete blocks was only found to be 1.45M/mm2 to 3.5N/mm2 (Graham, 1990; Danso, 1994). This problem tends to limit the application of the material and could also be a major factor in relation to the structural failure of buildings in the event of earthquakes.</p> <p>As mentioned above, apart from the compressive strength of the unit, very little is known about the other properties of the block such as the Young’s Modulus, tensile, flexural and transverse strengths which are required by structural engineers and other scientists for design computations. The lack of information on these strength properties of sandcrete blocks leaves room for much speculation and approximation, which could be detrimental to the design of structures.</p> <p>Virtually all the numerous research and publications on the material seem to focus on the strength properties of the material. Very little exist in literature on the durability of sandcrete blocks. In recent years however, reports from around the globe indicate that the premature deterioration of concrete and other cementitious materials is a major problem. For instance it has been reported that significant proportions of national budgets have been expended on the maintenance of concrete structures in the US and Europe. Thus the philosophy that a strong concrete is a durable concrete has failed as this is not always the case. It can therefore be argued that to avoid huge maintenance costs of structures constructed from concrete and for that matter sandcrete blocks, the basic masonry units must be durable as well as strong.</p> <p>Closely linked with permeation (durability) and strength properties of cementitious materials is the water-cement ratio. Most researchers agree that water cement ratio has a profound impact on the durability and strength of these materials but few researchers of sandcrete blocks have examined the effect of water-cement ratio on the properties of the blocks.</p>\n\nA MATHEMATICAL MODEL FOR PREDICTION OF THE STRENGTH OF SANCRETE CEMENT BLOCK<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A MATHEMATICAL MODEL FOR PREDICTION OF THE STRENGTH OF SANCRETE CEMENT BLOCK", "id": 25}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div><strong>PREFACE</strong></div> <br/>This case study is an existing pathway or fort path linking Ugwuji and Campus 111 (IMT) for a proposed road construction by the government of Enugu State.<br/><br/>This project encloses the following <br/>-    The condition of the existing sub-grade and its suitability for use as a good sub-grade soil material by processes of different lab test.<br/>-    Using the group index method and CBR method to design a flexible pavement on the pathway under consideration.<br/>-    The optimum moisture content (OMC) and the maximum Dry Density (MDD) which are obtained by various laboratory test with a view of applying corresponding values in the field.<br/><br/></div> <div><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong><br/><br/>Title Page<br/>Approval Page<br/>Certification<br/>Dedication<br/>Preface<br/>Acknowledgement <br/>Table of Contents<br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong><br/>1.0    Collection of Sample and Laboratory Testing Program <br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong><br/>2.0    Mechanical Analysis <br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong><br/>3.0    Compacting Test<br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong><br/>4.0    Atterberg Limit Test<br/>4.1    Liquid Limit<br/>4.2    Plastic Limit<br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong><br/>5.0    Califorms Bearing Ration (CBR) Test<br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER SIX</strong><br/>6.0    Analysis Conclusion and Recommendation<br/>6.1    Flexible Pavement Design<br/><strong>6.2    Bibliography </strong></div>\n\nBASIC SOIL TEST ON SUB-GRADE SOIL MATERIAL &amp; FLEXIBLE PAVEMENT DESIGN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " BASIC SOIL TEST ON SUB-GRADE SOIL MATERIAL & FLEXIBLE PAVEMENT DESIGN", "id": 26}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT </strong><br/>This report presents results obtained from the investigation and water sampling exercise carried out on the segment of River Illo that passes through Sango in Ado Odo-Ota Local Government Area, Ogun State, Nigeria. The report reveals that while some people used water from the river for domestic, food production and recreation purposes, others discharge their wastes without any form of pre-treatment into it. The multipurpose usage of water from River Illo by local residents thus hinges public health on the self purification capacity of the river alone.    <br/>Information on water use and waste disposal practices of the local residents were obtained through direct observation and oral interview of members of randomly chosen households built along the river within a distance of 2km. Single grab samples of water were obtained from the river at the site of an abattoir effluent discharge at distances 0m, 10m, 20m, 30m, 50m and 100m from the point of discharge. A seventh sample was also obtained 10m upstream of the point of effluent discharge to furnish information on ambient conditions of the river prior to pollution while an eighth sample which was prepared by diluting the water obtained at 0m with distilled water (i.e. 25%  stream water, 75% distilled water) was included to serve as control sample. All water samples were transported (within 3 hours of isolating them from the river body) to the laboratory for analysis and the results were subjected to graphical, statistical and mathematical analysis. Pollution from the abattoir caused a drop in dissolved oxygen level of the river from an ambient value of 4.6mg/l to 0.01mg/l at the point of discharge. The pollution also caused an increase of 447.5mg/l to 1071.5mg/l in T.S., 0.04mg/l to 4.4mg/l in ammonia, 170mg/l to 670mg/l in BOD, 0.05mg/l to 3.05mg/l in phosphorus, 50mg/l to 1066.7mg/l in alkalinity and 18mg/l to 820mg/l in Acidity. It was also found out that between 30m \" 80m downstream of the pollution point, a threat of eutrophication is caused by plants growing in the river path. Despite this obstruction, the river recovered considerably to a D.O. level of 3.9mg/l at 100m downstream. Results from the dispersion modeling shows the self-purification capacity of the river, f, to be 1.1 within 30m distance from the point of discharge and 0.8 between 30m and 100m from the point of discharge. The results from the application of the Streeter-Phelps model showed that the eutrophication occurring between 30m \" 80m is interfering adversely <br/>with the self purification processes of the river.   The percentage compliance of each of the eight water samples with Guideline Values (GLV) of WHO and FEPA was performed. None of the samples met the minimum requirements for BOD, COD and TSS, which are indicators of pollution. It was concluded that River Illo is being polluted by abattoir effluents discharge thereby exposing the health of local residents who use the water from the river for domestic, recreation and food production purposes to avoidable risks. Suggested actions that could further complement the self-purification capacity of the river were offered.</div> <div><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS             Page </strong><br/>Title Page

Primary data were also collected for analysis using structured questionnaires and oral interviews to elicit the contribution of the industries to water pollution.</p> <p>To advance analytical process various scenarios of improving water quality along the river under study were examined. An array of computer based hydrogeometric and water quality models were investigated. QUAL2K was operated as a one-dimensional steady state and completely mixed system for hydrogeometric and water quality analysis on the Atuwara River. The 10.81 km long stretch from upstream at Owode – Ijako to Iju Water Works was mapped with geographical positioning systems (GPS) and divided into 7 reaches with further segmentation of 0.3 km each from where grab samples were collected routinely throughout the study period.</p> <p>The research analyzed the effluent discharges from all industries along the river for priority pollutants such as BOD, COD, TDS, TSS, and Heavy metals using standard methods. The effluent samples were obtained and compared with river water samples before and after receiving waste loads in the dry and wet seasons. Model result was interfaced with geographical information systems (GIS) for clear display of model outcome to demarcate polluted zones, limnographic points and wetlands of the Atuwara watershed. The worst scenario of the effluent samples were obtained for laboratory-scale treatability studies by applying electro – Fenton alone or with further treatment by Granulated Activated Carbon (GAC) type BBC 945 to properly remove traces of heavy metals.</p> <p>xxii</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>The result showed that the effluents were acidic in both seasons with range between pH 5.4 - 6.7. The BOD and COD concentration were also very high especially at immediate downstream of points of discharge. The level of dissolved oxygen (DO) attained at points of discharge remain anoxic with the DO gradually increasing at short distances downstream to each discharge point but much higher where tributaries discharge into the river under study. The assimilative capacity of the river is very high because of the contribution from the tributaries. Calculated worst scenario of BOD discharge was about 12 metric tonnes per day. The heavy metals (cadmium, lead and iron) were slightly above the FEPA standard at all sections of the river. All these indicated that the river is impaired and should be declared polluted and not good for human consumption without adequate treatment.</p> <p>The study showed that the Atuwara River was grossly polluted. Treatment of the worst scenario effluent collected from an industry showed that COD removal of more than 66% was achieved with electro-Fenton treatment at a molar ratio of H2O2/Fe2+ between 150-250, using 0.3M H2O2 and 0.002M Fe2+ and when further treated with the GAC 945 sample, the COD removal was 86%.</p> <p>To achieve river water quality specified by regulatory authorities, it is therefore recommended that substantial load curtailment from the firms discharging the effluents be enforced by the government through mandatory provision of in-house adequate treatment and at regulated flow rate to meet the National standards.</p> <p>xxiii</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.         </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong>      <strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Water is life and the quality and adequacy of water is an essential measure of the quality of life or rather the existence of life. Consequently water quality management is (or should be) one of the most important activities of mankind, so as to protect and save human life. The management of water quality, or the protection of the aquatic ecosystem in a broader sense, means the control of pollution. Water pollution originates from point and non-point (diffuse) sources and is mostly anthropogenic activities.</p> <p>A crucial aspect in the series of complex activities of planning and implementing water pollution control actions is the quantitative determination and description of the relationship between human activities and the state of the aquatic system. These activities are essential for the modelling of aquatic systems (hydrological, hydrodynamics, hydraulic, and water quality modelling) (Jolankai, 1997).</p> <p>Planning and management activities require the assessment of hydraulic and water quality conditions often beyond the range of observed field data. In this context, both hydraulic and water quality models need be made that are general enough to (1) describe observed conditions and (2) predict planning scenarios that may be substantially different from observed conditions. In stream water pollution control the main objective is to assess if the system complies with the maximum pollutant release allowed from point and non-point source pollution, so that pollutant levels in the receiving streams meet water quality standards. Water quality models for in - stream water pollution control have been calibrated and verified with data collected prior to model development during surveys designed to check basin wide water quality for regulatory compliance (Radwan <em>et al,</em> 2003).</p> <p><strong>1.2    Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>A lot of environmental degradation is generated during the planning, developmental stage including construction and final occupation of engineering projects.</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>2</p> <p>The problems include deforestation, land and water pollution, and contamination of ground water, poor environmental sanitation, poorly planned road network, air and noise pollution, destruction of natural food chain, toxicity and radioactivity within the eco-system, etc. Others are:</p> <p>-        Rapidly increasing generation of industrial effluents and discharge into the available water courses</p> <p>-        Increasing difficulty of industries to comply and meet regional and national water quality standards and limits</p> <p>-        Increasing occurrence of water- borne diseases as a result of pollutions from indiscriminate industrial effluents discharge into water courses</p> <p>-        Deterioration of water quality standards and its effects on water supply, aquatic ecosystems and public health due to river pollution in populated areas</p> <p>-        Service delivery standards<strong>:</strong> Many existing national environmental standards and environmental management practices are based on those developed in industrialized countries, under conditions totally different from those existing in developing countries.</p> <p>These standards are often inappropriate, even where they are in theory appropriate they often cannot be applied due to high cost.</p> <p><strong>1.3    Aims of the Research</strong></p> <p>The aims of this research include the:</p> <p>i.            Determination of the dilution power and self- recovery ability of a purposively selected river in Ado-Odo/Otta District after receiving industrial effluents, <em>and</em></p> <p>ii.             Assessment of the industrial waste management capability of the treatment facilities of selected industries.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong>      <strong>Specific Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The specific objectives of this study are to:</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>3</p> <p>1.      Characterize selected industrial effluents and determine their impacts on a purposively selected receiving water courses;</p> <p>2.      Use an existing model to determine the ability of the selected receiving stream to recover from the environmental impacts of the industrial activities, <em>and</em></p> <p>3.      Determine the treatability of the effluents and recommend an engineering solution to the impacts.</p> <p><strong>1.5    Justification for the Research</strong></p> <p>Existing literature showed that there has been no detailed scientific and engineering study of industrial impact on the rivers in Ado-Odo/Otta Industrial Zones. Presently there exists a global focus on sustainable consumption and production activities by industries. There is the need therefore to determine conformity by the industries with the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA) of Nigeria other national and international regulations.</p> <p>The findings of this work will be useful to Engineers in the design and management of industrial wastes.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong>      <strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>i.            The scope of this study was limited to a field survey of selected industries which discharges industrial effluents into River Atuwara.</p> <p>ii.             Laboratory scale modelling of the pollution impacts, using QUAL2K developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), to determine the hydrodynamics and water quality of the receiving river; and</p> <p>iii.             Laboratory bench - scale treatability study and analysis of the identified pollutants of concerns in the effluents from the selected industries</p> <p><strong>1.7</strong>      <strong>Delimitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study covered River Atuwara in Otta Municipal Districts. The major polluting industries in the industrial layouts will be determined in the three major industrial areas in Otta viz: Idiroko road, Ijoko road and Lagos-Abeokuta expressway. A model</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>4</p> <p>to simulate one-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality parameters of the receiving streams will be examined.</p> <p><strong>1.8</strong>      <strong>Operational Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Industrial</strong> <strong>pollution<em>:</em> </strong>is a very broad category of pollution resulting from manufacturing activities. Industrial pollution can be in the form of air pollution, water pollution or solid and hazardous wastes.</p> <p><strong>Industrial wastes<em>:</em> </strong>industrial and radioactive waste from chemical plants and nuclear power plants includes potentially dangerous substances such as petro-chloro-benzene (PCBs), tributylin (TBT), organo-chlorides, heavy metals (HMs), acidic wastes, radioactive caesium and plutonium 239,(Falconer ,1990).</p> <p><strong>Industrial effluent<em>:</em> </strong>These are partially treated or untreated wastewater discharges from industries. It is normally unacceptable to discharge untreated industrial wastewater direct to rivers, land or disposal down mineshafts wells etc. Gaseous discharges from stacks are also part of industrial effluent.</p> <p><strong>Industrial</strong> <strong>wastewater management<em>:</em> </strong>This is the process that ensures the minimization of wastewater production for recovery and reuse. The recovery and reuse of wastewater in an economic way enable the cost of wastewater treatment to be minimized. The options for the industrialist are: (1) to treat or partially treat at source within the site;(2) treat at a centralized works effluents plant within the industrial complex or (3) discharge the wastewater to a sewer and pay for off site treatment.</p> <p><strong>Water quality: </strong>a term used to describe the chemical, physical and biological characteristics of water, usually in respect to its suitability for a particular purpose.</p> <p><strong>Mathematical model<em>:</em> </strong>Mathematical models are useful instruments in the survey of computer systems. It is not possible to survey the many components and their reactions in an ecological system without the use of mathematical models as</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>5</p> <p>synthesis tool. Mathematical models can be used to reveal dynamic system properties. They revealed gaps in knowledge on ecological systems and can therefore be used to set up research priorities as an idealized formulation that represents the response of a physical system to external stimuli.</p> </div>\n\nPOLLUTION PROBLEMS AND AN ENGINEERING APPROACH TO THE MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF INDUSTRIAL EFFLUENTS <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " POLLUTION PROBLEMS AND AN ENGINEERING APPROACH TO THE MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF INDUSTRIAL EFFLUENTS ", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong><br/>A lateritic soil classified as sandy clay or (CL) and A-7-6 (5) according to Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) and AASHTO classification system respectively,was treated with up to 10% pulverized steel slag (an industrial waste product) by dryweight of soil. Elemental and chemical analysis of the steel slag was determined using x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. Tests were carried out to determine the index properties, compaction characteristics (maximum dry density, MDD and optimum moisture content, OMC), strength characteristics (California bearing ratio, CBR and unconfined compressive strength, UCS) and permeability of the natural and treated soil. Test results show that Atterberg limits (liquid limit, plastic limit and plasticity index)<br/>generally decreased, while specific gravity of soil \" steel slag mixtures increased with higher steel slag content; MDD and OMC increased and decreased, respectively, with higher steel slag content. Generally, CBR and UCS increased up to 8% steel slag treatment of the soil. Permeability of soil \" steel slag mixtures increased with higher steel slag content. Based on laboratory test results, an 8 % optimal stabilization of the A-7-6 soil with steel slag satisfactorily meets the Federal Republic of Nigerian General Specifications (Roads and Bridges) requirement for subgrade materials.<br/><br/></div> <div><strong>Table of Contents</strong><br/>CERTIFICATION ii<br/>DEDICATION iii<br/>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS iv<br/>LIST OF FIGURES viii<br/>LIST OF TABLES ix<br/>LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS x<br/>ABSTRACT xi<br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION </strong><br/>1.1 Preamble 1<br/>1.2 Statement of the Problem 1<br/>1.3 Justification for the Study 2<br/>1.4 Aim and Objectives 3<br/>1.5 Scope of the Study 3<br/>1.6 Significance of Study 4<br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER TWO<br/>LITERATURE REVIEW 6</strong><br/>2.1 Background 6<br/>2.2 What is Slag? 7<br/>2.2.1 Slag Recycling 10<br/>2.2.2 Utility and Usage of Slag Products 11<br/>2.3 Efforts in Utilizing Slag 13<br/>2.4 Production of Steel Slag 13<br/>2.4.1 BOF Slag from Basic Oxygen Steelmaking 14<br/>2.4.2 EAF Slag 17<br/>2.4.3 Steel Slag Utilization 19<br/>2.5 Properties of Steel Slag 20<br/>2.5.1 Physical and Mechanical Properties 20<br/>2.5.2 Chemical and Mineralogical Properties 23<br/>2.6 Environmental and Health Considerations 27<br/>2.7 Laterite and Lateritic Soils 27<br/>2.8 Stabilization of Lateritic Soils 30<br/><strong><br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>MATERIALS AND METHODS 33</strong><br/>3.1 Materials and Preparation 33<br/>3.1.1 Steel slag 33<br/>3.1.2 Soil 33<br/>3.2 Methods 34<br/>3.2.1 Chemical composition of steel slag 36<br/>3.2.2 Natural moisture content 36<br/>3.2.3 Sieve analysis 37<br/>3.2.4 Specific gravity 38<br/>3.2.5 Atterberg limits 36<br/>3.2.6 Compaction characteristics 39<br/>3.2.7 Strength characteristics 38<br/>3.2.8 Permeability 39<br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 40</strong><br/>4.1 X-ray Fluorescence 41<br/>4.2 Natural Soil 41<br/>4.3 Sieve Analysis 41<br/>4.4 Specific Gravity 42<br/>4.5 Atterberg Limits 43<br/>4.6 Compaction Characteristics of Lateritic Soil Sample 45<br/>4.7 California Bearing Ratio 47<br/>4.8 Unconfined Compressive Strength 49<br/>4.9 Permeability 51<br/>4.10 Optimal Stabilization 52<br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 53</strong><br/>5.1 Conclusion 53<br/>5.2 Recommendation 54<br/><strong>REFERENCES 55<br/>APPENDIX: LABORATORY RESULT SHEETS 61</strong><br/><strong><br/>LIST OF FIGURES</strong><br/>Figure 2.1: Types of Slag 7<br/>Figure 2.2: Types of Ferrous Slag 8<br/>Figure 2.3: Flow of Steel Slag Production (Nippon Slag Association, 2006) 10<br/>Figure 2.4: Major Productive Use of Steel Slag in Europe 11<br/>Figure 2.5: Steel Slag Utilization in Europe 11<br/>Figure 2.6: A Typical BOF (National Slag Association, 2011) 14<br/>Figure 2.7: Schematic of Operational Steps in Oxygen Steelmaking Process (BOF) (Fruehan, 1998) 15<br/>Figure 2.8: Typical Composition after Sampling (Corus, 2011) 17<br/>Figure 2.9: A Typical EAF (National Slag Association, 2011) 18<br/>Figure 2.10: Schematic of Operational Steps in EAF Processes (Corus, 2011) 19<br/>Figure 3.1: Steel Slag Sample Collection Site 34<br/>Figure 3.2: Lateritic Soil Sample Collection Site 34<br/>Figure 4.1: Particle Size Distribution of Soil 42<br/>Figure 4.2: Variation of Specific Gravity with Slag Content 42<br/>Figure 4.3: Variation of Average Liquid Limit with Slag Content 42<br/>Figure 4.4: Variation of Plastic Limit with Slag Content 44<br/>Figure 4.5: Variation of Plasticity Index with Slag Content 45<br/>Figure 4.6: Variation of OMC with Slag Content 46<br/>Figure 4.7: Variation of MDD with Slag Content 46<br/>Figure 4.8: Variation of Unsoaked CBR with Slag Content 47<br/>Figure 4.9: Variation of Soaked CBR with Slag Content 48<br/>Figure 4.10: Variation of Swell Potential with Slag Content 48<br/>Figure 4.11: Variation of Unconfined Compressive Strength with Slag Content 50<br/>Figure 4.12: Variation of Undrained Shear Strength with Slag Content 50<br/>Figure 4.13: Variation of Permeability with Slag Content 51<br/><br/><strong>LIST OF TABLES</strong><br/>Table 2.1.

This was achieved by sourcing for data once every month from 22 sampling locations of interest within a pre-selected segment of the river over a period covering the dry and wet seasons. The data collected include hydraulic data (depth, width, velocity and time of travel) and water quality data such as Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). Excel Spreadsheet and MATLAB were used for data processing. Regression analysis was carried out where stream velocity and depth were the regressors and the re-aeration constant k2 (as a function of BOD, DO and Temperature) was the dependent variable.  A coefficient of re-aeration, k2, (Atuwara re-aeration model) was developed and validated statistically. Its performance was also verified by comparing the model with 10 other internationally recognized models. It was  found that even though Atuwara model performed better than Agunwamba model and most of the other well cited models, both Atuwara model and Agunwamba model could be safely adopted for future water quality modelling researches in the Nigerian environment.  Results of detailed water analysis of samples from River Atuwara shows high level of pollution hence it is unfit for human consumption without adequate treatment. It is recommended that River Atuwara and similar rivers in the country should be regularly monitored for quality control.</div> <div><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS      PAGE </strong><br/>Title Page          i  <br/>Declaration         ii  <br/>Certification         iii <br/>Dedication          iv <br/>Acknowledgement        v <br/>Table of Contents         vii <br/>List of Figures         x <br/>List of Tables         xi <br/>List of Plates         xiv <br/>Abbreviations and Symbols       xv <br/>Abstract          xvi <br/> <br/><strong>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION </strong><br/>1.1  Background Information       1                             <br/>1.2   Water Quality modelling       3 <br/>1.3   Description of Study Location     5 <br/>1.4   Statement of The Problem      6 <br/>1.5   Aim         6 <br/>1.6   Objectives        6 <br/>1.7   Significance of Study       6 <br/>1.8   Scope of Study       7 <br/> <br/>   CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW <br/>2.1  Water Quality Modelling as a Field of Study    8 <br/>2.2   Coefficient of Re-aeration, k2      9 <br/>2.2.3  The Indian k2 Model       13 <br/>2.2.4  The Chilean k2 Model       14 <br/>2.2.5  The Nigerian k2 Model     15 <br/>2.3    Water Laws and Standards       15 <br/>2.4    Statistical Analysis       17 <br/>2.4.1  Some Relevant Statistical Operations   17 <br/>2.4.2  Statistical Software     19 <br/>2.4.3  Model Calibration and Validation in Water Quality <br/>Data       20 <br/>2.4.3.1      Sum of Squares Due to Error  21 <br/>2.4.3.2      R-Square        21 <br/>2.4.3.3      Degrees of Freedom Adjusted R-Square 22 <br/>2.4.3.4      Root Mean Squared Error   22 <br/> <br/><strong>CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY  </strong><br/>        3.1   Selection of the Study Area       24 <br/>       3.2   Determination of Sampling Stations      27 <br/>       3.3   Field Activities        49 <br/>  3.3.1  Field Observations      31 <br/>  3.3.2  Field Sampling Visits      31 <br/>   3.3.2.1     Rationale for Gathering Data Once Every Month  32 <br/>    3.3.2.2     Activities During the Field Exercises  33 <br/>            3.4     Materials        34 <br/>            3.5     Laboratory Analysis       36 <br/>       3.6     Data Analysis        37 <br/>            3.6.1    Time of Travel       38 <br/>           3.6.2    Re-aeration Coefficient Model     39 <br/> <br/><strong>CHAPTER FOUR: DATA PRESENTATION AND INTERPRETATION </strong><br/>  4.1 Data Gathering       40 <br/>   4.1.1   Hydraulic Data      41 <br/>   4.1.2   Physico-Chemical Data     50 <br/>    4.1.3  Monthly Variations in DO, Temperature, Stream Depth       57 <br/>   4.2  Computation of Measured k2                                                              63 <br/>            4.3  Re-arrangement of Sampling Stations    67 <br/>4.3.1  Time of Travel      68 <br/>4.3.2  Hydraulic Radius                 80 <br/>4.3.3  Ultimate BOD and De-oxygenation Rate              80 <br/>4.3.4  Saturation DO and the Upstream and Downstream DO deficits  80<br/> 4.3.5  Determination of k2                 80 <br/>4.3.6  Model Parameters                 80 <br/>4.3.7  The Model                  83 <br/>4.3.8  Comparison with other Selected Models              83 <br/>4.4  Water Use Practices                             103 <br/> 4.5       Pollutants and Public Health Implications              106 <br/> <br/><strong>CHAPTER FIVE: CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION </strong><br/>5.1  Conclusion                  110 <br/>5.2 Contribution to Knowledge                111 <br/>5.3  Recommendations                 111 <br/>       <br/><strong>REFERENCES                   113 <br/> <br/>APPENDICES  </strong><br/>Appendix 1: Matlab Code for Beta               121 <br/>Appendix 2: Matlab Model Output                          128 <br/>Appendix 3: Matlab Code and Output for Plot of all Models           132 <br/>Appendix 4: Mix Calculations               140 <br/>Appendix 5: Laboratory Reports               147  <br/>Appendix 6: Procedure for data Analysis              160<br/><br/><strong><br/>LIST OF FIGURES                                           PAGE </strong><br/>Figure 1.1 -

Although the blocks are preferred to other similar walling material such as bricks and concrete blocks due to the availability of the dominant material (sand) in the country and the ease of manufacture, the material is known to have several drawbacks: it has a low compressive strength which could be a factor for structural failure in buildings. Apart from the compressive strength, little is known about the other strength and permeation properties of the material. Thirdly, little research has been conducted into the influence of water-cement ratio which is known <em>to wield </em>a strong influence on the strength and permeation properties of cementitious materials. On the basis of a thorough review of the literature, a detailed experimental programme was designed and carried out in Nigeria on the factors that influence the strength and permeation properties of the material using over 10 destructive test methods. Over 1500 sandcrete blocks were moulded and tested. The literature review also indicated that lack of quality control in the Nigeria sandcrete blocks manufacturing industry which accounts for the poor quality of the material in the country. The results of the experimental programme indicate that with the right constituent materials,   manufacturing   and   curing   processes,   it   is   possible   to   improve   the compressive strength of sandcrete blocks to over 7.0N/mm2 (the minimum specfied by the British Standards) with a lean mix of 1:12 cement/sand ratio. The compressive strength of the material was found to have a strong relationship with other strength properties of the material and could therefore be used as the main criterion for determining its quality. The inclusion of quarry dust and coarse aggregate (sharp sand) significantly improved the strength and permeation properties of the blocks. Compared with normal concrete, sandcrete; was found to have a relatively high permeability. Through this study, a data base on several strength and permeation properties has been developed which can assist engineers to estimate these properties. Finally recommendations were made on ways of improving the quality of sandcrete blocks in the country.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1.            </strong><strong>Research Background</strong></p> <p>Sandcrete blocks are produced from a lean mix of Portland cement, natural sand and water and are the main masonry unit used in the urban and peri-urban areas of Nigeria, West Africa and many parts of the developing world. Unlike other masonry units such as concrete blocks and burn bricks which are used in other civil engineering infrastructure, they are predominantly used as walling units in the construction of shelter: both as external cladding and for partitions. They have an appeal to the construction industry due mainly to its ease of manufacture and the widespread availability of the main constituent material (sand).</p> <p>A number of studies including the project National de Recherche/Development (Sablocrete) (1994) carried out in France have designated sandcrete as a member of a family of concretes, which can be used when environmental and economic constrictions restrict the use of coarse aggregate. This project carried out in France (Sablocrete) revealed the economical and mechanical advantages of this material and showed typical applications in public works and building.</p> <p>In researching into the properties of sandcrete blocks as defined by this study, one is faced with a delimma, little material exists in the technical literature on certain properties of sandcrete blocks such as its durability, tensile, transverse and flexural strength and the value of elastic constants. One way of overcoming this problem is to compare sandcrete with some of its closest relatives such as concrete and mortar. In fact as a material, sandcrete can be considered as a form of zero-slump concrete or mortar. This three materials share many common characteristics even though their properties diverge at a point. For this reason, extensive references are made in this study to concrete and mortar.</p> <p>Sandcrete blocks are mostly produced in Nigeria by the small scale manufacturers who as business people have profit as their main motive and therefore often use sub-standard materials and improper procedures in the production of the blocks. This results in the output of poor quality blocks with poor strength properties. Whereas Nigerian burnt bricks are reported to have compressive strength in the range of 11.5N/mm2 to 26.0N/mm2, the corresponding range for sandcrete blocks was only found to be 1.45M/mm2 to 3.5N/mm2 (Graham, 1990; Danso, 1994). This problem tends to limit the application of the material and could also be a major factor in relation to the structural failure of buildings in the event of earthquakes.</p> <p>As mentioned above, apart from the compressive strength of the unit, very little is known about the other properties of the block such as the Young’s Modulus, tensile, flexural and transverse strengths which are required by structural engineers and other scientists for design computations. The lack of information on these strength properties of sandcrete blocks leaves room for much speculation and approximation, which could be detrimental to the design of structures.</p> <p>Virtually all the numerous research and publications on the material seem to focus on the strength properties of the material. Very little exist in literature on the durability of sandcrete blocks. In recent years however, reports from around the globe indicate that the premature deterioration of concrete and other cementitious materials is a major problem. For instance it has been reported that significant proportions of national budgets have been expended on the maintenance of concrete structures in the US and Europe. Thus the philosophy that a strong concrete is a durable concrete has failed as this is not always the case. It can therefore be argued that to avoid huge maintenance costs of structures constructed from concrete and for that matter sandcrete blocks, the basic masonry units must be durable as well as strong.</p> <p>Closely linked with permeation (durability) and strength properties of cementitious materials is the water-cement ratio. Most researchers agree that water cement ratio has a profound impact on the durability and strength of these materials but few researchers of sandcrete blocks have examined the effect of water-cement ratio on the properties of the blocks.</p>\n\nA MATHEMATICAL MODEL FOR PREDICTION OF THE STRENGTH OF SANDCRETE CEMENT BLOCK<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A MATHEMATICAL MODEL FOR PREDICTION OF THE STRENGTH OF SANDCRETE CEMENT BLOCK", "id": 33}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE <br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1 Background of the Study<br/>Fluoride is one of the very few chemicals that have been shown to cause significant effects in people through drinking-water. Fluoride has beneficial effects on teeth at low concentrations in drinking-water, but excessive exposure to fluoride in drinking-water, or in combination with exposure to fluoride from other sources, can give rise to a number of adverse effects. These range from mild dental fluorosis to crippling skeletal fluorosis as the level and period of exposure increases. Crippling skeletal fluorosis is a significant cause of morbidity in a number of regions of the world (J. Fawell, K. Bailey, J. Chilton, E. Dahi, L. Fewtrell and Y. Magara 2006).      Fluoride is known to occur at elevated concentrations in a number of parts of the world and in such circumstances can have, and often has, a significant adverse impact on public health and well-being (J. Fawell, K. Bailey, J. Chilton, E. Dahi, L. Fewtrell and Y. Magara 2006).     There is now a continuing process of updating the (GDWQ) Guideline for Drinking Water Quality, through which it was concluded that there was a need for a monograph on fluoride in drinking-water that would be useful to a wide range of individuals, including health workers and sanitary engineers who may require a broad introduction to the subject, but would still provide more detailed guidance in some specific areas. Such a monograph could provide an appropriate introduction and background information, and indicate where other more detailed information could be obtained. The primary focus of the monograph is  the prevention of adverse effects from excessive levels of fluoride in drinking-water.   Fluoride is found in all natural waters at some concentration. Seawater typically contains about 1mg l–1 while rivers and lakes generally exhibit concentrations of less than 0.5 mg l–1. In groundwater, however, low or high concentrations of fluoride can occur, depending on the nature of the rocks and the occurrence of fluoride-bearing minerals. Concentrations in water are limited by fluorite solubility, so that in the presence of 40 mg l–1 calcium it should be limited to 3.1 mg l–1(Hem, 1989). It is the absence of calcium in solution which allows higher concentrations to be stable (Edmunds and Smedley, 1996). Iree town which is the focus of this project work has a very high tendency for the presence of fluoride in its ground water because of the geological nature of the area. Iree is a town surrounded by different rocks and the presence of this rock naturally leads to the presence of fluoride in all the well water in Iree metropolis. The problem that necessitated this project include dental fluorosis and skeletal deformation in some people living in Iree metropolis.           This project is to determine the effect and implication of fluoride on drinking well water in some areas in Iree community of Osun state, Nigeria.  <br/>1.2   Statement Of The Problem           <br/>The problem of the study is the health hazard noticeable among the inhabitants of the study areas such as dental fluorosis and skeletal deformation which may be traceable to the amount of fluoride in well water.   <br/>1.3   Aims And Objectives Of The Study <br/>1.  To know the required dosage of fluoride needed in drinking well water. <br/>2.  To know the health implications of the amount of fluoride in drinking well water in Iree metropolis.   <br/>1.4   Significance of The Study <br/>Fluoride has beneficial effects on teeth at low concentrations in drinking-water, but excessive exposure to fluoride in drinking-water, or in combination with exposure to fluoride from other sources, can give rise to a number of adverse effects such as Dental fluorosis, and skeletal deformation.           <br/>1.5   Scope of the Study <br/>This project work covers well water from Off-campus, Ladoja, Oke Aare, Small London, Oris, B.H.S, and Eyinade area of Iree metropolis.             <br/>1.6     Limitation of the Study <br/>The project work could not cover the entire iree community for the following reason v Financial constraints. v Mobility. v Time constraints. v  Lack of accessibility in some areas.  <br/>1.7   Definition Of Terms <br/>EFFECT: This may refer to a result or change of something. <br/>IMPLICATION: This is the conclusion that can be drawn from something, although it is not explicitly stated. <br/>GDWQ: This is the acronym of Guideline for Drinking Water Quality. <br/>FLOUROSIS: This is a condition due to the ingestion of excess amount of fluorine.<br/>FLOURIDE: Fluoride is the anion of fluorine, it is also the reduced formed of fluorine.<br/>FUMAROLIC GASES: This is a vent in the surface of the Earth from which hot smoke and gases escape. <br/>FLUORIDATION: This is the controlled addition of fluoride to a public water supply to reduce tooth decay.  <br/>DENTAL FLUOROSIS: This is a change in the appearance of the tooth’s enamel. <br/>ENDEMIC: This means a disease occurs frequently and at a predictable rate in a specific location or population. <br/>ENAMEL: This is a vitreous, usually opaque, protective or decorative coating baked on metal, glass, or ceramic.</p>\n\nEFFECT AND IMPLICATION OF FLUORIDE ON DRINKING WELL WATER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT AND IMPLICATION OF FLUORIDE ON DRINKING WELL WATER", "id": 34}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE <br/>1.0     INTRODUCTION <br/>The search for alternative binder or pozzolanic material has become a challenge to national development.  Potential of laterite soil as a reliable and durable construction material is highly locally available and has been one of the major building materials for a long time. One of the various soil types that occur in the tropic and sub-tropic laterite is one of the commonest types and is of special interest in building and road constructions. Laterite soils are highly weathered soil which contains large but extremely variable proportion of iron and aluminum oxides well as quartz and other minerals.  AASHTO classified soils into seven groups. A – 1 to A – 7. According to the AASHTO subgrade classification system, residual soils are typically classified in the A – 2 category (AASHTO Designation: M 145 – 87).  The glacial soil found in the northern states can be classified as either gravel  (A – 1) sand (A – 2), Silts (A – 5) or silty clays (A – 6).  The coaster soils along the eastern seaboard and in the gulf area are largely sands and gravel.  Note, however, that within this region are extensive area of highly plastic clay (A – 7). According to Ola (1978) most lateritic soil for road fall within the A – 2, A – 6 and A – 7 group and lateritic soil have been found in the A – 3 and A – 5 group. Laterite is defined in Osula (1984) is a highly weathered tropical soil, rich in secondary oxide of any or a combination of iron, aluminum and manganese, manganese having been reported as a predominant element with combination with iron is some varieties of laterites notable those in India,  Nigeria laterite soil are derived from basic igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock and can be found in the sedimentary basin and over the basement complex area of the country (Durotoye 1983).  Laterite soil has been successfully used in various aspect of civil engineering construction project.  Laterite materials are employed in the construction of airports, runways, highways, earth fill dam, low cost building etc. Osinubi and Kate (1997) have described laterite soil as the most common pavement materials in the tropics and sub-tropics. Some laterite soil, like laterite clays required improvement on the engineering properties before they can be used in any form of construction due to the fact that these soil have high swelling potentials which caused problem in construction thereby making them not favourable when used for construction materials in their natural states. <br/>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>A lot of research activities have been carried out on lateritic sills but little emphasis have been laid on the relationship between plasticity (consistency limit) and compressibility characteristics.  Negligence on the part of construction engineers have led to uncountable road and structure failure within the Sub-Sahara Africa.  According to Ashworth (1996), it was revealed that lateritic soils are graded with deficiency in sand and silt size particles. Ola (1974), investigated stabilization problems associated with laterite and the modified result is used in production of blocks.  Balogun (1982), investigated some physical and geotechnical properties of laterite soil in Shagamu, Southwestern Nigeria, this found to have significant difference in some index properties and crushing strength of three Southwestern Nigeria lateritic clay deposits with the aim of seeing how the materials could be used for bricks.  The result of the findings showed that firing increase the strength tremendously. A problem laterite soil is those that do not yield reproducible result using standard laboratory testing procedures.  The soils are difficult to evaluate as engineering construction materials.  The peculiar problem of this soil have been identified as thermal and mechanical instabilities i.e the susceptibility to significant change on the addition of small levels of the thermal or mechanical energy.

The ground improvement in granular soils can be achieved by different methods such as vibro-floatation, compaction piles, and compaction with explosives, excavation and replacement, grouting e.t.c. The selective of the most suitable method depend on a variety of factors, such as: soil conditions, required degree of compaction, types of structure to be supported, as well as site specific considerations available time for completion of the project, availability of equipment and materials e.t.c. Soil compaction can offer effective solutions for many foundation problems and his especially useful for reducing total settlement in sand. Sandy soil means most of the soil particles are bigger than 2mm in diameter. It gives good water drainage and has a low capacity to hold nutrients. Sandy soil does not hold moisture very well. It is granular and consists of rock and mineral particle that are very small. Therefore, the texture is gritty and is formed by the disintegration and weathering of rocks such as limestone, granite, quartz and shale. Is also easier to cultivate it if it is rich in organic materials but then it allows drainage more than needed. This results in over drainage and dehydration of the plant in summer. It warms very fast in the spring season. Grouting on the other hand is a process whereby stabilizes either in the form of suspension or solution is injected into sub surface soil. Sandy soil is the largest particle in the soil when you rub it, if feels rough. This is because it has sharp edges and it does not hold many nutrients.   <br/>1.1    HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF GROUTING <br/>The development and history of compaction grouting over the last 30-40 years as been established by many distinguished researcher, design engineer and design contractor. Many technical papers are been published dealing physically with the issues surround compaction grouting design such as: “compaction grouting, 1973”, “planning and performing compaction grouting” 1974. These and other important reference are the main stream basis of knowledge for the highly specialize engineering and construction technique know as compaction grouting. The compaction grout method as some unique features which allow distinct advantages over other remedial method of geo-technical construction. In many distances growth is the only viable solution. Some of the advantages include: Economic: Many time compaction grouting is the only feasible solution to foundation settlement problems, other than demolishing the structure and re-building with expensive deep foundation technique. Minimal disturbance: During the grouting operation, destructure may remain occupied and in service. Minimal risk: Compaction grouting offers minimal risk of catastrophic structural failure while re-leveling structure. Other are: Minimal geotechnical exploration, provide greater support for structures, cost factor e.t.c.   <br/>1.2   AIM AND OBJECTIVE <br/>1.     To determine the nature of the sandy soil particles. <br/>2.     To determine the degree of the sandy soil compatibility. <br/>3.     To carry out the improvement of sandy soil through grouting. <br/>4.     To carryout some laboratory test on sandy soil such as compaction test California bearing ration (CBR) test, atterberg LIMIT test, liquid limit test, Plastic limit test, sieve analysis test in comparing the effectiveness of grouting system.   <br/>1.3            SCOPE OF THE STUDY This research is focused on the quality and improvement of bearing capacity of sandy soil by grouting.   <br/>1.4            LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY The limitations of this study are: <br/>TIME FACTOR: Limited time that does not permit to carryout many practical. <br/>AREA OF STUDY: This project is limited the technical study of sandy soil properties.</p>\n\nIMPROVEMENT OF BEARING CAPACITY OF SANDY SOIL BY GROUTING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPROVEMENT OF BEARING CAPACITY OF SANDY SOIL BY GROUTING", "id": 36}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE <br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY AND ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE <br/>Seeley (1997) described the construction industry as one of the most important sectors of the economy, which integrates a wide variety of skilled and unskilled professionals. These professionals engage in the provision of goods and services ranging from construction, alteration, refurbishment to repairs of building and civil engineering structures. All these professionals work together under various types of contractual agreements to actualise the client’s brief and deliver the project. Each project is unique and has its main objectives outlined by the client and project circumstances. Amongst the most common objectives of any successful project are deliveries at the right time, within authorised cost and meeting the envisaged quality standards (Love et al, 1998). Construction projects, like all others, are not risks free and thereby can result to financial loss. Construction risks are events that generally influence any or all of the project objectives. Risk events could either be positive in terms of opportunities or negative in terms of threats to either or the entire project objectives (Hillson, 2002). A lot of academic and professional literature has developed in the field of effective contract planning and management within construction contexts. The degree of application of contract planning and management techniques by contractors especially, was found to differ in various construction industries across the globe. Most countries in the MiddleEast and some part of Africa do not utilise project planning and management techniques in the delivery of construction projects (El-Sayegh, 2008; Laryea and Hughes,2009). Akintoye and McLeod (1997) found that low usage of formal contract planning techniques was essentially due to lack of knowledge and doubts on the suitability of the techniques to real life situations. This was supported by the findings of Shen (1997). Kartam and Kartam (2001) however attributed the low usage of risk analysis techniques to subjective judgement and contractor’s reliance on their experience and intuition. El-Sayegh (2008) identified financial loss as the most significant in the Kuwaiti construction industry due to the boom in construction activities and inflationary trend of the market. Laryea and Hughes (2009) attempted to find how contractors’ in Ghana include financial risk in their bid prices. The research showed that besides having risk allowances as lump sums or percentage allowances, the method used is neither scientific nor informed by any empirical evidence. Ojo (2010) found that design changes, financial losses and inadequate specifications were the risk factors with most impacts on construction sites but the study did not highlight any Project contract planning (PRM) technique used by Contractors to respond to such risks. Another research carried out in Nigeria on this subject was on the evaluation of key risk factors and the measures to mitigate their effects on construction projects (Dada, 2010). Though the research found financial, political and physical risks as the most significant, the use of contingency sum and insurance cover were adjudged to be the most effective means of mitigating risk. However, no study has reported on the PRM practices used by Nigerian Contractors in redevelopments projects, with their attendant problems and challenges in terms of scoping.           1.1.2 ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE Julius Berger Nigeria Plc is a Nigerian constructioncompany, headquartered in Abuja FCT, with additional permanent locations in Lagos and Uyo. The company is represented across Nigeria in structural engineering and infrastructure works, and in southern Nigeria through domestic and international oil and gas industry projects (this company is also listed on the \"flake list\" for craigslist). It is known for constructing most of Nigeria's infrastructures, major expressways, and even some residential buildings for the Chevron Nigeria headquarters in Lagos. The company was listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange in 1991. Before this, its parent company was Bilfinger Berger. Bilfinger Berger is still the largest shareholder in the company. The construction business of Julius Berger Nigeria is the heart of the Julius Berger Group. With 18,000 employees from close to 40 nations and clients from both Nigeria and the global oil and gas industry, JB is a leading construction company and the largest private employer in Nigeria. <br/>MAJOR PROJECTS ·        <br/>The company built the Eko Bridge completed in 1968, the Third Mainland Bridge completed in 1990 and the Abuja Stadium completed in 2003. ·        <br/>Tin Can Island Port, commissioned in 1977. ·        <br/>Lagos Inner Ring Road, completed in 1979. ·       <br/>  Ajaokuta Steel Plant, completed in 1990. ·        <br/>Itakpe – Ajaokuta Ore Railway, completed in 1990. ·        <br/>Abuja International Airport phase II, completed in 1997. ·        <br/>Central Bank of Nigeria Head Office, completed in 2002. ·        <br/>Uyo infrastructure and road works, ongoing since 2008. ·        <br/>First discharge drain built utilizing pipe-jacking technology in Nigeria, completed in 2011. ·        <br/>National Assembly phase III, completed in 2011. ·        <br/>Multiple projects, Escravos GTL plant in southern Nigeria, commissioned in 2012. ·        <br/>Bonny Liquefied Natural Gas facility, multiple ongoing works since 1996. ·        <br/>Challawa Gorge Dam Karaye, completed in 1992   <br/>1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT <br/>The general low usage of formal contract planning and management techniques by Contractors globally often culminates into project failures, incessant claims for variations, huge financial losses and sometimes results in bankruptcy of Contractors (Allan et al, 2007). This situation is more prevalent in redevelopment projects due to the inevitable problems of unexpected additional work, excessive requirements and scope management issues, project funding not aligned with project plans, delay, structural failure, cost overrun, etc (Naaranoja and Uden, 2007). These problems or uncertainties, among others, increase the project risk and make their management crucial if success is desired. For the Eket-Ona 20km dual road project, billions of Naira wasexpended and the overall aim of the project was not achieved. This hugeexpenditure and apparent failure in the primary objectives of the project led tocomplaints, probe panels and subsequent abandonment of the project. Research has shown that financial, political and physical risks are the mostsignificant to Nigerian Contractors (Dada, 2010). However, of the differentlevels of risk (country, market or project), there is shortage of research as tohow Contractors approach project planning at organisational level.   <br/>1.3 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES <br/>1.     To explore contract planning practices applied by Julius Berger at various project levels.<br/>2.     To assess awareness and usage of formal and informal contract planning practices by Julius Berger, Uyo office. <br/>3.     To examine the success or failure of the contract planning approach used by Julius Berger Contractors on Eket-Ona dual road project. <br/>4.     To evaluate the impact of the applied contract planning approach to the attainment of project profits. <br/>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>1.     What contract planning guidelines and practices exist in Julius Berger Nigeria Plc, Uyo?<br/>2.     How do you gather information about newer contract planning strategies to be applied in your on-going projects? <br/>3.     What are the effects of contract planning on contractor’s profit?       <br/>1.5 HYPOTHESIS FORMULATION <br/>Hypothesis for this study include: <br/>Ho:    There is no significant relationship between effective contract planning and contractor’s profit. <br/>Hi:     There is significant relationship between effective planning and contractor’s profit. <br/>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>This study gives a clear insight into the various ways in which contractors in the construction companies in Nigeria can maximise profits through effective and efficient contract planning and management. The study also gives a clear insight into the various effects of contract planning on risk level, cost and timing of a project. The findings and recommendations of the researcher will help in building a strong and better contract policy and guideline in Julius Berger Nigeria Plc as well as other construction companies in Nigeria, if taken seriously by government and the general public. The effects of contract planning on cost and time are outlined in-order for drastic measures to be taken to tackle any challenge employers may face when developing and implementing contracts with other organizations.   <br/>1.6 SCOPE OF STUDY <br/>This research focuses mainly on the impact of effective contract planning on contractor’s profit in Julius Berger Nigeria Plc, Uyo. Results and recommendations may not be used to generalise other construction companies in Nigeria, as the researcher could not cover a wider scope due to financial and time constraints. Based on the findings of this study other possible researchable areas may include studies on the various effects of other aspects of contracts such as contract laws in Nigeria and contract management and control.   <br/>1.7 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY <br/>The only limitation faced by the researcher in the course of carrying out this study was the delay in getting data from the various respondents. Most respondents were reluctant in filling questionnaires administered to them due to their busy schedules and nature of their work. The researcher found it difficult to collect responses from the various respondents, and this almost hampered the success of this study. <br/>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS Definitions of terms serve as the dictionary of this research.  The terms are defined to enable the reader understand the research more clearly. Contract:  Erikson (2002) defined Contract as an agreement that creates an obligation binding upon the parties thereto. The essentials of a contract are as follows: <br/>(1) mutual assent; <br/>(2) a legal consideration, which in most instances need not be pecuniary; <br/>(3) parties who have legal capacity to make a contract; <br/>(4) absence of fraud or duress; and <br/>(5) a subject matter that is not illegal or against public policy. <br/>Contract Planning: According to Simmons (2007),Contract planning is the process of systematically and efficiently managing contract creation, execution and analysis for maximising operational and financial performance and minimising risk. <br/>Contractor: General contractor, organization or individual that contracts with another organization or individual (the owner) for the construction of a building, road or other facility.<br/>Profit: Tucy (2008) defined profit as the difference between the purchase price and the costs of bringing to market.</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF EFFECTIVE CONTRACT PLANNING ON CONTRACTORS PROFIT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF EFFECTIVE CONTRACT PLANNING ON CONTRACTORS PROFIT", "id": 37}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE <br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>The construction industry is an important part of the economical backbone in many countries (Ngai <em>et al.</em>, 2002), often accounting for between 7-10 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (Winch, 1996, Voordijk <em>et al.</em>, 2000). Furthermore, construction products and processes have a large impact on safety, health and environmental aspects (Bayliss <em>et al.</em>, 2004). Since all human beings in modern societies are directly affected by its processes and/or products, the importance of a well-functioning construction industry is beyond doubt (Cheung <em>et al.</em>, 2001, Ngai <em>et al.</em>, 2002, Eriksson, 2007).   In many countries the construction industry has, however, attracted criticism for inefficiencies in outcomes such as time and cost overruns, low productivity, poor quality and inadequate customer satisfaction (Latham, 1994, Egan, 1998, Ericsson, 2002, Chan <em>et al.</em>, 2003). Practitioners, researchers and society at large have, therefore, called for a change in attitudes, behaviour and procedures in order to increase the chances for construction projects to be successful and result in improved end products (Love <em>et al.</em>, 2000, Dubois and Gadde, 2002).   Increased complexity, uncertainty, and time pressure in construction projects have increased the need for cooperation among different project actors (Anvuur and Kumaraswamy, 2007). Traditionally, relationships are, however, very competitive and adversarial in the construction industry (Cheung <em>et al.</em>, 2003), which to a large extent is due to the customary procurement procedures potentially causing many problems in all stages of the buying process (Eriksson and Laan, 2007). Therefore, in order to take advantage of collaboration, procurement procedures is one key improvement area and can contribute substantially to project success (Cheung <em>et al.</em>, 2003, Eriksson, 2007). A change of procurement procedures is, however, impeded by clients’ habitual behaviour (Laedre <em>et al.</em>, 2006). Although procurement procedures need to be tailored to enhance the fulfillment of different project objectives (Cox and Thompson, 1997, Love <em>et al.</em>, 1998, Wardani <em>et al.</em>, 2006), clients tend to choose those procurement procedures they have a habit of using, regardless of any differences between projects (Laedre <em>et al.</em>, 2006). In order to enhance change, an increased understanding of how different procurement procedures affect different aspects of project performance is vital. Earlier research efforts in this area have been limited to the investigation of how a single or a few specific procurement alternatives affect one or two project objectives. In order to achieve successful governance of construction projects a holistic and systemic approach to procurement procedures is crucial (Cox and Thompson, 1997, Eriksson and Pesämaa, 2007, Eriksson, 2008b). Since a systemic perspective on the effect of procurement procedures on different aspects of project performance is lacking in the construction management literature, this research effort aims to fill this theoretical gap that has potential to bring important practical implications.   Different studies have confirmed the use of various types of procurement methods for project delivery in Nigeria. Studies of Ogunsanmi, Iyagba and Omirin (2003), Ojo, Adeyemi and Fagbenle (2006), and Dada (2012) all confirm the use of Traditional, Design and Build, Project Management, Construction Management, Labour only, Direct Labour and other types such as Alliancing, Partnering and Joint Ventures procurements in the Nigerian construction industry. The use of these procurement methods can significantly affect the performance of most projects.   <br/>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>The Nigeria construction industry is modeled after the British system being our colonial master, although, since independence in 1960, it has incorporated the styles of other European countries, such as Italy, Germany and France (Mansfield, 1994). This industry is of paramount importance for employment and economic growth (Ogunsemi, 2004). The Nigerian construction industry forms nearly 70% of the nation’s fixed capital formation; Federal Office of Statistics (FOS)(2004), yet its performance within the economy has been, and continues to be, very poor due to cost overruns resulting to abandonment of projects. For example, the Nigerian construction industry’s contribution to employment has remained consistently at 1.0% over the last decade against the World Bank’s average observation of about 3.2% in developing countries (Idrus, 2008). The traditional design-bid-build system of procurement is still dominant in the Nigerian construction sector and this may likely continue to be the trend. In addition, the Nigerian construction sector comprises the clients, contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, and key professional actors responsible for design and supervision of projects. The professionals includes architects, engineers (structural and services), and Quantity Surveyors. There are professional bodies that regulate the activities of these professionals. Delay in project execution is a major problem in the Nigerian construction industry. This occurs both in small and large projects. Virtually, all the projects executed over the years in Nigeria were faced with problem of delay in delivery. Odeyinka and Yusuf (1997) observed that seven out of every ten projects suffer delay in Nigeria. Nigerian construction industry is faced with problem of cost overrun. Ogunsemi and Jagboro (2004) noted that one of the most serious problems the Nigerian construction industry is faced with is the project cost overrun, with attendant consequence of completing projects at sums higher than the initial sum. Therefore, working with realistic project estimate is necessary at the outset of a project work, which would eliminate uncertainty and as well provide a platform for project success. Idrus and Sodangi (2008) also observed that the last decade has however exposed the declining level of clients’ satisfaction from the built facilities as a result of poor quality performance in addition to the perennial problems of time and cost overruns in the Nigerian construction industry. The Nigerian construction industry continues to occupy an important position in the nation’s economy even though it contributes less than the manufacturing or other service industries. This industry plays an important role in the economy, and the products of its activities are so vital to the achievement of national socio-economic development goals of creating job opportunities and social amenities and infrastructures (Anaman, 2007).   <br/>1.3  OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>The main aim of this study is to examine procurement systems and it impact on cost management and delivery. Specific objectives of the study are: <br/>1.              To identify various procurement systems commonly used by quantity surveyors in Owerri. <br/>2.              To examine challenges encountered when employing various procurement systems for construction projects. <br/>3.              To examine the impact of procurement systems on construction cost.   <br/>1.4     RESEARCH QUESTIONS               <br/>To guide the study and achieve the objectives of the study, the following research questions were formulated: <br/>1.   What various procurement systems are commonly used by quantity surveyors in Owerri? <br/>2.    What are the challenges encountered when employing various procurement systems for construction projects? <br/>3.   How do procurement systems affect construction cost?     <br/>1.5     RESEARCH HYPOTHESES <br/>1.   Ho: Variations in procurement systems do not affect construction cost. <br/>Hi: Variations in procurement systems affect construction cost. <br/>2.   Ho: Challenges encountered when using procurement systems contribute do not contribute to construction cost overrun. <br/>Hi: Challenges encountered when using procurement systems contribute to construction cost overrun. <br/>3.   Ho: There is no significant impact between procurement systems and construction cost management and delivery. <br/>Hi: There is a significant impact between procurement systems and construction cost management and delivery.   <br/>1.6     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>This study will be of importance to personnel in the construction industry and the general public because it would not only clarify but also create awareness of the extent to which inadequacies in cost management and procurement systems can adversely affect project performance. The study will also help contractors, clients, consultants and all parties involved in construction projects about ways of improving their current method of cost management and control. The study will also be of great benefit for other student researchers’ who may want to venture into the same subject matter. Having gotten results-both empirically and theoretically, the study will serve as a foundation for future research studies.   <br/>1.7     SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>The study will cover some selected contractors from Owerri. All findings and recommendations from the study may not reflect the true view of the traditional roles and changing roles of quantity surveyors as the researcher could not cover a wider area due to financial and time constraints.     <br/>1.8     DEFINITION OF TERMS ·        <br/>Procurement: This is the acquisition of goods, services or works from an outside external source. ·        <br/>Procurement System: Procurement system’ is a contemporary term, which is known to many practitioners and researchers of the construction industry by different terms; these include terms such as project approach, procurement methods, procurement delivery methods or project delivery. ·        <br/>Project Procurement: Project procurement has been described as an organized methods or process and procedure for clients to obtain or acquire construction products. ·        <br/>Open tendering: This is a procedure that allows practically any contractor to submit a tender for the work. This procedure involves either the client or consultant (on behalf) of the client placing a public advertisement giving a brief description of the work. ·        <br/>Selective tendering: It consists of the client drawing up a short-list of contractors that are known to have the appropriate qualifications to carry out the work satisfactorily. ·        <br/>Negotiated tendering: This method is applied in several or different contexts, but the essence is that tenders are obtained by the client inviting a single contractor of his/her choice to submit a tender for a particular project. ·        <br/>Non-traditional procurement systems: This is a diversified contemporary procurement system that not only considers design and construction, but also considers financing, operating and facility management. <br/>Construction: In the fields of architecture and civil engineering, construction is a process that consists of the building or assembling of infrastructure. Far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking. Normally, the job is managed by a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect. <br/>Deliverable: Deliverable is a term used in project management to describe a tangible or intangible object produced as a result of the project that is intended to be delivered to a customer (either internal or external). A deliverable could be a report, a document, a server upgrade or any other building block of an overall project. Project management: this is the discipline of planning, organizing, motivating, and controlling resources to achieve specific goals. A project is a temporary endeavour with a defined beginning and end (usually time-constrained, and often constrained by funding or deliverables), undertaken to meet unique goals and objectives, typically to bring about beneficial change or added value. Time: This is a dimension in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future, and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them. Cost: A cost is the value of money that has been used up to produce something, and hence is not available for use anymore.

Laterite samples were collected from the Otta area in Ogun State, Nigeria; based on previous work which stated that the samples obtained from this place produced good interlocking blocks that met minimum standards. These samples were stabilized with ordinary Portland cement using 0%, 5%, 15% and 25% by weight of the binder; 0% stabilization being the control. The stabilized samples were then used to produce stabilized blocks which were tested for strength and durability.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong>  <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The importance of housing in human history cannot be overemphasized. Housing is seen as one of the best indicators of a person’s standard of living and of his or her place in society (UNCHS, 1993). Furthermore, Venkatarama (2004) is of the view that housing and building conditions also reflect the living standards of a society. Thus, the importance of access to adequate and affordable housing took the front burner in the mid 20th century. The low-income group whose population is on the increase due to rapid urbanization and population growth evidently became the most vulnerable in terms of lack of access to decent and affordable housing in developing countries. This has led to various researches into development of locally available building materials and construction techniques to enhance access to housing for all.</p> <p>In 1976, the Human Settlements conference in Vancouver gave new impetus to this approach, condemning the transposition of Western building techniques for low-cost housing and recommending the design of technologies suited to climatic, social and cultural contexts (Rigassi, 1985 cited in Alagbe, 2008). The conference also recommended the gradual reduction of imports of products and services linked to construction, and the drawing up of norms and regulations which covered the basic needs of end-users whilst taking account of their economic possibilities.</p> <p>The acquisition of local building materials and techniques to guarantee access to decent and durable housing for all by the year 2000 was adopted in December 1988 by the General Assembly of the United Nations with the slogan “Global Strategy for Housing to the year 2000”. The Assembly proposed relying on a vast formal and informal private sector participation in housing provision. This strategy was aimed at removing the dependence on the public sector for housing provision by exploring the erstwhile ignored wealth of existing human resources and their building cultures and social dynamics (UNCHS, 1993).</p> <p>The building culture of pre-independence Nigeria was an absolute dependence on earth building techniques such as use of adobe bricks (sun-dried bricks) and wattle and daub (mud wall construction). These techniques were predominant in major rural and semi-urbanized towns and cities in Nigeria. These techniques were durable, adequate and accessible enough for them to meet their housing needs. The techniques were also sustainable since they do not deplete the natural resources of the environment neither do their production processes lead to the emission of gases that causes global climate change.</p> <p>However, post-independence rural centres in Nigeria acquired new status as a result of independence on October 1, 1960. This period was immediately followed by the “oil boom” of the 1970 and 1980 which brought about an unprecedented prosperity and development of the nation. There were massive improvements on infrastructural development particularly in state capitals and major cities and towns. Thus, the towns became increasingly urbanized and became an urban-oriented society. The crave for Western building techniques led to the gradual extinction of the erstwhile earth building techniques. Thus, while other countries were developing various earth building techniques to meet the housing needs of their populace, the technique became associated with the poor in Nigeria and not fashionable for housing purposes.</p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Sustaining housing development especially to the medium/low-income group of the society has become a huge challenge particularly because of the huge capital outlay required to do so. Thus, acquisition of indigenous building materials by way of Compressed Stabilized Laterite Bricks (CSLBs) has been suggested as a way out (Alagbe, 2008).</p> <p>Despite the cost benefits of using stabilized blocks for building construction (Alagbe, 2008), the use of stabilized laterite blocks still appears to be on a low profile. It is opined that this could be due to the properties of stabilized laterite blocks. This research evaluates CSLBs as a building material for sustainable housing construction and investigates the properties of CSLBs. The study focuses primarily on evaluating its physical properties as a building material as well as a measure of its level of acceptability for housing construction among the populace.</p> <p><strong>1.3       AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research is to investigate the properties of stabilized laterite blocks at 5%, 15%, and 25% stabilization.</p> <p>The specific objectives are;</p> <p>i)                    To determine the compressive strengths of stabilized laterite block samples at 5%, 15% and 25% cement stabilization.</p> <p>ii)                  To investigate water absorption capacity of stabilized laterite block samples at 5%, 15%, and 25% cement stabilization, and</p> <p>iii)                To assess the resistance to abrasion of stabilized laterite block samples at 5%, 15% and 25% cement stabilization.</p> <p><strong>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The research questions are;</p> <p>i)                    What are the compressive strengths of stabilized laterite block samples at 5%, 15% and 25% cement stabilization?</p> <p>ii)                  What is the water absorption of stabilized laterite block n at 5%, 15% and 25% cement stabilization?</p> <p>iii)                What is the resistance to abrasion of stabilized laterite block samples at 5%, 15% and 25% cement stabilization?</p> <p><strong>1.5       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study has the following significance;</p> <p>It shows the compressive strengths of stabilized laterite blocks at 5%, 15% and 25% cement stabilization. This helps in finding out if there is any significant difference in the compressive strength at the various degrees of stabilization. This will aid decision making when making stabilized bricks as it will inform what percentage of cement will be needed to achieve a specific compressive strength.</p> <p>The study finds out the water absorption of stabilized laterite blocks at 5%, 15% and 25% cement stabilization. This helps in finding out if there is any relationship between the degree of stabilization and the water absorption capacity of stabilized laterite blocks. This will be helpful when making stabilized bricks as it will inform what percentage of cement will be needed to achieve certain degrees of water absorption.</p> <p>It tells the resistance to abrasion of stabilized laterite blocks at 5%, 15% and 25% cement stabilization. This helps in finding out if there is any significant difference in the resistance to abrasion at the various degrees of stabilization. This will aid decision making when making stabilized bricks as it will inform what percentage of cement will be needed to make the stabilized blocks resistant to abrasion.</p> <p><strong>1.6       SCOPE AND LIMITATION</strong></p> <p>This study will focus on making various laterite block samples with cement stabilization at 5%, 15%, and 25%. The samples are cured and then made to undergo laboratory tests to determine their compressive strengths, water absorption capacity and resistance to abrasion. The laterite block samples will be made from laterite clay sourced from Ogun state, Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.7       DEFINITION OF KEY TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>ADOBE -</strong> A Spanish word often used in English (and French) to refer to a mud brick. This technique consists of moulding laterite bricks without compaction and allowing them to dry in the sun, hence their also being commonly known as laterite blocks.</p> <p><strong>CEMENT -</strong> A mixture of limestone and clay heated at a temperature of About 15000C after which gypsum would be added and the resulting mix ground to a fine powder. It is indeed the addition of gypsum that prolongs the setting of limestone and clay when in use.</p> <p><strong>COMPACTION -</strong> This is a mechanical process aimed at increasing the density of the material, thereby reducing porosity as well as its characteristics. It also reduces its susceptibility to water.</p> <p><strong>COMPRESSED LATERITE BRICKS -</strong> This refers to the tampering of laterite in a mould where it is compressed using a press.</p> <p><strong>GYPSUM -</strong> This is a term used to refer to a soft mineral called hydrated calcium sulphate which is the source of plaster of Paris and other plasters. It is produced by heating gypsum rock to about 1700 C. At this temperature, about 75 percent of crystallization water would have been driven off, leaving a white powder. This powdery substance gets hard after mixing with water and settles over a short period of time.</p> <p><strong>HYDRATED LIME -</strong> The production of hydrated lime is carried out in two stages. The first stage requires the calcination of limestone in a kiln at about 9000 C. At this stage, carbon dioxide will be expelled and quick lime (calcium oxide) will be produced. Second stage involves slaking or hydrating quick lime with a certain volume of water which causes the production of hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide).</p> <p><strong>LATERITE -</strong> This is a term that is used to refer to formation of soil, particularly clay and silt, by weathering of rocks especially in a tropical climate, composed mainly of iron and aluminum hydroxides. It is the term used to describe all the reddish residual and non-residual tropically weathered soils formed from decomposed rocks through clays.</p> <p><strong>LIME -</strong> This is a term used to refer to a white caustic earth (calcium oxide, quicklime, caustic lime) which is got by calcining calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) got by adding water to quicklime.</p> <p><strong>OPTIMAL MOISTURE CONTENT -</strong> This is defined as the moisture or water content at which a specified amount of compaction would produce the maximum dry density.</p> <p><strong>SOIL STABILISATION -</strong> This is a term that refers to the process of obtaining a better quality soil by improving the characteristics of the local soil in order to create a perfectly suited material for construction works. It assists in reducing the volume of the spaces between the solid particles thereby reducing its porosity.</p> <p><strong>STABILISERS -</strong> These are complementary additions of products intended to enhance the qualities of the earth materials further, and above all, guarantee that the properties will endure over time. They are also referred to as stabilizing agents.</p> <p><strong>STABILISED LATERITE -</strong> Refers to the mixture of sandy clay, water and a given quantity of stabilizing agents such as lime, cement, bitumen emulsions etc. These stabilizers increase water resistance. Mostly used for making walls, bricks etc</p>                                                           \n\nAN INVESTIGATION INTO THE PROPERTIES OF STABILIZED LATERITE BLOCKS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE PROPERTIES OF STABILIZED LATERITE BLOCKS", "id": 41}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Maryland is located in Enugu South in Enugu State. The subsoil of this region consists of fine grained soils with a considerable part of soft soil deposit which extends to a considerable depth.</p> <p>       When a compressive load is applied to a soil mass, the volume of the soil mass tends to reduce, due to reduction in its voids. This reduction in volume of a soil mass on application of a compressive stress can rather be placed either normally (laterally), or vertically or in both directions depending on how the soil mass is allowed to deform. When a vertical compression deformation is non-uniform it poses serious danger to the safety of structures and other civil engineering facilities, therefore there is need to study the compressibility properties of soil in Maryland.</p> <p><strong>1.1.1 COMPRESSIBILITY</strong></p> <p>       This is the degree to which a soil mass decreases in volume when supporting a load.  Compressibility is reduced in a situation where there are more coarse-grained soils in contact with each other. It increases as the proportion of small particles increases and becomes highest in fine-grained soils which contain organic matter.</p> <p>       Compressibility is approximately proportional to the plastic index. The greater the plastic index (PI), the greater the compressibility of the soil. (Adeyemi 2014).</p> <p><strong>1.1.2      PLASTICITY INDEX</strong></p> <p>This can be defined as the numerical difference between the liquid limit and plastic limit. The plasticity index is expressed in percentage of the dry weight of the soil sample and also it shows the size of range of the moisture contents at which the soil remains plastic.</p> <p>       The plasticity index also gives a good indication of compressibility. The greater the plastic limit the greater the soil compressibility (Ashworth 1966).</p> <p><strong>1.2  AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>       The aims and objectives of this project includes</p> <p>i.            To study compressibility</p> <p>ii.           To obtain the compressibility properties of soil in Maryland area.</p> <p>iii.         To obtain data that may be used in predicting the rate and the amount of settlement of structures in the area.</p> <p><strong>1.3 SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of this project is limited to obtaining the compressibility properties of soil in Maryland area.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>    i.        This project will help to understand the compressibility properties of soil in Maryland area which will reduce the problems that geotechnical engineers face in designing economic foundation for the required infrastructure in Maryland area.</p> <p>   ii.        The compressibility properties of the soil in the area obtained from labouratory test might be used to estimate the magnitude and the rate of settlement of a structure or an earth fill in Maryland area.</p> <p><strong>1.5 COMPRESSIBILITY PARAMETERS:</strong></p> <p>       To obtain the compressibility properties of soil in Maryland, labouratory test will be carried out to obtain.</p> <p>i.            Coefficient of compression/compression index (CC).</p> <p>ii.           Swell index (CS)</p> <p>iii.         Coefficient of compressibility (AV)</p> <p>iv.         Coefficient of volume compressibility (MV)</p>                                                          \n\nTHE COMPRESSIBILITY PROPERTIES OF SOIL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE COMPRESSIBILITY PROPERTIES OF SOIL", "id": 42}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p> <strong>EFFECTIVENESS OF QUALITY ASSURANCE STRATEGIES IN PROJECT EXECUTION</strong></p> <p><strong>(A STUDY OF ROAD CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN OWERRI)</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background Of The Study </strong></p> <p>Over the years, most projects in organizations especially those of the Zerock, Rhas and New Idea Construction companies in Owerri, might have been subjected to poor performance and abandonment following the inability of the management of such projects to apply quality assurance techniques in the execution of such projects. </p> <p>According to Jaideep (2009), the definition of quality varies in different contexts. On one hand, we talk of software quality that means adopting standards and measures to ensure the building of software product that meets all customer requirements (design, interface, business requirements, functional requirements, etc) and ready to deliver. On the other, hand, project quality refers to the standard and measures by means of building (or adopting) to ensure successful completion of a project, in terms of time and revenue. This starts right from initiation of the project to its implementation stage and continues to the post implementation stage. In the context of software-the quality means software strategy, plan, test cases, test scenarios, test results and fixing of bugs. Inclusion of quality in this context will vary from organization to organization and project to project (within an organization). This will ensure the successful building of software product ready for delivery. In the context of project, the quality would mean managing quality standards and measures for a project right from its initiation to all stages coming forth. A project life cycle in standard terms would comprise of project initiation, project planning, development execution, implementation, execution, project close-out, and post implementation phase broadly, which remains on-going till the software built is in use by the customers for a period of years (Jaideep, 2009). </p> <p>Also, according to the project management book of knowledge PMBOK (2005), to perform quality assurance means applying-the planned, systematic quality activities to ensure that the project employs all processes needed to meet requirements. Quality assurance is the application of planned systematic quality activities to ensure that the project will employ all processes needed to meet requirements. Quality assurance is the application of planned systematic quality activities to ensure that the project will employ all processes needed to meet requirements (PMBOK, 2005). A quality assurance department or similar organization often oversees quality assurance activities. Quality assurance supports, regardless of the unit’s title, may be provided to the project team, the management of the performing organization, the customer or sponsor, as well as other stakeholders not actively involved in the work of the project. Quality assurance also provides an umbrella for another important quality activity, continuous process improvement. Continuous process improvement provides an iterative means for improving the quality of all processes (PMBOK, 2005). Such quality assurance inputs as quality management plan, quality metrics, process improvement plan, work performance information, approved change requests, quality control measurement, implemented change requests, implemented corrective actions, implemented defect repair and implemented preventive action must be performed (Anyanwu, 2007).</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement Of The Problem </strong></p> <p> Many construction industries in Owerri had in the past delivered completed construction projects which fell short of design specifications and quality standard. (Ministry of Works, Owerri, 2012). </p> <p>Indeed, most of the roads hardly survived one rainy season. Many roads constructed in the past lack durability and reliability in that they cannot withstand the climatic and environmental challenges in Owerri. Examples of such roads include St. Johns Laboratory through Relief Market to Egbu road and Transfiguration road between IMSU Junction and MCC road junction. </p> <p>Experience has also shown that many project managers find it difficult to determine if quality assurance is effective for successful project execution in construction industries (Anyanwu 2007). It could also be dangerous for project completion if there are low performance indices due to inability to put in place quality assurance techniques in project construction. </p> <p>It is also painful, as experience has shown that many project managers are yet to develop a relationship between quality audit and input materials in construction firms. This could be compounded by the perceived poor attitude of project firms to quality assurance techniques (Kenny, 2010). </p> <p>It is in the light of the above problems that this research is conducted.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Objectives Of The Study </strong></p> <p> The major objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of quality assurance strategies on the execution and delivery of construction project. Specifically, this study is undertaken to: </p> <p>(a) Determine if quality assurance is effective for successful project execution in the construction industries. </p> <p>(b) Examine the performance indices for quality assurance in </p> <p>construction projects. </p> <p>(c) Determine the extent of application of quality audit to input materials in construction firms.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Research Questions </strong></p> <p> The research questions for this research work are: </p> <p>(a) Are quality assurance strategies effective for successful project execution in construction industries? </p> <p>(b) Are there performance indices for quality assurance in project construction? </p> <p>(c) Is there any relationship between quality audit and input materials in construction industries? </p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>Project managers will use this work to determine the essential roles which quality assurance can play in the satisfaction of project owners. Project workers will use this work to understand the need to improve their quality assurance skills. Project management </p> <p>consultants and project-based firms will use this work to educate their clients on quality assurance and improve the quality of their works respectively. </p> <p><strong>1.7 Scope And Delimitation Of The Study </strong></p> <p>This study seeks to investigate the effectiveness of quality assurance in project execution as it affects all projects in various organizations, but due to time and financial constraints, the researcher has chosen to focus on project organizations like Zerock, Rhas and New Idea Construction Companies. </p> <p>It is not only quality assurance that has effects on project execution, other factors like time management, motivation, project human resources development and project financial management all have impacts and effects on project execution. </p> <p><strong>1.8 Limitations Of The Study </strong></p> <p> There were a lot of constraints which the researcher </p> <p>encountered in the course of carrying out this research work. First, was the lack of sufficient funds to face the challenges of the research work. This was overcome by the intervention of relatives. It was difficult to educate the respondents on how best to complete the questionnaires administered to them. The researcher solved this problem by ensuring that the respondents filled the questionnaires in her presence.</p> <p><br/></p><p> REFERENCES  </p> <p>Alexander, A.

The purpose of this study is to determine the degree of compliance with the use of protective clothing and other safety control systems to improve the safety performance and productivity of workers in construction projects. Participants with many years of experience in site management in the state of Lagos, Nigeria, received a total of 128 (128) copies of the questionnaire. The data obtained based on the snowball and the random sampling methods were analyzed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 21, using the average scores, the index of relative importance (RII). The importance of each of the associated variables, which affects the safety practices of construction workers in construction projects, was determined by the Mann-Whitney U test, an independent sampling test. The descriptive result of the statistical analyzes showed that there is a great demand for security practices. The results of the study show that workers are dissatisfied with the effective use of protective clothing and its application to local operators, since it is difficult to adapt to traditional practices (RII = .776).unethical practice of workers due to human attitudinal peculiarities (RII=0.766), inadequate engagement of safety managers on sites  (RII=0.764), inadequate engagement of safety managers and ineffective supervision on site (RII=0.762) as well as poor communication between site managers and site operatives (RII=0.750) as factors preventing effective use of safety wears among the categories of respondents sampled. inclusion of safety matters from the planning stage, setting safety guidelines into conditions of contract, reward workers that exhibit excellent safety performance, conduct in-house safety training were found to be statistically significant with medium effect.

In some cases safety is considered a part of total quality management (TQM). In the international construction scene, the inclusion of both the traditional qualities and safety efforts within a TQM system is advocated by Dias and Curado (1996). They suggest that the TQM emphasis on the customer will lead to protection of the employee who is a vital customer. They write that safety record keeping would be improved and a needed safety culture comparable to the existing quality culture would result.<br/>Quality management has increasingly been adopted by construction companies as an initiative to solve quality problems and to meet the need of final costumer ( kanji and wong, 1998). As suggested by (Oakland and Aldridge, 1995) if ever an industry needed to take up the concept of total quality management (TQM),it is the construction industry. Alfred (1988) advances the view that construction very probably promises a greater pay back for performance improvement than any other service industry because of its magnitude.<br/>Over the years, a lot of attention has focused on the causes of occupational incident (Haslam 2005). When accident occur in the work place, it is important to understand what human factors may have contributed to the out come in order to avoid similar incidents in the future. Through developing and understanding of why and how incident occur, appropriate method for incident prevention can be developed (Williamson and Feyer 2002). In the past, any attempt to improve work safety or to control work place risk has focused on technical aspects and on the direct influence of human behaviour (Gadd and Collins 2002). Several papers have sought to identify specific safety management practice that acts as a predictor of safety performance (Mearns 2003). Through examining organization with good safety performance, it was intended to identify common features that are associated with good safety performance.<br/>This Research work will present a review of the literature on quality management and then on safety culture in construction industry. It will also use data from the studies on quality and safety in construction industry to further illustrate the problem of defining quality.<br/>1.2 Statement Of The Problem<br/>It is commonly known that accident have serious implication to the construction industry both in financial and humanitarian terms. Construction accidents may cause many problems such as:<br/>1 Demotivation of workers<br/>2 Disruption of site activities<br/>3 Delay of project progress and adversely affecting the overall cost, productivity and reputation of the construction industry (Mohammed, 1999).<br/>The primary problem to management system implementation success seems to be the nature of the construction process; the projects are very large; seldom situated in the same location and labour intensive; the work force tends to be transient; demand fluctuates, subject to the client is perception of the value of the construction project (Somerville, 1994). All of these are barriers or problems that have made implementation of management system to be almost impossible.<br/>Another problem to quality implementation is non- standardization. In the construction phase of a project, general contractors want to ensure quality through out the project. However, according to (Rowlinson and walker 1995), the construction industry is characterized by its non standardization. Very often, products are one- offs and the production processes are to some extent different from each other. Hence, no universal standard or specification can be applied to the product, which leads to difficulties in quality assurance. Changes to the design of a project are typical and may be frequent throughout the construction process. Quality is often at risk when there are excessive changes.<br/>1.3 Research Questions<br/>The following questions are raised in the research.<br/>1 what are the similarities between construction quality and safety?<br/>2 what crucial factors are measured in improving quality<br/>and safety performance?<br/>3. What are the benefits of quality and safety implementation?<br/>4 what are the possible methods used in implementing them?<br/> 1.4 Aim And Objectives<br/>This paper is aimed at examining the relationship between quality and safety and to explore how quality and safety can be operationalized in the construction industry.<br/>The following are the objectives to aid the achievement of the aim:<br/>1 To examine the current state of safety practices on building construction projects.<br/>2 To examine factors affecting site operatives from using safety wears on construction sites.<br/>3 To evaluate the decision making pattern of contractors in ensuring quality during the design and planning stages.<br/>Hypothesis of the study<br/>H0:-There is no significant difference between professional and site workers perceptions on factors preventing effective use of safety wears on construction sites.<br/>H1:-There is significant difference between professional and site workers perceptions on factors preventing effective use of safety wears on construction sites.<br/>1.5 Significance Of The Study<br/>Constructors, client and others in the design and construction team do see obvious benefits of quality and safety improvement. Chase (1998) concluded,<br/>“In the construction industry, application of TQM to the job site has been proven to speed – up project while increasing profitability”. Torbica and Stroh (1999) also concluded that, “for the first time an empirical study has confirmed that implementation of TQM is positively associated with home buyer satisfaction”. According to (McINtyre and kirschen man, 2000), Contractors do see benefits of quality improvement. More repeat customers and reduced rework.<br/>1.6 Scope And Limitations<br/>This research is restricted or limited to planning and implementing quality management and safety culture in achieving desired performance in the construction industry.<br/>The area location of this study will be limited to selected site at Asaba, Delta State metropolis. Some of the limitations to this research study are: lack of adequate finance, time restraint etc.<br/>1.7 Definition of Terms<br/>Occupational Safety and Health (OSH): is defined according to Alli (2008) as the study of the expectation, acknowledgment, assessment and control of hazards emerging in or from the work environment that could impede safety of operatives.<br/>Safety policy: is a strategy and commitment together with the arrangements on ground to create adequate safety education among workers on hazards related to their work and the role an individual/person needs to play at work settings in ensuring healthy working conditions. The goal and essence of establishing safety practices’ code and regulations on construction sites is to prevent, eliminate, curb, limit and total eradication if possible, the occurrence of accidents and injuries during and after the construction processes and as well train site operatives on safety programmes that will put all these in place.<br/>Health: Health, as defined by Longman’s Dictionary of Contemporary English, is a point of well-being both in body and mind and free from unknown injury. It is also defined according to Hughes and Ferret, (2005) as the assurance of the body and psyche of individuals from anticipated injury coming about because of materials, procedures or strategies utilized as a part of the working environment.<br/>Safety: According Gray (1990) safety is key to achieving success in construction project, is a state of being free from harm. In other word Safety is a state of being secured from accidents, hazard, injury or death due to measures put in place to prevent such from happening.<br/>Accident: Accident is therefore an impromptu occasion that resort into injury of individual or damages to property, plant, materials or environment or loss of business opportunities (Hughes and Ferrett, 2011).<br/>Productivity: Jarkas and Bitar (2012) define productivity as the ratio of using total input such as labour, materials, equipment, energy and capital to produce total output based on two measures.<br/>Site operatives: Site operatives in this research work are refers both skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers engaged in the physical construction of a building.<br/><br/>\n\nIMPACT OF QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND SAFETY CULTURE ON CONSTRUCTION PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND SAFETY CULTURE ON CONSTRUCTION PERFORMANCE", "id": 44}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EFFECTS OF AGGREGATE SIZES ON THE CONCRETE STRENGTH<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>1.1 GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>The relevance of road to life and its activities cannot be over emphasized.<br/>Road is as old as the origin of man and plays a vital role in the life of the people in communities, states, countries. It is quite obvious that life would have been very difficult without the existence of roads. Nigeria for instance acknowledged the importance of road such that the local, state and federal government are all involved in the development and maintenance of road network.<br/>History has shown that provision of roadway is a necessary tool for civilization.

On the sides of the proposed road are existing buildings and farm lands.<br/>The traffic capacity of the road is low because of the poor grading of the road.<br/>Because the road has not been properly paved, less pedestrians use the road and motorist prefer going through the longer way by passing through mass communication department when going to industrial center.<br/>When the road is properly improved, all these problems will be eliminated and a lot of benefit will be accrued, benefit to the intending business center as a result of more people using the road and reduction in travel time.<br/>1.3 GEOMETRIC DESIGN<br/>This is the aspect of the highway design that is solely meant to take care of the road user and level of service rendered to him. The paramount factor of consideration included expected traffic capacity, design speed and volume. O' Elaharty E. A in his book \"Highway Traffic Planning and Engineering states that proper geometric design will inevitably reduce the number and severity of highway accidents while ensuring high traffic flow with minimum delay. He continued by saying that improper design would result in the early obsolesce of the new highway with constant economic loss to the community.<br/>1.4FACTORS INFLUENCING THE CHOICE OF STATION<br/>a.Easy Measuring Condition: Stations were chosen to avoid obstacles during drainage or tape exercise.<br/>b. Intervisibility: Station were chosen and placed such that the station does not obstruct the other station line of sight.<br/>c.Tranversing at closed Distance should avoided: This is to avoid angular error that would be introduced there to target at short range not be properly bisected.<br/>1.5 FACTORS WHICH FAVOUR THE SELECTION OF ROUTE OR ROAD ALIGNMENT<br/>There are several factors which normally favour the selection of a route alignment for high way construction.<br/>i The route should be as straight as possible. This implies less cost of construction, maintenance and operation of vehicles as wear and tear on curves route are entirely eliminated.<br/>ii.Vertical and horizontal elignment should be eased out with maximum radius of curvature in relation to the design speed and maximum route of superelevation.<br/>iii. Good sight distance should be maintained. Sight distance or visibility is the distance measured along the center line of the road over which the driver can see the opposite object on the road for necessary application of brake.<br/>iv.Applicability of proper road drainage: Immediate evacuation of rain water on pavements as well as embarkment of a highway is necessary is to last till the end of the design life generally taken as 20years.<br/>v.Availability of road building materials such as stone, gravel, sand, laterite etc along the highways bring down the cost of the construction as well as maintenance cost.<br/>vi. Good formation soil should be ensured.<br/>1.6 AIM AND OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT<br/>This aims at giving student practical knowledge in the design of a roadway in order to aid her in designing a related project in real practice in future.<br/>1.7 SCOPE OF THE PROJECT<br/>The scope of this project includes the leveling, theodolite traversing of the road, design of the curve, soil investigation and pavement design of the route of study.<br/>en and W.

A structural project is initiated by the Engineer (Civil Engineer).<br/>The process of designing begins with the Engineers appreciation of the client’s requirements. After the specification given to the Engineer by Architect according to the requirement of the client, the Engineer develops different structure scheme from the Architect plan and designed load, which will help him to know the axils load and neutral axis where the structure is liable to settle and develops sagging or hogging due t o improper use of rein for cement bar. Having considered the use of material and erection methods and then comes up with the final work of full structural analysis and detailed design.<br/>Structural detailing can be defined as the process by which the design Ota structural system is drafted in a form that a builder can use for construction for easy establishment.<br/>Also structural drawing is the principle means by which the designer communicates his requirements in a clear and unambiguous manner to the builder.<br/>This project outlines the important components and basic techniques and methods required for structural detailing of a reinforced concrete duplex.<br/>The structural drawing is simple to interpret, dimensions are clear. Bar bending schedules showing now the reinforcement bars are to be bend a real so provided. This is essential to the quantity survey or cost estimates of the project and to the steel to supply and also to the iron bender to determine the bends dimension.<br/>A summary of design specifications, information and structural consideration a re provided standard scales and abbreviation are used to ensure the uniformity. The structural elements, beans, column, slabs, foundations have been detailed and shown in plans, elevations and sections.<br/>It is therefore believed that this project will fulfill its requirements and serve its purpose of guiding the reader through the process of basic structural detailing.<br/><br/>\n\nSTRUCTURAL DETAILING OF A REINFORCED CONCRETE STRUCTURE - DUPLEX \r\nBUILDING FOR MR INNOCENT I.

It consist of two layers the cement slab and the snobs of granular material or stabilized soil.<br/>These two large are sprees I n separate construction operation.<br/>1.10           ADVANTAGE OF RIGID PAVEMENT <br/>This types of pavement has long life, when properly design constructed.<br/>It has low maintenance cost<br/>The reinforcement made it not flexible <br/>1.11           DISADVANTAGE OF RIGID PAVEMENT <br/>(i)                 Trans cracking of concrete paving slab under combined flexural and direct tensile stress is inevitable.<br/>(ii)               Longitudinal crack slab more than one lone wide is also inevitable  <br/>1.12           FUNCTION OF PARTS OF THE PAVEMENT STRUCTURES <br/>SUB-GRADE:           This bears the load of pavement and traffic load in other to reduce the effective thickness, the bearing capacity is reduced by<br/>(a)        Proper Compaction     (b)        Stabilization <br/>(c)                Proper drainage  <br/>1.13           THE SUB – BASE<br/>This is introduced due to poor bearing capacity of the sub grade soil or high traffic density. It is made to improve earths its function is to transmits the traffic load from the road and spreading as jet over a large area of the sub grade formation level. <br/>1.14           ROAD BASE<br/>The function of the base is bearing the late load from the traffic and long heed from the over wearing surface and spreading it uniformly over a large area of the sub grade or sub-base.<br/>1.15          SURFACING (WEARING COURSE)<br/>The weary course is to spread the wheel load to the road base against surface water. The presence of bitumen improves the water proofing property. It also provide skid resistance.<br/>1.16          PAVEMENT FAILURE<br/>Pavement is bound to fail for many reasons not ably localized depression or settlement, but the most but the most common is lack of maintenance. From the day one pavement is exposed to traffic, the pavement is subjected to destructive forces. Temptation change settlement, precipitation and run – off and other natural phenomenous that stress the pavement structure increase addition of the load of traffic on the pavement increases the rate of failure. The serviceability or rider quality of a new pavement declines shallowly at first but as years pass rider quality begins to deteriorate mush more rapidly if maintenance is neglected and the situation is been worsen. The cost of rehabilitation must surly increase visual inspection can be used to determine pavement condition and degree of failure.<br/>1.17           RUTTING<br/>A known depression in the pavement parallel to the side is sevialy slight when the depression measures less than ½ + 1 inch deep, but not deep enough to pavement steering usually water accommodate in the depression,  promoting pavement failure. This depression can also be caused by traffic loading more than the bearing capacity of the pavement or by poor construction method.<br/>1.18           CORRUGATION <br/>The corrugation or coach boarding is a form of plastic movement.  Ripples and visible in the pavement perpendicular to this direction of traffic. The condition is slightly with barely visible sever when the ripples are so prevalent that they require the diver to reduce speed.<br/>1.19          REVEALING <br/>A braking of the visible loose particles or pieces of aggregates considered slightly when only a few piece of aggregate are dislodged from the pavement and are loosely silting above the street surface. Moderate when enough piece of loose aggregate are present to cover wide area of the surface and survey when the loose aggregate is so prevalent that they make the surface rough.<br/>1.20          FLUSHING <br/>This occurs when asphalt covers the aggregate on the pavement. It is slight the covering is noticeable moderate when long areas are covered and serves when asphalt is totally covering the aggregate.<br/>1.21           ALIGATOR CRACKING<br/>This occurs when crack is like skin of alligator. The crack are said to be slight when barely visible, moderate when the cracks are more than 6.25mm wide in some place but side and cracks not fully separated. They are usually associated with a gianular untreated base that has failed with a resident sub grade.<br/> 1.22           POT HOLE<br/>These are bower or cup shaped holl of various sizes in the pavement resulting from localized disintegration. They are usually caused by weakness in the pavement resulting from too little asphalt or too tin asphalt or too many fine too few fire or poor drainage.<br/>1.23          DISTORTIONS<br/>These are normally caused by too little compaction or too many fines in the surface course or settlement like cracks distortion take a number of different forms channeling, corruption, shoring, depression and uphaueaved pavement distortion is any change in the pavement surface from its original shape. <br/>1.24           UPHEAVAL <br/>Localized upward displacement that is due to swelling of the sub-grade on some portion of the pavement. It is commonly cause by ice penetration in the sub-grade it may also be caused by swelling effects or moisture on exposed soils.<br/>1.25           SPALLING EDGES <br/>This is a result of the vehicle travelling along the edge of the carriage way or to the continual absorption of surface water. These are deep potholes shallow pot holes which constitutes a very dangerous treat to both life and property including passing traffic on the road. It is normally experienced at the edge of a flexible carriage way where a separate channel course.  <br/>1.26           SUMMARY OF PAVEMENT FAILURE<br/>The pavement fails because the sub-grade, base course wearing surface course has failed. Sub-grade failure results when the applied load on soil expells all then water and air pressure in pores of the sub grade combined with the force produce by the applied force such as plastic deformation si progressively under repetition of load and is the major course of road failure. Insufficient stability of soil which may be as a result of excessive moisture, improper compaction of soil itself may be another coarse of pavement failure.<br/> BASE FAILURE <br/>(a)                Poor  materials used in the base course<br/>(b)               Loss of binding or inter locking properties of the materials.<br/>(c)                Loose of material from base course<br/>(d)               Loose of factual support to the base course <br/>(e)                Poor drainage both for surface and sub surface improper and inadequate compaction<br/>(f)                Poor proportions of the materials<br/>1.27           WEARING COURSE MAY FAIL DUE TO <br/>(a)                Improper quality of binding in the mix<br/>(b)               Inferior quality of binding used<br/>(c)                More than required quality of binder<br/>(d)               Inadequate of binding used<br/>(e)                Volatilization and oxidation of binder which make bitumenous stalling brittle and course cracking of the surface.<br/>1.28          RECONNAISSANCE SURVEY <br/>A visual survey was carried out to investigate the following<br/>(a)                The topography and feature along the road<br/>(b)               The nature and types of pavement materials<br/>(c)                The drainage pattern in relation to expected run off<br/>(d)               The pavement profile, sup--- elevation, depth and construction material <br/>(e)                The pavement is of flexible type, made of asphalt with crush stone.]<br/>(f)                Poor drainage system – the installed drainage system is not available and so causes water to percolate around the pavement. <br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nINVESTIGATION ON THE CAUSES OF PAVEMENT FAILURE ALONG HILLVIEW OFF ESBS ROAD ENUGU<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INVESTIGATION ON THE CAUSES OF PAVEMENT FAILURE ALONG HILLVIEW OFF ESBS ROAD ENUGU", "id": 49}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>STRUCTURAL DETAILING IN REINFORCED CONCRETE OF A THREE BEDROOM <br/>DETACH DUPLEX, IN AZUIYIOKWU ABAKALIKI  EBONYI STATE<br/>PREFACE</b><br/>In structural detailing, the project is initiated by the structural engineer.

It is obvious that life would have been very difficult without the existence of roads.<br/>Nigeria for instance acknowledged the importance of good road network such that the local, state and federal government are all involved in the provision, development and maintance of roads in the country in other to boost economic aquaculture and commercial activities in the nation<br/>History has shown that provision of grod road network is an important tool for civilization. Roads are of optinman benefit to the people in the sense that it brings about industrialization, commercialization in a community and also ease traffic cevgestion and facilitates the movement of agicultural products from the nrel areas to urban centers.<br/>            AIM OF THE PROJECT<br/>            The aim of the project is to pwide the student with the practical knowledge in the design of a road way with a bid to help the student execute such related project in real practice in tntive <br/>            It is also aimed at marrying they with practice and also at during information on the nature and effectiveness of the subgrade material and suggort what should done with the aid of test results to alleriate parement failine <br/>            RECONNAISSANCE SURVEY <br/>            This is a quick type of survey or rapid examination of the ground and its adjacent natural features usually made without survey instruments to limit the alterate route in terms of cost to one or two<br/>FACTORS NORMALLY CONSIDERED IN RECONNAISSANCE SURVEY<br/>-          over all cartage of goods<br/>-          Nearness to road material quauires<br/>-          Traffic conditions<br/>-          Soil condtions<br/>-          Right of way or road land<br/>-          Ruling gradient<br/>-          Type of road surface <br/>-          Number of major and minmor buildges<br/>-          Approximate length and cost<br/>-          Curvature along the alignment<br/>GEOMETRIC DESIGN<br/>This is the aspect of the high way design that is solely meant to take care of the road user and level of service rendered to him. The paramount factor of consideration include; expected traffic design speed and volume. Elaharty E.A. in his book “High way Traffic planning and Engineering states that proper geometric design will inevitably reduce the number and seventy of highway accidents while ensuring high traffic flow with minimum delay. He continued by saying that improper design would result in the early deterioration of the new high way with constant economic loss to the community.<br/>            FACTORS, WHICH FAVOUR THE SELECTION OF ROUTE OR ROAD ALIGNMENT<br/>            There are a number of factors, which favour the selection of a rounte or toad alignment for constriction and they include; <br/>-          The route should be as straight as possible. This implies least cost of construction, maintenance and operation of velicles as wear and tear on curved routs are entirely eliminated<br/>-          Vertical and hnizontal alignments should be eased out with maximum radius of curatous in relation to design speed and maximum rate of super elevation<br/>-          Good sight distance should be maintained sight distance or visibility is the distance measured along the centre line of a road over which the driver can see the opposite object on the road for the necessary application of brake and stopping of vehicle to avoid any accident.<br/>-          Applicability of proper road drainage: immediate evacuation of rain water on pavements as well as on the embitterment of a high way is necessary if the high way is to last till the end of the design life generally taken as 20 years.<br/>-          Availability of road building materials such as stone, grarels, ard, laterite etc along the highway bring down the cost of construction as well as maintenance cost <br/>-               Freedom from slides should be ensoud for construction on hilly areas of cuts it is necessary to ensure that the construction the road does not produce earth cutting slides or earth cutting slipes<br/>-          Good soil formation should be ensured strurborn soil normally provke early deformation and soft cutting and result in costly constructions.<br/>-          Avoidance of impaired visibility: The alignment should cross another road or railway alignment or stream preferably at right angles to ensure visibility at these crossings.  <br/>            SCOPE OF THE PROJECT<br/>            The scope of the project includes leveling operation, traversing of the road, soil estuation, design of cure and pavement design and drainage.<br/><br/>\n\nROUTE SUREY AND DESIGN OF PAREMENT OF ROAD LINKING FERDERAL SECRETANIAFE, INDUSTUAL CENTEN AND MASS COMMUNICATION I.M.T.

These persist to the present day and can be found in a band across the regions of the South Western Asia and North Africa extending from Aghanistan to Morocco.  A cross section a long a qanat ie shown in fig 1.1 typically, a gently sloping tunnel dug through alluvial material leads water by gravity flow beneath the water table at its upper end to a ground.<br/> FIG 1.1<br/>             A vertical cross section along a qanat surface outlet and irrigation canal at its lower end.  Vertical shafts dug at closely s paced intervals provide access  to the tunnel.  Qanats are laboriously hand constructed by skilld workers employing techniques that date back 3000 years.<br/>            Iran possesses the greatest concentration of qanats; here some 22,000 qanats supply 75 percent of all water used in the country.  Lengths of qanats extend up to 30km, but most are less than 5km.  The depth of the qanat mother well (see fig 1.1) ie normally less than 50m, but instances of depth exceeding 250m have been reported.  Discharge of Qantas varies.  Seasonally with water table fluctuations and seldom exceed 100m3/hr.<br/>GROUNDWATER THEORIES<br/>            Utilization of groundwater greatly preceded understanding of its origin, occurrence, and  movement.  The writing of Greek philosophers to explain origins of springs and groundwater contain theories ranging from fantasy to nearly correct accounts.  As late as the seventeenth century it was generally  assumed that water emerging from springs could not be derived from rainfall, for it was believed that the quantity was in adequate and the earth  too impervious to permit penetration of rain water for below the surface.  Thus, early Greek philosophers such as Homer, Thates and Plato hypothesized that springs were formed by seawater.  Conducted  through subterranean channels below the mountains, then Aristotle suggested that air enters cold dark caverns under the mountains where it condenses into water and contributes to springs.<br/>            The Roman philosophers, including Seneca Pliny, followed the Greek ideas and contributed little to the subject.  An important step forward, however was made by the Roman architect Vitnvius he explained the now accepted infiltration theory that the mountains receive large amounts of rain that percolate through the rock strata and emerge at their base to form streams.<br/>            The Greek theories persisted through the Middle Ages with no advances until the end of the Renaissance.  The French Poffer and Philosopher Bernard Palissy (1510 – 1589) reiterated the infiltration theory in 1580, but his teachings were generally ignored.  The German astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571 – 1630) was a man of strong imagination, who likened the earth to a huge animal that takes in water of the ocean, digests and assimilates it, and discharges the end products of these physiological processes as groundwater and springs.  The seawater theory of the Greeks, supplemented by ideas of vapourizaton and condensation processes within the earth, was restated by the French Philosopher Rene’ Descarfes (1596 – 1650).<br/>            A clear understanding of the hydrologic cycle was achieved by the latter part of the seventeenth century.  For the first time theories were based on observations and quantitative data.  Three European countries made notable contributions, although others contributed to and supported these advances.  Pierre Perrault (1611 – 1680) and estimated runoff of the upper sein drainage basin.  He reported in 1674 that precipitation on the basin was about six times the river discharge, thereby demonstrating false the early assumption of inadequate rainfall.  The French Physicist Edme Mariotte (1620 – 1684) made measurements of the same of paris and confirmed paraults work.  His publication appeared in 1686, after his death, and contained factual data strongly supported the infiltration theory.  Meinzer once stated.  Mariotte probably deserves more than any other man the distinction of being regarded as the founder of groundwater hydrology, perhaps I should say the entire science of hydrology”.  The third contribution came from the English astronomer Edmund Halley (1656 – 1742), who reported in 1693 on measurements of evaporation demonstrating that sea evaporation was sufficient to account for all springs and stream flow.<br/>RECENT CENTURIRES<br/>            During the eighteenth century fundamentals in geologic were established that provided a basis for understanding the occurrence and movement of groundwater.  During the first half of the nineteenth century many artesian wells were drilled in France stimulation interest in groundwater.  The French hydraulic engineer Henry Darcy (1803 – 1858).  Studied the movement of water through sand.  His treatise of 1856 defined the relation, now known as Darcy’s law, governing groundwater flow in most alluvial and sedimentary formations.  Later European contributions of the nineteenth century emphasized the hydraulics of groundwater development.  Significantly contributions were made by J. Boussineq, G.A. Daubree, J. Dupuru and A. Thiem.  In the twentieth century, increased activity in all phases of groundwater hydrology has occurred.  Many Europeans have participated with publications of either specialized or comprehensive works.  There are too many people to mention them all, but R. Dachler, E. Imbeaux, K. Keihack are best known in the United States.  <br/>            American contributions to groundwater hydrology date from near the end of the nineteenth century.  In the past 90 years, tremendous advances have been made.  Important early theoretical contributions were made by A. Hazem, F.H. King while detailed field investigations were begun by men such as T.C Chamberline, N.H Darton through his consuming interest in groundwater and his dynamic leadership of groundwater activities of the U.S geological survey, stimulated many individuals in the quest for groundwater knowledge.  In recent decadeds the publications of M.S. Hantush, C.E. Jacob.  Within the lat 20 years the surge in university research on groundwater problems, the establishment of professional consulting firms specializing in water resources, and the advent of the digital computer have jointly produced a competence for development and management of groundwater resources that was nonexistent hereto fore.<br/><br/>\n\nGROUNDWATER DEVELOPMENT FOR PORTABLE WATER SUPPLY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " GROUNDWATER DEVELOPMENT FOR PORTABLE WATER SUPPLY", "id": 55}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE STRENGTH OF CONCRETE MADE FROM VARIOUS AGGREGATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The work has gone a long way in determining strength of concrete made of various aggregates such as granites stone, black gravel, washed gravel and surface gravel.<br/>Some factors such as porosity of the  aggregate temperature coursing lose of water plate form for mixing of concrete mix affect the workability and eventually the strength of concrete.<br/>This project work consist of using hydraulic machine to carryout the compressive test of the strength of concrete made of the earlier mentioned aggregated.<br/>From the result obtain, it is quite clear that their strength are not the same,<br/>The result also reflect the strength of aggregate since their strength  can be directly determined.<br/>The finishing from these works show the strength of these aggregates and also reflect the standard of work that these aggregate can be used for concreting.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE                                                            <br/>1.1              Introduction                                                               <br/>1.2              Project objective                                            <br/>1.3              Particle sized distribution                              <br/>CHAPTER TWO                       <br/>2.1              Concreting                                                     <br/>2.2              Testing of cubes                                                         <br/>CHAPTER THREE                                                       <br/>3.1     Discussion of result                                           <br/>3.2     Result                                                                                        <br/>3.3     Conclusion and recommendation                                             <br/>Bibliography                                                                    <br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>RETAINING WALLS<br/>Retaining walls are structures used in providing stability for earth or materials where conditions do not give room for the material to assume its natural slope and are mostly used to hold back soil banks, coal or over, piles and water.<br/>Retaining walls are distinguished from aone another based on the method of achieving stability.<br/>There are six type of retaining walls and are:<br/>i.                    The gravity wall<br/>ii.                  The cantilever wall<br/>iii.                The counterfort retaining wall<br/>iv.                Buttressed retaining wall<br/>v.                  The crib walls<br/>vi.                Semi-gravity wall<br/>Bridge abutments are often retaining walls with using wall extension to retain the approach fill and provide protection against erosion.

(Rit Craig 2nd edition soil mechanical published by van nostrand rain hold co.ltd) <br/> Retaining wall design goes on with the choosing of tentative dimensions, which are then analyzed for stability and structural requirements. Since this s a trail process overall solution to the  problem may be obtained, all of which are satisfactory.<br/> CANTILEVER RETAINING WALL<br/>The cantilever wall is a reinforced concrete wall that utilizes cantilever action to retain step.

Stability of this wall mainly depends on the mass of the soil on the heel behind the wall. <br/>Dimensions for a retaining wall should be adequate for structural stability and to satisfy local building code requirement.<br/>The date shown below may be used where no other data is available but may result in a overly conservative design.

The toe pressure will be too much such that only a part (Bowles J-E and (Hansen and Peck) of the footing will be effective.<br/> A better is increasing in order to save materials. A front better is more acceptable so that the forward wall movement to develop active pressure is not noticeable. <br/>A slight increase in wall stability is usually  obtain when the battler is on the Bach face (Ref Bowles J.E) see fig 1-3 below for illustration.<br/>RANKING THEORY<br/>Ranking theory deals with pressure within a soil mass under the following condition (ie assumptions)<br/>i.                    The wall is vertical<br/>ii.                  The retaining wall face is smooth<br/>iii.                The wall yield above the base and satisfies the condition of plastic equilibrium<br/>iv.                It is isotropic<br/>Ranking theory applies when the soil  mass is in so called rankling sate.<br/>When a soil mass is allowed to explain (active earth pressure) or contract (passive earth pressure rapture surface will form within the mass. if not interrupted by the back of the retaining wall or other strictures, the mature surface will be aeries of straight lines making an angle  1 with the horizontal.<br/>Active earth pressure i = 45 + Ø/2<br/>Passive earth pressure i = 45 – Ø /2<br/>When the state above exists, the soil is said to be in the Rankin state and the Rankin theory is applicable.<br/>Where pa and pp = unit active and passive earth pressure respectively, at a depth   Z<br/>  q= vertical pressure or load due to the weight of the soil above  Z<br/>C = cohesion strength of the soil<br/>Ka and kp – coefficient of active and passive earth pressure respectively<br/>Ka = 1-sin Ø,  kp =1+ sine Ø :.<br/>           1x sinØ              1 sinØ             <br/>According to ranking theory, earth pressure increase linearly with the depth of the same manner as the lateral pressure exerted by a fluid.

It should  also be clear that it is  not the height it used for computation if max. Shear and bending moment that is used for sliding computation to get the driving force. It is left for the design to decide whether to use passive pressure from the soil in front of the toe and whether the soil covering the top portion will be available for existing over  turning moment and sliding. Sometimes this is not considered. Just for conservative purpose<br/>The triangular pressure diagram on the stem,wil yield a shear diagram that is a  third degree curve.<br/>The use of the different equations for shear and moment seems to be easier.<br/>This  enables the roped computation of the cut off points for there in forcing steel since it is uneconomical to use a constant amount of reinforcement for the entire wall height.<br/>From the diagram shown below. The with of the base slab is deduced from the gross. Soil pressure diagram before computing the shear and moments diagrams. The   eccentricity of computed by equation (iii) and (iv) shown below.<br/>Differential equations can also be used to compute the shear and moments of the base slab if the safe of the cane is desired and even when numerical values are required.<br/>  CONTERFORT RETAINING WALL<br/>Counterfort retaining wall, are similar to  the cantilever retaining wall only that this type has counterforts built behind to hold the wall (stem) and base together and is used where the cantilever is long or for very high pressure behind the wall this counterforts behinds the wall are subjected to tensile forces.<br/>The dimension indicated in the diagram below, only act as a guide, some walls which are about 100mm to 150mm thick have been built in area like united Kingdom. Any thickness which satisfies stability of the wall can be used.<br/>Relative costs of forms, concrete, enforcement and labour will determine to use of counterfort but it is doubtful if a counterfor wall  will  provide any relative construction economy values it is over 7m is height.<br/>The spacing in the counterforts is based on the trail and error in other to   huiumise cost. The most economical method is placing them 1/3 to ½ H (height) apart. by conventional beam theory bending moments in the face slab cantilevered part of the wall  as at the interior if the length of over hang is made 0.411 and a spacing between counterforts of L.<br/> 200 – 300m<br/>The counterfort will may be constructed with out a toe if additional front clearance is needed and sliding and overturning stability requirements are met. <br/>  Design dimension for a counterfort wall<br/>FORCES ON A COUNTERFORT WALLS<br/>Counterfort walls are described as indeterminate problem. this can be solved by the use of plate theory of the expense of large amount of labour. Simplified methods are commonly used in the solving of this problem which makes it to be over-designed the weight of the counterfort is not considered in the design.<br/>A simplified and conservative solution to a counterfort wall problem is in the diagram shown below (gig 1-7). The face slab of the wall is considered as continuous slab constituting series of equivalent unit –width beam since the pressure distribution is triangular, the equivalent beam should be analyzed for strips at the junction of the wall and base and at two or three intermediate location between the top of the wall and base so that  adjunctions in reinforcing steel can be made as the pressure decrease moment distribution can be used to find the bending moment, although due to approximations being made continuous beam coefficients maybe used for lower strip wh2/12 or wl2/14may be used because of the lower edge being fastened to the base while for the upper strips, wl2/9 or wl2/10 can be used for a conservative solution or method. The same coefficients for both positive and negative moments maybe employed as the designer consider appropriate the toe of the base is considered as a  cantilever beam and heel as a continuous beam, similar to the treatment of the  shrinkage steel should be satisfied in the directions not steel should be  satisfied in the directions not analysed in this manner the counterfort member may be considered as a wedge shaped T-beam, which include the applicable portion of the wall tem as the flange, bat these beams are so massive that the concrete stresses will be so low that an analysis is usually not required. Tensile steel will be required at junction of the base (heel) and the counterfort to resist the moment, fending to tip the wall over and the quantity can be conservatively computed treating the conuterfort along as a beam. Tensile steel will also be required running horizontal from the counerfort into the stem to tie the wall and counterfort together. in some case, the bound stress requirements of this reinforcement control the slope of the counerfiort member.<br/>             Huntington (1957) presented a method in the diagram below. the also recommended a value for one in  the middle half of the wall, at the base of  0.2qH to be used as long as he ratio of  counterfort spacing to the wall height L/H &gt; 0.5 BOWLES J.E 1982.<br/>qL2/10 for top strips for stem with an average ‘q’ on unit strip<br/>qL2/10 for top strips near the bottom of stem because of fixity of stem to base.<br/>qL2/10 for  all strips in the heel use an average net q for heel pressure. consider both rH and the upward actins soil press.<br/>Computation of bending moment in horizontal direction for the counterfort stem (Huntington 1957)<br/>  qs = Ws + Wcb<br/>            b<br/>qb = Pa sin B<br/>            b                                                        <br/>q1b = Pb1 sin B<br/>            b<br/>q=W1_ qs +qb+q1b<br/>qnet =qs+q2b+qb+W11-4<br/>NOTE: The increase in heel pressure due to moment is <br/>W 1=2.4m: W1 = W1  = 2/3W1b<br/>            6<br/>MT == toe moments value at front face of wall.<br/>Note that W1 is parabolic but may be approximated as a uniform pressure W11 <br/>            W11 =w1/b<br/>Assure pressure q1b, qb and q are constant and uniformly distributed across b<br/>If B-O the is only q and will W1 to consider since W11 qb and q1bare small he design will usually be sufficiently accurately to neglect these pressure<br/>THE GRAVITY RETAINING WALL <br/>This type of wall depends on its weight in other to achieve stability, just as the name implies. it also depends used in the constriction <br/>No reinforcement is provided except in concrete walls where a nominal amount of steel is placed near the exposed faces to prevent surface cracking due to temperature changes (shrinkage)<br/>Typical dimension for gravity walls maybe taken as shown below. Generally, gravity walls have trepezodial shape but it can also be constructed with broken backs. The base and other dimensions are designed and constant in such a way that the resultant falls within the middle on third of the base. The top width of the stem should be on the order of 0,30m. if the heel perfection is only 100 to 150mm, the coulomb equation may be used for evaluating the lateral earth pressure, with the surface of sliding taken along the  back face of the wall. The Rankin solution may face of used on a section taken through the heel. Due to the massive proportions and resulting low concrete stress, low strength concrete can generally be used for the wall construction.<br/>            A critical section for analysis of tensile flexure stress will occur, through the junction of the toe portion at the front face of the wall.<br/>i.                    Tentative dimensions for a gravity retaining wall <br/>ii.                  Broken –back retaining wall<br/> FORCES ON GRAVITY RETAINING WALL<br/>            The active earth pressure is computed by using either the rackine or coulomb methods if the coulombs method is used it is assured that  there is incipient sliding on the back face of the wall, and the  earth pressure acts at the angle of wall frication to a normal with the wall. The rackine solution applies to Pa acting at the angle B on a vertical plane through the heel.the vector can then be added to the weight vector of the edge of  magnitude of the resultant Pa and the wall.

Generally the task of maintaining a heating environment through good sanitary disposal or waste has a become increasing difficult in west Africa and  most developing countries of the world. This is due to such factors as population explanation rapid urbanization, industrialization increased use prepared (package products, changing lifestyle towards out door recreation etc (WAHEB) 1999. a close study of solid waste management has clearly shown that these factors have generated corresponding problems such as  blocked gutters and drainage channels, traffic congestions. overcrowdings, over flooding air pollution and even ineffective refuse management, poor refuse management in out cities has been as associated with other  problems  such as sporadic fireboat breaks, spread of  diseases and distortion of aesthetic value of our environment (Lucas and Giles1990).<br/>            Varies types waste are generated in Enugu, namely solid waste, liquid waste (sewage ad industrial waste (chemical fluent).<br/>            This study is concerned with solid waste which comprises refuse from homes offices and market places. Enugu from its statue as the state capital ,has now become an international commercial center with the recent development in the state (ie the new international center which attracts larger influx of residents and tourists.<br/>            Various attempts have been put in place by the state and local government in the past to enforce refuse management scheme. These effort failed because of poor implementation of these lifting policies the problem of refuse management has assumed a social problem in Enugu, today especially as the Enugu state environment sanitation agency (ENSEPA) appears in capable of handling the task and members of the public appear ignorant and  not ready to co-operate with the authority in keeping Enugu clean like in other cities in Nigeria, the problems of refuse management in Enugu metropolis have defied realistic refuse management solution. This poses gave concern to well meaning citizen of the state<br/>1.2 STATEMENTS OF PROBLEMS<br/>            The one- time held historical and cultural reputation the Enugu city was the cleanest city in Nigeria is fast fading away. in its place great Pyramids of  refuse are found at every junction and street corner begging for removal despite of public out cry, public enlightenment programmes on personal hygiene and environmental health. The refuse heaps blocks the gutters and drain, obstruct traffic flow,, pollute the air encourage instead and trident breeding and the spread of  disease.<br/>            The National sanitation exercise which was introduce  by the head of state General Mohammed Buhari (1984) had then help to check indiscrimate differing of refuse along the streets, but today the story is different since the assumption of chief Olusugn Obasnjo as the president of Nigeria he put an end to it.<br/>            Even with the  introduction of monthly environmental sanitation any the state government it is still unable to meet the standard.<br/>            Refuse was formally collected from house  to house and transferred into a open van. but today the ones that are  still use are put in smaller vehicles and not properly covered, as the vehicle moves on almost all of it spill on the street.<br/>            In view of all the above problem of refuse manager in Enugu metropolis, appear enormous with the local government inadequately positive to tackle it.<br/>            It is the focus of this research project to come up with findings and possible solution to the problem  refuse management in Enugu metropolis.<br/>1.3              OBJECTIVE OF STUDY<br/>The general objective of this study is to critically examine the refuse management problems in Engu metropolis in terms of patterns, storage and final disposal with a view to findings solution to Len.<br/>The specific objectives, however include<br/>1.                  To identify the various methods of refuse management applied in Enugu metropolis<br/>2.                  To asses the effectiveness or adequacy of the existing system of refuse management in Enugu metropolis<br/>3.                  To  identify eh specific problems associated with refuse management<br/>1.4              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is significant to the extent that the findings will ascertain the problems arising from effective and inadequate refuse management  and its implication on public health, the study is also important as it findings will beneficial to the state and local government public health sector in their planning of refuse management programs.<br/>1.5              DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>For purpose of under standing of this study definition of certain terms as are applicable to this study will be advance.<br/>1.                  REFUSE: These consists of heterogeneous mass of deposited waste particle from the house hold, office, market places etc as well as homogenous accumulation of agricultural industrial and mineral waste. it therefore include all participle and non-particle solid waste with the exception of bar waste (exceeta) (Wahab 1991).<br/>2.                  MANAGEMENT: As a process by which responsible persons in an organization (managers or executives at all  levels of management) combine resources (men.

Good transportation system through the pavement design has in the recent years provide to be of much significance commercially and otherwise history testifies that the provision of roadways is necessary to draw a country out of a state of uncivilization, but that civilization is not attained until good road network between neigbours is made so easy that the local difference which brench narrowness is minimized.<br/>However this project has been designed strictly to modern design standards e.g ASSHO method and it centers on the route survey and pavement design of the road to meet with the present day effective services.<br/>Moreover, this project work could really sever as a future guide in making a new rural  road, down to industrial layout to connect mass comm..<br/>Therefore being in a school environment a good transportation  system will improve the  healthy studying condition of the new road pavement and maintenance of the existing one.<br/>1.1              RELEVANCE OF PROJECT<br/>The roadway linking Federal Secretariat industrial centre and Mass Communication Department is an earth road of about 0.620km in length whose origin can be traced back to the origin of the I.M.T campus III environment.<br/>The project work has its relevance centered on the general design of a roadway which will link federal secretariat, industrial centre and Mass communication Department in order to ensure a hitch free traffic especially to the lecturer, visitors and students making use of that industrial centres<br/>However the improvement  of this roadway would grieve the students and lecturers the service of belonging as it gives easier access to masscom. Department.<br/>1.2              SITE INSPECTION<br/>This project site which is the roadway linking Federal Secretariat industrial centre and Mass Communication Department was inspected to ascertain its location and the present state of  the road. It was vividly observed that the area was a dusty roadway throughout its length and had been  graded without siderains, spanning about 620m length with the width of 85m.<br/>To obtain these information, a preliminary survey was carried out which also helped to ascertain the geological and soil conditions  likely intervals forming the chainages to be referred to until the construction ids brought to a completion.<br/>1.3              EVALUATION OF ROAD NETWORK W NIGERIA<br/>There are three types of roads in Nigeria<br/>-                      Grade I: Surface dressed road<br/>-                      Grade II: laterite on natural soil road<br/>-                      Grade III road on nature soil<br/>Road, which were built earlier in Nigeria, were built as grade III roads, which consist of roads built on level earth. This grace of road was  subsequently improved to grade II roads, which comprises of stone laterite on soil and on general surface roads.<br/>Ultimately, the road was improved to grade I which is laterite road with good surfacing. The surfacing is either asphalted concrete for flexible pavement (in this project work flexible pavement will be considered).<br/>The progressive method of road construction produced  very durable roads but because of this rapid growth of traffic on the grade I and II this method of road construction was discontinued and surface dressed roads were built.<br/>Road development receive a set back due to the development of railway in the country between 1895 and 1910 but was only revitalized early 1960when highways were built to connect various party of the country. Today, there is virtually on state capital (if not local government area headquarter) that is not linked directly by a highway.<br/>1.4              MOTOR VEHICLE CHARACTERISTICS THAT AFFECT ROAD DESIGN DATA<br/>In design of road, the current physical characteristics of ehicle in use and the anticipated future improvement in se are all essential. These vehicles are evaluated in terms f a standard vehicle known a design vehicle. The design data for a road stretch include: aix load, axle space, overall length, eight and width of the design vehicle.<br/>1.                  Length: The length of the vehicle will affect the extra widening at curves and minimum turning radius the passing sight distance the road capacity and parking facilities for example 12m are recommended for a single unit truck while 20m (19:812m) for Troilus<br/>2.                  Width: The width of the vehicle will affect the  lane width the width of shoulders and the width of parking spaces. AASHO recommends a maximum width of 2.59m.<br/>3.                  Height: The height of the vehicle will affect the overall height distance provided under structure such as: bridges, overhead bridges electric services lines etc. the maximum height for vehicle should not be more than 4m.<br/>4.                  Weight: The weight of vehicles affects the thickness of the pavement, ruling and limiting gradient and design of bridges.<br/>5.                  speed: vehicle affects horizontal and vertical alignment design elevation limiting radius, signal distances, width of pavement on straight and curves for the purpose of this project a design speed of 30km/n is been considered. He design speed is the maximum speed maintainable throughout the journey with compatible safely and comfort)<br/>1.5              DRIVER AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS<br/>A driver could be a vehicle rive, cyclist or pedestrian. There are no average drivers as the capabilities of a driver changes under such effects as fatigue ,frustration, monotony and alcohol. Much speed is the primary cause of accident.<br/>Drivers have different visual perception capabilities to tract promptly to conditions requiring positive action<br/>The major driver characteristics considered are:<br/>1.                  Reaction time: this is the period of time, which elapses from the period the eye of a driver registers a sene to the time muscular reaction occurs.<br/>2.                  perception time: this is the period of the much elapses before reaction time begins. AASHO recommends combined reaction plus perception time tobe2.5 sec and can be taken as 3 sec in complex situations.<br/>1.6              RECONNAISSANCE SURVEY<br/>This is a quick type of surveyor rapid examination of the ground and its adjacent natural features usually made with out survey instruments to  limit the alternate route in terms of cost tone or two.<br/>In the cause of this project, there reconnaissance survey was carried out in order to obtain a first hand view of the road by walking through the length of the road thereby having a clear picture of the entire roadway. This is also helped in determining the most suitable way of carrying out the project economically in time and energy. During the process of reconnaissance, survey stations were chosen and marked.<br/>1.6.1        CHAIN SURVEY<br/>The method adopted in marking linear measurement is the linear measurement in which a employed in making a direct measurement is dependent of the degree of accuracy required. However in cause of this project, accuracy in measurement was maintained to a moderate level. Obstacle such as rough ground, pedestrian traffic and motor cycle traffic were avoided as much as possible.<br/>1.6.2        STATION MARKING<br/>The survey stations were marked in such  way that will fulfill the following requirement. <br/>a.                   The stations where to be easily and quickly found during survey operations.<br/>b.                  They were to be fairly permanent so that pedestrians will not easily remove them.<br/>c.                   They were marked using bottle tops and nails at the center line of the road for easy location of these stations, temporary stations were established at the edge of the road using wooden pegs.<br/>1.7              FACTORS AFFECTING THE CHOICE OF STATION<br/>These factors include the following<br/>1.                  Easy meaning condition: stations are to be chosen in such a way as to avoid obstructs during draining or tapping exercise.<br/>2.                  Inter-visibility: stations are to be chosen and placed in such a manner that no station on struts the line of sight of another stations. This was considered for both traversing and leveling.<br/>3.                  Traversing at close distance should be avoided in order to avoid angular errors being introduced if targets at short range are not properly bisected.<br/> <br/>\n\nROUTE SURVEY OF ROAD AND PAVEMENT DESIGN  (REHABILITATION/MODERNIZATION)\r\nCASE STUDY:  ROAD LINKING FEDERAL SECRETARIAT INDUSTRIAL CENTRE AND MASS COMMUNICATION DEPARTMENT (IMT CAMPUS III), ENUGU\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ROUTE SURVEY OF ROAD AND PAVEMENT DESIGN  (REHABILITATION/MODERNIZATION)\r\nCASE STUDY:  ROAD LINKING FEDERAL SECRETARIAT INDUSTRIAL CENTRE AND MASS COMMUNICATION DEPARTMENT (IMT CAMPUS III), ENUGU\r\n", "id": 59}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OF A RETAINING WALL<br/>TABLE CONTENTS</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>Introduction<br/><br/>Retaining walls<br/><br/>Cantilever rw<br/><br/>Rankin theory<br/><br/>Forces on cantilever rw<br/><br/>Counterfort  rw<br/><br/>Forces on counterfort rw<br/><br/>The gravity rw<br/><br/>Forces on gravity rw<br/><br/>Semi gravity rw<br/><br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/><br/>Stability of retaining wall<br/><br/>Soil properties of rws<br/><br/>Drainage in rw<br/><br/>Allowable bearing capacity<br/><br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/><br/>Procedure for the design of rw<br/><br/>Cantilever rw<br/><br/>Analysis example<br/><br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/><br/>Design of retaining wall<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>NOTATION USED IN THIS PROJECT<br/><br/>1.         Angle of internal friction of soil                     -                                   O<br/><br/>2.         Unit weight of sol                                           -&amp;<br/><br/>3.         Sat unit wt                  -           &amp;sat<br/><br/>4.         sauntered unit wt                    - &amp;sub<br/><br/>5.         Overturning moment   -           Mo<br/><br/>6.         Base width of container wall -           B<br/><br/>7.         Overall height of wall             -           H<br/><br/>8.         Effective height of wall          -           He<br/><br/>9.         Height of stem            -           h<br/><br/>10.       Effective depth           -           d<br/><br/>11.       Overall depth  -           d<br/><br/>12.       Weight stem                -           we<br/><br/>13-       Weight soil                  -           ws<br/><br/>14.       Surcharge                    -           S<br/><br/>15.       Active pressure on wall           Pa<br/><br/>16.       Passive pressure on wall          Pp<br/><br/>17.       Breadth for design      -          <br/><br/>18.       Sum of vertical weight                        -           Ew<br/><br/>19.       Point of application of the resultant   X<br/><br/>20.       Eccentricity                                         -           e<br/><br/>21.       Sum of moments                                 -           Em<br/><br/>22.       Characteristic strength steel    -           fy<br/><br/>23.       “          “          ‘           concrete           -           fcn<br/><br/>24.       Lever are factor                                   -           z<br/><br/>25.       Lever are                                                         Z<br/><br/>26.       Ultimate shear stress               -           Vc<br/><br/>27.       Shear force                                          -           V<br/><br/>28.       Shear stress.                                        -           v<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>RETAINING WALLS<br/>Retaining walls are structures used in providing stability for earth or materials where conditions do not give room for the material to assume its natural slope and are mostly used to hold back soil banks, coal or over, piles and water.<br/>Retaining walls are distinguished from aone another based on the method of achieving stability.<br/>There are six type of retaining walls and are:<br/>i.                    The gravity wall<br/>ii.                  The cantilever wall<br/>iii.                The counterfort retaining wall<br/>iv.                Buttressed retaining wall<br/>v.                  The crib walls<br/>vi.                Semi-gravity wall<br/>Bridge abutments are often retaining walls with using wall extension to retain the approach fill and provide protection against erosion.

It should  also be clear that it is  not the height it used for computation if max. shear and bending moment that is used for<br/>Forces on cantilever wall (a) entire unit; free bodied for (ii) stem,(ii) toe, (iv) heel.

Sliding computation to get the driving forces it is left for the designer to decide whether to use passion pressure from the soil in front of the toe and whether the soil covering the top portion will be available for existing over  turning moment and sliding. Sometimes this is not considered. Just for conservative purpose<br/>The triangular pressure diagram on the stem, will yield a shear diagram that is a  third degree curve.<br/>The use of the different equations for shear and moment seems to be easier.<br/>This  enables the roped computation of the cut off points for there in forcing steel since it is uneconomical to use a constant amount of reinforcement for the entire wall height.<br/>From the diagram shown below. The with of the base slab is deduced from the gross. Soil pressure diagram before computing the shear and moments diagrams. The   eccentricity of computed by egns (iii) and (iv) shown below differential equations can also be used to compute the shear and moments of the base slab if the safe of the cane is desired and even when numerical values are required.<br/>CONTERFORT RETAINING WALL<br/>Counterfort retaining wall, are similar to  the cantilever retaining wall only that this type has counterforts built behind to hold the wall (stem) and base together and is used where the cantilever is long or for very high pressure behind the wall this counterforts behinds the wall are subjected to tensile forces.<br/>The dimension indicated in the diagram below, only act as a guide, some walls which are about 100mm to 150mm thick have been built in area like united Kingdom. Any thickness which satisfies stability of the wall can be used.<br/>Relative costs of forms, concrete, enforcement and labour will determine to use of counterfort but it is doubtful if a counterfor wall  will  provide any relative construction economy values it is over 7m is height.<br/>The spacing in the counterforts is based on the trail and error in other to   huiumise cost. The most economical method is placing them 1/3 to ½ H (height) apart. by conventional beam theory bending moments in the face slab cantilevered part of the wall  as at the interior if the length of over hang is made 0/4h and a spacing between counterforts of L.<br/>200 – 300m<br/>The counterfort will may be constructed with out a toe if additional front clearance is needed and sliding and overturning stability requirements are met.<br/>FORCES ON A COUNTERFORT WALLS<br/>Counterfort walls are described as indeterminate problem. this can be solved by the use of plate theory of the expense of large amount of labour. Simplified methods are commonly used in the solving of this problem which makes it to be over-designed the weight of the counterfort is not considered in the design.<br/>A simplified and conservative solution to a counterfort wall problem is in the diagram shown below (gig 1-7). The face slab of the wall is considered as continuous slab constituting series of equivalent unit –width beam since the pressure distribution is triangular, the equivalent beam should be analyzed for strips at the junction of the wall and base and at two or three intermediate location between the top of the wall and base so that  adjunctions in reinforcing steel can be made as the pressure decrease moment distribution can be used to find the bending moment, although due to approximations being made continuous beam coefficients maybe used for lower strip wh2/12 or wl2/14may be used because of the lower edge being fastened to the base while for the upper strips, wl2/9 or wl2/10 can be used for a conservative solution or method. The same coefficients for both positive and negative moments maybe employed as the designer consider appropriate the toe of the base is considered as a  cantilever beam and heel as a continuous beam, similar to the treatment of the  shrinkage steel should be satisfied in the directions not steel should be  satisfied in the directions not analysed in this manner the counterfort member may be considered as a wedge shaped T-beam, which include the applicable portion of the wall tem as the flange, bat these beams are so massive that the concrete stresses will be so low that an analysis is usually not required. Tensile steel will be required at junction of the base (heel) and the counterfort to resist the moment, fending to tip the wall over and the quantity can be conservatively computed treating the conuterfort along as a beam. Tensile steel will also be required running horizontal from the counerfort into the stem to tie the wall and counterfort together. in some case, the bound stress requirements of this reinforcement control the slope of the counerfiort member.<br/><br/>            Huntington (1957) presented a method in the diagram below. the also recommended a value for one in  the middle half of the wall, at the base of  0.2qH to be used as long as he ratio of  counterfort spacing to the wall height L/H &gt; 0.5<br/>qL2/10 for top strips for stem with an average ‘q’ on unit strip<br/>qL2/10 for top strips near the bottom of stem because of fixity of stem to base.<br/>qL2/10 for  all strips in the heel use an average net q for heel pressure. consider both rH and the upward actins soil press.<br/>Fig 1-7, reduction of the complex analysis of a counterrfort  RW to a system of simple beans for rapid design.<br/>qnet<br/>q=W1_ qs +qb+q1b<br/>qnet =qs+q1b+W11-qf<br/>NOTE: The increase in heel pressure due to moment is<br/><br/>W 1=2.4m: W1 = W1  = 2/3W1b<br/>            6<br/>MT == toe moments value at front face of wall.<br/>Note that W1 is parabolic but may be approximated as a uniform pressure W11<br/>            W11 =w1/b<br/>Assure pressure q1b, qb and q are constant and uniformly distributed across b<br/>If B-O the is only q and will W1 to consider since W11 qb and q1bare small he design will usually be sufficiently accurately to neglect these pressure<br/>THE GRAVITY RETAINING WALL<br/>This type of wall depends on its weight in other to achieve stability, just as the name implies. it also depends used in the constriction<br/>No reinforcement is provided except in concrete walls where a nominal amount of steel is placed near the exposed faces to prevent surface cracking due to temperature changes (shrinkage<br/>Typical dimension for gravity walls maybe taken as shown below.

The base and other dimensions are designed and constant in such a way that the resultant falls within the middle on third of the base. The top width of the stem should be on the order of 0,30m. if the heel perfection is only 100 to 150mm, the coulomb equation may be used for evaluating the lateral earth pressure, with the surface of sliding taken along the  back face of the wall.

Thus, this project examines the effect of sewage effluent contamination on the permeability of the soil.<br/>    Permeability is known to depend among other factors, on the void ratio and porosity of the soil sample. However, it has no effect on the affinity of the soil for water.<br/>    It follows that factors which increases the void ratio of a soil sample, also increases its permeability as more water is likely to pass through soil with larger voids.<br/>    Since sewage effluent is liquid pollution, which contains some microscopic solid particles, these particles tend to plug up pore passages and at the same time cause a decrease of permeability with time.<br/>    This shows that sewage effluent, although is very important to soil users in agriculture, its effect on the permeability and other engineering properties is not commendable.<br/>                            TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION.<br/> <br/>1.1        Definition of terms <br/>1.1.1 Permeability<br/>1.1.2.

Permeability is an important engineering property, which governs the rate of flow of aquifer. Hence, permeability in its simplest term is the ease with which water can flow through soil. <br/>1.1.2.         Sewage effluent <br/>Sewage is the wastewater of a community consisting of human excreta, urine and sullage. Solid forms a very small percentage (0.1%) of fresh sewage. Sewage may contain pathogenic organisms, organics and nutrients. Hence, sewage must be treated before discharge in order to prevent pollution of surface and underground water source. Sewage exerts biological oxygen demand in rivers, which depletes oxygen. Besides, being rich in nutrients (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus), sewage causes in receiving water algal bloom and autrophication. Generally, supplying it with oxygen treats wastewater, so that bacteria may utilize the waste as food.<br/> 1.1.3.         Compaction: <br/>Compaction means processing the soil particle close to each other by mechanical methods. Air during compaction, is expelled from the void space in the soil mass and, therefore, the mass density is increased. Compaction of soil mass is done to improve its engineering properties. Compaction generally increases the shear strength of the soil, and hence the stability and bearing capacity. It is also useful in reducing the compressibility and permeability of the soil.<br/>Compaction of soil is required for the construction of earth damage canal embankments, highways, runaway, and in many other engineering applications.<br/> 1.1.4.                   Failure:<br/>Dense sand shows initially a volume decrease in a drained test, but as the strain increases, the volume starts increasing. The loose sand shows a volume decrease throughout.<br/>In case of loose sand, the specimen bulges and ultimately fails by sliding simultaneously on numerous planes. The failure in this case is known as brittle failure.<br/>1.2    Aims and objectives  <br/>Most ancient structures collapse, mainly due to lack of knowledge on permeability. Properties such as permeability help an engineer, to determine the suitability of soil for some engineering works.<br/>Hence, modern civil engineering works allows for site investigation, which includes the determination of the permeability relative to the soil which would be used for the work. <br/>The main aims of this research are. <br/>•To determine the maximum dry density (MDD) of soil, thus increasing its shear strength and bearing capacity. <br/>•To determine the rate of seepage of water through a given soil sample. <br/>•To determine how permeability of soil is affected by sewage effluent of different levels of pollutal strength.<br/>1.3 Scope of the research <br/> This research will be carried out using soil sample, collected by digging one meter below the ground level, from a farm land located nearby the junior staff quarters. The sewage effluent will be   collected from the university of Nigeria treatment tank, by varying the quantity of sewage used.  <br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF SEWAGE EFFLUENT ON THE PERMEABILITY OF SOIL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF SEWAGE EFFLUENT ON THE PERMEABILITY OF SOIL", "id": 61}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>COMPARING THE STRENGHT AS BLOCKS MADE FROM<br/>(1)     CEMENT AND LATERITIC SOIL<br/>(2)        CEMENT AND RED EARTH<br/>(3)        LATERITE, SAND AND RED EARTH</b><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>            This case study is “comparing the strength of blocks made from: cement stabilized laterite blocks, cement stabilized red earth blocks and sand,  red earth and laterite blocks and mud blocks dried in the kiln.<br/>            This project implement the following analysis<br/>(1)               To  effect  reduction to the  rise in market price of sand (fine aggregate), cement blocks to substitute literate blocks.<br/>(2)               To determine the strength of the cement stabilized blocks of literate soil in the soil laboratory with a view to have an alternative in the building industry.<br/>(3)               To analyse the existing laterite soil and evaluate it’s suitability for use as a good building material by means of various tests.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>PROJECT BUILDING MATERIALS<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>PREPARATION OF MATERIALS<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>PREPARATION OF CUBE<br/>CASTING OF THE STABILIZED MATERIALS<br/>CURING OF SPECIMENS<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>FIRING OF BLOCKS IN KILN<br/>TESTING OF BLOCKS<br/>COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH TEST<br/>CALCULATION OF RESULTS<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>DISCUSSION OF RESULT<br/>COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH TABLE WITHT EH CMENT MORTAR BLOCKS<br/> CHAPTER SIX<br/>RECOMMENDATION<br/>CONCLUSION<br/>REFERENCES<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>            This project was obligated to present in o n e volume of the fundamental and practical information in the field of comparing the strength of blocks made from: cement and lateritec soil, cement and red earth and sand, red earth and lateritic soil and mud blocks fired in the kiln which may be useful to people involved in civil and structural engineering and particularly those that found pleasure in the design and construction of buildings, bridges and culverts and related structures.<br/>            Due to high cost of sand in the market, the comparative analysis of stabilized laterite blocks, red earth blocks and sand blocks have revealed t hat one can definitely substitute the stabilized laterite blocks and mud blocks in place of sand blocks to reduce the cost of the entire building or used stabilized laterite blocks where there are no sand in such an area where the work is going to be sited.  A great have been done throughout this work, although it is limited in scope to assess their suitability as standard concrete aggregates.<br/>THE PROJECT BUILDING MATERIALS<br/>            To obtain the materials used for these project such as red earth, laterite, sharp sand, and cement, we had to move to the outskirts of Enugu State.  Cement was bought from the famous Keyatta market in Enugu.  The market is well known for the sales of building materials in the state.  Cement was added to the mixture during mixing, to give the mixture a good binding when in shape and also increases the strength of the blocks.  The brand of cement used was ROCK CEMENT.<br/>            The red earth material known as mud was obtained at 9th mile corner in Ngwo, at the outskirts of Enugu.  It was dug from a depth, to make sure that it has not been mixed with foreign or any other material.

important branches of transportation system.  Highway Engineering deals with the planning, design, construction and maintenance/repair of road system.<br/>Furthermore, road transportation contributes to the economic, industrial and cultural development of a country.  The importance of road transportation is comparable to the veins in the human body.  Just as veins in the human body maintains health by circulation of blood to different parts of the body, similarly, a good road keep the health of a Nation in good condition by keeping the goods and people moving from one place to another place.  Thus, road is vital for the all-round development of a nation, or region, since every commodity needs road transportation facilities both at the production stage and as well as distribution stage.  In the production stage, road transport is needed for carrying raw materials such as seeds, manure in the case of food production, cotton, coal, steel and sugarcane, etc, in the case of cloth and sugar industry and many more.  In the distribution stage road transportation is required to transport finished products from farm and factories to the distribution centers.  Students used road transportation to go to school, workers, business men and women and so many other categories of people need road transport for their day to day activities for the running of their business, office, etc.<br/>Finally, for the economic, cultural and social development of a country an effective and adequate means of road transport is very essential.<br/>1.1     SCOPE OF THE PROJECT<br/>          This project is aimed at finding out the causes of the pavement failure on this route, 278.2m long and the possible way of rehabilitating it so as to enhance easy, efficient and comfortable flow (movement) of traffic in the road.  Survey and soil analysis were also carried out for the purpose of generating data for the design.  Information and specific features from Federal Ministry of Works were also utilized during the Engineering design of the road.<br/>1.2     DEFINITION OF HIGHWAY, ROAD, STREET AND EXPRESSWAY<br/>          Some terms like highways, roads and streets have precise meanings, though they are often used loosely in practice.<br/>          A highway is therefore defined as an arterial road facility designed for high speed and high volume traffic in the non-urban areas.  For example, the National road network of a country is called the National Highway Network.<br/>          A ‘road’ is defined as a lower order of highway (facility), designed for relatively lower speed and lower volume of traffic in the non-urban (rural) areas.  They can be district roads or village roads.<br/>          A ‘street’ can be defined as an urban road facility for low speed and high  or low volume of traffic movement.  The traffic on the street road is high at the pick period (time) and relatively low at the non pick period.<br/>          An ‘expressway’ or ‘Express Highway’ in order hand can be said to be a superior type of highway facility with full or partial control of access.  They are generally provided with divided carriageways, controlled access, and grade separations at cross-roads.  It is called freeway in USA.<br/>1.3     FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF ROADS<br/>          It is necessary to classify functionally the road system of a country for the following reasons:<br/>(i)                   To facilitate administration of the roads, assigning responsibility to administer roads of different classes to different organization.<br/>(ii)                  To assign appropriate design standards to different classes.<br/>(iii)                To facilitate the planner to develop an integrated and harmonious road network for the country.<br/>Universally, roads are classified into two broad categories:<br/>(i)                   Urban roads   (ii)     Non-urban (rural) roads.<br/>Urban roads are those which are located within cities, towns and other inhabited areas and come under the jurisdiction of municipalities, cantonment boards and post trusts.<br/>Rural roads are those that are located in the non-urban areas and connect cities and towns across the country.<br/>The urban roads are further classified functionally into the following broad hierarchy:<br/>(1)         Expressways:  These are urban roads whose central portion is reserved for high speed vehicle with full or partial control of access.<br/>(2)         Arterial roads:-  These are urban roads which are meant for through traffic, usually on a continuous route.<br/>(3)         Sub-arterial roads:-  These are urban roads which provide lower level of travel mobility than the arterial roads.<br/>(4)         Collector roads:-  These are urban or city roads which are constructed for the purpose of collecting and distributing the traffic to and fro local roads or streets.<br/>(5)         Local roads:-  These are urban roads which provide access to residential, business and other buildings.  They may be residential commercial or industrial.<br/>The Non-urban roads or rural roads are classified as follows:<br/>(1)     National Highway (N.H):        These are roads which traverse the length and breadth of the country and are of national importance.  They connect commercial or industrial centres with airports, seaports, states capitals, foreign highways, and large towns.  They can be deemed to be the primary road network of the country and in Nigeria for example, it is being constructed and maintained by the federal government.<br/>(2)     State Highway (S.H):  These roads are the main arteries of traffic within a state.  They connect district headquarters with state headquarters, connect national highway system and highways of neighbouring or adjacent states.  These are constructed and maintained by the state government.<br/>(3)     District roads also known as local government roads:  These roads take off from the main roads in a state to the interior of the districts or local government areas.<br/>(4)     Village roads (V.R):  These roads connect villages and group of villages with one another and to market places and district roads.  They are being constructed and maintained by local government boards or through donations and community efforts.<br/>1.4     IMPORTANCE OF A GOOD ROAD NETWORK SYSTEM<br/>          A road development programme opens up new avenues of employment agriculture, industry, commerce, health and sanitation of the environment. <br/>Besides providing employment and creating basic infrastructure for economic development in all direction, road holds the key to the economic and social progress including higher food production, improvement in the living standard of the people and opening up of the rural communities and the country in general.  The construction of road changes the character and intensity of land use by making a significant contribution towards balanced regional development and industrial growth.  In short, the importance of roads can be summarized as follows:-<br/>1.            The improvement of road increases the land value of the near by areas.<br/>2.            It helps in the development of agriculture and natural resources of the area<br/>3.            The roads help in transporting rural produce such as vegetables, fruits, etc. in a very short time to the cities and the farmers get better price for their produce, which helps in improving the economic conditions of the rural areas.<br/>4.            It helps in the development of commerce and increases the political activities in an area.<br/>5.            It helps in better fire and police protection and national defence.<br/>6.            A new road shortens the distance and improves speed.  It also opens up new avenues for exchange of goods and services.<br/>7.            It helps in medical, educational and sanitation facilities of an area<br/>8.            It helps in famine and flood relief e.t.c<br/>1.5        DISADVANTAGES OF ROAD TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM<br/>It is often said that any thing that have advantages also have some disadvantages, for this reason, the disadvantages of road transportation system includes the following:<br/>(1)     Safety:  One of the serious disadvantages of road transport is its poor record of safety.  The reason is not far to seek because the vehicle move on road space which is shared by all the vehicles and hence crossing and overtaking manoevres are potential hazards.  Road accidents have become a serious menace, claiming enormous economic loss to the nation. <br/>(2)     Environmental Pollution:  Road transport is one of the major causes of sources of environmental pollution.  Noise, fumes, vibration, loss of aesthetics, ribbon development, clutter of advertisements along highways, these are some of the ill-effects.<br/>(3)     Parking problem:  Road transport has caused parking problem of serious proportions in city streets.<br/>(4)     Energy:  Road transport consumes greater energy per passenger km and tone km.  though the road transport has some disadvantages, its advantages still supercedes the disadvantages and cannot be over-emphasis with.<br/>  <br/>\n\nREHABILITATION OF ROAD LINKING UMUEKULUMMIRI STREET TO IMT AWARNESS GROUND JUNCTION IMT \r\nCAMPUS III ENUGU\r\n<div

Wash – basins, water closets and sinks together with rain and discharges into public sewers, septic tanks, soakaways or cesspools.<br/>The construction of drain is therefore principally concerned of the Manson. It is accomplished by constructing the road so that it has a crown and by sloping the shoulders and adjacent areas so as to control the flow of water either towards existing natural drainage, such as open ditches, or into a storm drainage system of catch basin and underground pipes. If a storm drainage system is used as it would be with city streets, the design Engineer must give consideration to the total area drainage unto the street, the maximum rate of run-off expected, the duration of the design storm, the amount of ponding allowable at each catchments area and the proposed spacing of catch basin along the street. From this information the desired capacity of the individual catch basin and the size of the underground piping network are calculated.<br/>In designing facilities to carry run-offs from pavements, the Engineers must determine the area to be drained, the maximum probable precipitation over the drainage basin, the highest expected run-off rate, and then using this information must calculate the required capacity of the drainage structure.<br/>Generally designs are made adequate to accommodate not only the largest flow ever recorded for that may be expected under the most adverse conditions for a given number of years.<br/>Factors considered in calculating the expected flow through a culvert opening include the size, length and shape of the entrance and down stream end of the conduit, the maximum allowable height of water at the entrance, and the water level at the outlet.<br/>There is a trend to use designs that permit drainage structure yard. Such procedures permit better control of the work. For example with recast concrete pipe section, it is often possible to avoid building small box culverts in the field. Circular culverts of large diameter are now also constructed in the same way.<br/>1.1       IMPORTANCE OF WATER DRAINAGE<br/>Water drainage as an elemental part of Civil Engineering Construction plays an importance role which makes it very significant when it comes to the act of practicing maintenance culture.<br/>To this end in every construction process, drainage should be given due consideration. In residential buildings, water drainage system is very importance so as to get rid of waste water and storm water from the building and thereby preventing the building from excessive dampness and by so doing providing good maintenance for the building.<br/>Aside the fact that drainage system in residential building prevents excessive dampness, it also prevents excessive flooding.<br/>Another area in construction where drainage system can highly be appreciated is road and embankment construction. In road construction, water drainage are primarily designed to prevent excessive flooding of the paved surface thereby preventing wearing away of the surface and also make it more accessible during and after storm.<br/>In the light of all these significant roles played by water drainage system, necessity has made it mandatory for any existing structure or proposed structure to have a water drainage system.<br/>Resolving a water drainage system involves a lot of activities especially where the water drainage is to control excessive flooding or where it is to be designed for water logged area. The designing water drainage system there is need to anticipate the position of future structure erections so as not to hinder the aesthetic nature of future construction process.<br/>Another importance fact is that for good effective water drainage system to be developed, there is need to construct a filter along the drainage channels because of the retention capacity of the soil within the campus area. The soil consist mostly later tic clay which has the ability to retain water for a long period of time. As this will be detrimental to the life span of the water drainage channel to be constructed, it is that masonry lining for the water drainage channels be constructed also. <br/>1.2              OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The objectives of the study work shall cover all the vital aspect of the drainage problems system. The first stage of this project work shall include the reconnaissance survey of the area covered by the campus, nothing the land scope and modal points ways, the effects of flood and erosion more prevalent, the catchments area and tributaries of the storms water that constitute the major part of the erosion and flood because it is quite noticeable that during the raining seasons that most of the road leading to campus and within the campus becomes in-accessible for motorists and part of the building, lecture rooms are highly flooded.<br/>The next is to found out which type of the drainage system exists and the orientation, direction of the drainage channel.<br/>Another objective where the study is going to lover is the type of hydraulic drainage design, the study shall also highlight the serviceability and cost effectiveness of the method adopted that is to say whether the design is made of press-stressed concrete or in-site concrete.<br/>On the reasonable part of it, this study shall highlight more on the solution to this water drainage problems<br/> <br/>\n\nTHE WATER DRAINAGE PROBLEMS (A CASE STUDY OF IMT CAMPUS 3 ENUGU)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE WATER DRAINAGE PROBLEMS (A CASE STUDY OF IMT CAMPUS 3 ENUGU)", "id": 66}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CONSTRUCTION OF A SIX RAISED PANEL DOOR<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    Introduction <br/>1.1    Definition of a panel door<br/>1.2    Classification of a door<br/>1.3    Objectives of the project<br/>1.4    Significance of the project<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0    Timber<br/>2.1    Definition of timber <br/>2.2    Growth of timber<br/>2.3    Types of timber<br/>2.4    Conversion of timber   <br/>2.5    Methods of conversion of timber<br/>2.6    Characteristics of a timber<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0    Seasoning of timber<br/>3.1    methods of seasoning<br/>3.2    Importance of timber seasoning <br/>3.3    preservation of timber<br/>3.4    Ways of timber preservation<br/>3.5    Uses of timber<br/>3.6    What is a wood<br/>3.7    Classification of trees<br/>3.8    Characteristic of hard and soft wood   <br/>3.9    Types of wood<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.0    Construction of the panel door<br/>4.1    Estimation (materials list) of a panel door<br/>4.2    Hand tools<br/>4.3    Machine used<br/>3.4    Assemble procedure<br/>3.5    Diagram of a panel door<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>5.0    Joint<br/>5.1    Definition<br/>5.2    Types of joints<br/>5.3    Finishing materials used in a panel door<br/>5.4    Conclusion <br/>5.5    References <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION TO DOOR<br/>        A door is a solid barrier that is fixed in an opening in a wall to hinge , pivot or slide pen (or close).<br/>        The door opening or door way allows access and agrees from  building and between rooms, compartments and corridors.  As a component part of a wall he door and if frame are integral to the overall performance of the wall.<br/>        Doors are meant to provide access to the room of a building. They may be constructed of wood, plywood, glass, metal or a combination of these materials they are located in such a way that easy movement and privacy of the room is achieved. For this reason the door are generally placed at the corner of the room in one line. This provides good ventilation and easy movement of the users.<br/>1.1    DEFINITION OF A DOOR<br/>A door can be defined as a hinged, sliding or revolving barrier at the entrance of a building, room or vehicle or in the framework of a cupboard.<br/>1.2    CLASSIFICATION OF A DOOR<br/>          Wood door may be classified as:<br/>-      Paneled doors<br/>-      Flush doors<br/>PANELED DOOR<br/>          Paneled doors are frame with stiles and rails around a panel or panel of wood  or ply wood because the door is hinged on the side to open, it tends to sink on the lock stile.<br/>        The stile and rails have to be joined to resist the tendency of the doors to sink.<br/>FLUSH DOOR   <br/>        A variety of flush doors are manufactured with plain flush faces both sides and fibreboard facing press moulted often with comparatively shallow sinking to resemble the appearance of a paneled door.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT<br/>        This project is aimed at using timber towards the construction of the panel door by the carpenters.<br/>        It will try to examine some of the importance of timber to the student while undertaking the project endeavour in using timber in the construction of a pane door.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>        The essence of this project is to draw the attention of the students, carpenters and individuals in constructing a panel door using timbers.<br/>        This research draws the attention of the individuals to the need of timber for construction of a panel door as well as its uses in storing and making a panel door.<br/> <br/>\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF A SIX RAISED PANEL DOOR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\"

of information basically on the structural detailing of reinforced concrete members of a story building, in a sloppy land with a retaining wall.  Structural detailing is a branch of structural work that transposes the idea of works of a structural engineer into working drawings for easier utilization in the building construction.  Working drawings are drawings produced by engineers for easy execution of a plan by builders.<br/>            The drawing also shows the interrelationship between the architectural and the engineering design, it shows all the construction detail properly as they relate to the other with no attempt of separation of diverse materials. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>Introduction of Project<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0       Detailing

drawing mostly done by architecture in connection with the design being provide by the structural engineer.<br/>            It is the work of a structural engineer to design an object such as bridges, railways, dams, roads, buildings and so on.   The design comes up in the hand sketch first after which the design are put together into a clear and presented working drawing used by builders or contractors often taken to the authority involve for approval.<br/>            The drawing will show the interrelationship of all the parks that go together to make the ground design drawing.  All the general construction details are shown properly as they relate to the other with no attempt of separation of diverse materials.<br/>            A good drawing should provide the following information.<br/>a.                   Overall dimension<br/>b.                  Interrelationship of material, equipment and the space schedule of finishes<br/>c.                   Doors and windows type and sizes<br/>All detailing works developed by the detailer serves a good purpose of standing the risk of sudden of buildings.  It also helps to avoid unnecessary delay of work, which may come up

These same types of concrete are made under the same mix proportion.<br/>Another purpose also is to know the compressive strength of concrete at different ages.<br/> <br/>\n\nEFFECTS OF AGGREGATE SIZES ON THE CONCRETE STRENGTH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF AGGREGATE SIZES ON THE CONCRETE STRENGTH", "id": 69}]
