The early approaches and establishment of the function in so many organization.</p> <p>Organization and methods is simply the used  of work study techniques to the structure and procedures of an organization in order to improve the efficiency of an organization.</p> <p>Organization and  methods has transformed into a very valuable component of an organization. In fact it become a specialized field with career prospects, especially for our teaming unemployment. It provide opportunities that are both challenging and satisfying  to the average intellectual employee to prove his with  in improving and processes.</p> <p>The British standard 3188.1001 defines organization and methods as the systematic examination of activities in order to improve the effective use of human and other material resource.</p> <p>According to Harzel (2001) defines organization and methods \"is the application of work study techniques to the structure and procedures of an organization in order to improve the efficiency of an organization system.</p> <p>Briscoe (1992) defined organization and methods \"as a specialist function which has a primary objective of improving efficiency and control in organizations. It is  thus seen as an essential function that should be part  of the make  u of any organization.  Organization and method and it associated techniques can be seen to form the basis of business process re-engineering and business process improvement.</p> <p>1.1     <strong>BACKGROUND  OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The must important reason of introducing organization and method is to improve administrative procedure and clerical practice in the office. Therefore its equally important to be familiar with  the  definition of office: -</p> <p>Office can be deafen as a work area  for handling information or process equipment.</p> <p>Office can also be seen as a place of work on the other hand it has been seen as a place where business activities are carried out. In which ever way an office is defined, it is to be noted that the world of work bring about the existence of office.</p> <p>Office does not derives it meaning from the size of any room where clerical functions are being carried out. On the other hand, it has no reference to size or nature of activities that are taking place  in any Organization. For example; the room where lecturer attend to his student is called an office also, the room where the president of the federal Republic of Nigeria carried out is constitutional duties is also called an office.</p> <p><strong>Office management </strong><br/>This could be regarded as an act of putting into systematic relationship those elements and activities essential to the satisfaction of an office purpose.     </p> <p>In a nutshell Organization and the method is simple the w ay and manner organizational activities is put in the right and most orderly manner. On the other hand is a process of coordinating organizational structure and procedures  in the most perfect way.</p> <p>1.2     <strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>When the employees  of an Organization are not fully equipped with knowledge of organization and methods the  way and manner in which office should be kept in the most desired order might be  a problem. This could result to loss of documentation and even low employees performance. <br/>The question therefore asked is, is it the poor knowledge of organization and methods that lead to poor employees performance and improper documentation in Kaduna north local government are? At the same time does it mean if, every officer in Kaduna north Local Government is fully developed with the knowledge of organization and methods it will lead to help employees performance and proper documentation. This is actually an issue of investigation.</p> <p>If the knowledge of organization and method is not provided there would be contribution cost of document and low performance. This research is therefore undertaken to monitor the level of the  knowledge of organization and method and it relevance to proper documentation an improve performance and also make recommendation on how to improve the knowledge of organization and  methods.</p> <p>1.3     <strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>Every research has a purpose and aim.  This research is to investigate the  impact  or organization and methods' on  office management with particular reference to Kaduna North Local Government area. The researcher interest to provide answer to  issues of office management in the area under study. Therefore the objectives of this research among other are:</p> <ol><li>To investigate the level of office holders understanding of organization and methods.</li> <li>To find out the problems that lack of the knowledge of organization and method can result to      </li> <li>To find a way of providing the knowledge of organization and methods to office holders in the local  government area.</li> <li>To investigate how the knowledge of organization and  methods will result to high employees performance and proper documentation. <strong>STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></li> </ol> <p>In carrying out this research, the following hypothesis has been formulated to which its validity with the tasted in course of the study. These hypothesis are:<br/>1)<br/>Ho: organization and methods does not improve the processes of record keeping and documentation in the office.<br/>H1: organization and methods improve the processes of record keeping and documentation in the office.<br/><br/>2) <br/>Ho: organization and methods does not encourage quick decision making, process and responses to business operations emerging issues.<br/>Ho: organization and methods encourage quick decision making, process and responses to business operations emerging issues.</p> <p>It is also among the significant of this study to find out problems that are likely to happen as a result of inadequacy of the knowledge of organization and method and provide remedy to such problems. And to save as reference to office holders and other researchers.</p> <p>1.5  <strong>SIGNIFICANCE  OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The importance of this project can not be over emphasized because the organization and method is a course that is designing for the smooth management of  office which is the coordinator  of all organization activities therefore:</p> <ol><li>There is the need for knowledge of organization and method for the smooth management of office.</li> <li>The research work will be a source of research to other researchers and also a refresh point.</li> <li>The research work also find out problems likely to be faced by all office users</li> </ol> <p>1.6     <strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The vital part of   this study is the impact of organization and methods on office management. In the courses of the study, the researcher will limit it study to Kaduna North Local government.</p> <p>1.7  <strong>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The limitation of this research can be view from the fact that the respondent are serving members of Kaduna north local government and Sultan Bello primary school they  were very busy to the extent that the appointment which were booked has changed and new booking obtained before the issuing of the questionnaire. Also some considered the information required to be official and a such wanted to seek permission from their superior before attempting the questions</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF ORGANIZATION AND METHOD ON OFFICE MANAGEMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF ORGANIZATION AND METHOD ON OFFICE MANAGEMENT", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE SECRETARY AND THE EFFECTIVES OF NEW OFFICE TECHNOLOGIES ON RECORD KEEPING MANAGEMENT IN INSTITUTION OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY, ENUGU.</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Technological advancement has ushered in drastic changes in record keeping through the introduction of new office technologies and new methods of communication. Man is an embodiment of change, his life circle is marked with different stages of metamorphosis which when it finally actualizes, adulthood is made secretarial profession, an inseparable bed fellow of management no exception. The secretary has been defined as one entrusted with secrets or confidence of a superior, or employed to handle correspondence and manage, routine and detailed work for a superior. Also Orisananya (1991) put it that, a secretary is a skilled and specialize type of employee in an establishment or part of it who is charged with some aspects of organizational functions in the unit including dealing with people’s correspondence and other business matters, with the above definitions, it can be deduced that the secretary is an important officer in any establishment and that the contribution and effectiveness of a secretary enhances the efficiency of an organization. This is the more reason that the secretary needs a proper training to be able to carry out her functions.</p> <p>The training of an efficient and effective secretary should cover not any skills in shorthand and type-writing but also in other managerial skills. These skills should be backed up by appropriate demeanour and etiquette at all times. Evans (1980) noted that the secretary’s role will be supporting, but with the added requirement of technological knowledge will encompass data administration and information management, allowing the secretary to analysis complex situations and submit practical recommendation.</p> <p>        With the introduction of these new machines, people are trained to acquire new skill for operating them. It is therefore, noted that proper record keeping makes it easier for information to be retrieved for use with a lot of ease. This, of course, had tended to reduce the work lead of a secretary.</p> <p>Even though a lot of charges have begun in technology, the question now is how to improve the secretary with the new office technologies for record keeping? The advantage of such purpose may be derive from the use of these new office technologies need not to be over-emphasized. Therefore, their presence and effective utilization is essential.</p>\n\nTHE SECRETARY AND THE EFFECTIVES OF NEW OFFICE TECHNOLOGIES ON RECORD KEEPING MANAGEMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE SECRETARY AND THE EFFECTIVES OF NEW OFFICE TECHNOLOGIES ON RECORD KEEPING MANAGEMENT", "id": 2}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE ROLE OF DATA PRESERVATION IN ENHANCING THE EFFICIENCY OF SECRETARIAL FUNCTION IN THE BANKING SECTOR IN AGUATA NORTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF ANAMBRA STATE</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>According to the Advanced Learner’s Dictionary of current English, data is information prepared for and operates on a computer programme.</p> <p>Also, Ani, 2011 in her mimeograph on data processing, defines data as a collection of unprocessed items which on their own do not convey any meaning. Suffice it to say that data can be preserved in the computer as well as in other system.</p> <p>The preservation of data is as old as man himself. In the earlier times, men were capable of storing information in their brains and passing them on from mouth to mouth. But the more authentic ones were data inscribed on stone tablets, on paper scrolls and even on walls, so that generations later can still make reference to them if properly preserved. However, there were limitations on how far one could rely on these methods of preserving data. As time progressed, the advent of various mechanisms for preserving data were developed.</p> <p>In 2012, Charles Babbage, English, Mathematician, invented a device called the punch-card which was designed to calculated and print mathematical tables. This innovation can equally be used as a memory or storage unit that can store data in the form of holes punched in cards.</p> <p>However, the effectiveness of this machine was limited by slowness and mechanical operating difficulties. These restrictions were overcome by the next development in data preservation history-the invention of electronic computer.</p> <p>In 2010, the first types of computer called UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer) was delivered to a business enterprise. They were designed to handle vas quantities of data typical of business operations. This new method of increased speed, output and preservation, over the years, files and cabinets have been used to preserve data too.</p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF DATA PRESERVATION IN ENHANCING THE EFFICIENCY OF SECRETARIAL FUNCTION IN THE BANKING SECTOR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF DATA PRESERVATION IN ENHANCING THE EFFICIENCY OF SECRETARIAL FUNCTION IN THE BANKING SECTOR", "id": 3}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE DEARTH OF TECHNOLOGICAL EQUIPMENT AND EFFECT ON SECRETARIAL JOB PERFORMANCE ON MINISTRIES IN ANAMBRA STATE</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>        We strongly said that, the office is the center of all the activities of any organization. It is from the office that instruction are sent to the different component units of an organization.</p> <p>        Reports from these components are received, collected, and interpreted for policy formation. Therefore, in every aspect of the world, the office is concerned with information, management and collective collection, processing and arranging same for onward transmission to the management for use. Furthermore, the office is also involved in the presentation and retrieval of such information as required by the organization for it’s service.</p> <p>        From the above, if should be obvious that the handling of information in the selected ministries is carried out by the secretary and other clerical staff. In carrying out the arduous task of information management, the office personnel, notably that secretary uses some equipment to facilitate the handling of information from manual to the highly electronic computerized technological, equipment.</p> <p>        Some of these equipment are: typewriter (manual and electrical), duplicating machine, stamping, electronic, stencil, scanner, dictating, addressing, shredding photocopying, computer etc.</p> <p>        Today, the information technology has helped to design and provide highly sophisticated and models of the equipment. The highly development helps to enhance the efficiency and facilitate the labourious and strenuous functions of the secretary thereby reducing physical exertion and fatigue. These items of equipment have also gone long way in improving the productivity of the secretary particularly and the organization in general effect, technological equipment has made a lot of effectiveness in the business world. This effect is also reflected on the functions of the secretarial staff.</p> <p>        From the foregoing, the researcher feels that the importance of these equipment in the overall efficiency and productivity of any office is no longer in doubt. Dearth of technological equipment make clerical and secretarial job cumbersome, time consuming, physical exerting, mental intriguing and doubtful inefficiency.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>        Every establishment has its main functions of the office as administration. This implies, by definitions management and transmission of information. The secretarial staff using different forms and management of technological equipment to perform this complex of information management. Some of them are manual and they are easy to handle, others are expensive, complex and computerized gadgets that require immense or great skill to manipulate.</p> <p>        Since these equipments facilitate secretarial job and enhance the performance in selected ministries, like personnel, type of service rendered and the working environment among others of an organization, use some of these equipment.</p> <p><strong>Purpose of the study</strong></p> <p>        The purpose of this research is to identify the strategies of the dearth of technological equipment in the selected ministries. </p> <p>a.          Identify the causes of dearth of technological equipment in selected ministries in Anambra State.</p> <p>b.          Determine the strategies and the process of resolving the problems.</p> <p>c.           Find out the effect of the dearth of technological equipment among the ministries.</p> <p><strong>Research Question</strong></p> <p>a.          What are the causes of the dearth of technological equipment in ministries?</p> <p>b.          What are the effects of the dearth of technological equipment?</p> <p>c.           What are the strategies for resolving the problems of the dearth of the technological equipment?</p> <p><strong>Significance of the study</strong>   </p> <p>        It will generate the life of using the technological equipment on ministries in Anambra State.</p> <p>        The findings of this study will significantly contribute tot the re-examining and implementation of these technological equipment.</p> <p>        Through these findings, the selected ministries will improve on their workflow during their day-to-day activities in the organization.</p> <p>        It will enable the individual to attain better job satisfaction through the use of these technological equipment.</p> <p><strong>Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>        Certain words and expressions have been used commutatively in this paper.

This means that managers of these business establishments must have insight or vision which will enable them plan and work towards achieving its economic objectives using all available resources effectively or efficiently.</p> <p>        The managers accomplishment of these objectives is a demanding task. The manager will require the services of someone who will help him to achieve or accomplish this great task which is the services of a secretary.</p> <p>        According to Elendu, O. (2001) it is necessary to refer to definition given earlier and adopted by the national – Secretaries Association Missouri, USA which says that the secretary is an assistant to an executive, possessing mastery of office skills and ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision, who displays initiative, exercises judgment, and makes decision within the scope of her authority.</p> <p>        According to Okolo (2009) a secretary is a person who directly assists the chairman in the conduct of the meeting. The secretary is in charge of the secretariat and is responsible for all the secretariat functions of the meeting.</p> <p>        According to White Head (1979) a secretary is one who must act as the alter ego of the chief executive. The secretary must be able to render such services as desired by the chief executive and also assist him to realize the organizational goals based on competence and efficiency.</p> <p>        The secretary plays essential role in any establishment/office. This means that a secretary must be a person of high responsibility and even qualified by training experience and temperament to perform these essential duties.</p> <p>        A secretary being able to carry out his/her duties perfectly, physical working condition is mandatory to provide. It is so because these help to make secretaries comfortable. Physical working condition according to Elendu O. (2000: 1.8) said that it is not enough for an office to be properly located and laid out. It is also highly necessary to ensure that good physical condition are provided and at the same time will maintained, while Obasi Oko (1994: 950) enumerated them as orientation of the building, cleanliness of the office furniture and fittings. Physical working conditions and those things which is in an office that makes a worker to work for a long time without getting distracted and tired. The provision of adequate, attractive and conducive physical working conditions in the offices is of utmost importance. The manager should try to make the working condition comfortable and attractive.</p> <p>        The nature of the physical working conditions influences the performance of the secretaries in a greater way. If the office is not comfortable of conducive, it affects the job performance of secretaries, her mood and productivity. But a comfortable environment makes the secretary to be excited and enhances his/her performance and productivity. </p> <p>        In any office there should be maximum use of certain working conditions like lighting, ventilation, computers and others. Effective use of doors, windows, rents and skylights will save eyes, improve work and health, and it reduces the cost of lighting, heating and air condition. Base on these the provision of proper physical working condition in the office is sine qua non, if the productivity of the secretary is to be guaranteed.</p> <p>        This study is therefore aimed at finding out the extent to which the provision and lack of any of these physical working conditions have influenced and affected the secretary’s performance and productivity.</p> <p><strong>1.2  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>        The challenge of these modern office and the resultant challenge posed on the secretaries in the office and job holders have made the practice of secretariat functions too demanding and tasking. With poor physical working conditions there is usually disconformental fatigue and poor health, with its consequentes on productivity.</p> <p>        Lack of adequate and proper physical working conditions in offices the secretary’s morale depressed resulting to lack of job satisfaction, sabotage and performance. In an office, lack of performance of the secretary will surely disorganize the entire system in the business for the organization. </p> <p>Some people have ability to concentrate in the face of distraction but whether a person has this ability or not, it is the duty of an employer to make adequate provision for his staff, an environment conducive to work in order to enhance job performance and productivity. Absence of these physical working conditions in an office have made secretaries resort to truancy, lateness, indifference, absenteeism and the consequential rate of labour turnover of the secretaries.         </p> <p><strong>1.3  PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The major objective or purpose of this study is to determine the physical working conditions in offices and their effects on the productivity of secretaries in some business establishments.</p> <p>i.            To identify the major physical working conditions in offices and its level of availability in those establishment.</p> <p>ii.          To identify the problems associated with lack of these physical working conditions.</p> <p>iii.        To prefer solutions aimed at solving these problems and make recommendations.</p> <p>iv.         To determine the extent to which the physical working conditions in offices affect the productivity of the secretary especially in those selected establishments.</p> <p><strong>1.4  SIGNIFICANCE </strong></p> <p>This study is intended to highlight the major physical working conditions that should be present in offices. It will exposes the factors responsible for lack of these physical working conditions in offices and its resultant effects on the performance of the secretaries.</p> <p>        This study will suggest the various ways establishments and employees of labour could follow to provide these essential physical working condition for the secretary in order to ensure maximum serve as a reference material to other students and reachers who may embark on similar research in future.</p> <p><strong>1.5  DELIMITATION </strong></p> <p>        The researcher emerged the result of covering all the country and decided to limit the investigations to some selected establishments in Enugu urban.</p> <p><strong>1.6  RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>        This study is intended to identify the following:</p> <p>1.          What are the major physical working conditions in offices and the level of availability in those establishments?</p> <p>2.          What are the problems caused by inadequate physical working conditions?</p> <p>3.          To what extent do these physical working conditions influence your productivity?</p> <p>4.          What do you think are the possible solutions to these problems?</p> <p><strong>1.7  DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>PHYSICAL CONDITION</strong>:  These facilities and conveniences in the work place that without distraction and fatigue that work can be done efficiently.</p> <p><strong>PRODUCTIVITY</strong>:              The amount of production in relation to labour employed.</p> <p><strong>SECRETARY:</strong>                   An executive assistant who possesses a mastering of office skill without direct supervision, exercises initiative judgement and makes decisions with the scope of his assigned authority.</p> <p><strong>ENVIRONMENT:            </strong>The surrounding conditions of an employee, which influences his work.          </p> <p><strong>ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS:</strong>  Targets or designed objective, which an organization aimed to achieve.</p>\n\nA SURVEY OF PHYSICAL WORKING CONDITIONS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON PRODUCTIVITY OF THE SECRETARIES IN SOME BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A SURVEY OF PHYSICAL WORKING CONDITIONS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON PRODUCTIVITY OF THE SECRETARIES IN SOME BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS ", "id": 5}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>A SURVEY OF THE PROBLEMS OF COMPUTERIZATION OF OFFICE FUNCTIONS IN SELECTED BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENT IN AGUATE L.G.A</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The contribution of the Business Establishment to the economic development of any nation cannot be over emphasized. Computer have also contributed greatly to ease the functions performed by this industries to meet its economic obligations to the nation. The computer as a very necessary tool has not been adopted by all business establishments. So many establishments on the other hand, have able seen it as a means of improving business transactions and keeping necessary data on customers and other services. Organizations which have not actually adopted computers, will see that its positive effects surpasses its negative effects if they should look into it. This study therefore is going to show the actual contributions of computers to the business establishments and the problems faced by the establishments, that has not gone into computerization. In trying to state the problem related to computer the researcher used both secondary and primary data. The main purpose of this study was to determine the functions of computerization in office function in some establishment in Aguata L.G.A Anambra State.  The population of the study consisted 94 people from 5 selected organizations Aguata Local Government Area.  The sample for the study was 50 people out of 94, which we drawn using simple random sampling.  Four research questions were formulated which guided the study.  A 14 items structured questionnaire was developed.  Mean were use to answer the research questions.  The major finding of the study were (1) any staff can loss his job if you are not computer literate.  (2) Computerization can reduce the cost of service in organization. (3) When there is light it can safe time. (4) When the is qualify staff it can bring customer satisfaction. (5) To provide adequate machine can also make job sweet.  </p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong> INTRODUCTION:</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>One of the major objectives of most business firms, individuals and government agencies in installation of computer is to assist them in data processing, counting, information storage and to eliminate manual interference between data, input, information and output. In the past, counting and other simple arithmetical operations were performed by the use of parts of the human body such as the fingers and toes. Also used were objects like stones, sticks and drawing lines and works on the surfaces.</p> <p>However, when the volume of data to be processed increased and also to need for faster processing and more accurate results become imperative, then aids or tools to be used for computing because necessary, hence the need for mechanically processing equipment, otherwise known as computers.</p> <p>The earliest mechanical and to calculation used in China and other parts of the world e.g ABACUS or BEAD FRAME was crude, time – consuming and to worsen the situation. It was only used to perform arithmetical operations. To overcome the limitations of ABACUS, it was still necessary to carryout research on the improvement of the equipment and to invent a more sophisticated one that will not only solve the problem of country, but also produce an accurate results in data processing, business and management information for decision making that will be utilized in all sectors of any economy. With above in mind, computer came into being </p> <p>The emergence of computer and also its application to various sectors of the economy may not come without problems.  Actually the usefulness of computerization cannot be over emphasized especially to execute office functions.  At nonetheless there are some problems to be encountered by firms, and government agencies that may wish to computerize their office function.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS:- </strong></p><p>         It has been know and recognized hat some of the problems of computerization of office functions range from lack of qualified staff to manage the computers and inadequate electricity to the displacement of manual work, this creating unemployment, embezzlement of public fund and computer robbing.          Decisions affecting computerization of office functions are I theoretical by an obvious fact and subjective judgment of most firms, individuals and government agencies. </p> <p>        The chief executive of a firm or government may have some of needs that may require the installation of computer system in such organization but such need may only be part or an aspect of the entire need of the firm of organization.  On the other hand there may be other benefits the firm’s may be exposed to if it falls to computerize the office functions.</p> <p>        On this note, therefore the problems are to identify the difficulties many firms, individuals and government agencies find themselves for having computerized their office functions.  I t equally expected that this study will go long way to establish or identify the relationship between computerization of office functions and the functions and the overall performance of the organization with respect to efficiency productivity and employment of both human and material resources.</p><p>   <strong>PURPOSE OF STUDY:</strong> </p> <p>This study attempts to investigation to the following points</p> <p>1    To enhance the extent to which computerization reduced the cost of business services.</p> <p>2    To know the extent had computerization had led to efficient information storage.</p> <p>3.  To know how computerization of office function can reduce the time wastage for customers.</p> <p>4.   Has computerization help in office function. </p> <p>5.  Also to know how workers use to consider computerization services.</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTION:</strong></p> <p>How does the development of computer reduce the cost o f office services?</p> <p>2.To what extent has computerization led to loss of job and

IMPROVEMENT</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>        An office cannot effectively function without secretary. A secretary is very important in every organization. Secretary is the pillar of every organization. The objectives of an organization can hardly be achieved if a secretary is not employed. The success or failure of any organization depends on the secretary. The impression the secretary creates influence the attitude of the public towards the organization. Every secretary must be able to handle office equipment such as typewriter, converting hand written materials into printed forms mail room equipment, dispatch and receive of mails telephone instrument for communication purposes and the computer, a powerful equipment which renders itself to various uses. All these activities and many others not described here from the duties attributable to confidential secretaries.</p> <p>        Therefore, before appraising the major roles confidential secretaries play in the civil service of Anambra State. Let us have a brief concept of which a secretary means. Confidential secretary has been defined in various ways.</p> <p>        A confidential secretary is an assistance to an executive possessing a mastery of the office, the person must demonstrate the ability to accept responsibility without direct supervision assigned direction.</p> <p>        A mere servant, his position is that he has to do what he is told and no person can assume he has any authority to represent anything at all.</p> <p>        The above definition was made when the education status of secretaries has not been enhanced and their duties not clearly identified. As time goes on the positive of confidential secretaries has started to experience what can be termed as modification is occasioned by technological development, which afforded advancement in secretarial field. Many scholars and association formulated a coherent definition of secretary. Homby (1942) in his dictionary identified a secretary as: An employee in an office who deals with correspondence, keeps records, make arrangement and appointment for a particular member of the staff and usually called private secretary.</p> <p>        The importance of a secretary and his work in any organisation cannot be overemphasized he is the gateway of every employer as he is the first person to be seen.</p> <p>        According to Unwin (1982) a secretary is an ambassador of an organization, more often. He is the first person whom customer or members of the general public come in contact. A secretary is also a person to speak than on the telephone, and first impressions are important, therefore, the secretary has the responsibility of representing the organization.</p> <p>        The national association of secretary in their view described secretary as: An assistant to an executive possessing mastering of office skill and ability to assume responsibility without being directed, supervision, who display initiative exercise judgment and makes decision within the scope of her authority.</p> <p>        Oguniye (1978) in his handwork of secretary duties identified secretary as: that individual who has been professionally prepared through series of educational expose coupled with practices to records correspondence, minutes, finance, personal materials related to the affairs of the organization for which is employed.</p> <p>        Finally, confidential secretaries are employed in various ministries constituting the evil service of Anambra State. They play significant roles but are faced with many problems, which will be identifier in the course of the research possibly solution or strategies would be suggested, aiming at ameliorating the problems, encountered by confidential secretaries.</p>\n\nAN APPRAISAL OF THE ROLES AND POSITION OF CONFIDENTIAL SECRETARIES IN THE CIVIL SERVICE OF ANAMBRA STATE PROBLEMS   AND STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVEMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN APPRAISAL OF THE ROLES AND POSITION OF CONFIDENTIAL SECRETARIES IN THE CIVIL SERVICE OF ANAMBRA STATE PROBLEMS   AND STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVEMENT", "id": 7}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE STRATEGIES </strong></p> <p><strong>FOR IMPROVING MANAGEMENT/STAFF</strong></p> <p><strong>RELATIONSHIP IN TERTIARY</strong></p> <p><strong> INSTITUTIONS</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>It is no longer news that the standard of education in Nigeria has drastically fallen. Different methods and approaches have been adopted severally to savage the situation, but it has yielded no particular positive result. Bad teaching method, poor reading habits, poverty, ill-equipped laboratories and libraries, are among the claims put by scholars that had caused that standard of education in Nigeria. This paper examines the need to enhance the learning and teaching process in tertiary education through balance student-staff and student–student relationship to achieve a sustainable tertiary education system that will produce optimal results thereby salvaging the falling standard of education in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER I</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>Background of the Study </strong></p> <p>‘‘In view of the central nature of staff relationship, and the almost universal assumption that institution benefits management staff, and the importance of scholarship, it is perhaps surprising how relatively few institution have specific policies in place to either monitor or to develop and maximize these  beneficial synergies’’, (J.M consulting 200, p.16).</p> <p>        Academic leaders and managers need to understand the conditions likely to facilitate links between management staff of an institution and the relationship existing within them (member of staff) and those that inhibit connections and seek to compartmentalize academic activities (Locke, 2004, pp. 108)</p> <p>         This publication seeks to support institutional policy- makers to enable their institutions to maintain a cordial relationship between the members of staff and discipline – based scholarship more effectively. The focus however, is on supporting the relationships between staff and the inter-relationship among member of staff a higher institution of learning with respect to policies and practices.</p> <p>         In terms of the work of the higher education academy, we seek to support its strategic aim of working with institutions in their strategies for improving the students learning experience’’ (higher education and academy, 2005a.) and to ensure that the advice is based on research evidence. Ultimately, the central issue that national system and institution hade decide is ‘’what is distinctive about higher education?’’ however, what is distinctive about higher education is supporting student and the wider society understanding of the complexities of the worlds in which we live</p> <p>Although, for many staff, their motivations and the sense of their role is highly shaped by both their own appreciation of, and belief I the value of relationship to other member wider society. While there is evidently much practice in realizing these values we also have to recognize that it is unevenly distributed, much is implicit and many institutional policies in this area are poorly developed and sometimes work against nexus.</p> <p>        In the long run, more recent research demonstrates the potential value of staff relationship to student learning and for motivating student to learn. This research also how that the linkage is not automatic, and has to be built systematically into the curriculum, department institutional and national planning questioning the value or possibility of the link also stems from the realities of mass higher education. Thus, the linkage might once have been readily assumed or delivered with small classes, selective student entry, and staff with time to teach and relate effectively clearly, if that golden age ever existed, it has now gone.</p> <p>        Paul Ramsden (2001), then pro-vices- chancellor (learning and teaching) at the university of Sydney and now chief executive of the higher education academy, expressed this works perspective when her stated ‘’the main hope for relating a genuinely student-centered undergraduate education lies in re-engineering the enter academic institution of higher learning. The word ‘engineer’ suggests that the link does not occur automatically; it has to be designed; ‘created’; constructed; and brought about. The word ‘reengineer’ suggest that even if once the linkage did exist, it now needs significant ‘re-inventing’ to ensure it is in place or, even better, that it is embedded in many places and processes. Therefore, there is much that individual, course teams, department and national systems can and should do to forge these links (Jenkins et al, 2003).</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>“The mission statement included retaining a core commitment to learning-based teaching and enhancing scholarship through clearly linking research, professional practice and teaching. However, it was difficult to find this mission executed in the policy statement. For example the only instance in the process of appointment, continuation, promotion, performance review, or application for study leaves for promotion to the rank of senior lecturer, whereby there was a criterion under the teaching  category, ‘ application’ of research to teaching. There was no reference to the nexus in proposal for new course student evaluation forms, review of department or internal grants procedure. We suggest that if such a case study was conducted in most universities, there would be a similar pattern of rewarding the parts separately, but rarely the nexus. It is therefore not surprising that the context in which academic works is part of the explanation as to why there is a zero relationship between teaching and learning. ( Hattie and marsh,2004 pp5-6; emphasis added).</p> <p><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of this study is to determine the strategies for improving standard of education in the higher institution as well as management- staff and relationship in tertiary institution.</p> <p>To determine how reward system support the staff in binding teaching and learning together in higher institution.</p> <p>To investigate the behaviors of the staff toward the students and vice versa.</p> <p>To examine the performance of the academic staff and how it can enhance to the teaching and learning of the students.</p> <p>To identify different strategies that must be adopt in the other to maintain good relationship between the staff and students in tertiary institutions.</p> <p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>Can management and staff relationship improve the standard of education in the higher institution?</p> <p>To what extent can reward system support the staff in bringing teaching and learning together in higher institution?</p> <p>Can the behaviors of staff in tertiary institution improve management/students relationship?</p> <p>How can the performance of the academic staffs enhance the learning habits of the student?</p> <p>How can we indentify strategies that must be adopted in other to maintain good relationship between the staff and the student in tertiary institution?</p> <p>What can be the barrier in the improvement of management and staff relationship?</p>\n\nAN INVESTIGATION INTO THE STRATEGIES   FOR IMPROVING MANAGEMENT &amp;

The population of the study consists of 58 Secretaries in Anambra State Owned Companies. The sample for the study was the total population of the Secretaries which is 58. Three research questions were formulated which guided the study. Nine (9) items structure questionnaire was developed validated and tested for its reliability. The percentage method was used in calculation. The major findings of the study were:</p> <p>1.     That secretaries have more area of conflict with their bosses than areas of mutual friendship.</p> <p>2.     The consequences of such conflicts affect the progress of the establishment concerned.</p> <p>3.     That if the possible strategies or procedures suggested can be adopted by the secretaries the conflict can be remedial. </p> <p>It is concluded that, it is important for the secretaries to have a good working relationship with their bosses to stop the conflicts and achieve the goals of the establishment, and bosses should provide or create a room for negotiation between them and their secretaries.  </p>\n\nCAUSES OF CONFLICT BETWEEN SECRETARIES  AND BOSSES IN ANAMBRA STATE OWNED ESTABLISHMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button

MANAGERS IN SELECTED TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS IN SOUTH EAST ZONE OF NIGERIA</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    </strong><strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Industrial Training is the training given to the students in tertiary institution in order to know the responsibilities of human resources development and how they will tackle their work/job after their school career.</p> <p>The Industrial Training Funds was set up by (SIWES) Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme programme to help students in tertiary institutions especially those offering practical courses such as Office Technology and Management students, Art and Applied Sciences, Engineering students etc. to achieve their required training skills for their professions.</p> <p>This programme has brought about many positive effects on the students.  As the manager’s job is to provide service to the general public, industrial training helps to expose managers to industrial behaviour in order to improve on practical aspect of their course.  According to Okafor (1993), this type of experience would expose students to the world of work and help them remedy the deficiencies of the classroom in terms of its practical components.</p> <p>Thus, the Industrial Training Fund programs help Office Managers to perfect in their profession.  For instance, some courses in Office Technology and Management line is Office Management System, Office Practice, Principle of Law, Advance Transcription, Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Human Capital Management etc. are being taught theoretical in school.</p> <p>In Polytechnics, Office Managers due go to four months Industrial Training (IT), in their first year, in second year another one year Industrial Training making them acquire the necessary skills to perfect in their course of study.</p> <p>Students experience during the course of their training will definitely help them to carry out their managerial work effectively provided that the programme of the Industrial Training Fund (ITF) is a continuous process.  The experiences gotten by students is a good tool that responds to a certain basic aspect of the students fullest development in the Office Management and Technology course making them acquire the necessary skills.</p> <p>The most serious problem facing the students before the introduction of the Industrial Training (IT) is unemployment.  Many of them do not possess the relevant and employable skills needed by employers, students are being faced with the problem of acquiring the needed practical knowledge.  Thereby, making the students to imagine everything that are being taught.  But the introduction of this IT programme has helped Office Managers to perform well, especially in getting direct contact with some of the new office gazettes that have been taught theoretically in school.</p> <p>The SIWES objectives is to help students to find solution to the problem of unemployment, to take their steps in the journey through their life career with pleasure, confidence, and to prepare students for the world.</p> <p>Taylor (1983) had concluded that students who have benefited from SIWES opportunities pass on to the next level and are ready to accept any challenges of learning skills in their career.  For this reasons the potential managers that went through the industrial training fund programme benefited from many effects needed for their experiences and exposure.</p> <p>1.2    <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The management problem of the industrial training is on how to achieve the organization goal.  And the effort of well trained managers as Folayan (1998) stated is a sine quo non for the achievement of the organizational corporate goal.</p> <p>Before the introduction of Industrial Training Scheme, the Office Manager’s attitude and performance in school and outside school was very discouraging.  </p> <p>The Federal Military Government introduced this programme (IT) to guide and direct the Office Manager’s learning so that they will carry out their work/job effectively and accurately.</p> <p>Atuenyi (1995), pointed out that “Office Managers need urgent training right from their year one in higher institution in order to meet up with the information technology demand in any organization”.</p> <p>Another problem bordering on this is the problem of how often the supervision staff in Industrial Training Fund (ITF) visits the students on attachment and allowance paid to students on attachment.</p> <p>1.3    <strong>Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>The objective of the study is to find out the effect of Industrial Training Scheme on the training of Office Managers.</p> <p>Specifically, the study sought to:</p> <p>1.           Identify the aims and objectives of the Industrial Training.</p> <p>2.           Find out the benefits that the entire students derive from Industrial Training (IT) Scheme.</p> <p>3.           Examine the causes of the poor implementation of the programme.</p> <p>4.           Examine the remedies to the poor implementation of the programme.</p> <p>1.4    <strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>This study sought answers to the following research questions.</p> <p>1.           What are the aims and objectives of the Industrial Training?</p> <p>2.           What are the benefits derivable by students from the Industrial Training Scheme?</p> <p>3.           What are the causes of poor implementation of the programme?</p> <p>4.           What are the remedies to the poor implementation of the programme?</p> <p>1.5    <strong>Research Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>To guide the study, the following hypothesis has been formulated to enhance authentication of the subject matter.</p> <p>Ho:    Industrial Training Scheme has no effect on the training of </p> <p>Office Managers in selected tertiary institution in South-East zone of Nigeria.</p> <p>H1:    Industrial Training Scheme has effect on the training of </p> <p>Office Managers in selected tertiary institution in South-East zone of Nigeria.</p> <p>1.6    <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study of the effect of industrial training scheme on the training of managers will help the students to achieve the practical aspect of learning, which will help them to perfect in the theoretical training.</p> <p>The industrial training will help the students to be more committed to the programme instead of relaxing and forge industrial training letters from any company, since they have known the importance of the programme.</p> <p>It helps the SIWES workers to be more committed to their work by making it compulsory for the students to acquire the necessary practical knowledge and experience required from them during the training period.</p> <p>The study in this training will help students to be cost conscious when dealing with customers or when using companies stationeries in their work place.</p> <p>The study will also help to create awareness to the public especially government establishments on the importance of the training so that the industrial workers will be accepted.</p> <p>1.7    <strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The scope of the study is strictly on the effect of industrial training scheme on the training of Office Managers.  It focused on the aim and objective of industrial training scheme towards the students that are offering practical courses in tertiary institutions, especially in the training of Office Managers.</p> <p>To evaluate the benefits that the students derive and to find out the problems and solutions towards the training</p>\n\nEFFECT OF

Commissioned on 25th August, 1979 by the military Administration of the then Anambra state Col. D.S Abubakar. </p> <p>        It has a total capacity of 12 million liters of petroleum products. It has only three by products in stock which include Premium Motor Sprit (PMS) otherwise called petrol, Dual Purpose Kerosene (DPK) and Automobile Gas Oil (AGO) ago or diesel for onward distribution to her customers the oil marketing companies.</p> <p>        Enugu depot has a total number of six departments namely: Administrative, sales, security, accounts operation and safely departments with a total workforce of 250 workers. Each department is managed by the head of such department who equally reports to the depot manager who is the overall boss.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>        In a developing country like Nigeria, the use of modern office equipment in the office is still minimal because they lack the technical know how to put the one their disposal to good use. Lack of stilled manpower to update and maintain already acquired machines. Besides, constant power failure from the public electricity supply has not helped matters in any way. </p> <p>        More over, some office worker especially secretaries sees the technological improvement as a challenge and also as threat to their job. These problems and anxiety in the minds of office workers, is likely to lead to a drastic reduction in production in most office.  </p> <p>Finally, this situation calls for serious policies by management dealing with the problem, which psychologically destroys the mental and emotional state of workers.</p> <p><strong>1.3   PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>For every act, there must be a reason and in light of this, the purposes of this study are:</p> <p>1.   To discover what office equipment is all about.</p> <p>2.          To identify the contributions of modern office equipment on the success of business organization. </p> <p>3.          To examine the training needed for the operation of these office equipments.</p> <p>4.          To identify how to maintain them in the office. </p> <p>5.          To discover the problems associated with the use of these equipments. </p> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>1.          What is office equipment all about?</p> <p>2.          Do these modern office equipments actually have any contribution on the success of business organization?</p> <p>3.          Do the operation of these modern equipments need any training program? </p> <p>4.          Do these modern office equipments require proper maintence? </p> <p>5.          Is there any problem associated with the use of these modern equipments? </p> <p><strong>1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The significance of this study “modern office equipments and their contributions to the success of a business organization, a case study of NNPC Enugu depot” is that it will create awareness as well provide information on the roles these modern office equipment plays in seeing that NNPC Enugu depot achieve their goals and also meet up the standard.

ONE</strong></p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1     GENERAL PERSPECTIVE</p> <p>          According to Oxford Advance Learners Dictionary, “environment is defined as the natural conditions in which people, animals and plants lives”.  Environment can also be defined as “all the surrounding things, conditions, and influences affecting the growth or development of living things”.  It is the act or fact of surrounding in other words, environment means the surrounding in which living things live.  Therefore, environment for the purpose of this research refers to the office environment.  This type of environment gives secretaries good  working relationship and enhance high productivity.</p> <p>          The secretary’s environment can be divided into two:</p> <p>1.                 Immediate environment</p> <p>2.                 Remote environment</p> <p>-                     Immediate environment:  refers to the secretary’s very office and other offices, of the same organization</p> <p>-                     The Remote environment:  means the outside environment of the secretary’s office or building that has a negative effect such as, ventilation, noise, temperature, over crowding, cleanliness, lighting, attitude of office colleagues etc.  It is therefore, a prime importance for employers to make environment as conducive as possible for the secretary’s higher productivity which is ultimate goal of any employer.  Creating selection, arrangement, and use of sample physical surrounding chairs, tables, storage, lighting, decorating and other physical element that comprises your personal office are mans of enhancing competences as well as the image of an organization.</p> <p>In the light of above this research will focuses on the effects of environment on secretary’s productivity, it will look at some of the areas like poor ventilation, lighting, cleanliness, internal noise, heating all these are factors that can affect the productivity of working secretary in an office environment.</p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>          To determine the extend which the environment factors such as noise, ventilation, lack of enough space in the office and equipment can hinder the performance of secretary in an organization.</p> <p><strong>1.3     OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>I.       To find out and ascertain the effect of environment condition to the working secretary in an organization.</p> <p>II.      To encourage the organization to acquire more office automation for effectives efficiency of secretary</p> <p>III.     To provide organization with mores ideas for a conducive environment for the workers</p> <p><strong>1.4     RESEARCHER QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>i.        Does lack of constant power supply in an office affect the performance of a secretary?</p> <p>ii.       Does too much noise in an office affect the secretary’s productivity?</p> <p>iii.      Does an office which is not clean and tidy, brings about low productivity?</p> <p>iv.      Do stuffy environment causes drowsiness, which in turn produces less accurate work?</p> <p><strong>1.5     LIMITATION</strong></p> <p>          The research work is limited to the case study that is the Federal Polytechnic Kaura Namoda.</p> <p><strong>1.6     DELIMITATION</strong></p> <p>The study therefore, will highly be concentrated on factors that affect performance of secretaries in the Federal Polytechnic Kaura Namoda</p> <p><strong>1.7     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The research is to identify the importance of office environment, know the effect of environmental condition in the life of working secretary, and also to fulfill the following:</p> <p>-                     To serve as a criteria or form of reference to secretaries in an organization</p> <p>-                     To aid students who may wish to conduct research on project that relates to this topic.</p>

However, earlier the role of a secretary was limited to notes from their heads, typing and storing information. Perhaps with the advent of technology in companies and offices, secretarial duties have extended to things that were meant for the professional and managerial staffs. The secretary that organizations are seeking in today’s time should not only have clerical skills and administrative skill alone but also cooperate governance, security laws, and capital market.</p> <p>As it is today technology has affected every aspect of secretarial work from the organization of document, sorting and storing of document.</p> <p>Aku (2004) informs that the basic secretarial functions of collecting, transferring, processing and transmission of information allows themselves to computerization. Consequently, the most works carried out by the professional secretary in the office are now being handled more speedily and in a better way with the use of computer.</p> <p>Hill (2004), A secretary is someone who receives executive and company officials, clerical duties and keep personal records, read and sort, organize incoming mails, make and answer phone calls.</p> <p>Assessing the performance of professional secretaries and computer operators requires proper check and change to ascertain he caliber of each.</p> <p>Performance as define by Wynel (2010) as a systematic description of job relevant strength and weaknesses within and between employees. Which also means that performance evaluation is a review of the employee’s performance based on the agreed objectives. As performance determines output in an organization, the output of a secretary can be observed from the duty performed and how specialized one is in his or her functions.</p> <p>The computer operators who obtains diploma or certificate course in computer training is mistaken for secretaries as there are minor similarities in their duties which are typing of documents, receiving and sending of mails, which are temporary duties performed by the computer operators.</p> <p>According to Suleiman (2000), a computer operator is someone who requires the knowledge and practice of computer appreciation and operations, he is only knowledgeable in operation of the computer and how to manipulate it. Most people lack the typing skills as well as the techniques for standard production of  documents.</p> <p>Suleiman (2000) also define the duties of a computer operators as the duplication of duties by computer operator. He adds that because the computer operators can manipulate the computer does not mean that they are secretaries. This is difficult to identify professional secretaries and computer operators, because the computer operator tends to perform better than some professional secretaries in organizations Ball (2001) to them as long as you are under a typewriter, you are a typist; they ignore the facts that there are distinctive features of the two profession in terms of skill, qualifications, duties, responsibilities and remuneration. This wrong perception or impression has permitted the general public and a great percentage of the public sees the secretarial position as nothing but mere typist who are trained from business centers after undergoing some few months of training in typing from street business schools, and factors that hinders their promotion both as secretaries and computer operators.</p> <p>This explains why many students are reluctant to take the course of secretarial studies as a profession in spite of the fact that secretarial position is crucial and important to organization just like any other position. It is against this background that the researchers sees this trend as an empirical problem worthy of investigation.</p> <p>1.2    <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>The work of a professional secretary is quite different from that of a computer operator in an organization. This is so because the work of a professional secretary encompasses that of a computer operator. Secretaries responsibilities include various administrative and clerical duties needed to run a company efficiently and smoothly.</p> <p>Some duties include serving as an office information manager, arranging and scheduling meetings or appointments and preserving paper and computer files, managing projects, handling travel arrangements and distributing information through the use of telephones, mails, e-mails while the work of a computer operator is just limited to operating the computer, but in spite of this differences, a lot of organization tends to place a computer operator in the same level with a professional secretary which undermine the profession. As such doubt is expressed about the importance of a professional secretary’s contribution to goal attainment of an organization sequel to wrong perception of organizational members, as such people treat the profession with contempt and disregard. Hence the subject matter of this research: Evaluation of the performance of a professionals secretary and computer operators in an organization becomes worthy of investigation.</p> <p>1.3    <strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The general objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of professional secretaries and computer operators in an organization.</p> <p>However the specific objectives of the study are:</p> <p>i)            To examine the roles played by professional secretaries and computer operators in the smooth running and planning in an organization.</p> <p>ii)          To identify the factors that are responsible for lack of promotional opportunities of professional secretaries and computer operators in an organization.</p> <p>iii)        To examine the duties of professional secretaries as compared to computer operators in an organization.</p> <p>iv)         To know the demands for professional secretaries services and computer operators in an organization.</p> <p>1.4    <strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>i)       How does the modern office technology aid the planning and smooth running of the organization?</p> <p>ii)      What are the factors that hinder promotional opportunities of professional secretaries and computer operators in an organization?</p> <p>iii)     What are the various roles and duties played by professional secretaries and computer operators in an organization?</p> <p>iv)         Why are there demands for professional secretary services and computer operators in an organization?</p> <p>1.5    <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study, when completed would be of great importance to the secretaries in practice and secretaries in training as well as the management of various organizations in the following ways:</p> <p>i)            To the secretaries in practice and training: The study will help them to understand the qualification needed for one to assume a secretarial position in an organization.</p> <p>ii)          It will help those willing to take secretarial profession to appreciate the fact that being a secretary is not to be attached to a typewriter as a typist but rather a call to greater responsibilities in an office.</p> <p>iii)        It will help the secretaries in practice and in training to know the responsibilities or duties of a professional secretary in an organization as compared to computer operators.</p> <p>iv)         The study will be of help to Managers in job placement in an organization.</p> <p>1.6    <strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study covers the empirical evaluation of the performance of professional secretaries and computer operator in an organization.

This change is reflected in the office structure and office positions from entry level to Executive Office Manager Level. Hence attention is now given to what the office does and the way in which office activities can be accomplished in an efficient and an effective way an office manager is responsible for the smooth operation of the day-to-day business of the company, a good office manager makes it possible for other people to function efficiently. Office managers work closely with the company partners, owner, or president to meet their company’s staffing, equipment, and organizational needs. Duties may include pricing products from vendors, interviewing job applicants, managing payroll, and reimbursing members of the firm for out-of-pocket business expenses, and so the need for information technology had to come into play as information technology has replaced the traditional equipment used by an office manager to perform his tasks.</p> <p>Montgomerie (2004), defines information technology as the handling of vocal, pictorial, textual and numerical Information by means of micro-electronic based equipment in computing and telecommunication. This clearly brings about the advantages of information delivery through technological means, since almost all aspects of office work can adequately be taken care of.</p> <p>Aronu (2000) defines Information Technology as the combination of two technologies, computing and the main purpose of which is to transmit representation of information signals between remote locations.</p> <p><strong>1.2       </strong><strong>Statement of the Problem </strong></p> <p>Office Managers in banking sectorsin Nigeria are scared of losing their jobs due to the advent of information technology. Never the less, Information technology when properly implemented in an organization will bring about productivity and easy flow of information, effective production delivery services to customers.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it appears that the introduction of information technology seems to pose some problem to office managers.</p> <p>Office Managers in banking sector in Nigeria, seems to be scared of losing their jobs because some of them are inexperienced in the use of modern gadgets such as facsimile Transfer (FAX), video conferencing. As a result of this it has created fear and instability in the office managers as it seems as if most of them are looking for alternative jobs.</p> <p>The introduction of technology in the banking sectors in Nigeria would bring about improved performance, but it appears to be at a very high cost-that is the cost of maintenance of equipment   and services.</p> <p><strong>1.3       </strong><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The aim of the study is to find the effect of Information Technology on the performance of the office Manager. The specific objectives of the study are to:-</p> <p>1.      To establish the contributions of Information Technology towards efficient performance of the office manager.</p> <p>2.      To determine the causes of non adaptation of Information Technology in the banking sectors by office managers.</p> <p>3.      To determine the implications of poor Information Technology applications among office managers in the banking sector.</p> <p>4.      To identify ways necessary to address issues of Information Technology among office managers in the banking sector.</p> <p>1.4<strong>    Research Question</strong></p> <p>1.      What is the contribution of Information Technology to the performance of the managers in the banking sector?</p> <p>2.      What factors affect the non adaptation of Information Technology among office managers in the banking sector? </p> <p>3.      What is the implication of non- application of Information Technology in banking sector?</p> <p>4.      What strategies are necessary for addressing issues of Information Technology among office managers in the banking sector?</p> <p><strong>1.5    Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p><strong>1.      Organization:</strong> The study will help treat and improve some existing theories on Information as they apply to organizations as well as the office professionals   in the areas of human resources management. It has also become a vital and integral part of every business plan .It will also help organization to improve the way they design and manage customer relationships.</p> <p><strong>2.      Further Research:</strong> It is also hoped that the findings of this study will contribute to the existing knowledge and information in the area of research.</p> <p><strong>3.      Office Practitioners:</strong> The significance of this research work is immeasurable both to the practitioners, office professionals, chief executives, personnel managers, the management of the organizations and the public at large.

According to Merriam-Webster (2007) technology is making usage and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems or methods of organization in order to solve a problem or perform a specific function. The word technology comes from Greek, the term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: example include construction technology and information technology. </p> <p>Technology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology h as helped develop more advanced economies (including today’s global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes product unwanted by-products: known as pollution and deplete natural resources, the determinants of the earth and its environment. Various implementations of technologies influences the value of a society and news technology often rises new ethical questions examples include the rise of efficiency interm of human productivity, a term originally approved to machines and the challenge of traditional norms. </p> <p>According to Franklin Ursula (1952) Traditionally, new technology has been concerned with the construction of machines, structures, and tools on a relatively large scale. The development of materials for building bridges or sky scrapers is an example of this, as is the development of the internal  construction engine and the nuclear reactor. While such activities involve all the sciences, from chemistry to nuclear physics, the overding goal has been the same to improve the human condition by finding better ways to deal with the macroscopic world. </p> <p>Jaulius Adama’s (1999) in his views says: Since world War II, the focus of technological activities has undergone a major change while the old activities are still pursued, they have largely superseded by applications of technology at the microscopic level instead of building large-scale structures and machines modern-day technology tends to concentrate on finding improved ways to transfer information and to develop new materials by studying the way atoms come together. The silicon clip and micro electronics typing the new technological trend, as does the blossoming of genetic engineering. The trend can be expected to continue into the fore seeable future. </p> <p>With the changing world of technology this day, it is important to say that modern technology has come to stay, and it plays significant role in the improvement of the secretary’s job which in turns enhances productivity in all aspect. </p> <p>However Eric Schalzbery (2004) in his views says that with the high rate of technological development in this “global village” era, the secretary has come to terms with the reality of having her job greatly enriched and complete business activities going on in modern office. The secretary plays important role in ensuring the proper utilization of these machines for greater productivity. </p> <p>In the past, most office work had been carried out manually although them the volume of office work had been small and there was less sophistication in the industrial art, hence there was no significant demand for modern technology. But today, when one looks at the basic tasks. In an office, whether it be writing, calculating, filling, sorting or analysis, it is found that office machines cam be used to dot he job better and faster which leads to great achievements and professionalism in the field. There has never been grater need for efficiency in business than there is today. All kinds of businesses. Must employ modern methods in their offices. The raw material of an office is information, and the responsibility of an office is lit that of a clearing house, receiving and sending out information, processing storing facts in various forms. Therefore, the ever increasing size of business organizations has increased the development of new techniques in office management. Unlike in the past, where the secretary made use of old model manual typewriter that does not enhance efficient. Since the secretary is a medium through which the organization actions and policies are conveyed to the public. In readable and disenable form, it is wise that she is exposed to office machines and understand their proper usage so that she can efficiently carryout the routine job of the office. By so doing the organization concern can benefit highly form the services of the secretary. </p> <p>The secretary is part of the management team since she is completely involved in the affairs of the office and in making and implementation of business plans. She deals with letter drafting and typing, filing processing and storing of information as well as disseminating information. With the office automation such as electronic typewriter Word process, computer, telephone, fax machine, internet, e-mail, photocopier and calculating machines at her disposal, her job is sure to progress swiftly and a boost to attaining productivity in the organization where she works. </p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </strong> </p> <p>Even though modern technology is regarded as important and of high value in ensuring quality work output in an office, as well as bringing about productivity. It is equally believed that these machines can cause job. Displacement. This is the fear that many employees suffer from when new machines are being purchased for use by their organization. The machines are cost effective. Some organizations do not really apply the use of some of the modern machines and this lead to poor performance, this is because they seem not to attach great importance to these machines and most secretaries are ignorant of their uses. </p> <p><strong>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>The study intend to achieve the following: </p> <p>a.      To examine the concept of modern technology and its effect on the secretary’s profession. </p> <p>b.      To examine whether modern technology causes job displacement of secretaries in organizations. </p> <p>c.       To determine whether the secretaries utilize the office machines for productivity in every aspect. </p> <p>d.      To determine whether the modern machines enhances the secretary’s efficiency. </p> <p><strong>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS </strong></p> <p>Based on the topic, the effect of modern technology on the secretarial profession in government parastatals, this study has drawn up the following research questions: </p> <p>a.      What effect do modern technology have on the secretary’s job in an organization.?</p> <p>b.      How has these modern machines caused job displacement of secretaries in organization’s today?</p> <p>c.       How well do secretaries utilize the office machines for productivity in their places of work?</p> <p>d.      Does modern machine enhance the secretary’s efficiency, performance and productivity. </p> <p><strong>1.5    SCOPE OF STUDY </strong></p> <p>The study covers all aspect relating to the effect of modern technology on secretarial profession such as the concept of modern technology, functions of modern office, secretarial function in government parastals, types of modern technologies used by secretaries in their profession, effect of modern technology on secretary performance. </p> <p>This also talks on how this variables can be put together to enhance productivity in all aspect most significantly in secretarial profession. </p> <p><strong>1.6       </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>The research believes that this study will be of immense benefit to the following categories of people. </p> <p>a.      <strong>Secretaries:</strong> This study will be useful to practicing secretaries. It will help broaden their knowledge about modern machines because they are the people who actually make most use of these machines in the offices, it will help motivate them in wanting to make use of the modern machines. </p> <p>b.      <strong>Employers of labour:</strong> This study will enable employers of labour to have more knowledge about the modern machines and will give them a focus in acquiring these machines for use by their secretaries for grater productivity in their business activities.. </p> <p>c.       <strong>Future Researchers:</strong> This study will serve as a guide to the future researchers who will need to study and expand on the same topic.

The question why people work is a controversial one because of the increasing complexity of industrialization in the society.</p> <p>William (1984) opines that motivating staff does not end or stop at mere giving out of rewards and incentives but to be effective and consistence in maintaining the rewards system. Although, it has been the practice of most organizations to ensure that rewards provided are ones which are highly demanded and utilized, since the behavior and attitude put into production depending largely on the kind of rewards and incentives existing in the organization.</p> <p>Porter and Lawler (1984) state that the first step in building effective reward practice is for the organization to ensure that rewards provided are ones which are widely desire by the office professionals on the day-to-day operation. This suggests that the reward and employer considers highly positive for certain office professionals may not be regarded by another set of office professionals in the same organization.</p> <p>Eugene (2007) postulates that the first step towards achieving and maintaining the morale of the workforce lies in understanding the differencing factors which motivated individuals within a team. (i.e. some factors regarded as inspirational force to one team- member, may attempt to another team-member). This mean that there are many or numerous ways of determining factors that can highly motivate and influence the morale of office professionals but the most successful way is simply ask them what their desires are.</p> <p>Mullins (1989) postulates that office professionals are experts of their own. The formal organization is now constantly changing with interested members and the individuals are central features of the organizational behaviors, and a necessary part of any behavioral situation, whether acting in isolation or as a part of a group, in response to expectation of the organization.</p> <p>Productivity is the amount of output per unit of input (labor, equipment and capital). There are many different ways of measuring productivity. For example, in a factory productivity might be measured based on the number of hours it takes to produce a good, while in the service sector, productivity might be measured based on the revenue generated by an employee divided by his/her salary.</p> <p>Productivity is a measure of the efficiency of production. Productivity is a ratio of what is produced to what is required to produce it. Usually this ratio is in the form of an average, expressing the total output divided by the total input. Productivity is a measure of output from a production process, per unit of input (Onasanya 1990).</p> <p>Productivity is a process of combining various material inputs and immaterial inputs (plans, know-how) in order to make something for consumption (the output). The methods of combining the inputs of production in the process of making output are called technology. Technology can be depicted mathematically by the production function which describes the relation between input and output. The production function can be used as a measure of relative performance when comparing technologies.</p> <p>Office professional is an occupation or vacation carrier where specialized knowledge of a subjects, field or science is applied. Office professional is a member of vacation founded upon specialized educational training. The term is used more generally to denote a white collar workers or a person who performs commercially in a field typically reserved for amateurs.</p> <p>Office professional may also refer to a person having impression competence in a particular activity.</p> <p>The secretary has extremely vast and varied significance. He/she plays or functions as an office manager and combines his/her varied skills, good human relation, supervisory competence, creative and initiative to ensure a more productive and perfect organization of work-force in the office.</p> <p>Onasanya (1990) states that, a secretary carryout the functions of communication in an organization. That is to say, the process by which information is disseminated between individuals, personnel in an organization is entirely necessitated by the secretary in that organization. A very efficient secretary is conscious of the importance of conveying the desired message in effective and appropriate manner, which in a way facilitates organizational productivity.</p> <p>Hornby (1995) opines that, Human Relation is one of the core functions of a secretary in an organization. It is the wholesome responsibility of a secretary to tactfully and wisely exhibit the role of Human Relations in order to create hard work.</p> <p>Melvin (1990) said that as occasion demands, the secretary may be required to stand in for the executive when the Executive is indisposed and perform or carryout a general supervision in an organization.</p> <p>A trader has little of no need at all for effective management of correspondences. However, as business expands, the need for paper work arises. Letters would have to be written and received, stored, processed and disseminated to the appropriate quarters for consumption. These documents may be needed for future references, which could only be formed or retrieved if they are properly kept.</p> <p>Nwosu (1997) defines storage of filling as the process of sorting documents or correspondences into appropriate headings, which enables easy location. This practice is good so long as it does not allow dust and insect to destroy or muddle up the documents. But advances filing tools for long-lasting preservation of documents has been carried out for effective and efficiency secretarial work or function. This implies that organization is enriched with more information both the past and present via this function, performed by secretary.</p> <p>It is also worthy of note that, secretarial functions have significantly enhanced the organizational administration operation. Whitehead (2001) states that, a secretary today the power behind the “throne” in many Executive situations. That is to say, behind every successful administration, a first class secretary acts as effective administration nerve.</p> <p>1.2    <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Experiment has shown that most techniques adopted or deplorable by the employers is void of appeal to encourage and influence the morale of the office professionals, and by extension could hamper the best of the office professionals working ability and productivity. This is because employers of labour have not taken into cognizance of those factors that boost efficiency and effective performance which ordinarily could yield high productivity in organization.</p> <p>More so, it is obvious that there is negative impression such as fear of reward system, which affects grossly the morale of the office professionals in achieving organizational goals. Some employers do not see the need of improving the staff welfare or give a better remunerations and incentives to them, and thereby has demoralize the morale of the workforce in the organization and has in turn reduced productivity of the office professionals.</p> <p>In addition, some employers of labor erroneously believe that by showing, swearing and treating office professionals with termination of their contract or employment would propel them to perform their duties. Whereas, this factor could yield “good” results in a short-term and in the long run, the office professionals will likely contemplate on either to keeping the job or quitting.</p> <p>Furthermore, the management in most cases are careless about what their workers feel productive or unproductive at work, and these have resulted to lateness, absenteeism, truancy, theft etc. all these are factors that have culminated to poor exhibition of attitudes toward work or performance.</p> <p>1.3    <strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The general objective of the study is to identify the effect of morale on an office professionals productivity in an organization, while the specific objective are as follows:</p> <p>1.  To find out the effects of leadership style on the morale of office professionals.</p> <p>2.  To identify the techniques used for boosting the morale of office professionals and their productivity in an organization.</p> <p>3.      To find out the impact of good environment on office professionals morale and productivity in an organization.</p> <p>4.      To investigate the ways in which effective communication of office professionals morale and productivity.</p> <p>1.4       <strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions have been formatted in order to help find out solutions to the problems under study.</p> <p>1.      What are the effects of different leadership styles on the productivity of office professionals? </p> <p>2.      What are the techniques used to boost office professional morale and          productivity in an organization?</p> <p>3.      What impact does work environment have on office professional morale and productivity in an organization?</p> <p>4.      In what ways does effective communication influence workers morale and productivity in an organization?</p> <p>1.5       <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The findings of this research will be of immense benefits to the office professionals, organization and the future researcher.</p> <p>The study will enable the office professionals of an organization to identify factors that will motivate them and by extension, they will be encouraged to put out in their best and achieve a better output.</p> <p>The study as well will be of great importance to the employers, since it will enable them to easily discover what is to be done, when and how to do them in order to gainfully devote the hearts of their office professional to work in an organization. More so, the study will indeed be of immense importance to organization, (i.e. management) as it will serve and enable them to identify factors that will boost employee’s morale working in the organization.</p> <p>This research work will serve as a source or reference materials for on-coming researchers who may be writing on a similar idea or researching for similar problem.</p> <p>1.6    <strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study is being conducted to find out factors that could boost and enhance employee’s morale in an organization. Therefore, the scope of this study would cover the effect of motivating workers in an organization, the roles of effective communication, effect of leadership styles on workers morale and productivity and the impact of working environment on workers morale and productivity in an organization.</p> <p>1.7    <strong>Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>The fact that the researcher was unable to use the entire population but instead resorted to sampling the study population posed a problem.</p> <p>Another major constraints to this study was the problem of finance. The cost of designing the questionnaire, typing, photocopying and binding of the project, transportation cost to the various units and department of some organization several times to administer and collect the questionnaire, was very high.</p> <p>The attitude of respondents was a real problem as some of them were nor ready to cooperate at all. The executives were simply out of reach. The few that the researcher was able to see, refused to attend to the researcher but instead suggested to change of topic as, to them, the topic is not researchable. Others asked the researcher to come back at a later date only to meet their absence or apology. Some of the respondents were on leave and so could not be reached.</p> <p>Finally, the problem of time was a major limitation the time given was very sort as it carried alongside normal academic work.</p> <p>1.8    <strong>Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>In the course of this study some unfamiliar terms were used which are seen strictly in the light of this study:</p> <p>§     <strong>Office Professional:  </strong>A person having impression of competence in a particular activity.</p> <p>§     <strong>Productivity: </strong>Productivity is a measure of the efficiency of production. Productivity is a ratio of what is produced to what is required to produce it.</p> <p>§     <strong>Employee: </strong>A staff of a particular organization.</p> <p>§     <strong>Morale: </strong>Means lifting an individual inner feelings or mind.</p> <p>§     <strong>Motivation:</strong> It is a spring of action which intends to positively influence the performance of office professional in an organization.</p> <p>§     <strong>Organization: </strong>A group of business that is formed for a particular purpose.</p>\n\n MORALE AND OFFICE PROFESSIONAL’S PRODUCTIVITY  (A STUDY OF KADUNA POLYTECHNIC COLLEGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES [CES])<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  MORALE AND OFFICE PROFESSIONAL’S PRODUCTIVITY  (A STUDY OF KADUNA POLYTECHNIC COLLEGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES [CES])", "id": 17}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>MOTIVATIONAL TOOLS AND THE PRODUCTIVITY OF OFFICE PROFESSIONALS</strong></p> <p><strong>(A Survey of Selected Organization in Kaduna Metropolis)</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0   Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Motivation and the productivity of office professional can best be talked about when motivation is viewed from the angle of the employees (i.e. office managers) because it is the employees that make-up the organization.</p> <p>In other words, when employees are well motivated and are doing well, they will be in the right frame of mine even at workplace and whatever they are doing, and in return, make the organization productive since the well being of the organization is a channel to their own (employees) well being. Also when employees or office professionals are well motivated by the organization their productivity would increase in a faster rate and profit will increase. (Abraham Maslow 1943),</p> <p>The problem of motivating workers by the management is synonymous to all organizations, the view of management of organizations are that their workers are well motivated based on their overall net-profit margin, while on the other hand, the employees claim that management has not motivated them enough.</p> <p>Human beings tend to have one need or the other at any point in time in their existence. Individuals are concerned as striving to satisfy those needs within a world of limited and unavailable resources we have. To satisfy those need certain behaviours must be exhibited that will lead to the desired goals.  That is, the inner drive that make them behave in such a way. This inner drive is the motivation. </p> <p>Motivation can be defined as the management behaviour, action or incentive which enables the workers to willingly see, accept responsibility and carry out their work or task satisfactorily. They increase their productivity everyday, particularly as it has contribution towards the general economics of the world.</p> <p>Motivational tools are those things put in place the employer t o force the behaviour of workers out. Motivational tool according to Matt Krumine (2000) says, motivational tools are those tools they enable the managers to motivate their workers or employees within and out side the organization, and it includes all the necessary tools that enable the employees to work effectively and get high productivity.</p> <p>Motivational tool enhance the productivity of employee (officer professionals) when used effectively. Productivity refers to the aggregate performance of an organization or employees (office professionals) according to Palik (2003) define productivity as a ratio of a measure of output to a measure of some or all of the resources used to produce these out. Currie (1972), says productivity is the qualitative relationship between what we produce and the resources we used. Productivity is concerned with the ration of output to an input. Grezor (2001) also sees productivity as the way in which will enhance the performance of office professionals to the high level of the organization.</p> <p>Office professional copes with all demands and stresses of the office in the way that he enjoys leadership control of crisis that might emanate from managing rewards people communication, information and other resources that are involved in making an office. according to MTU in Medilyn and Urwin (1980)l define office professionals as one in charge of typesetting, rewarding and keeping vital or confidential documents of an organization that some executives’ may not be allowed to access. That is why the thrust of this study is: what are the motivational tools that enhance the productivity of office professionals. </p> <p>Motivation can be defined as the management behaviour, action or incentive which enables the workers to willingly see, accept responsibility everyday, particularly as it has contribution towards the general economics of the world. There are various motivational tools used by employer to activate them.</p> <p><strong>1.1   Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The effect of motivation on the performance of workers cannot be overestimated as opined by motivation theorists such as Maslow.( Abraham Maslow 1943).</p> <p>However, some organization put more effort on structures, which include advertisement, promotion etc rather than on the workforce or the human resource. Their belief is that with or without the required input from the workers, they must succeed. </p> <p>Some organization put more money and resources without achieving employees or workers’ performance and  higher productivity due to lack of  motivation and motivational tools that help to have high performance and productivity.</p> <p>It is base on these issues that this study has decided to look into the  motivational tools and the productivity of office professional for an organizational achievement.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The general objectives of this research work is to determine the motivational tools that lead to increase the productivity  of office professionals in an organization  specifically the study will:</p> <p>1.   Identify the motivational tools that increase productivity of office professional in an organization</p> <p>2.   To critically examine the effect of unmotivated employees in relation to organizational growth</p> <p>3.   Determine the role of management in determining the best motivational tools to enhance productivity</p> <p>4.   Ascertain the effect of motivational tools on office professionals’ performance.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Research Question</strong></p> <p> This research work is based on the following research questions:</p> <p>1.   What are the motivational tools required to increase productivity of office professional in an organization</p> <p>2.   How does the motivation of office professionals lead to higher productivity?</p> <p>3.   How does a particular section of workers in an organization shows lack of interest in motivation?</p> <p>4.   To what extent do workers really perform  when they are motivated?</p> <p><strong>1.4   Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>When the strategic of motivating office professionals are fully explored this study will be benefited to:</p> <p><strong>Organizations:</strong> The organization in designing alternative strategy to motive its workers in order to increase productivity from the findings of this study</p> <p><strong>Employees:</strong> It will enable office professionals in an organization to know how best possible ways of being motivated by their various organizations as well as the kind of motivation that would best suit them</p> <p><strong>Students:</strong> This will also assist students when embarking on any work similar to this study.</p> <p><strong>Further Researcher: </strong>Researchers that want to broaden this study will equally be of benefit as it will serve as a good source of material for them.</p> <p><strong>1.5   Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study will be conducted in selected organizations in Kaduna metropolis which are: New Nigerian Development Company (NNDC), national Board for technical education (NBTE), National Eyes Center (NEC), power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHVN)l. the study also will cover so many aspects that are related to the topic which are: Motivational tools, and the productivity of office professionals.</p> <p><strong>1.6   Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>The definitions of some of the terms used in the content of this project is given below:</p> <p><strong>Productivity:</strong> The major ability to growth things or the calculated rate of making goods.

INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>On the early days the secretarial profession was limited to typing, writing and transcribing of shorthand only.  But today, it is far beyond this, it involved functions as sorting and retrieving of information passing on information and so on with the help of manual electronic equipment.  A secretary assistance to an executive, possessing mastery of office skills and ability to assume responsibilities without direct supervision who display initiative, exercises judgment and makes decision within the scope of his/her authority.  The secretary also handles more office jobs, makes and takes decision on behalf of his/her organization.  But because of the aforementioned about information communication technology, there are controversies about the future of the secretary in information communication technology.</p> <p>The term information communication technology was first widely employed in 1981 to describe the equipment and system, which were being introduced in both private and public sectors, to create, store and distribute information since, then, the term has abbreviated to (I.C.T.).</p> <p>The key feature of modern technology is its ability to deal with information in one form or the other.  Trend has been towards using ways of interconnecting the various types of equipments so as to integrate their functions and manage them effectively.  Underpinning the definition of “ICT” lies on the modern which provides a helpful explanation of the way in which computers process information.</p> <p>Information communication technology as the broadly based technology needed to support information systems, which many people today refers to as computer equipment, which aids to increase profit margin and enhance planning, and organization by the use of very fast, accurate and flexible devices in the business society.  Efficiency in offices many people believe, is a vital factor in the well being of an organization as it can affect productivity.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>The objective is to assess information communication and examine the problems faced to the modern secretary and the prospects the secretary is expected to meet with.  The specific objectives are:</p> <p>i.                   To examine the changing roles of the secretary in the ICT era.</p> <p>ii.                 To access the problem and threats of information communication technology to the secretarial profession.</p> <p>iii.              To highlight the challenges posed

capital, inadequate text books, and as a result of other academic activities going on.</p> <p><strong>1.6     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The significance of the study has risen from the researcher’s realization of the problem facing a secretary in the information communication technology at first bank, oceanic and interconnected bank plc Kaura Namoda branch, Zamfara State the researcher also realized the prospects of a secretary in the information communication technology.  This research work will be valuable assets to government policy makers on privatization and contributing to the successful up-lifting of secretaries in information communication technology.</p> <p><strong>1.7            </strong><strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</strong></p> <p><strong>1.7.1

<p><strong>1.0           </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p><strong>1.1           </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>It sounds rather ironic that at a time when the opposition and controversy to the activities of the principal players on the global stage are growing increasingly harsh and more loud, we have chosen as our theme for this research “THE EFFECT OF GLOBALIZATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON OFFICE SERVICES”. </p> <p>Globalization appears to be the most noticeable. Tough described by many as an elusive trend, globalization is a multi-dimensional, highly complex process with tending forms and a complex mix of effects in all places it touches. It is a process that has been referred to as “multi-faceted in its operation, massive in its reach and implications and elusive as a concept” Dele and Robertson (2003:14).</p> <p>Globalization, the term may be relatively new one. But the development it refers to has been known for quite a long time. In African for example the movement and traffic in human beings and other resources across the Sahara into the Arab world, and later across the Atlantic into the American and European were definitely a significant episode in the process. Similarly, the sustained Islamic and Christian missionary campaigns in Africa as well as the subsequent colonization and domination of the continent by foreign powers marked another important phrase. But in the modern and restarted sense in which the concept is used today, globalization as such refers to “The forging of a multiplicity of linkages and interconnections between state and societies, which make up the modern world system”. Allen and Thomas, (2000:20).  The process aim at making the world into one large global village /neighbourhood so that events, decision and activities in one part can come tot have significant consequences for people and communities in quite distant parts. The concept of globalization, as Ahrens explains has made a remarkable career in recent years because world wide processes in the field of economics, communication, transport of ideas, and migration of religion have gained such an enormous speed that in many people’s consciousness it appears as if our globe were shrinking Ahrens (2000:286). Social relations acquire as it were relatively distance less and borderless qualities as human beings are turned into actors in a single but open stage with their actions and interactions more and more being conducted and organized on the basis of one world unit. Globalization has significant military, political, legal and cultural dimensions. </p> <p>Information Technology has replaced the traditional equipment used by a secretary and the way in which secretarial task are performed is being modified. In the next ten years, as organizations try to stop the missing cost of paper work and to provide more information in a timely, usable format, electronic technology will be extended to the executive/managerial work station Iredia, (2002). </p> <p>Information technology abbreviated as (IT) is an act of the technology computer and communication. In the word of Carroll, information technology is “term that describes the disciplines encompassing computer system, telecommunication networks and multi media applications”. </p> <p>Globalization is no doubt producing new ways of using and thinking about information technology. It is universally acknowledged that globalization requires as well as produces new channels, networks and practices of communication which are not dependant on state or quality. Globalization narrowly refers to the growing economic interdependence of countries world wide Kevin (2001:116). </p> <p>Office service according to Mark (2003:11) are work that are being carried out in the office by the office professionals e.g. telephone answering services, from message bas, transcription, editing document, design and many other office services. </p> <p><strong>1.2           </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>This research work is focused on the effects of Globalization of information technology on office service. It has been observed that organizations both company, government and private in Nigeria has been left behind not really moving at the pace at which this technology </p> <p>Despite the provision of office equipment, office service providers lack the skills and knowledge to handle or in performing their duties using modern information technology because they are not being trained by the organizations to acquire the necessary skills they need. </p> <p>Moreover, some organizations find it difficult to adopt to the changes of information technology. The changes that information technology is bringing to individuals and economics are creating significant new uncertainties. Organizations and people are forced to adapt to new circumstances and to new requirements at the work place and outside, and these adaptation processes are complicated and often initially difficult. </p> <p>However, there is the fear of losing ones job due to information (electronics) technology explosion and the fear of complex equipment being introduced into the system the fear of secretarial ability and skills changes, also the fear of changes in secretarial job title. </p> <p><strong>1.3           </strong><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>This study is designed towards identifying some of the effects of globalization of information technology on office services.

Kaduna Metropolis)</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.0       <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1    <strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          In today’s national and international buiness world, information is a price less commodity, what ever form it takes, without up – to the minutes, accurate information, most commercial organization would quickly  founder.</p> <p>Such business offices serve as hubs or centers of information which take in, process, store and relay data and messages in a host of situations, financing, selling, building, making, servicing or advising – so as to to enable all sorts of people to function in their jobs, ranging from senior managers planning company activities over the next five years to stop assistants quering the current retail price of a product.</p> <p>While manual and paper-based system of information processing are still much in use, in the form of book, diaries, letters, invoices and so on, more and more office facilities are today being undertaken by electronic and compute-based technology.       </p> <p>Information technology, both in the industry and business world is resourceful. In the 1905s, business embarked on the first widespread use of computer primarily as tools for recording and processing accounting transactions.</p> <p>          Thus information technology has only really been part of business for about the last 40 years. Nonetheless, information technology  is one of the most important resources in today’s business environment. But what exactly is information technology.</p> <p>Aronu (1999) defines information technology as the combination of two technologies; computing and telecommunication (the cornerstone of information technology and the main purpose of which is to transmit representation of information (signals) between remote locations).</p> <p>          One must admit that the modern business world have been reshaped, compared to the business of years ago. History has it that man has to cross oceans, spend huge amount of money and energy to transfer information or transact business. Since the advert of computers, experts have contributed to research with a view of making computer a greater advantage to the business world.</p> <p>          The world at present is connected to a global system of communication that ensures speedy information and business transaction. The global system of communication involves the uses of computer, GSM, fax machine etc.</p> <p>          The modern technology offers world wide communication capability, a mechanism for information dissemination and a medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals without regard or geographical location.</p> <p>          Buying and selling electronically is changing the way people think and carry out transaction all over the world. Time, distance, and competitive product quality, is no longer the problem. This  has triggered off increased economic activities  and is having a considerable impact on the world of business. The business  world should not be left out in this trend.

This goals required the creation of a set of connected network that would act as a co-ordinate whole. </p> <p>According to Mborun (2007) the internet an the world wide web and its development technology as we have it today are contribution of scientist student and researchers each contribution at different time as the need arises.</p> <p>In July 199, Learnard Kleinrock of Massachusetts Institute to technology (M.I.T.) http//www.mit.edu. published the first paper on packet swathing which is a technology that breaks up data into bits to enable it travel trough witching commuter network. The idea of packet switching was to allow more users to send text message over computer network.</p> <p>Then in 1992 JCR Licklider presented his idea about Galelcltic network. This involves a global collection of computer in a huge net work so that  each one could acess the data and programmes of others. This earned MLiklier the headship of the Defence Academic Researcher projects Agency. His mission according to a report was to maintain its technological superiority over her enemies in the impending cold war. From then on the idea of network computer for information sharing became important.</p> <p>Also between 1967 and 1969 Learnard Klerrock idea of packet switching and JCR Lcklider Defence Advance Research project agency network net was on and running of this brought about computer network, capable of sending and receiving packet. The base line of these introductory problems this makes us understand that the internet as we have it today was in the womb of the intelligence military exigencies. This however an internet communication system.</p> <p>In the resulting internet the responsible of message routing was this spread throughout the network instead of being centered in one location by the early 90s past of the network had evolved in to the publicity assessable internet in large part the internet now over two decades old has grown in popularity because of the use of browser.</p> <p>1.2    <strong>Statement of the Problems</strong></p> <p>In today business world organization are becoming increasing concerned with high productivity of its employers. In order for private and public business organizations to achieve these objectives. Business organization are being connected to internet resources for the effective performance of the secretary. The secretary had many things to offer more than being an assistance to an executive processing without direct supervision who display initiative exercise judgment and make decision within the scope of his/her authority. This task of a secretary being on many computer illiterate secretary it is worth mentioning that as more internet resource in the office are introduced the more demand for qualified computer literate secretary.</p> <p>Employers need secretaries who are skilled and computer knowledge and knowledge in computer. There are hardly any advancement of secretaries that does not ask for computer literate.</p> <p>But employers complain that it is difficult to find secretaries with the skill urgently need for business survival and growth. This limits the employed opportunities for some secretaries</p> <p>1.3    <strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of the study is to find out the impact of internet software packages to the modern secretaries.</p> <p>1)           To know the extent the internet had aid the efficiency and effectiveness of operations in an organization.</p> <p>2)           To know how the internet software packages help in widening the scope and knowledge of the secretary.</p> <p>3)           To ascertain how organizations benefit from the internet software package.</p> <p>4)           To ascertain how relevant the internet software packages is to the modern secretary.</p> <p>1.4    <strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>In order to make an implicit work and to help in the analysis of the impact of software packages to the modern secretaries the researchers frames these research questions base, of the objectives of the study.</p> <p>1)           What extent has the internet aid the efficiency and effectiveness of operations in an organization?</p> <p>2)           Has the internet help in widening the scope and knowledge of the secretary?</p> <p>3)           How does the organization benefit from the internet?</p> <p>4)           How relevant is the internet software packages to the secretary?</p> <p>1.5    <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study will be of great significance to the colleges of education, polytechnic and university which are the procedures of a secretary.

Is a fact that all human activities are interdependent on one another socially, economically, culturally and politically. No human being can live in isolation, that is to say human being must pass on and also receive information in every activities that must be done. Communication is one of the fundamental functions of the office and process which is essential to all forms of business. It is the means of conveying information from one person to another, which can be through Telephone, post office, Teleprinter, Mobile phone, Messenger services, Computer and many other means. Communication is done in order to pass or receive information, ideas and knowledge from one person to another.</p> <p>During the past few decades there have been development and improvement in office communication system. This makes the work of today’s trained secretaries to be easier.</p> <p>Azuka (1990), states that the word Secretary is taken from the Latin word “Secretaries”. This means that the Secretary is the ability to keep information or knowledge away from others. But in your own views a secretary is the keeper of secret.</p> <p>Little (1976), defines Communication as “the process by which information is passed between individuals and organization by means of previously agree symbols such as words, fiscal grimaces, gestures, postures, pictorial or usual display etc.</p> <p>1.2    <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The Advent of modern communication facilities has spured up radical changes in the secretarial profession. These changes have been characterized by new methods of doing this, with emphasis on Information and Communication Technology (ICT).</p> <p>According to Ali and Akinbi (1995), technology is an alteration in the life of an equipment, character, knowledge and method of doing things. The impact of these modern communication facilities this resulted into the acquisition of the needed competencies by secretaries, to effectively and efficiently operates these facilities in order to be relevant in the world of Labour. This is because, prior to this time, the communication facilities obtainable in the office were; Analog, Telephone, the manual typewriter, Teleprinter, Duplicating machine, reprographic machines etc.</p> <p>Today Modern Communication facilities which include, computer, internet, mobile phones, fax machine, telegram etc. have replaced the persons existing ones. This had also created another impetus on the secretary, as there is an improvement in the way/she discharge his/her duties. However, the impact of modern communication gadget on the organization goals, have not been properly felt for instance the says in some organization are not still efficient even though there gadget. The problems of modern facilities seem to care a problem for instance some says it must undergo many loose of their job.</p> <p>1.3    <strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The overall purpose of this study is to examine the impact of modern communication equipment on the Secretary and the profession. However, the specific objectives of the study are:</p> <p>1.           To identify the modern communication gadgets is the use in organization.</p> <p>2.           To find out the impact of modern communication facilities on the organization goals.</p> <p>3.           To assess the impact of modern communication gadgets on the efficiency of the Secretary.</p> <p>4.           To outline the problems which modern communication facilities pose to the secretary profession.</p> <p>1.4    <strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>1.           What are the modern communication gadgets in use in organizations?</p> <p>2.           What are the impacts of modern communication gadgets on organizational goals?</p> <p>3.           What is the impact of modern communication gadgets on the efficiency of the Secretary?</p> <p>4.           What are the problems of modern communication facilities to the Secretary profession?</p> <p>1.5    <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>It is hoped that if the importance and the roles of Secretaries in the usage of modern communication equipment in communication is identified, the secretary will benefit from it, because by providing the modern facilities such as computer, mobile phone, Teleprinter, and Printing machine, photo-copy to improve its skills. Also secretarial students will benefit from this modern communication facilities.</p> <p>1.6    <strong>Scope/Delimitation of Study</strong></p> <p>The essence of the research work is to find the effects of modern communication facilities on the Secretary. The research work is however, delimited to the following areas: What is communication? Identify the modern communication gadgets in use in organizations, the impact of modern communication facilities on the secretary assess. Communication gadgets on the efficiency of the Secretary and outline the problems which modern communication facilities pose to the secretarial profession.</p> <p>1.7    <strong>Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>These are definition of some words which might sound strange to the readers and which will also make the research work comprehensive and readable.</p> <p>-              <strong><em>Secretary: </em></strong>A person employed by an organization to deal with papers and correspondence keep records and assist his/her boss in the day to day running of the organization.</p> <p>-              <strong><em>Communication: </em></strong>The process of passing ideas, information and documents from one person, location etc. to another though usage of a specified channels.</p> <p>-              <strong><em>Modern: </em></strong>This is the present or recent time(s) or things.</p> <p>-              <strong><em>Impact: </em></strong>The effect or the importance.</p> <p>-              <strong><em>Equipment:</em></strong> Tools or machinery use for specific purposes.</p> <p>-              <strong><em>Secretarial: </em></strong>Duties of a secretary</p> <p>-              <strong><em>Profession:</em></strong> Individual areas of specialization or occupation.</p> <p>-              <strong><em>Computer: </em></strong>It is a machine or an electric device which accepts information from an input device, it also performs arithmetical logical operations in accordance with a pre-defined programme and fully transfer the processed data to an output device either for further processing or in final printed form like business document.</p> <p>-              <strong><em>Word Processing: </em></strong>Getting ideas into words, words into papers and then to the final result and communications.</p> <p>-              <strong><em>NCC: </em></strong>Network Control Center</p> <p>-        <strong><em>VDU: </em></strong>Visual Display Unit</p> <p>-        <strong><em>CPU: </em></strong>Central Processing Unit</p> <p>-        <strong><em>SCPC: </em></strong>Single channel perceiverv</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MODERN COMMUNICATION FACILITIES ON THE SECRETARY (A SURVEY STUDY OF SOME SELECTED ORGANIZATIONS IN KADUNA METROPOLIS)  <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF MODERN COMMUNICATION FACILITIES ON THE SECRETARY (A SURVEY STUDY OF SOME SELECTED ORGANIZATIONS IN KADUNA METROPOLIS)  ", "id": 24}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE IMPACT OF OFFICE ENVIRONMENT ON OFFICE   PROFESSIONALS PRODUCTINITY</strong></p> <p><strong>(A Survey of Selected Organization in Kaduna Metropolis)</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Contemporary dictionary defines environment as all the surrounding condition, which influence growth and development. Environment can also be defined as the external and internal surrounding of an office as it affects a secretary. According to Rwuaan (2010), an office is a building where clerical work is done, where information is received, conveyed, recorded processed and safeguard. An office is generally a room or other area in which people work, but may also denote a position within an organization with specific duties attached to it (see office, office holder, official), the latter is an fact an earlier usage, office as place originally referring to the location of one’s duty. </p> <p>An office is an architectural and design phenomenon and a social phenomenon, whether it is a small office such as a bench in the corner of a “mom and pop shop” of extremely small size (see small office home office) through entire floors of buildings up to and including massive building dedicated entirely to one company. In modern terms an office usually refers to the location where white-collar workers are employed.</p> <p>Productivity has been generally defined as a ration of a measure of output to a measure of some or all of the resources used to produces these output. In this way, one or a number of input measures can be taken and compared with one or a number of output measure. When attempt is made to include all inputs and all output in a system, the measure is called a Total Productivity Measure (TPM) Palik (2006) explains in his what that the input used in a process can be hour of labour, unit of capital and qualities of raw materials compared with the consequent output.</p> <p>History has it that the background of office professional dates back to the days when ancient office professionals who were then called secretaries worked under the primitive circle of office surroundings. Despite the fact that the importance of the early office professionals was realized when the need for keeping, retrieving and safeguarding confidential matters were needed. At that time, the duties and responsibilities of office professionals was of much importance in terms of job satisfaction the office profession. The duties and responsibilities of office professional involves providing services relating to processing, documenting and disseminating information, (Smith, 2008).</p> <p>Today, the duties and responsibilities of office professional in organization are very important that no organization can survive without this class of workers. They are so important that the ill conceived idea of the federal Government to right size and down size these class of worker caused great set back in the discharge of office function which made it imperative for all affected office professional to be recalled back to their duties (BPSR, 2008).</p> <p>The function of office professionals in organizations have formed part of the cardinal roles stated in available literatures. In consonance with the views expressed above. Omotosho (1990) states that no business activity succeeds without an efficient office professional. The office professional copes with all demands and stresses of the office in the way that he enjoys leadership control of crisis that might emanate from managing records, people communication, information and other resources that are instinctively involved in making an office.</p> <p>In most office today, two types of office professionals are recognized and these are the personal or private and confidential. For the purpose of updating the duties and responsibilities of office professionals, MTU in Madelyn and Urwin (1980( defined office professionals as one in charge of typesetting, recording and keeping vital or confidential document of an organization that some assist a member of staff at top level by undertaking some of his routine work and ensuring the smooth executives may not be allowed access to; while the private office professional is one who employed to running of the office.</p> <p>Ceik and forti (2009) state that the duties of office professional in organization includes organizing, coordinating and implementing delicious for the day to day running of the organization. Azuonge (2007) says executives in most organization are ignorant of the vital roles performed by office professional for the growth of an organization as such these class of worker are seen with little or no respect as clerks  and mail runners by this officers. To achieve any set objective by an organization in a work place, it require the complete efforts of a team work. The office professional being part of this team plays an important and essential function in bringing about the desired success in every organization, irrespective of services it renders to the general public. Jeffrey and Kevin, (2001) state that in this age of globalization, characterized by computer and other office technology, as well as sophisticated nature of office dealings, the duties and function of office professionals in achieving organizational goals cannot be over emphasized.</p> <p>Njoku (2003) opines that the duties of office professionals vary and are often unspecified. However, the duties and function of office professionals and the expectations of an employer. These duties include taking down notes from the speech of the boss and producing a mail able copy out of it, performing reception duties involving public relations, clerical duties involving replying to correspondence, filling operations, records management, other unspecified function such as booking flights and accommodation, running specialized errands etc.</p> <p>He adds that the functions of the office professionals are ever expanding rapidly. However, the proper performance of duties by office professional is a reliable avenue for the image making profiles such office professional work with. It is with this in mind that the research work is being carried out to identify the duties and responsibilities of office professionals in Kaduna polytechnic.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Problem </strong></p> <p>The office environment is a determining factor to office professionals performance and productivity but this has not been achieved in modern day office as a result of the following problems such as inadequate of modern office equipments, poor human relations, physical environmental factors and poor remuneration of office professionals, all these factors contribute to low performance of office professionals. It is not uncommon to find some organizations still subjecting office professional to the use of manual typewriters. When office professional are not provided with efficient and effective working tools, productivity is definitely bound to be low.</p> <p>It is equally agreed that some office professionals find it difficult to get along with their work as a result of un-conducive environment in the office. this brings about other tendencies among with include the inability to control staff under her or not giving proper attention to visitors in the office     .Overcrowding and of clean office or environment especially in the office professional’s office seriously have impacts in the productivity of the office professional</p> <p><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The major purpose of this study was to examine the impact of office environment on the productivity of office professional. But in specific terms, the study was under taken to:</p> <p>1.                 find out the types of modern office machines require for office professionals productivity.</p> <p>2.                 determine the physical environmental factors that lead to the attainment of the organizational objectives</p> <p>3.                 to find out how adequate remuneration of office professional improve office productivity in an organization.</p> <p>4.                 to find out how human relation skills increase office professional productivity.</p> <p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions and hypotheses were posed and formulated for the study:</p> <p>                               i.            What are the types of office equipment require for office professionals productivity</p> <p>                             ii.            What are the physical environmental factors that lead to the attainment of organizational objectives</p> <p>                          iii.            How does human relations skills influence office professional productivity in an organization</p> <p>                          iv.            How does remuneration influence office professional productivity in an organization.</p> <p><strong>Significance of the Study </strong></p> <p>The significance of this research can never be over emphasized.

There are other technological transformation on the way we live, play and relax in our homes.<br/>However, this technological advancement has ushered in drastic changes in all walks of life, secretarial profession is no exception. The basic abilities required for secretarial work with continue to change as sophisticated equipment are introduced into the office.<br/>The impact brought about by invention of new office equipment cannot be over emphasized. Most of these office equipment out-perform secretaries due to their speed, and as well saving of time. The introduction of such machines might cost secretaries their jobs or result to the reduction of the number being employed. It envisaged that as technology advances and new products and processes replace old ones, craft and skills would definitely disappear. Consequently, there would be a problem of extra cost of training and re-training, to get them acquainted with these new inventions.<br/>This motivates the researcher into investigating and ascertaining how true theses statements are, with respect of technology and its effect on secretarial profession. Her findings will also enable her make meaningful suggestions as to know how to face challenges posed by these technological advancement in this technological era.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>The world is undergoing technological transformation now that we are at the threshold of the 21st century. There are new inventions that are changing the way we move from place to place, others that are changing, our traditional methods of communication and even others that are changing, the way we live, look, eat, sleep and relax in our homes. More importantly is changing the face of the offices of today and this process is likely to accelerate as we enter the 21st century. The secretary as one of those who work in offices is not left out in the impact made by technological transformation of offices. What are the effect of these changes on the person of the secretary, her traditional functions in the office, her ability to cope, her job security, her relevance to the office work for which she is employed and more so to meet the challenges of her ever-changing work environment. This research, using NEPA-Enugu, is aimed at fining answers to these questions. It is believed that at the end, the researcher may make recommendations that will help the secretary adjust and re-adjust as her work environment is restructured by technological change.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong><br/>This study is aimed at finding out what the effects of modern technology (invention/innovation of modern office machines) are on the secretarial profession. This study also intends to identify and analyze the relevance and importance of the various office machines to the everyday working life of the secretary.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study is didactic, in that it enlightens the public and secretaries who think, that they cannot be useful again due to the introduction of this new office equipment. This ought to done in order to boost their morals and increase their productivity as well. This study will go along way to encourage practicing secretaries and secretaries in training not to fear about the future prospect of their profession.<br/>This research study is beneficial to higher Institutions and teachers as well, in that it would induce them to install some of these newly introduced office equipment, as to enable the students practice before their graduation and not just teaching them theoretically.<br/>This study will also be of help to subsequent researchers that may be interested in doing more work in this area of study with a view of recommending how to tackle these challenges brought about by modern technology.</p> <p><strong>1.5 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The objectives of this study therefore are:<br/>a. To identify the roles and responsibilities of secretaries and their vitality.<br/>b. To discuss about the newly introduced office equipment and its impact on secretarial profession.<br/>c. To recommend solutions to these secretaries who think their services are no longer necessary and felt threatened on their profession due to innovations.<br/>d. The increasing dependence of modern secretaries on modern office equipment as basis for increasing productivity prompts a vivid research work to find out the extent to which such equipment are better used and the effect they have on the secretary.<br/>e. This research will serve as a reference source to the National Board for Technical and School Authorities in up-dating their syllabus in secretarial Administration.</p> <p><strong>1.6 DELIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The scope of this study is very wide if it has to be carried out in all the modern offices in Nigeria. The study is limited, based on the fact that there is no time and material resources to see the secretaries in the whole Nation. This study is limited to secretaries in (NEPA-Enugu, in Enugu State) and the findings may not reflect the situation in the whole secretaries in Nigeria, but by and large, what happens to secretaries in NEPA-Enugu can be said to apply to other secretaries in whole Nation.</p> <p><strong>1.7 RESEARCH OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>a. Is the secretary likely to be more efficient and productive with the use of modern office machines?<br/>b. Does technology act as stimulant to the secretary?<br/>c. Can modern office machines act as aids that can assist the secretary in her work?<br/>d. Is there a likelihood that modern office machines can take over the job of the secretary?</p> <p><strong>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>For the purpose of this study, it is important to define some of the terms as they were used in the context of this research work so that the terms may not be given a misconstrue.<br/>Secretary:<br/>A secretary is an executive assistant who possesses the mastery of skills, demonstrates the ability to assume responsibility, who exercises initiative and judgment and who makes the decision within the scope of her authority.� <br/>Technology:<br/>This is the branch of knowledge dealing with scientific, industrial method and their practical use in the industry.<br/>Innovations:<br/>It means introducing changes or introducing new things. It implies technical innovations in the office.<br/>Computer:<br/>Is an electrical or electronic devices, which can both, process raw data and store information, perform mathematical works, logical and equally give a feed back.<br/>Word Processors:<br/>Word-Processors are modern typewriters, but have advantages over ordinary typewriters; one is the ability to produce individually typed copies of documents at very high speed; another is that it enables corrections, reformat, and insertions to be made easily to edited draft without the typist having to retype the unaltered portions.</p> </div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY ON THE SECRETARIAL PROFESSION IN GOVERNMENT PARASTALS", "id": 26}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>STUDY OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF OFFICE TECHNOLOGIES IN SECRETARIAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM IN NIGERIA POLYTECHNICS </p> <p>(A Case Study Of The Institute Of Management And Technology Enugu)</p> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>This study was carried out to discover the possible implications posed by the office Technologies in Secretarial Education Curriculum in Nigeria Polytechnics.

This is because of new machines, which are threatening to take-over the jobs performed by thee categories of workers thereby making them face job hard of redundancy, retrenchments which will lead to mass unemployment will result. <br/>Nigeria is undergoing technological revaluations just like any other developing country of the world. This technology advancement has actually revolutionized most office activities and procedures. Until recently, the study of secretarial educations programme in our polytechnics especially institute of management and technology (I.M.T), Enugu was based mainly on shorthand, typewriting and office practice. The activities had greatly changed since supervisor of the polytechnic by the NBTE.<br/>The task and activities of these categories of workers in most offices and business circles lave also increased tremendously because of the high office responsibilities expected of the secretary to now handle with little or no supervisions. The scope of the course they now cover before qualification has also greatly increased.<br/>They now have to be trained and educated in too many course and have to acquire more technical skills to be able to handle and manipulate the very modern office machines now inherent in most business offices if they have to be marketable and employable.<br/>Secretarial professions now have to battle with the skills of handling the electric typewriters, scanners, ward processors, the facsimile (FAX) machines, the computers etc. This is to enable him meet up wit the increasing demand of information as and when urgently required which could not have been so carried out with the use of manual typewriters. <br/>It should be noted that these automatic, light -technological machines couldn’t do everything or operate themselves without the human aid, thus making the needs and quests for the professionals in secretarial filed necessary. <br/>The most current and implicating question in the minds of the present day secretarial studies educators and curriculum planners is what to do in order to keep peace with the technological changes in secretarial office equipment. This is because the more knowledgeable the secretaries are in the use of these office technologies, the better prepared our country will be to develop technologically. <br/>Hence, in the opinion of Kanu (1987), there must be positive attitude towards continuous up dating of knowledge for everyone, especially the secretaries, if this age of technological advancement is to be acquired and improved advancement and inter – personnel skills developed.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong><br/>Since a lot of office work is based on the basic knowledge of key boarding and clerical skills, it became apparent that if secretarial education curriculum in our polytechnics are not reviewed, revisited and updated from time, to adequately take care of these technological changes, the products of this profession mighty not be able to face challenges they will meet in future in the course of their working life. <br/>It therefore, becomes apparent that those concerned with the training and education of secretaries in our polytechnics and other institutions of higher learning should always adjust their curriculum so s to catch up and stay afloat with the incessant technological changes and advancements. The problems then is how far has I.M.T been able to adjust its curriculum to reflect the current development? How far have they been able to purchase the equipment required for the training? Do they have qualified personnel to handle these equipments? Are the students being adequately prepared?</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE FO THE STUDY </strong><br/>The main purpose of this project is to find out the implications of office technologies in secretarial education curriculum in I.M.T Enugu, specifically, this purpose targets at: <br/>i) Identifying the implications of office technology on the secretarial education curriculum in I.M.T Enugu <br/>ii) The cause of frequent changes in educational curriculum especially that of secretarial education programme performance. <br/>iii) To ascertain whether / if these office technologies that are used in the different to offices today are available in the Department of secretarial studies of institute of Management and Technology (I.M.T), Enugu where secretaries are trained. <br/>iv) Identifying whether the curriculum planners re-cognized these implication before gong on the drawing board, drawing especially for secretarial <br/><br/><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>Technological development has taken a rather tremendous new dimension since the middle of this century. According or Ndubuisi (1981), since there is need to promote interest in more and advanced technology, provision should also be made for institutions, the nation as a whole, curriculum planners and business world. <br/>By finding out the implication of office technology on the secretarial educations curriculum in our polytechnics especially IMT, all that are involved in the training of these category of professionals and the curriculum planners, will be able to adjust their curriculum and course contents to suit the needs of the expanding technological business world. Their products, the students, secretaries would then be prepared well enough enter the now world of automated offices and still face squarely the implications inherent in high technological environments without fears of retrenchments.<br/>The study will among other things, serve as a guide to the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) in determining these new trends that are designed to become an integral part of business studies and include some of the programmes in the school syllabus.<br/>Finally, the country and the business parastatals swill also benefit from this study since the school of business has been producing very proficient and marketable personnel that will stand the vigorous test of time through updated planed curricula, especially in this ear of technological advancement.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTION</strong><br/>In order to obtain more purposeful and significant results form the data analysis, the following questions will be tested in the course of the study<br/>1. What are the implication of office technologies in the secretarial education curriculum in the institute of management and technology Enugu?<br/>2. Is the institute prepared to meet up with the implication in training students for today’s and future technological office environment?<br/>3. What effects have the frequent changes in curriculum brought to the secretarial studies department?<br/>4. Being aware of the technological changes in the country do you think this will have any effect in your career as secretaries?</p> <p><strong>1.6 DEFINITION OF TERMS </strong><br/>BREADING UNEMPLOYED GRADUATES <br/>Training and turning-out of graduates who cannot be employed because they lack of the required skills for handling and manipulating modern office machines and equipment.<br/>CURRICULUM <br/>Subjects / courses included in course study like secretarial studies or taught in a particular school or collage.<br/>OFFICE TECHNOLOGIES <br/>The application of he use of modern office machines and equipment in performing office tasks for quicker and greater production. <br/>COMPUTER LITERACY <br/>Being educated or enlightened on the uses, functions and operations of the electronic data processing machine called the computer, which is capable of handling, processing, staring and retrieving information at the shortest possible time. <br/>OFFICE AUTOMATION <br/>The use of different types / kinds of machines aided devices to work in an office in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the employed manpower. <br/>TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION <br/>Drastic charge shift from the use of old fashioned machine and equipment to the recently manufactured (modern) are. <br/>TECHNIQUES <br/>Methods of getting things done or preferred.</p> </div> </div>\n\nSTUDY OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF OFFICE TECHNOLOGIES IN SECRETARIAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM IN NIGERIA POLYTECHNICS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STUDY OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF OFFICE TECHNOLOGIES IN SECRETARIAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM IN NIGERIA POLYTECHNICS", "id": 27}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ROLE OF PROFESSIONAL SECRETARIES IN COMMERCIAL BANK </p> <p>(A Case Study Of Afribank Plc In Enugu Urban)</p> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>The research study investigated the role of secretaries in computerized offices, with particular reference to commercial banks in Enugu urban Afri-Bank Plc Enugu was mainly used for the study <br/>The population consists of all the secretaries in Afri Bank Plc.

As far back as 1887, Lord Eshere word who defined a secretary as “ a mere servant” his position is that he has to do what he is told and no person can assume he has any authority to represent anything at all. Thus the above definition was however made when the values of secretarial profession has yet been recognized. At this time, secretarial functions were limited to only typing with manual typewriter, writing with shorthand and filling of documents <br/>As years pass by, the educated status of secretaries as enhanced and their responsibility in the organization became clearly defined. In 1982, Margaret Kuntz define secretary in a magazine “Today’s Secretary” as an executive who possesses a mastery of office skill, demonstration the ability to assume responsibility and makes decisions within the scope of assigned authority <br/>Today secretary ship is a very vital and indispensable cancer needed for the smooth and efficient running of the day-to-day business of any organization. Their functions are limitless, not only do the secretary type, but they do that with the electric typewriter, computer and so many other sophisticated office equipment<br/>A good secretary is a public relation officer and an administrative head. She is the image maker. In other words, the reflecting glass of the organization. Most executive secretaries handle only highly confidential matters while jobs of less confidential nature are passed down to her subordinates.<br/>Moreover, even before the advent of computers, many speculations were made as regards the replacement of the secretaries by the computers since computer perform all office work at a very amazing speed, but this has been disproved because the secretary has to tell the computer what to do and when to do it. <br/>Before the word computer is used when referring to a person who arithmetic procedures such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division is extraordinary <br/>During that period man use pebbles, grains of corn, fingers and toes as well as smaller objects <br/>The numerous problems encountered by man, what dealing with large number was, the necessity which gave to the invention of a computer. The Abacus was adopted and modified by the Chinese and the Japanese about 2600 B.C</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong><br/>The major problem of secretarial profession is that people see it as a profession that had no definite sequence, a procedure for the job <br/>They feel that the secretary is often interrupted by telephone call, visitors, colleagues, and subordinates and even the boss may call her to receive one assignment or the other that the effect on secretary efficiency and productivity in the organization are cut down <br/>However, there has been a lot of speculation and inscription that the invention of computer in organization has posed a lot of problem to secretaries in all ramification and therefore seen as possible replacement of secretaries in organization using it (computer) . <br/>Secretaries in the part of the world is under rated. People see them as a profession by unintelligent people. The common occupied belief is that anybody who uses the typewriter takes dictation a secretary. Since the majority of the so called secretaries are typist with little or no secretarial education and training, the general belief is that the duties of a secretary do not go beyond taking dictation and typing correspondence, she is seen as having little or no contribution to make towards the attainment of organizational goals. <br/>Presently, most offices are equipped with modern technological equipments. Many business organization which do not have the financial capacity to produce most of the equipments see themselves odd in the pool of modern organization. Making use of the new equipment maximally enhances the productivity and efficient of workers <br/>It is expected that those machines and equipments should have special handling before they improve performance. What has not been known at the present is whether modern secretaries know how to operate these machines successfully, appreciated productivity. <br/>It has also not been known weather secretaries play special role in Afri-bank Plc we use the office equipment and whether secretaries play any special roles in willing them<br/>The research work therefore sought the role and the roles and the roles of professional secretaries in commercial banks in Enugu Urban</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>The purpose of the study is to <br/>i. Find out the role which secretaries perform in Afri bank<br/>ii. Find out if secretaries are trained to perform these roles <br/>iii. Find out if they encounter any obstacle from performing such roles <br/>iv. Find out secretaries in Afri-Bank Plc who uses modern office equipment <br/>v. Find out if the use of modern office equipments enhances secretaries productivity</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>The findings of the study of the roles of secretaries in Afri-bank Plc shall be useful to the practicing secretaries in appreciation of their ideal functions as secretaries. The findings shall also be useful to students secretaries in tertiary institutions to preview the task ahead of them. The study shall be of immense benefit to chief executives of business organization in appraising the responsibilities to their secretaries. The study shall also be beneficial to curriculum designers at the tertiary load in determining the real training to be given to student’s secretaries</p> <p><strong>1.5 DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>This research concentrated only on findings and the roles of secretaries in a computerized office. The study was conducted in Afri-bank Plc.</p> <p><strong>1.6 ASSUMPTION OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>The researcher assumes that if secretaries are trained peoples, they will also perform their role well. The researcher also assume that if organization procure modern office equipment, the performance of societies shall improve</p> <p><strong>1.7 RESEARCH QUESTION </strong><br/>1. What roles to secretaries perform in commercial banks <br/>2. To what extent are the secretaries in Afri-Bank Plc trained to perform their roles<br/>3. What problem do the securities encountered from performing the role <br/>4. To what extent does the use of modern office equipment helps secretaries in performing these roles <br/>5. Do secretaries in Afri-bank Plc use modern office equipment.</p> <p><strong>1.8 DEFINITION </strong><br/>Role – According to Oxford Advance learner’s dictionary of English language, role is a function which a person or hiring typical is expected to have. In this project role is use to seen somebody in an organization. <br/>PROFESSIONAL – According to Oxford advance learner’s dictionary language, profession is a type of job that need special training skill, especially one that needs a high level of education. In this project, it is used to weigh role of secretaries and their performance in an organization. <br/>SECRETARIES- According to advanced learners dictionary of English Language is a person who works in an office, working for another person dealing with letters and telephones call, typing, keeping records, arranging meetings with people.

It is the bank significantly chosen for the study.</p> <p><strong>1.9 IMPLICATION OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>The introduction of office automation has verify greater information and a lot of changes in office operation. <br/>Office Automation simply means the use of computer in carrying out variety of operation such as word process, data process relation and natural accounts and other salary operation. <br/>The need of this study is to know the role of professional secretary in an automated secretaries office. This study implies that business organizations that are computerized will still require the services of secretary if most of the functions of secretary will not take over by the computer.<br/>They study also implies most of the job of all if they exclude through the computer. The services of secretaries may not b e require. Therefore study of arouse if secretary in the computerized office w have variety of implication of curriculum designed and educational policy making to assist to take care of student which shall in nature to the world of works.</p> </div> </div>\n\nROLE OF PROFESSIONAL SECRETARIES IN COMMERCIAL BANK<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ROLE OF PROFESSIONAL SECRETARIES IN COMMERCIAL BANK", "id": 28}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CONTRIBUTION OF OFFICE MANAGERS TOWARDS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ORGANIZATIONAL GOAL </p> <p>(A Case Study Of Eedc Owerri District Office)</p> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div><strong><em>ABTRACT</em></strong><br/>This study examined the contributions of office managers towards the achievement of organizational goal. 160 participants were used for the study comprising 140 office managers and 120 bosses.

The term secretary is derived from the Latin word Secenere meaning ’’to distinguish or to set apart.<br/>A Secretary handles the confidential information of any organization. A Secretary provides the administrative support to senior level professional commonly called ’’Executive Assistant’’ This individual performs a variety of clerical operations and sometimes personal task aimed at ensuring that organization runs in an efficient and organized manner .<br/>In addition, it is not uncommon for employers to prefer to hire candidate who possess a college degree. Although, these has been traditionally viewed as an entry level for the occupation. The roles of secretary is extremely challenging, the need to be technically proficient is important because, office automation has moved from mechanization to electronic form. Secretary are expected to handle programs such as word processor, spreadsheet, database, desktop publisher, internet software package, computer file manager, presentation, financial system, internet publisher, which aimed at ensuring speed and accurate task performance.<br/>Also, he/she must be able to properly use host office machines including photocopiers, fax machine, and multiline telephones. The Secretary is often seen as an image maker, public relation personnel, information processor and indispensible personnel in the organization. He/she is often regarded as the clearing house through which various project undertake. As a result, the challenge of staying organize and on top of everything is required of him everyday Ohakwe (2012).<br/>Earlier, the role of office manager was limited in taking notes from their bosses. However, with the advent of technology in companies and offices, these duties have extended to things that were meant for the professional managers. Nowadays, employer prefer candidate who at least have a college degree. One can also enrol for specialize courses that train people to carry out their duties effectively. Though, the role of secretary profile is generally the same in any organization. In an attempt to write on the contributions of office Managers in achieving success at work, one shall attempt in this presentation to x-ray the contribution of office manager in achieving success at work through a simple but pragmatic SWOTT Analysis, where ‘S’ stand for strength,' W' for weakness, ‘O’ for opportunities 'T' for threat, and the last 'T' for trends. A curious mind at this juncture may ask who a Secretary is.</p> <p><strong><em>Statement of Problem</em></strong><br/>Over the year, there has been serious misconception about office manager by the public and others who are not in the profession sometimes look down on them as secretary assistant 2 (typist and stenographer) who wait and work according to the various wishes of their bosses. Others look at them as subordinate who cannot actually act even when there is need for them to do so unless with authority from their superior. All these have been the limitation or problems facing them, people take them as the inferior ones in an organization because they can never be the boss in an organization no matter their level. In the 21st century labour market, the secretary must of a necessity go beyond what is normally regarded as her duties event into the personal affairs of her boss. For instant, going to bank to withdraw money for boss, serving tea, assisting the chairman on any point and supplying explanation when necessary, getting information from files, sweeping the office if the cleaner is not around and. All these have been the problem facing the office managers.</p> <p><strong><em>Objectives of the Study</em></strong><br/>The main objectives of this study is aimed at finding out the contributions of office manager towards the achievement of organizational goals<br/>Moreover, it also extend at<br/>1. Investigating whether office managers are needed than their counterpart and whether the remuneration is commensurable with their duties.<br/>2. To know the level of contribution of office managers in organization.<br/>3. To know how their contribution have affected the productivity of the organization.</p> <p><strong><em>Research Question</em></strong><br/>This research question is aimed at knowing the relevant question that needed to be ask concerning this topic<br/>1) Are office manager needed by organization more than other cadres of officers? <br/>2) What are the contributions of office managers in business organization?<br/>3) What are the effects of the contributions of office manager to organizational productivity?<br/>Significance of the Study<br/>The finding of this study will be of great help to many people. Student in the secretarial professions will be exposing to the actual place of the secretary in the 21st century labour market and her perceived roles.<br/>The finding of this study will also correct the misconception on the part of the public who regard office manager as a main typist or stenographer. It will also give the undergraduate office managers an insight into what their prospects will be on the completion of their course. It will expose the worth of office managers in the business world.<br/>Moreover, the research work will help bosses to determine the quality and output of those they have as employer. It will also enable them to know the important of motivation and commensurate benefits of office managers.<br/>Finally, the finding will ensure uniformity in grading workers according to the qualification and merits if implemented</p> <p><strong><em>Scope of the Study</em></strong><br/>The study is on the contributions of office managers in some selected business organization. It is restricted to the office managers only for the purpose of thorough study, using EEDC as case study which is now privately owed. It is hoped that whatever results obtained would be assumed to be applicable generally.</p> <p><strong><em>Limitation of Study</em></strong><br/>Despite the limitation scope of this study, certain constraints are encountered during the research of this project.<br/>Some of the constraint experiences are:<br/>1) Time: The was a major constraint on the researcher during the period of the work considering the limited time given for this study, there was no much time to give this research the needed attention.<br/>2) Finance: Owing to the financial difficulty prevalent in the country and its resultant rise in price of commodities, transportation fares, research material etc it is not easy meeting all the financial obligation.<br/>3) Information Constraint: Nigeria researcher has never had it easy when it comes to obtaining necessary information relevant to their area of study from private businesses. EEDC find it difficult to reveal their internal operations. The primary information was gathered through face to face interview. Getting the published material on this topic means going from one library to other which was not easy.<br/>Although, these problem placed limitations on the study, but it did not prevent me from carrying out a detail and comprehensive research work on the subject matter.</p> </div> </div>\n\nCONTRIBUTION OF OFFICE MANAGERS TOWARDS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ORGANIZATIONAL GOAL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONTRIBUTION OF OFFICE MANAGERS TOWARDS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ORGANIZATIONAL GOAL", "id": 29}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>EFFECT OFFICE ENVIRONMENT ON THE MORAL AND PRODUCTIVITY OF SECRETARIES IN BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS </p> <p>(A Case Study Of Pz Company Plc And Nigeria Bottling Company Plc 9th Mile Corner Ngwo Enugu)</p> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>A lot of employees think that their secretaries are not producing as much as they should. That they are not working up to maximum capacity where as there is room for improvement in their job performance. In order for any organization to achieve its basic objectives, it must lay strong emphasis on the way it observes the environmental factors that affect their organizations as a whole and that of the secretary in particular. <br/>Efficient performance is contingent upon the proper match between he secretary and the job on the other hand and the environmental factors or physical conditions affecting her performance on the other hand. In this research work, attempt were made to identify and analyze the good physical factors influencing secretary’s job performance. The project is divided into five chapters. Chapter one covered the general introduction, statement of problem, working hypothesis, purpose of the study scope of the study, and determination. Chapter two death with the review of related literature. To defined what is meant by good physical conditions in an office and the scope of the good physical condition that were effect expected to be seen in an office environment and the effect on the secretary’s productivity.<br/>Chapter three deals with research methodology used in obtaining the relevant data to the study. It also highlighted the sample size and the research design, the administration and development of research instrument. It highlighted the type of statistical analysis method used in analyzing the data collected as well as the validation instruments. <br/>Chapter four deals with the findings, interpretation, analysis of data collected as ell as the testing of hypothesis. He data were analyzed using the percentage method only. The study was concluded with chapter five which included summary to findings, conclusion and recommendations, limitations. </div> <div>TABLE OF CONTENT</div> <div>Title Page <br/>Approval Page <br/>Dedication <br/>Acknowledgment <br/>Abstract <br/>Table Of Contents  <p><em><strong>Chapter One <br/>1.0 Introduction </strong></em><br/>1.1 Background Of The Study <br/>1.2 Objective Of The Study <br/>1.3 Statement Of The Study <br/>1.4 Scope Of The Study <br/>1.5 Delimitation Of The Study <br/>1.6 Significance Of The Study <br/>1.7 Research Questions <br/>1.8 Definition</p> <p><em><strong>Chapter Two <br/>2.0 Review Of Related Literature </strong></em><br/>2.1 Light <br/>2.2 Heating <br/>2.3 Ventilation <br/>2.4 Noise Proof / Control <br/>2.5 Music Conditioning <br/>2.6 Safety Measures <br/>2.7 Office Space</p> <p><em><strong>Chapter Three <br/>3.1 Research Methodology </strong></em><br/>3.2 Area Of Study <br/>3.3 Population <br/>3.4 Sources Of Data <br/>3.5 Method Of Investigation <br/>3.6 Method Analysis</p> <p><em><strong>Chapter Four <br/>4.0 Presentation Of Data</strong></em></p> <strong><em>Chapter Five <br/>5.1 Findings </em></strong><br/>5.2 Conclusions <br/>5.3 Recommendation <br/>5.4 Limitation <br/>Bibliography <br/>Appendix <br/>Questionnaire </div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>In this par of the world a careful observer would agree that it is not uncommon new that that which we refer to as good physical conditions in our working environment has always been mistaken which ought to be in our working place. <br/>To this effect one need not to wonder why entrepreneur and institutions, management has always failed in their duties to proving these basic needs to their workers. <br/>The functions of personnel management, extend to recruitment and training of workers, which the secretary is a part of. It is obvious to everybody, that the work of a secretary is very delicate and confidential, and as such, a healthy environment is necessary enable the secretary operates effectively. <br/>A secretary whose office is equipped with communication gadgets as telephones, fax etc cooling gadgets, as fans, air conditions, fridge etc including execrative upholstery chairs and table is therefore regarded as an extra senior service worker by her unfortunate colleagues who unknowingly or out of ignorance does not know that hey deserve more than mentioned above for maximum productivity but rather retard progress thereby constitution a cry in the wheel of progress of such as establishment. <br/>An understanding of effect of office environment in enhancing the secretary’s morals is necessary in every organization, he/she is an indispensable staff and as such, management should place high priority on work motivation. This influences the amount of work, interest and happens of secretaries. <br/>The provision of adequate and proper physical conditions in the office cannot be over emphasized. Secretaries tend to be happier when hey work in a quiet, cool and inspiring environment, but hey are unhappy and suffers from mental strain when the physical conditions are poor or inadequate. <br/>Physical conditions refer to those things in the office that enable workers to work for periods without fatigue and distraction, so that work can be carried out effectively and efficiently. <br/>It should be bone in mind that most office work is as the accounts clerks job of putting figures together or the secretary’s job and others. <br/>However, the increasing sophistication of modern office machines and self awareness towards the maintenance of a more co-operate image have resulted in management looking more critically at the environment of secretaries work place “in encyclopedia”.<br/>The term secretary is derived from a Latin word “secrtarum” which means a confidential office. He is one ot whom secrets are entrusted and he has to maintain secrecy of the work he deals with.<br/>According to Act, 1980. sec 2 (45) states that a secretary means “one whose office is to write for another; especially one who is employed to conduct correspondence, to keep records and to transactrarions other business for another person or for a society, corporation or public body.” <br/>“Environment” in the management context consists of office building the furniture and layout, the physical conditions under which secretaries operate, lighting, ventilation, decoration, sound, proof, safety measure and so on. The influence of work environment on secretaries has become so recognized that management now calls it science of “ergonomics”. <br/>Experience has shown that secretaries cannot be happy if the ventilation is poor. Work is likely to suffer and in accuracy would result if the lighting is poor. The noise from machine and visitors constitute a barrier to a secretary’s efficiency. Example of an ideal office should be measured with that of the secretary to director Nigeria Bottling Company Plc Enugu. All these have strong bearing on the secretary morale and work productivity.<br/>The promulgation of the office, shops and railways premises Act of 1963, is a milestone in the advancement of good working condition. Management therefore has duty of providing a comfortable environment which is pleasure and conducive.</p> <p><strong>1.2 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>This study is meant to investigate the following.<br/>The effect of the depressing and unstimulating nature of the office on the morals and productivity of the secretary.<br/>The effect of he physical factors such as office surroundings on the secretary’s morals to work.<br/>The importance of providing a good proper working environment for the secretary.<br/>The problems caused by lack of these good physical condition on the secretary productivity.<br/>Finally, to see to what extent the office environment affect the concentration of the secretary.</p> <p><strong>1.3 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong><br/>The secretary no doubt occupies a very important position in an organization and her inability to discharge her duties very well have an adverse effect on the image of the organization.<br/>Also a secretary’s moral boosted by the type of environment she works in. therefore, for a secretary to be able to perform her duties efficiently and effectively, she should be provided with a pleasant and conducive environment to work in.<br/>Presently, there are many problems encountered by secretaries with regards to their environment, and other facts like poor physical conditions in an office, lack of private office. <br/>Secretaries in business organization share offices with other staff. Sometimes, where one is lucky to be assigned any, there is always no privacy. <br/>In some organization, a secretary may be lucky to have a private office, but that office will be an entrance to his / her boss’s office. <br/>The study is to investigate the effect of poor conditions and lack of offices, how it affects the productivity of the secretary and find ways of enhancing her productivity.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>A lot of organizations are now aware that secretaries need to be settled comfortably in order to ensure high productivity in the organization.<br/>Much has been said and written about he best way to ensure secretary’s high job performance and many people have argued that those secretaries have to be adequately motivated in order to ensure effective job performance on their part. <br/>They outlined such motivational incentives as increase in salaries and wages, priorison of certain social amenities such as free medical facilities, ensuring effective job performance among the secretaries and workers in general. All those motivational incentives no debt facilitates high job performance among secretaries, but it depends on the environmental factors affecting the organization.<br/>The study therefore, be of immense value to the management of Nigeria Bottling Company and PZ Company Services as well as other organizations and also to the secretaries at large, especially those who do not recognize that he environment under which the organization operate will in any way affect their performance.</p> <p><strong>1.5 DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>This study requires extensive coverage, but due to short period allowed for the study, the researcher limited the scope of the PZ Plc and NBC Enugu. It is necessary to state that although the focal point of this study is mainly based on the aspect of effect of office environment on the secretary’s morale and work productivity, the work does not limit itself to that. This work was also use as a medium to identity some other problems and dissatisfaction the secretaries encounter in the office environment.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Some organization do not realize that the environment under which their business operation has anything to do with the secretary’ job performance. Their belief is that only the motivational incentives administered adequately will confluence the secretary’s job performance. <br/>This study will benefit management readers or the staff counterparts responsible for improving secretarial service operations by helping them using the items. <br/>A management can usually benefit by holding all aspects service system operations up to standard. <br/>It will also benefit future secretaries of Nigeria Bottling Company (NBC). It hoped that the management will improve the office conditions of the secretaries, so that the secretary will have cause to smile broadly and improve in their productivity. <br/>For other employers of labour, this should help them to know better how their work will fit into a production environment, and the environmental considerations that should be studied when planning for personnel includes the physical element of lighting and the whole subject of design.<br/>The result help to establish a realistic / service having a guide to management responsibilities as a background for analysis. <br/>This study will benefit both the management and secretaries to improve their productivity<br/><br/><strong>1.7 RESEARCH QUESTION</strong><br/>1) Does the depressing and unstimulating nature of the office have negative effect on the morale and productivity of the secretaries? <br/>2) Does the small floor space and the congested nature of the office affect the secretary’s morale and attitude to work.<br/>3) What effect do air conditions and floor covering in most offices of the secretaries moral and work productivity? <br/>4) What effect do lighting and ventilation have on the morals and productivity of the secretaries.<br/>5) How does the relationship between the boss, others and the secretary affects the secretary’s environment.</p> <p><strong>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS </strong><br/>SECRETARY: A secretary is the image make of any organization for without a secretary, an organization is incomplete. <br/>According to Barrister N. A. Obodo 1998 He defined secretary as an executive assistance who secretary as an executive assistance who possesses the mastery of skills, who demonstrate ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision, who exercise initiative and judgment, who make decision within the scope of assigned authority. <br/>In enclopedea, the term secretary is derived from a Latin word “secreterum” which means a confidential officer. He is one to whom secrets are entrusted and he has to maintain secrecy of the work he deals with. <br/>OFFICE: In every well organized business there is the need for the record of its activities to be kept and protected. It is the office that such activities are carried out and its records kept. <br/>The term “office” was defined firstly by Geoffery Whitehead, as a room or building where clerical processes are carried out to start, develop and control the many activities of business. Ronald Warson et al, defined the office as “the place where information is received sorted, acted upon, file and passed on”.<br/>OFFICE ENVIRONMENT: Environment consists of the office building, its furniture and layout as well as the physical conditions under which workers do the jobs, it is also concerned with the external factors as the business which the office services, the industry or other activities within which business lies, the custom and laws of the community within which business operates. These environment factors are always changing and the office must react to change with them.<br/>When we are talking about office environment, we talk bout physical things in an environment. What you can see, something that enable you to work fine. Cleanliness of a place, or duty environment. </p> </div> </div>\n\nEFFECT OFFICE ENVIRONMENT ON THE MORAL AND PRODUCTIVITY OF SECRETARIES IN BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OFFICE ENVIRONMENT ON THE MORAL AND PRODUCTIVITY OF SECRETARIES IN BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>SECRETARY AND THE EFFECTS OF NEW OFFICE TECHNOLOGIES ON RECORD KEEPING MANAGEMENT </p> <p>(A Case Study Of Some Selected Establishments In Enugu State)</p> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>A lot has been written by many authors about new office technologies and how they have immensely affected secretarial performance.<br/>This study was therefore conducted to find out the secretary and the effect of new office technologies on record keeping management in some selected establishments in Enugu.<br/>As a result of this, research question were formulated as follows:<br/>(a) Do the working environments of practicing secretaries have each of the new office equipment?<br/>(b) Are the available new office equipment being put into effective use?<br/>(c) What factors influence the availability or lack of these new office equipment?<br/>(d) How are the job performance of secretaries affected by these new office machines?<br/>The total population for the study was 70 while the sample for the study consisted 60 practising secretaries randomly selected from four establishments in Enugu, 60 secretaries returned their completed questionnaires which was used as an instrument for data collection.

Man is an embodiment of charge, his life circle is marked with different stags of metamorphosis which when it finally actualizes, adulthood is made. Secretarial profession, an inseparable bed fellow of management no exception.<br/>The secretary has been defined as one entrusted with secrets or confidences of a superior, or employed to handle correspondence and manage routine and detailed work for a superior. Also Orisananya (1981) put it that, a secretary is a skilled and specializes type of employee in an establishment or part of it who is charged with some aspects of organizational functions in the unit including dealing with people’s correspondence and other business matters. With the above definitions, it can be deduced that the secretary is an important officer in any establishment and that the contributions and effectiveness of a secretary enhances the efficiency of an organization. This is the more reasons the secretary needs a proper training to be able to carry out her functions. The training of an efficient and effective secretary should cover not only skills in shorthand and typewriting but also in other managerial skills. These skills should be backed up by appropriate demeanour and etiquette at all times. Evans (1980) noted that the secretary’s role will be supporting, but with the added requirements of technological knowledge will encompass data administration and information management, allowing the secretary to analyse complex situations and submit practical recommendations.<br/>With the introduction of these new machines, people are trained to acquire new skills for operating them. It is therefore, noted that proper record keeping makes it easier for information to be retrieved for use with a lot of ease. This, of course, had tended to reduce the work load of a secretary.<br/>Even though a lot of charges have begun in technology, the question now is have some establishments in Enugu State acquired these new office technologies for record keeping? The advantages such establishments may derive from the use of these new office technologies need not to be over-emphasised. Therefore, their presence and effective utilization is essential.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM:</em></strong><br/>The technological changes that are taking place in different disciplines are also being witnessed in some offices today. New technologies or machines have been developed to make secretaries more efficient or improve working conditions. But certain questions need to be raised, have these new office machines been acquire for office duties in Enugu? What are the factors that influence the availability or non-availability of these new office machines in every working environment or office? In what ways have these new office machines, where available, affected the productivity and efficiency of such organization?<br/>However, the answers to these questions are readily available, and seeking answers to them constituted the major problem of this study.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</em></strong><br/>The purpose of this study is to;<br/>(a) Find out the availability of new office machines in the working environment of some selected establishments in Enugu State.<br/>(b) Identify the factors that are responsible for availability or lack of these new office machines.<br/>(c) Examine the effects of these new office machines on record keeping.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:</em></strong><br/>The study will be of great benefits to establishments. It will help them to know the advantages and disadvantages if any, they are likely to experience with the installation of these machines. It will also be beneficial to the practicing secretaries to know how far these office machines have contributed to their efficiency and also whether or not to encourage the use of these new machines in various offices. <br/>Finally, the study will serve as a reference point to intending researchers and could form basis for future researches.</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</em></strong><br/>In other to elicit information on these problems and to achieve the objectives of this study, the following research questions were formulated:<br/>(a) Does every establishment possess these new office equipment?<br/>(b) Are the available new office equipment being put into effective use?<br/>(c) What factors influence the availability or non-availability of these new office equipment?<br/>(d) How is job performance affected by these new office machines?</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY:</em></strong><br/>The researcher has narrowed the scope of this study to some selected establishments in Enugu State. They are as follows:<br/>(i) Central Bank of Nigeria, Enugu<br/>(ii) Governor’s office, Enugu<br/>(iii) Institute of Management and Technology, Enugu.</p> <p><strong><em>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS:</em></strong><br/>For the proper understanding of this study, the following definitions of terms had been made:<br/>1.

RECORDS:<br/>Writing information down for reference purposes or in other ways like on a disc, magnetic tape, etc.<br/>3. TECHNOLOGY:<br/>Technology in this case means the modern way or technique for making and doing things. It is those activities directed to satisfy human needs which produce alternative as in the material world.<br/>4. ETIQUETTE:<br/>A polite social behaviour among people in a class of society or a profession.<br/>5. METAMORPHOSIS:<br/>changes in form or character that occur in a person.<br/>6.

The purpose of his work was to find out the effects of stress on the secretary’s job performance, what factors caused this stress and how their effects were manifested and could be controlled.<br/>To do this, literature review relating to the effects of stress on the workers especially the sedentary worker, was conducted. A questionnaire was drawn up with which data were collected. This was supplemented by face-to-face interviews with secretaries and observations. The respondents were from Anammco Company and Emenite Aluminium Company, Enugu. In all, 100 questionnaires wee distributed and 88 were returned while 12 were not returned.<br/>The researcher from data analysis found out that secretaries under-face a lot of stressing situations in the course of doing their job but that some were more devastating in the effects than others. The three most significant stressors identified were:<br/>1. Lack of adequate and sufficient working materials and equipment.<br/>2. Strenous human relation in the workplace and<br/>3. lack of necessary qualification, both physically and mentally on the part of the secretary to handle the job efficiently.<br/>Recommendation were however made that adequate training of the secretary physically and mentally should be provided.

These conflicting decisions and instructions crop up all the time and they demand prompt attention and decisions, but the role of it is that the time to perform these function does not increase rather, it seems to diminish and with this apparent shortage of time comes “stress”.<br/>The roles and functions of the secretary are basic to the organizational roles and so cannot be confined within the purview of a job description. They range from covering of meetings, taking care of office duties, keeping schedules in both hers and her boss’s desk diaries for complete and effective job performance up-to-date and supervising subordinates as well as keeping order generally in the office. All these to be done without a pause to enable the smooth flow of work. Thus, she is also important to the organization because of her ability to remain calm under extraordinary condition of work pressures and human demands.<br/>The secretary’s obligations to the boss can sometimes be strenuous and conflicting with her other obligations to herself and to the company. This view of secretary’s function is an archaic one in view of the changes that have taken place in her training and job, but some employers still cling to it and cause her stress on the job when she finds difficulty in obeying these instructions.</p> <p><strong>1.1 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM:</strong><br/>The medium organization operates in the dynamic and ever changing environment. Because the modern organization exists in rapidly changing environment, the secretary is faced with a lot of physical and mental hazards on the job which may cause her stress – noise, lack of preparations for certain jobs or duties, attitude of the public to the job she does and the societal and organizational structures and their effects on her job are some of these factors that may affect her performance on the job. As well, the sitting arrangements, dangerous chemicals and substances used in the course of her work and lack of proper qualifications for the job may cause her stress.<br/>Added to these stressors is the fact that technology may eventually make her learned skills unwanted in the work place. Though not manifest in quantifiable terms, these threats cause stress that may eventually spell doom to the secretary mentally as well as physically.<br/>Fache (1981) said “for every successful businessman, executive or organization, there is always an efficient and hardworking secretary”. In view of the adverse effects of stress on the performance of the secretary on her job, which may in turn cause her boss or even her organizational performance not to be up to what it would have been or not to realize its goals, it becomes of urgent need to take a very keen look at the job the secretary does and find out what does cause her stress. If this is done, then plans on how to eliminate in control than can be successfully made and executed.</p> <p><strong>1.2 PURPOSE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:</strong><br/>The purpose of this research is to find out the environmental factors associated with the secretary’s job stress, and their effects on her job performance. The study, in looking at this problem, attempts to find out:<br/>1. What specific factors in the job situations cause the secretary stress.<br/>2. Who is to blame for her stress – the boss, management or secretary herself.<br/>3. What could be done to reduce or eliminate stress from the job environment.<br/>Further significance of the study, the researcher based on the importance of the study, which will be of great importance to the society at large and primarily be useful to the following:<br/>1. The management (secretary’s boss).<br/>Ignorance of how well to treat a secretary in order to get her best performance may be one of the reasons why the secretary is subjected to stressful conditions at the place of work. It is hoped that after reading this work the boss will be better informed as how to handle a secretary to get maximum performance from her.<br/>2. The professional secretary:<br/>It is hoped that as a result of careful perusal of this work, the secretary will be in a better position to recognize stressors, avoid them whenever possible and control their effects on her performance. This should lead to a better job performance on her part.</p> <p>3. Trainers:<br/>Sometimes, people who train the secretary for the job are hopelessly out of contact with what is required of her at the place of work so that training programmes are not up to what they should be. It is hoped that this will help trainers identify vital training areas on which to lay emphasis and from time to time improve on facilities to meet with modern office procedures.<br/>4. Academicians:<br/>This work may later prove useful to academicians who may find all or it as useful points for further research work on the secretary’s job.</p> <p><strong>1.3 SCOPE OF THE STUDY:</strong><br/>This research was on the study of the effects of stress on the secretary’s job performance. The researcher covered some selected organization in Enugu metropolis only. The findings, after analysis would be used as generalization upon the organizations under review.<br/>The organizations are as follows:<br/>• Anammco Manufacturing Company (ANAMMCO) Enugu.<br/>• Emenite Aluminium Company, Enugu.</p> <p><strong>1.4 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY:</strong><br/>No research work – no matter hours devoted and hardworking the researcher is, can claim to be hundred percent accurate. Every researcher encounters one problem or the other which limits the findings of the study being carried out. In the course of this project work, the researcher encountered the following obstacles:<br/>(a) Financial constraints<br/>(b) Time and distance factors<br/>(c) Attitude of respondents.</p> <p>(a) FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS:<br/>Normally, studies of this nature involves huge financial back-up, but due to limited funds at the disposal of the researchers, which is due mainly to the prevailing economic situation in the country, the study could not cover as many owns as would have been expected.<br/>(b) TIME AND DISTANCE FACTORS:<br/>The time limit given for this study though enough but the fact that the researchers had similar studies to carry out in other courses, took some of their time.<br/>Also, due to enormous size of Enugu State, the researchers was unable to cover all the organization in the State. It is was due to time and distance constraint.</p> <p>(c) ATTITUDE OF RESPONDENTS:<br/>Notwithstanding the fact that most of the people involved are educated, most of the time, the researcher have to convince them on the importance of the study before they could co-operate.

The aim of this study is to determine the extent the Information Technology (IT) has helped the secretary in the dissemination/execution of his or her daily routine works.<br/>Prior to the technological development in offices, clerical works were done manually. But today the invention of some equipment such as word processor, computer, electronic typewriter, facsimile transceiver, accounting machines and telephone etc.<br/>The purpose of this study is to investigate into the secretarial profession in order to find out the effects, which the use of these modern office equipment have on the job performance of the secretary. And in order to determine these, I designed questionnaires, which were distributed to secretaries and their boss. After analyzing their responses, I found out among others that modern office machine enhances the efficiency of the secretary.<br/>I also found out that secretaries were satisfied with their job because they are now using modern office equipment. Based on my findings, I recommended that business organizations that are still making use of obsolete gadgets should replace them with the modern office machines in order to enhance the job performance of their secretaries. I also recommended that institution of higher learning should procure this modern equipment to be used in the training prospective secretaries.<br/>The scope of this research work is limited to some business organizations in Port-Harcourt metropolis, Rivers State.</div> <div>TABLE OF CONTENT</div> <div>Title Page <br/>Approval Page <br/>Dedication <br/>Acknowledgement <br/>Abstract <br/>Table Of Content <br/><br/><strong><em>Chapter One<br/>1.0 Introduction </em></strong><br/>1.1 Background Of The Study <br/>1.2 Statement Of The Problem <br/>1.3 Purpose Of The Study <br/>1.4 Significance Of The Study <br/>1.5 Limitation Of The Study <br/>1.6 Research Questions <br/>1.7 Definition Of Terms  <p><em><strong>Chapter Two<br/>2.0 Review Of Related Literature </strong></em><br/>2.1 The Impact Of Information Technology Devices On The Job Performance, Efficiency And Satisfaction Of Secretaries. <br/>2.2 Review Of Some Information Tech.

Originally, it means one entrusted with the secrets and confidences of a superior. Personal Secretary, being a skilled and specialized type of employee in an establishment is entrusted with some aspects of organizational functions in the unit including dealing with people, correspondence and other business matters, especially private or confidential matters.<br/>Secretarial profession had started as far back as 1920. Prior to the advent of Technological facilities improvement, such as computer, word processor, and <br/>Electric typewriter etc. Secretaries used reed pen in taking shorthand dictations, processing minutes and letters, that rather makes their job boring and less interesting.<br/>During the industrial revolution at the turn of the century, businesses offices faced a paper-work crisis. And Secretary solved the crisis by adapting well to new technologies such as adding and calculating machines, telephone and electric typewriter. Today, secretaries who are also known as administrative assistants, office co-coordinators, executive assistants etc, are using computers, Internet and other advance office technologies to perform vital “Information management” functions in the modern office.<br/>Secretaries no longer simply type correspondence for the boss. But now, they often write that correspondence as well as plan meeting, organize data using spreadsheet and database management.<br/>In 1960’s the Information Technology came into existence, and it is a set of standards covering all processes involved in the development of an integrated computer database management.<br/>Information system, that are used today by the secretaries in the normal execution of their routine works.<br/>The evolution of Information Technology (IT) was traced back to the age of Abacus Computer by the Egyptians around, 3,000 BC. It was used for the systematic calculation of the arithmetic and numeric operations. At the sometime “the Boroughs Machine” has been developed to hold business information.<br/>Later, Charles Babge developed a machine known as “Analog Computer”, this device have provision for input data, storing information, performing arithmetic operations and printing out results.<br/>In 1970’s, the fist small computers known as “minis” and “Midis” were available which used floppy disks, Unix for storage of information and display of information that has been stored in the system. These mini Computers include IBM PC, Electric typewriter, Word processor and Apple computers. This information technology development had improved communication, unlike before whereby information were delivered through post office, which consumed a lot of time. But today with aid of information technology you can reach somebody anywhere in a matter of a minute without much stress.<br/>In those days, there was nothing like inter-com telephones that can linked various units or departments in an organization in order to save personal secretaries time and energy spent in running errands within the organization. As against the traditional office, the modern office has a lot of activities to perform with help of modern office machines.<br/>Moreover, these information technology gadgets act as an important tool in secretary’s job and minimize likely fraud, which could arise from numerous mathematical calculations done in the office. And the result to a greater output than that of a secretary using manual equipment.<br/>This development in Information technology has improved he effectiveness of secretaries in attaining their objectives in various organizations.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>The problem of this study is to determine the extent the modern office equipment has helped the secretary in the performance of her duties.<br/>In solving this problem, the researcher would investigate the following areas:<br/>a. The job satisfaction the secretary derives from the use of this modern office equipment in performing her duties.<br/>b. The quality and accuracy of work done using the equipment.<br/>c. The amount of time needed to perform a task using the equipment.<br/>d. Reduction of cost brought about by the installation of these modern office machines.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>1. The purpose of information technology (IT) is to improve and control communication flow within an organization and outside the organization.<br/>2. To find whether these machines actually improve their productivity.<br/>3. To find out whether the training received at school by secretaries is adequate to enable them perform in an automated office.<br/>4. To determine the level of experience of the secretary.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The trends in use of Modern machines and growing urge of everybody to known and experience, to enjoy the distinctive features of a technological society are rapid. This had instigated the researcher to have vested interest in this topic so as to find. Out how satisfied the secretaries that are using these modern office machines are and how efficient they use them in their work places to reduce their manual operations and physical activities in offices.<br/>The outcome of this study will be beneficial to the following:<br/>1. To secretaries, because it will create tremendous impact on their duties.<br/>2. To the suppliers of this modern office machines, as this will fetch them money, if their product’s performance creditable.<br/>3. To prospective secretaries who are yet to join the labour force to become aware of the importance of possessing a mastery of skill of Information technology equipment.<br/>4. To the readers of this work especially to students because it will be a source of added knowledge to them.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The researcher restricted her work on the impact of information Technology on the secretarial profession, to some Business Organizations in Port-Harcourt Metropolis. Such as <br/>1. Exmark Technologies Ltd<br/>2. First Bank PLC<br/>3. Standard Trust Bank PLC<br/>4. National institute of information technology center (NIIT)<br/>5. Secretariat office Port Harcourt.</p> <p><strong>1.6 RESEARCH QUESTION</strong><br/>The following questions were designed by the researcher to make her reach precise conclusion.<br/>1. Do information technology machines aid secretary in performance of her jobs?<br/>2. Does information technology influence secretarial job?<br/>3. Are the orientations and training acquired by the secretaries enough, to enable them use these information technology equipment efficiently and effectively?<br/>4. Do information technology machines replace the work of secretaries in an organization?<br/>5. Do secretaries derive job satisfaction from the use of these modern office gadgets?<br/>6. Does the use of information technology equipment enhance the secretary’s job output?<br/>7. Do companies or organizations benefit from the use of information technology equipment?</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>In respect of this study, the following terms are defined and explained in order to understand the full meanings by the reader:<br/>a. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: These are the more mechanized machines that have been using in the modern offices, e.g. word processor, computer services and other electronic machines that required at least less human efforts.<br/>b. DATA BASE: It refers to a group of related records and files. Libraries mostly keep database to help them manage their collection of books. A computer-based allows you use a database more efficiently than you would have imagined using paper records.<br/>c. INTERNET: The Internet, which is a worldwide network that are interconnected.<br/>It provides the following on-line services:</p> <p>Electronic Mail (e-mail) – Allows you to send and receive messages to and from any computer connected locally or internationally to the Internet via a service provider.</p> <p>World Wide Web (www) – This is graphical interface based on the multimedia framework that makes it possible to have text, picture, video and sound on the pages to be accessed. Surveying the Web can be a pleasurable experience when visiting the sites of companies and even individual on the net, discovering new ideas and meeting new friends.</p> <p>EVOLUTION: This process of developing into a different form. Something that works out gradually. The development of some modern offices machines have under gone many ages before the era of this technology which we are in today, i.e. from the age of Digital to Analog computer. </p> </div> </div>\n\nIMPACT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON THE SECRETARIAL PROFESSION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON THE SECRETARIAL PROFESSION", "id": 33}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>EFFECTS OF LACK OF ADEQUATE TRAINING FACILITIES ON THE PRODUCTION SECRETARIES </p> <p>(A Case Study Of Institute Of Management And Technology Imt Enugu)</p> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>This seminar was carries out to find out effect of lack of adequate secretarial training facilities on the production of secretaries and it was written in five chapters.<br/>Chapter one introduced the topic with an overview of contemporary historical facts, about the effects of lack of adequate secretarial training facilities on the production of secretaries.

It is also an experience that is becoming common or rather already common with students dispatched for their industrial training scheme. But we know that a large part of this problem can be traced back to the lack of adequate secretarial training facilities in our higher institutions. It is not a hidden truth that most of our higher institutions are not what they ought to be in the sense that they lack the variety of equipment they need to up to – date models of the equipment they need. <br/>No doubt, this lack has affected the production of secretaries that is why this project work wants to look at these shortcomings their effects and people reaction to them. Now, when we talk about producing a secretary, a is different from a typist. If we are going to produce a secretary, the facilities or equipment required will be very much different and advanced than that required to produce a typist. It is, however unfortunate today that if one goes to some of our institutions of higher learning, he will discover that the totality of the facilities left to the disposal of the or the students look more like than it looks likes that of secretaries. A secretary is an executive assistant who possess a mastery of office skills, who demonstrate the ability to assume responsibilities without direct supervision, who exercises initiative and judgement and who make decision within the scope of assigned authority –NATIONAL SECRETARIES ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL.<br/>It when we have a knowledge of who the secretary is that we can assess the type of training. The secretary needs a good knowledge of general education, good knowledge of short hand, typewriting, office practice and administration, business law, law and practice of meeting, human resources management, accounting, data processing, industrial psychology, human relations, economies and a foreign language. <br/>For shorthand, the students need good shorthand laboratories equipped with ear phones cassette players and recorder etc. for typewriting, they need good and modern typewriters ranging horn manual typewriters, electron/electronic typewriters to computers. This is to mention but a few looking at all the facilities needed for effective secretarial training without which you cannot produce a secretary. The students don’t need to hear about office equipment with their ears only but need to know how to operate them practically in view of the fact that the secretarial profession is a practical one. For more emphasis, if we re talking about filing, the students must have been able to file documents. By definition some students don’t known how these equipments look like until they meet them in the organization they find themselves out there in the labour market; and what do you think, the effects will be numerous. <br/>When students don’t know what to do, they do what they know. With the consistent standard of the various examination bodies like the National University Council (NUC), National Board for Technical Education (NBTE), the students seek means of maneuvering their ways to pass. More of the after mart includes unemployment, incompetence, termination of appointments, loss of confidence, loss of reputation for certificate etc. <br/>It is therefore the believe of the researcher that this research work will enlighten, educate as well as serve as a role model for production of first class secretaries from our universities and polytechnics.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong><br/>This research which will be carried out in the Institute of Management and Technology (IMT), Enugu in 2002/2004 will study the effects of lack of adequate secretarial training facilities an the production of secretaries.<br/>The problems are quiet enormous. The secretary produced will be half backed, in competent, inefficient and ineffective. With the increasing miniaturization in information technology which is increasingly being employed by most organization, secretary that was trained with out-dated facilities will non be able to she will be both stranded and frustrated finding herself in a completely electronic office. <br/>The co-ordinations of the various activities are and information of the organization, which forms a large part of the secretaries’ responsibility, is central to the profitability of the organization. This failing will mean the business /organization failing. Operating with the knowledge of out dated equipments have made her also outdated because she will be lagging behind in processing organizational information marking her inefficient and ineffective.<br/>The consequence of the above will be firing of the said secretary thus leaving him/her unemployed. Many to these graduates who have suffered the some fate in higher institutions will be bounced at the pre-employment interview which will make the unemployment problem more severe. <br/>The above will in turn study tells on our society will suffer some social vices without results from idleness, the idleness of the unemployed. The society reposed some confidence in the organization but when the organization cannot deliver because the secretary cannot deliver, these is loss f confidence in the organization and the business is bound to loose its customer to competing firms.<br/>The quality of education an individual acquires form part of his personality. But as long as modern information, communication and secretarial function is concerned, such ill-trained secretary has acquired half –baked knowledge. <br/>To carry out this study, secretarial staff and the Nigeria higher Institutions will be studied precisely those of IMT and data collected will be analyzed using percentages.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study is very essential because lack of adequate secretarial training facilities effect the quality of secretaries produce from our higher institutions and once it is so, the individual i.e. the secretary is already affects, secretaries are going to work and then also affect the economy and society in general. This is so because of the enormous taste the secretary performs, it is that will is central to the progress of the organization and the contributions of the various organizations in the society forms a large part if not the totality of the economy. And if people go to spend years in the universities and come out to become unemployed because they don’t know the job, obviously idleness will degenerate to various social vices. On the other the society will better if we have meaningful, responsible, educated and well trained secretaries. There will be less unemployment and reduced social vices. Furthermore, the society which deals will the organizations can actually have good confidence in the service the organization renders. <br/>The motto of the University of Nigeria is “to restore the dignity of man”. The institution believes in restoring the dignity of man through the rigorous discipline of the academia. So implementing this study will mean better citizen and better secretaries, all thing things being equal.<br/>To the organizations, its aims and objectives will met and this will mean increase turn over for such organizations. The same thing applies to the economy.</p> <p>The purpose drain of this study is as follows: -<br/>1. To find out the required adequate secretaries training facilities for students of higher institution. <br/>2. To uncover the lack of adequate secretarial training facilities by institutions of higher learning. <br/>3. To points out the importance or role of these facilities in production of secretaries. <br/>4. To find out the effect the lack of these facilities have on our students today.<br/>5. To make recommendations on the production of secretaries through the provision of adequate secretarial training facilities and to draw conclusion.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study will be limited to the department of secretarial studies in the Institute of Management and Technology, (IMT), Enugu. And the results will be used to relate to other secretarial training institutes not only nationally but also globally. Since the facilities need to produce a secretary here is the same facility needed to produce a secretary anywhere in the world and lack of such facilities will produce similar effect any where in the world.</p> <p><strong>1.5 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study may be limited due to time factor considering the workload one needs to contend with at this level in one’s academic carried. Other factors like availability of money and accessibility to every other secretarial training institute may also limit the study.</p> <p><strong>1.6 DEFINITION OF TERMS </strong><br/>The following terms used in this study should be taken to mean: <br/>Adequate: Satisfactory in quantity or quality <br/>Secretarial training: The process of teaching or preparing someone to become a secretary. <br/>Facilities: Prices of equipments and systems used to prepare people as secretaries.<br/>Production: the action of manufacturing or growing of things or people for a particular purpose <br/>Effects: Results or outcome <br/>Incompetent: Not having or slowing the necessary skills or qualification to do something successfully. <br/>Inefficient: The failure of an individual or organization to make the best use of the available time and researches<br/>Invective: Not producing the required effect or result;<br/>Productive: The measure of the ability of an individual of organization to make good use of available resources in relation to the amount produced.<br/>Skill: The ability, experience and knowledge to be able to do something well. <br/>Fatigue: A feeling of being extremely tired, usually because of hard work. <br/>Telephone Technique: A system of talking to someone else perhaps over a long distance using wires and radios.<br/>A Partner card: Is a data processing card on which on single microfilm frame can be mounted. <br/>Microfiche (pronounced microfiche): Is a transparent sheet of film containing multiple rows of micro images.<br/>Microform: The format is which microfilm is stored.<br/>Microfilm: A photographic film used to record documents, prohibited pages, drawing etc in a reduced size.<br/>Switchboard: The central part of a telephone system used by an organization. It also a place where telephone calls are answered and connected to the appropriate person or departments.<br/>Film/film strip: A thin plastic that is sensitive to light used in photographs or storage of information<br/>Over-head projector: A piece of equipment that projects an image onto wall or screen so that many people can see.<br/>Automation: This is a term used to describe to human labour and a maximum of continuous self-regulating machinery.(Agbo 2003).</p> <p><strong>1.7 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong><br/>HI Lack of adequate secretarial training facilities has adverse effect on secretaries’ productivity.<br/>H0 Many of our higher institutions do not have adequate secretarial training facilities.<br/>HI Many secretarial graduates are half-baked <br/>HI The effect of this lack is transferred to business organization, society and economy.</p> <p><strong>1.8 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>1. Does lack of adequate secretarial training facilities have an adverse effect on the quality of secretaries’ produce?<br/>2. Do you think that most of our higher institution lack adequate secretarial training facilities?<br/>3. Do you think that many students who graduate are half –baked?<br/>4. Does the lack of adequate secretarial training facilities in any way affect business organizations, the society or the economy?</p> <p><strong>1.9 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study is very significant in view of the role of the secretary in modern business coupled with the stage of our institutions of higher learning as regards training facilities most especially the secretarial studies department <br/>This project will therefore reveal the state of poor state of the Nigeria secretarial training institutions as well as the facilities housed in the departments. We will also discover some of the effects we many not have thought will ge the consequence of the lack of adequate secretarial training facilities. <br/>Furthermore this project will help the government and the school authorities to be aware of the significance. Above and also almost all the equipment if not all that makes for “adequate secretarial training facilities so to be able to restock the departments of secretarial studies in all institution of higher learning. </p> </div> </div>\n\nEFFECTS OF LACK OF ADEQUATE TRAINING FACILITIES ON THE PRODUCTION SECRETARIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF LACK OF ADEQUATE TRAINING FACILITIES ON THE PRODUCTION SECRETARIES", "id": 34}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>EFFECTS OF OFFICE AUTOMATION ON THE PRODUCTIVITY OF SECRETARIES </p> <p>(A Case Study Of Anammco Plc Emene Enugu)</p> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>This research work concentrated on “the effect of office automation on the productivity of secretaries in Anammco Plc Emene Enugu.<br/>In chapter one the work started with the introduction of the study dealt with the background of the study statement of problems purpose of the study significance of the study delimitation of the study and research questions.<br/>Chapter two dealt with the literature review which was treated under the office function of the office the office machines merits of office automation sources of acquiring office machines designing training programme for office machines operators and maintenance of office machines.<br/>In chapter three it treated research design and methodology area of study population of the study sample study instrument method of data collection and method of data analysis.<br/>Chapter four treated presentation and analysis of data based on research of data based on research questions <br/>Finally chapter five treated the discussion on the finding conclusion recommendation suggestion for further research and limitation of the study.</div> <div>TABLE OF CONTENT</div> <div>Title Page<br/>Approval<br/>Dedication<br/>Acknowledgement <br/>Abstract <br/>Table Of Content <br/>List Of Table  <p><em><strong>Chapter One<br/>1.0 Background Of The Study</strong></em><br/>1.1 Statement Of Problem <br/>1.2 Purpose Of The Study<br/>1.3 Significance Of The Study<br/>1.4 Delimitation Of The Study<br/>1.5 Research Questions</p> <p><em><strong>Chapter Two <br/>2.0 Review Of Related Literature </strong></em><br/>2.1 The Office <br/>2.2 Functions Of The Office<br/>2.3 Office Machines <br/>2.4 The Merits Of Office Automation<br/>2.5 Sources Of Acquiring Office Machines <br/>2.6 Designing Training Programme For Office Machines Operators <br/>2.7 Maintenance Of Office Machines</p> <p><em><strong>Chapter Three <br/>3.0 Research Design And Methodology </strong></em><br/>3.1 Research Design<br/>3.2 Area Of Study <br/>3.3 Population Of The Study<br/>3.4 Sample Study<br/>3.5 Instrument For The Study<br/>3.6 Validity Of The Instrument<br/>3.7 Reliability Of The Instrument <br/>3.8 Method Of Data Collection <br/>3.9 Method Of Data Analysis</p> <p><em><strong>Chapter Four<br/>4.0 Presentation And Analysis Of Data</strong></em><br/>4.1 Summary Of Finding</p> <em><strong>Chapter Five<br/>5.0 Discussion Conclusion And Recommendation </strong></em><br/>5.1 Discussion On The Finding <br/>5.2 Conclusion <br/>5.3 Recommendation <br/>5.4 Suggestion For Further <br/>5.5 Research<br/>5.6 Limitation Of Study<br/>References</div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Whitehead (1986) defined office as “a room or building where clerical work are carried out to start develop and control many activities of business” such services include decrial secretarial accounting and resaerch duties.<br/>Denyer (1974) also defined office as “any room where clerical work is habitually performed. He further stressed that the provision of the facts on which the decision of management are made is one of the most important function of the office and this has very real nd essential contribution to production. He is of the opinion that the office can only make this vital contribution if there is efficient office automation and proper use of the office services by the general management.<br/>However in my own opinion I attributed that an office can be defined as “any place under a building where management decision and over all control of people’s activities are clerically taken down by some of the employed of an establishment who may be specifically employed for the purpose”<br/>Automation according to Terry (1966) is the arrangement where one or more machines are operated without human starter button the oxford advance learners dictionary of current Engligh by Harnby (1977) defined automation as the use of methods and machines to save human labour.<br/>According to Croft (1971) office automation is therefore the introduction of devices in the office to save human labour. Before the advent of these devices such as computer word processor adding machines typewriter mailing equipment etc. man has been finding office work monotonous tedious which leads to inaccuracy inefficiency and consequently low productivity.<br/>There is no doubt that primitive man used his fingers for counting ten the number of finger of both hands became the basis for familiar counting system. This served man till the stone age when pebbles were used for counting.<br/>The advent of writing marked the beginning of the activities associated with office automation need. As the need for speed accuracy and standardization increased the symbol and tools for recording changed but the basis activities remain the same devices were conceived of and used as the years passed.<br/>The most significant of which are the arithmetic machines telephone typewriter calculating machines mail equipment etc.<br/>The greatest is the advent of computer which came in the years between 1812 and 1833 with the idea and efforts of Charles Babbage. As the method of performing the activities advanced more and more data were accumulated and processed certainly in an effort provide management with more timely accurate and comprehensible data for production and planning operation.<br/>Owing to the difficulties encountered by secretarial workers in automated offices Terry (1996) stressed the necessity for manufacturing industries to develop office automation management in their various environment to enable them keep track with the technological development introduced within the office environment.<br/>He further stressed that industries that do not evolve and well articulated office management sooner or later discover that inefficiency becomes the order of the day and the organizations objectives. Therefore office automation means the performance of office function with machines. It is also the same as office machines or office technology.<br/>Croft (1971) in his conclusion expressed that automation is meant to upset old pattern of life. Office equipment such as computer used in increasing productivity is now available and man is finding new benefits albeit with growing pains in changing social order.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS </strong><br/>There is need for office automation in order to make secretaries dynamic so that as organizations change in technology for improved productivity secretaries can grapple with the demand of such changes.<br/>Many people fear that office automation has come to replace the traditional secretary or to push her our of job. Many manufacturing industries face the problem of low productivity and inefficiency which can be traced to poor method from manual operations some industries still operate or work in their office with annual typewriters poor communication network like out-dated telephones etc which make office work boring inaccurate as well as dissatisfying.<br/>It is noted also that this manual method makes it impossible for offices to get rid of some old personal files which would have been stored in the computer and help in creating spaces in the office.<br/>This calls for the need for an automated office where electronic machines can be used to perform office jobs what are the effects of these machines on the productivity of the secretary? Will these machines enhance the secretarial productivities or will they throw the secretary out of job? It is based on this that the researcher surveyed the effects of office automation on increasing the productivity of secretaries in manufacturing industries in Enugu State taking ANAMCO PLC as a case in.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>The purpose of the study is to find out the effects of office automation on the productivity of secretaries in ANAMMCO Plc.<br/>To do this the research will try to <br/>1. Find out whether ANAMMCO PLC has automated offices <br/>2. Find out if how they acquired those office equipment <br/>3. Find out of they have trained personnel to man those sophisticated office equipment.<br/>4. Find out whether the use of those equipment positively or negatively influence the performance of their office tasks <br/>5. Recommend solution to any problem identified as to the use of modern automated office equipment</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>This study is of immense importance in the scene that it intends to x-ray the reasons for office automation and its effects if any on the productivity of secretaries in manufacturing industries with particulate references to ANAMCO PLC.<br/>The positive effects of office automation will go a long way to help manufacturing industries benefit more on secretarial works in terms on secretarial which head to high productivity.<br/>This study will educate the illiterate class of manufactures to change their belief that office automation is capital intensive and not profit oriented.<br/>It will encourage fresh graduates who intends to go into manufacturing business in planning their administrative offices.<br/>It will help manufacturers to know the merits of office automation by way of acquiring the best quality machines determining training and maintenance.</p> <p><strong>1.5 DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>Automation is in itself a wide area of study in office management the research therefore centered her study on the effects of office automation on the productivity of secretaries in manufacturing industries in Enugu state taking ANAMMCO Plc as the area of study.</p> <p><strong>1.6 RESEARCH QUESTIONS </strong><br/>To achieve the stated objectives answers will be provided to the following research questions.<br/>1. What are the effects of office automation on secretaries?<br/>2. Does ANAMMCO Plc has any automated offices <br/>3. How does ANAMMCO Plc acquire those automated equipment <br/>4. Has ANAMMCO Plc trained personnel to man those sophisticated office equipment <br/>5. How Positively or negatively has the use of those equipment in ANAMMCO Plc influenced the performance of their office tasks<br/>6.

From the data analyzed, the researcher found out that secretaries play prominent roles in the world of modern communication and that the effectiveness and efficiency of the secretary lies solely on the use of communication equipment.<br/>It was discovered that communication equipment can never replace secretarial role in any organization. Rather communication equipment are aids to the secretary in facilitating her job.<br/>The researcher thereby recommending that secretaries should endeavor to upgrade their skills and knowledge on communication equipment so as to equip themselves and face the challenges of technological innovations.</div> <div>TABLE OF CONTENT</div> <div>Title Page<br/>Approval Page<br/>Dedication<br/>Acknowledgement<br/>Abstract<br/>Table of Content  <p><em><strong>Chapter One<br/>1.0 Introduction</strong></em><br/>1.1 Background Of The Study<br/>1.2 Who Is A Secretary<br/>1.3 Roles Of A Secretary<br/>1.4 Statement Of The Problems<br/>1.5 Purpose Of The Study<br/>1.6 Significance Of The Study<br/>1.7 Scope Of The Study<br/>1.8 Limitation Of The Study<br/>1.9 Research Questions<br/>1.10 Definition Of Terms</p> <p><em><strong>Chapter Two<br/>2.0 Literature Review</strong></em><br/>2.1 The Secretary And The Modern Communication <br/>2.2 Basic Communication Equipment<br/>2.3 The Effect Of The Communication Equipment On The Efficiency Of The Secretary<br/>2.4 Merits Of Communication Equipment And Their Influence On The Secretary<br/>2.5 Demerits Of Communication Equipment And Their Influences On The Secretary</p> <p><em><strong>Chapter Three<br/>3.0 Research Methodology</strong></em><br/>3.1 Research Design<br/>3.2 Sources Of Data<br/>3.3 Method Of Data Collection<br/>3.4 Population Of The Study<br/>3.5 Sample Size<br/>3.6 Instrument<br/>3.7 Validity Of Instrument<br/>3.8 Reliability Of Instrument<br/>3.9 Nature Of The Study<br/>3.10 Questionnaire Administration And Collection<br/>3.11 Data Treatment</p> <p><em><strong>Chapter Four<br/>4.0 Presentation And Analysis Of Data</strong></em><br/>4.1 Percentage Analysis Of Data Collected<br/>4.2 Interpretation Of Data</p> <p><em><strong>Chapter Five<br/>5.0 Summary Of Findings, Conclusion And Recommendations</strong></em><br/>5.1 Summary Of Findings<br/>5.2 Conclusion<br/>5.3 Implication Of The Results<br/>5.4 Recommendations<br/>5.5 Suggestion For Further Research<br/>References<br/>Appendix 1<br/>Appendix 2</p> </div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The word communication is very complex and could be used in different contexts to mean to wide range of things. Communication particularly in business organizations provides a means by which power is required, exercised, shaped and sustained.<br/>Generally, communication is an act shaped by all living things. It originated from the Latin word “communies” meaning to share. Communication is the act of imparting a share of something.<br/>To emphasized on the importance of communication, Cicero (1970) said thus “If a wise man were granted a life of abundance of materials things, so that he has leisure to contemplate everything worth knowing, yet if he could not communicate with other human if he could not communicate with other human beings he could abandon life”<br/>By John fists (1982) “Communication is talking to one another, it is television, it is spreading information by whatever means. It is our life style, it is literary criticism, the list is endless.<br/>Two schools of though exist on communication. The process school and the sem school. Both schools agreed on the fact that for communication to be effective, there must be a sender, a receiver, a channel and the subject matter which is being communicated on. There could also be noise which is anything that is being added to the communication signals between its transmission and reception that is not intended by sources.<br/>Communication in a business organization encompasses more than mere oral transmission. It involves all the sensory, oral and written activities that form part of our organizational life. The actualization of communication is the equipment. This is because when instruction are communicated through the equipment,. The people working know their responsibilities and the secretary dispensers her duties appropriately. Thus, the organizational goal would be enhanced.</p> <p><strong>1.2 WHO IS A SECRETARY</strong><br/>The word secretary us coined from the Latin word “Secretus” which literally means “a secret”. Perhaps it is the fact that aspect if the work of a secretary involve keeping secrets that the secretaries are often regarded as a keeper of secrets.<br/>The National Secretaries Association (United stated of America) defined a secretary as “an assistant to an executive, possessing mastery of office skills and ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision, who displays initiatives, exercises judgment and takes decision within the scope of her authority. There is therefore no doubting that fact that the secretary is the wheel on which the executive activities revolve. The secretary is often refereed to as the executive alter ego.</p> <p><strong>1.3 ROLES OF A SECRETARY</strong><br/>The role of the secretary plays in an office is wide and varied depending on the size and type of organization in which she is working. Technological innovation in the office has increasingly made the work of the secretary more complex and sophisticated though a lot easier.<br/>However, there are some of the routine duties a secretary is expected to perform.<br/>ARRANGING FOR MEETING<br/>It is the duty of the secretary to arrange for meetings, take accurate minutes of the meeting and type them out neatly.<br/>DECISION MAKING AND PROBLEMS SOLVING<br/>H.A. Dauda (1993) The secretary should assist the executive in his decision making and problem solving role. She does this by filtering calls and callers which enables the manager to concentrate fully. She also furnishes her boss with adequate information from files and elsewhere. The secretary should seek as the ears of her boss when he is away and inform him accordingly when he is back.<br/>COMMUNICATION AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION<br/>The secretary joins the manager in his communication processing and dissemination of information. Modern communication and information technology can enable people communicate locally and internationally at the shortest possible time. Local area networks, teleconferences and caller phones are good facilitators of both near and far distant communications. The secretary in particular plays a great role in dissemination of information. He must give adequate and timely information.</p> <p>INTERPERSONAL SKILLS.<br/>Every organization is made up of different kinds of people/business associates, clients, peers and staffs of the organization. It believes on the secretary to develop a good public relations skill by which she grapes quickly the mood of views of all these people and adjust his own responses accordingly such skills include: being a good listener, making people feel at ease and being able to interpret the body movement and signals people display.<br/>ORGANIZING THE WORKLAOD<br/>It is the duty of the secretary to organize the method to run the daily workload of the organization. He doubles as the manager’s receptionist, prioritizes the procedure for handling the office mail, operates the various memory aids for checking work progress or those awaiting responses, looking appointments and blocking undesirable visitors and finally maintaining the manager’s diary. <br/>MASTERY OF THE COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT<br/>Mastery of the communications equipment and the office equipment for use in doing the job is vital. Also she should be able to know the objectives of the firm whether it is profit-oriented, service oriented, operates an expansionist policy or large-scale economics.</p> <p><strong>1.4 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>Our nuclear age is witnessing an everyday reduction in the number of staff required to perform units of a particular operation due to the development and injection of various communication equipment.<br/>Based on this development it becomes logical to ask if the communication equipment are bringing about changes in the communication role of the secretary.<br/>The problem now to be death with is “Can communication equipment enhance or undermine the efficiency of the secretary”</p> <p><strong>1.5 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The purpose of the study us to<br/>a. Look into the roles a secretary has to play in the m=world of modern communication<br/>b. Identify some of the oral and written communication equipment<br/>c. Determine the effect of communication equipment on the secretary’s efficiency<br/>d. Identify the merits and demerits of the communication equipment and their influence on the secretary.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This work aims at establishing the roles of a secretary in the world if modern communication. It equally aims at clearing the mind of those who think that secretaries are never-do-well and to make it clear that there is a difference between copy typists and trained secretaries.<br/>Also of importance in this study is the knowledge of the communication equipment to secretaries. Students studying secretarial and business administration respectively are not left out.<br/>The research will also try to allay the fear in some practicing secretaries and students secretaries that advancement of communication technology will have counter-productive effect on the role of a secretary</p> <p><strong>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The scope of this study is very wide if it has to be carried out in all organizations. Therefore, this research study will be confined to secretaries of (Nigeria Breweries Public Limited Company/Ama Greenfield, 9th mile corner Enugu) NBL. The company has enough of communication equipment and secretaries that operate them.<br/>Moreover the research is centered on this technological age where the innovations seem to take the position of human communication and that id a secretary in an organization. Thus, this research could be described as a modern and computer age study.</p> <p><strong>1.8 LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong><br/>It is normal in the process of every study to encounter some difficulties. As a matter of fact, the researcher encountered some which are not recorded but the following were the sticking short comings that militated against the in-debt study of the subject.<br/>1. The researcher had not enough fund for transport.<br/>2. Lack of efficient time for the study and the problem of procuring accurate and relevant data.<br/>3. It is also disheartening that the research found fellow secretaries non-cooperatives even to be engaged in an interview.<br/>By and large, a substantial number of them were cooperative.</p> <p><strong>1.9 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>The questions are intended to point more on the topic and accordingly supply answers to them<br/>1. What are the roles that a secretary plays in the world of modern communication<br/>2. What are the communication equipment (oral and written) to be found in a secretary’s office.<br/>3. Are the communication equipment bringing about effect on the efficiency of the secretary.<br/>4. Can a secretary cope with such effect/changes brought about by the communication equipment<br/>5. Are the communication equipment of any advantages or positive influence on the secretary.<br/>6. DO demerits of communication equipment have influence on the secretary.</p> <p><strong>1.10 DEFINITION OF TERMS.</strong><br/>EXECUTIVES ALTER EGO: This means an assistant to the executive who possesses a mastery of office skills, demonstrate the ability to assume responsibilities with or without direct supervision.<br/>TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION: These are the modern sophisticated devices that gave communication very wonderful boost.<br/>LOCAL AREA NETWORK (LAN): Is the linking of devices together for sharing information with the aid of terminals.<br/>NEVER-DO-WELL: This means unimportant and worthless. Thus, the secretary is not never-do-well but indispensable in every organization.<br/>MEMORY AIDS: These are those things/documents which a secretary uses to record appointments viz: diary. Appointment cards, induced memory aid, telephone pad, private notebook, reminder schedule, calendar, mnemonic devices and pocket computer.<br/>NUCLEAR AGE: This is the scientific era when weapons and innovation are in vogue </p> </div> </div>\n\nINFLUENCE OF COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT ON THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SECRETARY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INFLUENCE OF COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT ON THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SECRETARY", "id": 36}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>IMPACT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE COMPUTER ON THE SECRETARIAL PROFESSION </p> <p>(A Case Study Of Selected Banks In Enugu Metropolis)</p> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>The degree to which computer is used in offices has been of serious concern to secretarial profession.

Questionnaire and Oral interview were used to collect data.<br/>The statistical tools used are average and percentage. When the data was analyzed, it was found that secretaries do not react adversely to the introduction of computer in their offices, computer have created new skills for the secretary and have added some spices to their work. With the acquisition of such skills, secretaries are now seen as indispensable tool in the office, thus giving them good professional status. And it was recommended that secretaries should develop attitudes and learning skills that would enable them to take advantage of new opportunity.</div> <div>TABLE OF CONTENT</div> <div>Title Page <br/>Approval Page <br/>Dedication <br/>Acknowledgement <br/>Table Of Contents <br/>Abstract<br/><br/><em><strong>Chapter One<br/>1.0 Introduction </strong></em><br/>1.0.1 Background Of The Study <br/>1.1 Statement Of Problem <br/>1.2 Purpose Of The Study <br/>1.3 Research Questions <br/>1.4 Significance Of The Study <br/>1.5 Delimitation Of The Study <br/>1.6 Definition Of Terms<br/><strong><em><br/>Chapter Two<br/>2.0 Literature Review </em></strong><br/>2.1 Perspective On Computer <br/>2.2 Computer And Organizational Output/Productivity <br/>2.3 Computer And Workload <br/>2.4 Computer And Workers Health <br/>2.5 Computer And Redundancy <br/>2.6 Synthesis Of Literature <br/><br/><em><strong>Chapter Three<br/>3.0 Research Methodology </strong></em><br/>3.1 Area Of Study <br/>3.2 Research Design <br/>3.3 Population <br/>3.4 Sample And Sampling Technique <br/>3.5 Instrument For Data Collection <br/>3.6 Method Of Gathering And Administering Of Data <br/>3.7 Validation Of Research <br/>3.8 Method Of Data Analysis <br/><br/><em><strong>Chapter Four<br/>4.0 Data Presentation<br/><br/>Chapter Five<br/>5.0 Summary Of Findings, Conclusion,And Recommendation </strong></em><br/>5.1 Summary Of Findings <br/>5.2 Conclusion <br/>5.3 Recommendations <br/>5.4 Suggestion Topics For Further Research <br/>5.5 Limitation <br/>Bibliography <br/>Questionnaire <br/> </div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Today, the business world is undergoing far-reaching <br/>Technological revolution due to the advancement in science. For all types of organizations to succeed in today’s rapidly changing environment, they need to be able to be process data and information effectively.<br/>In conducting them day to day operations organization use information for functions such as planning, controlling, directing, organizing and diction making. Information therefore is unique actionably a critical resources in the operations of all organization the business men, secretaries, students and in fact everybody, would now readily see the indelible impact of modern technology on people lives.<br/>In an organization, information moves from person, forms are completed, filed and received and individuals communicate variety of both simple and complex concepts. At the turn of the century most written information were complied by hand in pen and ink copies were made by hand and communicated was by letter, telegraph or in person. Today most of the tedious functions related to information handling and processing are done through the computer. <br/>For the secretaries, not only have their equipment changed, but also their administrative processes office routine management systems are similarly evolving into new forms. Computers have replaced manual typewriters and electric typewriter while for machines replaced telex machines. There are also different type of advanced communication gadget such as cellular phones, pager etc. With this radical change, the secretaries are expected to change and be able to keep up with all these professional changes around them. In accordance with the law of motion CHANGE is a constant phenomena. If we look at the beginning of man to the present day, we would see that there had been tremendous change. If there had not occurred, man would have remained primitive hill today. Change is a challenge and if we abide by change, it brings out the best in us thereby leading to erroneous progress.<br/>The first office automatic machine were introduced 1930 and used paper rolls later paper tape as a form of memory. BY the 1960s the international business machine (IBM) had introduced the selective go If ball typewriter which allows the typist to change the print element, the go If – ball to provide a different type font (character design and sign) another break through was the introduction of IBM’s magnetic tape selective typewriter. This was followed by the introduction of a visual display unit (VDU) this allows the typist to see what I happening to the text as if being tyed amended and stored, but before it I being committed to paper or printed out. In fact, electronic systems are now possible that they can sense absorbs store, categorize ponder, very high quantity. Yet with greater accuracy, speed and reliability. Coventry, (1981) indicated that Recent development of the micro processor, founded on the silicon chips has potentials likely to have a vast social repercussion through out financial industry, for a simple chip take over a high proportion of today’s office job P.21. When we refer to computer system, we refer to information and communication system which are necessary for the functioning of the office. We assume that data processing and word-processing play a large role and also that human system under lie these technical systems. In an ideal situation therefore, the technology and the people function together harmoniously.<br/>It is important to recognize that development and implementation of the computer is moving through several overlapping phases, each affecting differently.<br/>In general, a distinction can be made between two classes of office workers. The first are the information worker they are those who are involved in the routine entry, recording, storage and transmission of information, those who fall under this group of worker include – Typist, secretaries, clerks and data entry personal.<br/>The second group are the knowledge works-this group aconite of those worker who create, interpret, analyze and utilize this information these knowledge worker can be divided into two (2) groups professional/technical employees and managers.<br/>The main impact of the computer is simply to facilitate office operation as they are now being carried out. For example the word professor replace the secretary’s type writers, the mini-computer replaces the clerk’s filing cabinets etc. More recently professionals and secretaries have begun using personal computers and sophisticated calculators to speed up their work. The timing of there development has largely been dictated by the emergence of the technology starting with the widespread introduction of word processor’s in the 1970’s, and it in the late 1970s and its legitimating as a business tool in 1981, with the introduction of the IBM P.C.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>Up to the 190’s the use of the computer in this country was limited to very few multinational companies. The secretary then had to contend with using manual and electric typewriters in performing her word processing function.<br/>Furthermore storage and retrieval of information was by use of files, filing cabinets, index cards etc. Accessing of other information had to be through telephone directories and other relevant specialized text meant for such purpose.<br/>Many of the secretaries of the 80’s are still in employment. With the advent and widespread use of the computer are then wonders how these secretaries are adjusting to be new devices now prevalent in modern offices are they finding it easy or difficult? Is the profession generally under threat by the introduction of the computer and the Internet? What can be done to keep the secretary still relevant in to day’s modern business setting? These and many more are what this research aims to find solutions for.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The purpose of this study is to thoroughly investigate on the impact of the introduction of the computer on the secretaries.<br/>1. How secretaries react or the attitude of secretaries towards the introduction of computers.<br/>2. To ascertain whether the introduction of computer has in any way improve the secretary’s work.<br/>3. To ascertain whether the introduction of computer has made it easy or difficult to adjust (especially the secretaries of the bank under investigation).<br/>4. To determine the problems encountered by secretaries in trying to adapt to changes in the nature of their work.<br/>5. To find out whether or not secretaries are involved in the planning and introduction of computers.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>The research provided answers to the following research questions;<br/>1. How do secretaries react to the introduction of computer<br/>2. What problems are encountered by secretaries in trying to adapt to changes in the nature of their work.<br/>3. Are there orientation programmes in facilitating the adaptation to new changes of work<br/>4. Are secretaries involved in the planning and introduction of computers.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The investigation of the impact of the introduction of the computer on secretaries in some selected banks in Enugu Metropolis. Would give some insight in the performance of secretaries on the advert of computers.<br/>Many of the major problems that organizations have faced in the past have been that they are in awe of technology, they failed to recognize the need to use technology as a competitive weapon against their rivals, they expected technology to be difficult to use and also the unwillingness to address the compelling human issues which has been the major cause of low productivity. This study will help secretaries to full understand how their career will change as a result of the introduction of computers in their offices.<br/>From this study, banks will now recognize the need to use technology as a competitive weapon. Winning a competitive edge has become of fundamental importance within national and international Banking, institutions. The prime emphasis of activity now rests on providing an ever improving levels of services to existing clients and customers and winning new business through the sheer quality of service provided and the ingenuity of marketing activity. Ultimately, it is only through establishing a competitive advantage over rival institutions that an institution can hope to maximize profitability.<br/>In Banking sector where establishing a competitive advantage has become so important, it is necessary for them to pay particular attention to the role which technology plays in offering them an opportunity to gain this advantage. The main function of technological deployment is to assist an institution to gain a competitive advantage.<br/>Finally, this research work will be of significance to the society at large because if the computer is well utilized, productivity (efficiency and effectiveness) would be enhanced, there by leading to a higher standard of ling for the society.</p> <p><strong>1.6 DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The study of the impact of computer on the secretarial profession, will be carried out in some selected Banks I.e. first Banks on Nigeria, Union Bank of Nigeria plc, and Abakpa Nike Community Bank limited in Enugu metropolis and does not pretent to give an overview of what applies in other Banks.</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>Bank: This means any private or pubic organization which derives the greater part of its revenue from handling, managing, or investing money either on its own behalf or on behalf of its customers.<br/>Computer: A computer is a device capable of accepting information, applying prescribed processes to the information and supplying the result of these processes.<br/>Secretary: An executive assistance who processes a mastery of office work and skills and demonstrates the ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision, who exercise initiative and judgments and who make decision within the scope of assigned authority.

Simple percentage was used for the data analysis. The findings revealed that: secretaries in modern business organization are affected positively and negatively by the new socio-economic and technological system. The functions of the secretaries are both secretarial and administrative functions more challenging than the traditional roles previously performed.<br/>The findings further revealed that most secretaries found at difficult to adopt to the new system. Absed on the findings, it was recommended that all these could be remedied if adequate training and motivation should be given to secretaries.<br/>Also, students should be exposed to the use of modern office equipment and that a national body should be established to register and regulate the practice of secretaryship in the country.</div> <div>TABLE OF CONTENT</div> <div>Title Page <br/>Approval Sheet <br/>Dedication <br/>Abstract <br/>Table Of Contents <br/>List Of Tables <br/><br/><em><strong>Chapter One<br/>1:0 Background Information</strong></em><br/>1:1 Statement Of Problems<br/>1:2 Objectives Of The Study<br/>1:3 Objectives Of The Study<br/>1.4 Research Questions<br/>1.5 Limitations<br/>1.6 Delimitations/Scope Of The Study<br/>References  <p><strong><em>Chapter Two<br/>2.0 Literature Review</em></strong><br/>2.1 Background Of The Secretary<br/>2.2 Functions Of The Secretary In Modern Organization<br/>2.3 Socio-Economic Challenges<br/>2.4 Technological Challenges<br/>References</p> <p><strong><em>Chapter Three<br/>3.0 Methodology</em></strong><br/>3.1 Design Of Study<br/>3.2 Area Of Study<br/>3.3 Population<br/>3.4 Sample Size<br/>3.5 Instrument For Data Collection<br/>3.6 Validity Of The Instrument<br/>3.7 Method Of Data Collection<br/>3.8 Method Of Data Analysis</p> <p><strong><em>Chapter Four<br/>4.0 Presentation And Analysis Of Data</em></strong><br/>4.1 Research Questions<br/>4.2 Discussion Of Findings<br/>References</p> <p><strong><em>Chapter Five<br/>5.0 Summary Of Findings, Conclusions And Recommendations Of The Findings</em></strong><br/>5.1 Conclusions<br/>5.2 Recommendations<br/>5.3 Implication Of The Study<br/>5.4 Appendix One<br/>References<br/>Appendix Two<br/>Sample Of Questionnaire</p> </div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0 Background information:</strong><br/>The modern business organization is a highly complex affair and thus the function of the secretary is becoming more is a highly complex affair and thus the function of the secretary is becoming more challenging. Every business management aims at making profit and at the same time, strives to provide the needs of its employees.<br/>The socio-economic and technological system of modern business has taken a new dimension. Thus could be attributed to challenges in the society. Thus, hails and Hubband (1977) said many organizations have changed their internal system to match changes in the environment.<br/>Business managers have now employed means to create a better working relationship between their employee and themselves. Employees are motivated to increase productivity and ensure good working conditions. Humbly (1975) said that suceesful manamgent of change requires an understanding of humans motivation.<br/>Hails and husband (1977) went further to say that every country must operate within an economic system that provides its citizens with necessary goods and services. To meet these needs modern business have adopted measures like: introduction of modern office equipment, performance appraisal, providing office security, training employees. Etc.<br/>As the duties of the secretary is becoming more and more complex, it is imperative to tach not only skills and techniques necessary for these functions but also a more general training that would give the secretary the possibility of career development. Anyatonwu (N.d.) opined that, the role of the secretary in today’s business has assumed added dimensions and they are no longer limited to shorthand and typewriting to become secretary.<br/>He further said that, secretary today cover many responsibility for which they are employed.<br/>The social system of business organizations has also taken a new trend. Modern business satisfy the needs of their employees, which was not the case in the past. Hence, humble (1975) opined that considerations of adaptability and motivation are not as same believes it to be of mere academic interest but, now it is practical importance to business. He also said that, social responsibility is one of the key areas of business and that computer has added a new dimension to business and social activities.<br/>Technological system can be conceived to be creative. To its creativity, Marvin and Mareia (1984) said that, “office automation should help to increase productivity, eliminate waste, and create new and more challenging jobs for those willing to adopt themselves to the new system.</p> <p><strong>1.1 Statement of problems</strong><br/>The modern business organisation is a highly complex affair and thus the function of the secretary is becoming more and more challenging, therefore, with this modernization, the secretary are faced with the following problems.<br/>The business managers strive to maximize profit through the introduction of new economic system, thus, in modern business it is believed that office automation should help to increase productivity eliminate waste and create new and more challenging jobs for those willing to adapt themselves to the new system.<br/>The technological innovation may affect the workplace of a secretary in several ways, one of which is to render skills and knowledge obsolete.<br/>The change in the system of modern business organizations has made the job of the secretary more challenging. One must have an understanding of what one is supposed to do how to do it and various ways one can fail.<br/>Again, the secretary who is not well trained and not well equipped may not be able to carry out her task effectively, socially, economically and technologically. To this effect, in discharging her functions, she may not get cooperations from her boss, colleagues or even outsiders.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Objectives of the study:</strong><br/>The major objectives of this study is to determine the socio-economic and technological system of modern business and how they affect the job of the secretary and also to determine the possible challenges faced by modern day secretaries and enlighten the secretary to move as the modern business moves by giving themselves, sound educational background, training and skills.<br/>The study will help to:<br/>i Identify the functions of the secretary in modern business <br/>organization.<br/>ii. Examine the socio-economic and technological system of modern business.<br/>iii. Look into the possible challenges faced by the secretary<br/>iv. Look into the level of adaptability of the secretary to this new trend in modern business.<br/>v. Find possible solutions to the problem to enable secretaries fit in the new system.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Significance of study</strong><br/>This project is intended to educate professional secretary on possible ways which they can improve their skills in order to adapt to the new system.<br/>To the would-be secretaries, this study will give them an insight into the new system of modern business organization so as to have foreknowledge of what would be required of them in the future. It will also prepare their mind for what they will be faced with in the business world.<br/>To the business organization, this study will create an awareness of the implications of this new system to its productivity and profit so as to be able to modify the system to suit its employees.<br/>To the institution, this study will create the need to include new courses into the school curricula so as to impart better knowledge on to introduce the use of modern office equipment and provide enough and well-equipped lecturers to handle the courses.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Research Questions</strong><br/>To direct the line of this study, the following research questions are asked:<br/>1. Are the functions of modern day secretaries different from those of the past?<br/>2. Are secretaries affected by the socio-economic and technological system?<br/>3. Are there challenges posed to the secretary by the new socio-economic and technological syste?<br/>4. Are there challenges posed to the secretary by the new socio-economic and technological system/<br/>5. Are there possible solustions that will enable the secretary to fit in?</p> <p><strong>1.5 Limitation</strong><br/>this study is limited in its coverage because of time constraint. It would have been ideal to cover more than one business establishment in Enugu State. Time – constrained the researched in Enugu state. Time constrained the researched due to academic work that needed urgent attention. <br/>Another constraint is finance, due to the economic situation of the country, the researcher, limited her study to the area mentioned.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Delimitation/ Scope of the study</strong><br/>This study focuses mainly on the effects of the new socio-economic and technological system. The investigation may not be exhaustive as it should be therefore, the researcher have limited herself to a selected business organization in Enugu state.</p> <p><strong>REFERENCES</strong><br/>1.

The fast production of efficient work is assured since they are well trained in that line.<br/>Whenever paper work, records and mostly written communication are needed in an organization the secretaries are likely to be involved. In as much as secretaries have been undermined by the general public in many ways, the general conception is usually that any employee who sits behind a typewriter and does other forms of secretarial jobs is a secretary; therefore regarding them as typists or mere servants. It is therefore pertinent to start by knowing exactly who a secretary is, before going to the challenges facing them.<br/>A secretary is an employment in an office who deals with correspondence, keeps records, makes arrangement and appointments for a particular member of the staff. He/she is the one who combines or has the mastering skills of shorthand and type writing and with a sound knowledge of secretarial duties.<br/>A secretary is defined by the National Association secretaries in United States of America “as a executive assistant who posses mastery of office skills, who demonstrates ability to assume responsibilities without direct supervisor who exercises initiatives and judgment, and who makes decision with in the scope of assigned authority”.<br/>Office skills include typewriting, shorthand ability to operate photocopying machine, duplicating machines, cope with filings, do reception duties. Furthermore, a good secretary needs also to have accumulated enough knowledge about commercial work in general and this implications, on secretary is deemed to be genius.<br/>A secretary in other words is a person employed in an office to care of correspondence/ records and in addition keep the day to day engagement of his/her executive in line with various demands.<br/>Based on these factors, one can now say that a secretary is an indispensable factor in any office or organization. <br/>A secretary has out-standing qualities – she understands the principles of keeping secrets, being polite to customers, callers and visitors, no matter how highly or lowly the visitors may be placed.<br/>She appreciates the aims or goals of the organization in office or business, and conscientious works towards the achievement of the goals, together with the boss and other staff.<br/>The secretary working in an industry should know all about the place. She should know the products, how they are produced, how raw materials are obtained, how the machinery works, how and where the spare parts are obtained, know managers and their individual assignments, other management staff, and indeed, the policy of the whole organization.<br/>A good secretary is always alert, she reads newspapers, listens to News on electronic media and even to other people as they discuss. This is because, she might get useful information with minimum delay for the smooth running of the organization. Other attributes of a good secretary include tactfulness, self-control, neatness, politeness, ability to work without grumbling memory and pleasant speaking, services of a secretary are indispensable in every establishment. But, this fact notwithstanding, secretaries complain of one form of maltreatment or another from their employers in the course of carrying out their duties.<br/>In spite of the important roles which secretaries play in organizations. Nigeria secretaries are still faced with a lot challenges and this paper or research will address these challenges.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM:</strong><br/>The secretarial profession has become overwhelming indispensable in all spheres of life in recent times, but unfortunately the profession is higher and adequate recognition in financial houses.<br/>Many people have this false notion that only never do wells enter the profession. Secretaries are most times misunderstood and misplaced, therefore they relegate to the background by many bosses as a result they are placed in their rightful positions.<br/>This research work is aimed at finding out the challenges facing the secretaries and paving a way to gaining the attention for the secretarial profession by making both financial houses and secretaries to be aware of their positions as they work hand by hand.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The main purpose of this research is to identify the challenges of secretaries in model financial houses. Specifically the study seeks to:<br/>1. Identify who the secretaries are in an organization.<br/>2. investigate whether secretaries are sent on training to improve their skills.<br/>3. ascertain whether secretaries are properly remunerated.<br/>4. to find out if today’s secretaries are able to manipulate modern office machines and equipment in our model offices.<br/>5. to determine how the secretaries relate with their bosses.</p> <p><br/><strong>1.4 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Any study carried out must have some significance and it is strongly believed that this study when completed will be of immense benefit to all groups of people in the society.<br/>For one thing, this study will identify the challenges of secretarial, help their employers to have a clear view of their problems and their device means of motivating their secretaries so as to enhance productivity. It will also help the manages to know what relationship that should exist between them and their secretaries.<br/>Again, it will be beneficial to the secretaries themselves to enhance their prospects, if they adhere to the recommendations set out by this study. It will serve as an inspiration to secretaries Nigeria having known their problems and ways of averting them.<br/>It will also have as a frame work in improving the ways, status, and working conditions of the secretaries in Nigeria.<br/>However, this project will serve as an indicator to employers so as to know how to treat their secretaries, know the working environments that will be best for maximum efficiency and productivity of secretarial work and the entire work of the organization and improve on their business in general.<br/>Finally, the research will provide an up-to-date data of secretarial challenges for future researchers to look at in their studies.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SCOPE/LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study focuses on the challenges facing secretaries in model financial houses first Bank Plc, Enugu (main branch) is specifically used for the study.<br/>The researcher encountered some problems that delayed the completion of the project on time. Chief among these problems was lack of materials.<br/>Most of the resource materials at hand were quite irrelevant to the topic of research because not much has been written by people on this topic from where enough materials would have been collected to help more in writing up the literature review.<br/>Time was also a problem to the researcher. Research work of this nature requires much time for collection of valid information and other relevant materials to make this study, due to the fact that is being conducted at a time when the researcher was preparing for her final examinations.<br/>The researcher was also constrained by finance, which also affected the depth of coverage of the variables researched.</p> <p><strong>1.6 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>This study is undertaken to provide answers to the following research questions;<br/>(1) What role does a secretary lay in model offices?<br/>(2) How are secretaries remunerated in model financial houses.<br/>(3) To what extent re secretaries so on training to improve their skills.<br/>(4) To what extent are today’s secretary able to manipulate modern office machines and equipment in model financial houses?<br/>(5) What are the relationships between the secretary and her boss? </p> </div> </div>\n\nCHALLENGES OF SECRETARIES WORKING IN FINANCIAL HOUSES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CHALLENGES OF SECRETARIES WORKING IN FINANCIAL HOUSES", "id": 39}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF TEACHING AND LEARNING BUSINESS STUDIES IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS </p> <p>(A Case Study Nuskka Zone)</p> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>This study is an investigation into the TEACHING AND LEARNING OF BUSINESS STUDIES IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN ENUGU URBAN .<br/>Data collected was analyzed and discussed in different chapters that make up this research work.

The dictionary sees the commercial studies of education as the area that comprises such school subjects as typewriting, shorthand, book keeping and elementary accounting at defines business studies a studies of commerce and management subjects.<br/>This definition however does not indicate the level of education at which the title should be used.<br/>The difference in title is a matter of sentiment which does not in any way determine the content of the courses at the various levels of education.<br/>In the secretary school in Nigeria the course is regarded as business studies but in the higher levels, in colleges and universities it is known as Business education or management science which covers subjects as well as related courses like business law, business management, accountancy, marketing data processing and computer.<br/>Under the new system in education, these subjects are not studies in isolation in the junior secondary school. As a result of this problem, there has been less interest and motivation on the part of the students who offer business subjects in schools.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong><br/>Business education in Nigeria is at its developmental stage at the initial introduction of this course into our education system there was no interest nor motivation from the government. According to Nsofor (1979) “The government was not only uninterested in including commercial subjects in the educational curriculum it made a deliberate and calculated attempt to frustrate the efforts of come of the philantiopicts”. Due to lack of attention which business education received at the introduction stage, efforts by the private proprietors no attention to crumple down. The proprietors gave no attention to the training of business teachers. This may be due to professional complications and financial burden which were not within their reach.<br/>It is discouraging to note that despite all the problem business education faces at the earlier stage and the opportunities at had offended to the country, much has not been done to improve the situation. Schools, students still today lack qualified business teachers which may be as a result of the period of former inadequate when compared with the complexities and dynamic nature of knowledge required. A major problems that face business education today is lack of equipment which are very necessary for proper mastery of the subject. As a result of these problems, there has been less interest and motivation on the part of the students who offer business subjects in school.<br/>Another problems which will inhibit a smooth teaching of business studies in secondary school is lack of libraries. The important of which cannot be over emphasized nor will not occupy lengthy discussion in this work..</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The purpose of this study is to find out the problems and prospects of teaching and learning business studies in secondary schools in Nuskka educational zone of Enugu state.<br/>These include the following.<br/>1. To identify the problems of teaching and learning business studies in secondary school in Nsukka Educational Zone of Enugu state.<br/>2. To find out if such problems test in Nsukka Educational Zone of Enugu state<br/>3. To know the extent of these problems if they exist<br/>4. To recommend actions to be taken to prevent or avoid/reduce future problems of teaching and learning business studies in Nsukka Educational zone of Enugu State.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>a. Does lack of business studies teachers affect the teaching and learning of business studies subject<br/>b. To what extent are materials and equipment available for the teaching and learning of business studies in the secondary schools.<br/>c. Does lack of fund contribute to ineffective teaching and learning of business studies in the secondary schools.</p> <p><strong>1.5 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The purpose of the study is to research, look deeply and to find out the teaching and learning of business studies in secondary schools. It also attempt to blend the differing view points in such a ways as to stimulate interests not only in the casual readers.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE AND DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study is limited to secondary schools in Enugu urban. This is because of shortness of time coupled with the sharing of time among other academic engagements.<br/>Other factors include finance and difficulties involved in meeting the required personnel in their various offices. The narrow area covered by the research is to enable the researcher carryout the study successfully and effectively.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The significance of this study definitely lies on the hope that an early identification of the existing problem in the teaching of business studies in secondary school call per measures to be adopted to eradicate them from the grass root. This will not doubt place the students on the right state with other areas to studies,<br/>It would serve as a reference point for further research not will also assist the government and the people in designing future educational policies to meet the need of the people.</p> <p><strong>1.8 PROBLEMS OF BUSINESS EDUCATION</strong><br/>Business education in Nigeria is at it development stages.<br/>At the limited introduction of this course into our educational system. There was no interest nor motivation from the government.<br/>According to Nsofor (1979) “The government was not only uninterested in including commercial subjects in the educational curriculum. It made a deliberate and calculated attempts fir frustrate the effort of some of the philanthropists.<br/>Due to lack of attention which business education received at the introduction stage, the efforts by the private proprietors stated to crumple down. The proprietors gave no attention to the training of business teachers. This may be due to professional complications and financial burden which were not within their reach. <br/>Another problem that face business education today is lack of equipment which are very necessary for proper mastery of the subjects.</p> </div> </div>\n\nPROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF TEACHING AND LEARNING BUSINESS STUDIES IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF TEACHING AND LEARNING BUSINESS STUDIES IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS", "id": 40}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>PROBLEM OF RECORDS MANAGEMENT IN INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY </p> <p>(A Case Of Enugu State)</p> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>Record management is the making use, control and disposition of records. So that the system works efficiently and economically.<br/>Business organizations, government ministry, educational institutions and social institutions depend upon records for their existence. There are several problems that stand in the way of achieving an efficient and effective records management in institution of higher learning.<br/>In view of this, the researcher decided to identify some of these problems of records management in institute of management and technology in Enugu state.<br/>The main instrument of this study was questionnaire, administered on a sample size of one hundred and fifty respondents chosen from these institutions. From the information gotten, the researcher concluded that given all other factors, the problems of records management in institution of higher learning are<br/>Absence of well define records management policy or practice; the problems encountered in handling records or mails and inadequate storage space and equipment, the problems encountered in retrieval of disposal of records.<br/>By these findings, the researcher gave some recommendations that may enhance records management practice and assets in offering solution to the above problems which are keeping of records retention policy of the institution by the institutions. Secondly, an efficient and effective records management department should be maintained so that records would be properly kept and handled. Also, inactive files or records should be kept in an inactive area or achieves as it costs less than keeping them among the active records. There should be periodic training and education for personnel in the records management unit of the institution. Records management personnel should made to have abroad background in business and a training information area to enable them cope with the expanding needs of business. Documents filing and records keeping should not be complex but done immediately actions are taken on them and finally, that should be adequate storage space and equipment where records should be stored.</div> <div>TABLE OF CONTENT</div> <div>Title Page<br/>Approval Page<br/>Dedication<br/>Acknowledgement<br/>Abstract <br/>Table Of Content  <p><strong><em>Chapter One<br/>1.1 Background Of The Study</em></strong><br/>1.2 Statement Of The Problem<br/>1.3 Purpose Of The Study<br/>1.4 Significance Of The Study<br/>1.5 Research Questions<br/>1.6 Scope Of The Study</p> <p><strong><em>Chapter Two<br/>2.0 Literature Review</em></strong><br/>2.1 An Overview Of Records, Management In Institution Of Higher Learning.<br/>2.2 The Problems Of Records Management In Institution Of Higher Learning<br/>2.3 Absence Of Well Defined Records Management Policy<br/>2.4 Problems Encountered In Handling Mails<br/>2.5 Problems Encountered In Retrieval And Disposal Of Records<br/>2.6 Suggested Solution To These Problems<br/>2.7 Summary Of Literature Review</p> <p><strong><em>Chapter Three<br/>3.0 Research Methodology</em></strong><br/>3.1 Design Of The Study<br/>3.2 Area Of The Study<br/>3.3 Population Of The Study<br/>3.4 Sample And Sampling Techniques<br/>3.5 Instrument Of Data Collection<br/>3.6 Method Of Data Collection<br/>3.7 Method Of Data Analysis.</p> <p><em><strong>Chapter Four<br/>4.0 Data Presentation And Analysis</strong></em><br/>4.1 Analysis Of Data</p> <p><strong><em>Chapter Five<br/>5.0 Summary Of Findings, Conlusion And Recommendations</em></strong><br/>5.1 Summary Of Findings<br/>5.2 Conclusion<br/>5.3 Recommendations<br/>References<br/>Appendix </p> </div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Over the years, many methods of records keeping have been applied in running organization but one thing that has remained relatively constant in modern management has been the management needs for information.<br/>Management requires information/records about products, personnel, finance, customers and when called for, they need them promptly to speed the work of the busy executors (Elendu 1983)<br/>Modern society depend much upon records. Business organizations, government ministries, Educational Institution and social institutions depends upon information for the existence. In the modern business offices in Nigeria, contracts, letters, memoranda, invoice, cheques, vouchers, price lists, catalogues, cost analysis statements, personnel reports constitutes records that have to be preserved for future references. <br/>Also, Educational institutes keeps records of their students names, address and even results of examinations taken either passed or failed, letters, transcript, reports, particulars of students.<br/>All these records should be kept in the most appropriate and convenient methods to fasten their retrieval when needed. All sorts of records are recovered by the institution working day.<br/>There is no doubts that if these records are not properly taken care of, the whole records office space will be flooded with papers and there will be no working space kept. This situation will then give rise to problems in records management. Records management ensures that important documents of the institution are retained and protected against damage, loss and unqualified assessments. Un-important and useless ones should be destroyed or discarded. Hence (Thelma 1990), the main purpose of record management is to eliminate papers that are temporary useless without delay and to identify and protect important documents of the institution.<br/>In every institution today, the key question asked are; What type of records should be kept? How long should it be kept? What is the mode of their destruction? This project therefore will try to proffer answers to these problems.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong><br/>Record keeping in higher institution has many problems which should be considered and solutions proffered. These problems are seen in the keeping, arranging and preparation of these records. The rate at which paper work accumulates every working day throws many heads into confusion as to how to deal with them.<br/>Experience has shown that owing to inefficiency in the practice of records management, higher institutions find it very difficult to make decisions as and at when appropriate.<br/>The problems of records management includes<br/>a. Absence of well-defined record management practice or policy. This is a big problems to institution of higher learning. This policy is supposed to be adopted by institutions and strictly followed (Lucy 1989)<br/>b. Lack of storage space and equipment. When these records are not properly stored, it results t misplacement and loss of some essential documents. Moreover, most institutions have problems in records management because they do not find it necessary to train personnel in the areas of records management (Todd 1986)<br/>c. Other problems are encountered in handling mails, delay in giving of documents, problems in retrieved and disposal of records. These are some of the problems of records management that necessitated this write up.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This research is to look into the problems of record management in institutions of higher learning; specifically to<br/>a. Identify the records management practice used in institute of management and technology Enugu<br/>b. Identify the problems encountered by secretaries in handling records in this institution.<br/>c.

Later the name was changed from Nigeria Broad casting corporation to federal Radio corporation of Nigeria by a Degree promulgated on February 28, 1979.<br/>The degree took retrospective effect from April 1, the degree has since been changed to an act of parliament No. 8 of 1979 in consonance with the democratic presidential system now being operated in Nigeria.<br/>Consequent upon the provisions of this act quoted above, the federal government of Nigeria has established four zonal stations in Enugu Ibadan, Kaduna, Lagos including the voice of Nigeria (VON) which though on its own but nevertheless takes care of the external services of the corporation.<br/>The federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria now has its head quarters at Abuja, the federal capital Territory of Nigeria. Also on 1st July, 2001 the Radio Nigeria started its own FM transmission in Nigeria.<br/>The act which Established, the federal Radio corporation of Nigeria also stipulated that the corporation shall amongst other things to the exclusion of any other broadcasting authority in Nigeria be:-<br/>i. Responsible for radio broadcasting in short-ware or powerful medium wave for effective and simultaneous reception in more than one state of the federation at any one time.<br/>ii. It shall be the duty of the corporation to provide as a public service, in the interests of Nigeria.<br/>iii. The corporation shall ensure that the services which it provides, when considered as a whole, shall reflect the unity of nIgeria as a federation and the same time give adequate expression of the cultural characteristics and opinions of each state of the federation. A part from its legal name of federation radio corporation of Nigeria, the corporations national character is equally reflected in as –on-the-air identifications name of Radio Nigeria as appellation exclusively of Nigeria.<br/>The structure of corporation as at present constituted, it based on zoning of the country with emphasis on broad casting in twelve Nigeria language viz Edo, Efik, fulfulda, Hausa, Igala, Igbo, Izon, Kanuri, NNPe, Tio, Urhobo and Yoruba, such as to ensure that at least 85% of the population of the country are covered by their programmes in these languages. Staff strength of about 847, 340 workers were disengaged that is about 40% of the total work force.<br/>Subsequently, in December 31, 1995, out of about 400 staff, 95 were disengaged and in March 1999 out of 300 staff about 80 workers were disengaged.<br/>In almost all the instance of disengagement of workrs, the major reasons have been:-<br/>a. years of service: that is some workers may have reached the retiring age and service of 60 years and 35 years respectively.<br/>b. Inefficiency<br/>c. Redundancy<br/>d. Misconduct (French disloyalty etc)<br/>e. Poor health condition<br/>f. Over-staffing<br/>The above reasons shall be discussed in detail in chapter 2 of this research work.<br/>The problems of this research work will there fore be to find out of the above claimed reasons for disengagement of workers were the true reasons for the exercise or not a combination of other sets of behaviour by a worker and the criteria for selecting them.<br/>In addition, the researcher work will also be interest in finding out the effect of this be interest I finding out the effect of this exercise on the remaining workers in the corporation that is it there has been any noticeable change in productivity and in what direction. The researchers lens will also be focused on the effect of this exercise on the external environment.<br/>That is the people outside the organization, socially, economically and so on.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>The containing economic depression which Nigeria has been passing through for some years now has compelled citizens, industrial and business establishment big and small to take for reaching measures in the struggle for survival the economic depression such as:-<br/>1. The difficult and stringent conditionality, which Nigeria government must, met before a IMF loan is given.<br/>2. delay in passing the budget estimate in Nigeria.<br/>3. delay in given subvention to parastatal.<br/>The successive disengagement exercises currently taking place in Nigeria public service poses Economic and social problems.<br/>According to Websters winth new collegiate dictionary (1983:1007) Retrenchment is the act of cutting down expenses live more cheaply.<br/>While disengagement means to the (oneselt) from an engagment, to reduce amount of curtail expenses in order to elenomize, it could also be seen as the act of terminating the services of a worker, when the job ceases to exist, usually as a result of technology, political or economic changes. Disengagement, which is a recent-phenomenon in the history of public services in Nigeria started in the middle 70’s by then military Head of state as a result of economic recession during the period.<br/>According to Adebayo (1994:113) there was a general purge (in 1975) of the public services in which though the intention was lauclable, the execution left much to be desired. The good were thrown, out with the bad. Those who survived the hole cast were told that their advice would be sought it and when need and that their main task was to carry out orders handed down to them.<br/>It may not be an overstatement to say that most developing countries of the world including Nigeria has been going through a recession, but nevertheless the Nigeria case has been a very peculiar situation because it has resulted in many people losing their job. This could be seen in an editoral, agory of Retrenchment, by Agbese (1985:6-7) where in federal radio corporation of Nigeria Enugu zone, out of a total enable him give out his best in the achievement of the organization objectives.<br/>This research work will therefore proceed pragmatically on the above theory Y, taking cognizance of the fact that, no one suffering from a feeling o fear and depression can be expected to be efficient at his work (Adebayo 1994:115).</p> <p><strong>Research questions</strong><br/>1. Why were workers in federal radio corporation of Nigeria Enugu disengaged recently?<br/>2. what are the effects of this disengagement on the mrale and productivity of the workers in federal radio corporation of Nigeria Enugu.<br/>3. what are the possible social and economic consequences of disengagement?<br/>4. what alternative action would you have preferred to government take?</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES / PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Disengagement of workers is an event currently taking place throughout the country. It had reached its heights since th emilitary found themselves into the position of leadership in Nigeria. It is therefore the aim of this study to find out the effect this exercise has had on the morale of the still employed workforce.<br/>To this end, the researcher will find out amount other things:-<br/>a. Reasons for the disengagement of workers and the criteria in selecting who were to go.<br/>b. How workers feel and think about disengagement exercise.<br/>c. How disengagement affects their productivity and attitude to work, that is whether the exercise has made them work harder because of the fear of loosing their job and also it they feel alienated from jobs.<br/>d. Social and economic consequences of disengagement of workers.<br/>e. Prefer solutions to the findings other researcher.</p> <p><strong>1.4 THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>According to Iie (1999: 252) city Mc Gregary (1960:35-48), here developed two theories or assumption of human behaviours namely, theories X and Y theory.<br/>The basic assumptions of theory x are:-<br/>1. work, it not down right distasteful is an enormous there to be performed in order to survive.<br/>2. the average human being has an inhenent dislike of work and will avoid it he can.<br/>3. because of his characteristic dislike of work, most people must be coerced controlled, directed or treated with punishment to put forth adequate effort, towards the achievemtn of organizational objectives.<br/>4. the average human being prefers to be directed, wishes to avoid responsibility, has relatively little ambition, wants security above all.<br/>Theory Y<br/>The basic assumptions of theory Y are:-<br/>1. the expenditure of physical energy and mental effort in work is as natural as play or rest.<br/>2. external control and the threat of punishment are not the only, means for bringing about effort towards the achievement of organizations objectives. Man will exercise self direction self control in the service of objectives to which he is committed.<br/>3. commitment to objectives is a function of the rewards associated with their achievements.<br/>4. the average human being learns under proper condition not only to accept but seek responsibility.<br/>5. the capacity to exercise a relatively high degree of juvenility and creatively in the solution of organization problems is widely, not narrowly distributed in the population.<br/>6. under the conditions of modern title intellectual potentialities of the average human being are only partially utilized. According to Olewe et al 91994: 168) the level of performance of a worker is a function of his abilities and will. A workers ability determines how he can do the work, while will determines what he would do.<br/>When the will is positive, workers output would increase, but where it is negative, works’ performance level would be low.<br/>As a result of the above and in agreement with theory Y above. It is the opinion of the researcher that disengagement of workers should not be used as a deterrent to the still employed state as this could be counter productive an average human being needs to be motivated and assumed of the security of his job to the incessant frequent and unplanned disengagement (Lay-offs, management successions etc) of workers especially in Enugu zone of the federal radio corporation of Nigeria has in no small way militated against the achievement of the set goods of the corporation.<br/>The research is therefore, aimed at finding the effect of disengagement on the morale of the skill employed work force of the corporation. That is, if they felt threaten and their morale is high and they have become more productive because of the exercise.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>For quite some years now, disengagement of workers have been the order of day especially in the public service. It has reached a crises situation since the ministry take over of government in this country.<br/>The seriousness of this exercise has made the executive of the Nigerian Labour congress (NLC) to cry out on behalf of their members to the government, both federal and state to stop further disengaement of workers, because it is subjecting members of NLC to some very hard conditions and untold hard ship.<br/>It is based on the above premise that the research is being carried out. Hoping that through the resulting of this research, the true effect of disengagement would be known.<br/>However, where disengagement is done on the basis of in efficiency, redundancy etc. this work would emphasis the fact that employers do not always disengaged just to save cost or to come out of recession but also, that efficiency dedication and hard work. On the part of employee are rewarding.<br/>Finally, it is hoped that the research paper would be of help to others who would want to explore the more.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study will be limited to the federal Radio corporation of Nigeria, Enugu zone is a delimitation on its own since federal radio corporation of Nigeria has four zonal offices plus Abuja. The Headquarter, therefore the researcher has decided to restrict the scope of this study to the identification and making of recommendation on the problem of disengagement with emphasis on Enugu zone of the corporation located at Onitsha road, in the Northem part of the capital city of Enugu state.</p> <p><strong>1.7 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The effort made by the research to produce a befitting thesis have been punctuated by certain limitation which include:-<br/>a. SCARCE LITERATURE TO REVIEW<br/>The extent to which the research is carried out depends so much on the available data. Therefore for a research topic to be given adequate treatment, it requires sufficient theoretical frame work. Literature peculiar to disengagement of workers is scanty. So in most cases, the researcher has no alternative than to resort to the use of magazines, articles and journals for reviewing disengagement issues.<br/>However, the researcher ensured that problems being address and in the study were explored and found.<br/>b. FINANCE<br/>The present economic constraints in the country constituted a problem to the researcher as no research work can go well without fund. Because of the limited fund, this work has to be limited to federal radio corporation of Nigeria, Enugu zone.<br/>c. TIME<br/>Time constraint is another limitation encountered. The interval between the choosing of the project topic, the submission of the project etc and the preparation for the degree examination is very short, though they are indispensable activities. As a result of the above premise, the researcher had to contend with the problem of time to be able to strit a balance between other school curriculums and the research work.<br/>d. LITERACY LEVEL<br/>The general attitude of the worker to the research was poor and very appalling.<br/>Therefore another problem encounter was the literacy of the average Nigeria workers. This is because most Nigeria workers. This is because most Nigerian civil or public servant are not academically exposes enough, they were unappreciative of usefulness of a researcher work. They have the impression that the university students and their lecturers are always wasting their time on the researchers that are never used by anybody.</p> <p><strong>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>Will<br/>This may be referred to as the power of making a reasoned choice or decision or of controlling one’s own action (Olewe et al, 1994).<br/>OVER – STAFFING<br/>This is seen as a having too large of a staff. That is having too many people to do all the work that needs to be done in an organization.<br/>DISENGAGEMETN<br/>This has been seen as the act of cutting down expense in order to economic in other works. It could be seen as the act of reducing the number of people or workers in an organization in order to economize.<br/>MORALE<br/>This has been defined as the mented emotional condition of an individual or group with regard to the function or tasks at hand. Morale is a feeling some what related to espint due corps, enthusiasm or zeal (Olew et al 1994).<br/>MISCONDUCT<br/>This term mis conduct has been defined as improper or unprofessional behaviour of a person or group of people towards a task or assignment.<br/>INEFFICIENCY<br/>This is a state of being wasteful (of persons) wasting time, energy etc. in their work or duties, not producing an adequate results.</p> </div> </div>\n\nSTAFF DISENGAGEMENT AND ITS EFFECT ON THE MORALE OF WORKERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STAFF DISENGAGEMENT AND ITS EFFECT ON THE MORALE OF WORKERS", "id": 42}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY MARRIED FEMALE SECRETARIES IN PARASTATALS </p> <p>(A Case Study Of Enugu Urban)</p> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>This research work is aimed at determining the problems of married female secretaries in some parastatals in Enugu urban, Enugu State.

Some of these problems are inherent in the profession while others arise as a result of the workers attitude. The secretarial profession is not an exception to these problems. This study has been designed to look into the problems encountered by married female secretaries.<br/>According to the National Secretaries Association of United States of America, a secretary is an assistant to executive, possessing mastery of office skills and ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision, who display initiative, exercise judgment and make decision within the scope of her authority. From the above definition, secretaries are indispensable in business organization both small and large organizations. <br/>Unfortunately, the role of a secretary especially in Nigeria is not quite understood by most people. It therefore, follows that most of the problems confronting the secretarial profession are as a result of misconception by people. People don’t seem to understand what secretarial profession entails.<br/>Consequently, the married female secretaries in the profession always faced with numerous problems.<br/>The problems encountered by married female secretaries are numerous and are ranged from their homes, their jobs and from people with whom they work and transact business with. Other hurdles they faced are those bearing labels such as sexual harassment, job stress and office politics. The greatest conflicts which married female secretaries has to live within their day-to-day activities is marrying their official duties with their domestic affairs.<br/>In the same vain, married female secretaries also faced with some positive problems such as expecting them to exhibit a sense of responsibility show a sign of maturity, loyalty and reliability in the performance of their duties.<br/>A secretary is that person in an organization who deals with the correspondences, keeps accounts, keeps records and in addition, arranges appointments for her executives. The nature of secretarial work is such that a certain degree of confidence and rapport must exist between her and her boss and this may lead to a social suspicion in such a relationship and this may trigger matrimonial hassles.<br/>In the same vain, a secretary is required to have administrative ability to keep an office running smoothly, insight to assign priorities and judgment to know when to issue orders in the boss’s name. They conserve the boss’s time by screening telephone calls, visitors and the mail.<br/>Moreso, a secretary is that person who has undergone some training in secretarial courses and has acquired good speed in shorthand and typewriting and knowledge of secretarial duties, office practice and English language. In addition, she should have a full measure of common sense and unfailing memory.<br/>Furthermore, a personal assistant or secretary means any person that works for another in the company no matter what she does have. Secretary could be a typist or it could be a full blown personal assistant or administrative officer. No one can say that they are secretaries without doing certain tasks regardless of whether they have got the qualification or not.<br/>A senior executive in a large Syndey based company defined secretary as an “appendage” of the boss.<br/>The boss secretary relationship is the subject of rumour and gossip and a secretary may either save or destroy their bosses.<br/>Consequently, a word processing assistant portrayed as the extension of her boss loyal trustworthy and devoted. She is expected to have honour and obey, relieving her boss of the routine and the trial, creating the condition for his detachment from the mundane rituals of everyday life. She is the gate keeper, protecting her boss from those who would waste his time and went to know his private business, meditating his relationship with the outside world.<br/>In the same vein, a secretary is a kind of co-partner with the employer. It is the duty of a secretary to save the boss a great deal of detail and as much routine work as you can. Think for him and anticipate his needs, learn his preferences and obey them even if you do not always agree with his ideals. Assume that he is always right.<br/>She should be a person who is on the conservative side of dressing simple and neat. Secretaries are the center of attraction all the time in the office, for both the employer and the callers.<br/>Always be a person who save the management and create the pre-conditions for their bosses advancement. Most of the pressure of the job is in the sense of being close to the center of power, participating in decision making, having confidential knowledge, having power to act on behalf of the boss.<br/>When a person has successfully undergone training as a word processor, or secretary, such a person is then vested with some responsibilities like copying typed word production of official document like letters, news, reports, he or she also cleans and maintains the word processor as well as the general orderliness of the offices.</p> <p><strong>STATMEENT OF THE PROBLEM:<br/><br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The purpose of the study include:<br/>1. To identify the reasons why some employers prefer unmarried female secretaries?<br/>2. To find out whether the official duties of the married female secretaries prevent them from paying proper attention to their families.<br/>3. To find out whether the husbands of these secretaries interfere with their wives’ job. <br/>4. To find out whether marriage on the part of the female secretaries plays any part in the secretary/boss relationship.<br/>5. To find out whether unmarried female secretaries have more changes of advancement on the job than the married ones.<br/>6. To find out whether married female secretaries divulge official secrets.<br/>7. Finally, to offer suggestion on how a married female secretaries can successfully combine her official duties with her domestic affairs to avoid conflicts.</p> <p><strong>RESEACH QUESITON:</strong><br/>The study shall have a look into the following research questions;<br/>1. Do organizations consider marital status in their employment policy?<br/>2. Do married female secretaries have equal change of recognition with their unmarried female counterparts.<br/>3. Does the secretarial work expressly affect the private lives of married female secretaries?<br/>4. Are female secretaries treated as inferior to their male counterparts?<br/>5. do married female secretaries divulge official secrets.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:</strong><br/>The investigation will no doubt help both married and unmarried female secretaries to tackle their problems successfully.<br/>It will also help to allay the fears of those involving to go into the secretarial profession. This study will also offer more areas that students may wish to make further research of the problems encountered by the married female secretaries.<br/>This study will help to improve the chances of advancement of the female married secretaries.</p> <p><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY:</strong><br/>This study is designed to study some six parastatals in Enugu metropolis. <br/>In order to have a fair representation, the following have been randomly chosen:<br/>1. National Electric Power Authority<br/>2. Nigerian Telecommunication Limited<br/>3. Nigerian Postal Services<br/>4. (NCC) Nigerian Coal Corporation<br/>5. Nigeria Water Corporation<br/>6. Nigerian Railway Corporation <br/>7. Universal Trust Bank.</p> <p><strong>LIMITATIONS:</strong><br/>The problems of degenerating trend in the successful secretarial career is a very wide scope to cover.<br/>The researcher could not carry out the investigation on all the parastatals in Enugu urban and therefore limited her work to selected parastatals in Enugu urban.<br/>The main problem in carrying out this investigation to all parastatals, organizations in Enugu State is chiefly due to the high cost of transportation.<br/>Another factor worthy of mention was the difficulty encountered in finding married female secretaries who are actually qualified for this study.</p> </div> </div>\n\nPROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY MARRIED FEMALE SECRETARIES IN PARASTATALS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY MARRIED FEMALE SECRETARIES IN PARASTATALS", "id": 43}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>OCCUPATIONAL MOBILITY AND THE EFFECTS ON SECRETARIES OCCUPATIONAL PROSPECTS </p> <p>(A Case Study Of Some Selected Financial Institution In Enugu Urban)</p> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>This study examined the problems encountered by secretaries in some selected banks in Enugu metropolis.<br/>A total of eighty-eight questionnaires were administered to eighty-eight secretaries in these banks.

A secretary is one who besides possession of typewriting and shorthand skills is knowledgeable in management and organizational techniques. The secretary relies on her sill in dealing with people. Such skills are tact, discretion, courtesy, common sense, pleasant speaking ability and having a good memory, to mention but a few.<br/>It is a well know fact that every occupation carries some elements of risks usually referred to as occupational hazard. Secretaries are to be found in almost all business organizations worth that name. As is well known, the secretarial profession has come of a age in Nigeria. Secretarial courses are now being offered in all polytechnic in the country and in some reputable universities. The number of students offering the course seems to be growing from day-to-day for those working, the take home pay is relatively attractive. Everything seems to be going for the secretary, yet many secretaries express dissatisfactions with their lot in their work places and some I know have abandoned the profession for greener pastures.<br/>This study therefore is being carried out to find out the problems facing secretaries in their work paces and those impediments on their way to achieving full job satisfactions identification of those constraints will be a first step in seeking for solutions to the problems and this is the objective of the research.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>In every well organized business, the service of the secretarial personnel are highly needed. It is usually asserted that the success or failure of any organization largely depends on the role of the secretary plays in achieving the objectives of the organization.<br/>In this modern times, the secretarial profession has become very lucrative and attractive. This has led to an unprecedented influx into the profession. Despite this enviable position the secretarial profession appears to be bedeviled by some unidentified obstacles which may lead the secretary to resort to negative attitude towards their work and even leave their job for entirely different professions.<br/>It is the aim of this paper to find out those impediments, obstacles and pitfalls, which make many secretaries wish to leave this profession despite the attractive salaries usually offered to them. We will also seek to find possible solutions and proper recommendations that may stop these problems.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The purpose of this study are<br/>i. To find out the problems encountered by secretaries working in some selected establishments in Enugu metropolis<br/>ii. To find out the likely effects of those problems on the secretary’s performance on the job<br/>iii. To make suggestions and recommendations for improve of the lot of secretaries.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>1. Do secretaries in some selected establishment in Enugu metropolis encounter problems in their working place<br/>2. Do these problems detract them from their official performance<br/>3. What are these problems<br/>4. What are the likely solutions to these problems</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>It is envisaged that this study when completed will be immense benefit the secretaries working in some establishment to the management and the organization as a whole.<br/>Firstly, this study intends to identify the problems encountered by secretaries, which can inject negative attitude in them so that their employers will have cleaver pictures of these problems and devise ways of motivating their secretaries as to enhance productivity. The study will also be beneficial to managers in those organizations so that they will reveal what could be done to enhance the prospects of these secretaries.<br/>On the other hand, the study will be beneficial to the secretaries themselves in that, if the recommendations advanced in this study are adhered to, they will be better placed in the organization and their status enhanced. It will also serve as an inspiration to Nigeria secretaries to embrace the profession fully having known the already existing problems <br/>Finally, the research will provide up-to-date information on the secretarial profession.</p> <p><strong>1.6 DELIMITATION</strong><br/>This research is delimited to secretaries in some selected establishment in Enugu metropolis.

It is a process of setting objectives, organizing resources to attain these predetermined goals, and then evaluating the results for purpose of determining future actions.<br/>Hodgetts, (1990) said that management has for thousands of years been a key to success to individuals and civilizations alike.<br/>Labour is one of the factors of production and consists of all human energy expended in the production and distribution of goods and services.<br/>Nwachukwu (1988) opined that this definition includes all professional executives, all levels of employees and self employed people. According to the United States Bureau of census, the labour force includes all who are willing and able to work whether employed or self employed.<br/>Productivity is the achieved set objectives in firm by the workers. It is the output of what the input of workers yield productivity when increased, favours the firms because this means that the predetermined goals of firm are realized but when it is decreased the firm is at loss and this affects both management and labour in the context of this research work, management should be seen as owners of business, firms of categories of management who participate in the setting objectives of firms and in the decision making, those who take leadership positions in such firms. <br/>Labour in this work should be seen as those hired employees of a firm who takes directives from the management in carrying out their official duties, who have no hand in the decision and objective settings of the firm, who through the management gets done the work that should be done in order to achieve the set objectives.<br/>These two groups, management labour are the two major groups, that exist in firms where goods and services are produced. These two groups must be built up effectively and efficiently in any firm for a harmonious work flow between labour and management.<br/>Nwachukwu 91988) had to state that management must work harmoniously with employees and must therefore develop programmes and policies that will enable them to achieve the best results of the organizational goals, understands labour (Employees).<br/>Most often management labour are in conflicting objectives. This comes in because management will always want higher productivity with minimal costs while labour will want to achieve higher price for its members through the instrumentality of labour unions. The conflicting objectives between labour management always result in strike action which causes loss of man-hour which results in decreased productivity.<br/>The need to promote and improve good relationship between management cannot be over emphasized. In all managements, the management of human beings at work are the most complex. Management, therefore it needs to relate very well with labour in any firm like NITEL Plc. So that there will be no disruption to achieving the set objectives which will hinder productivity.<br/>When labour is not satisfied with its management or management not satisfied with its labour, there is always a bridge to harmonious working in the firm and productivity suffers.<br/>As a means of achieving industrial peace, high productivity and attainment of all organizational objectives, management should regard and treat labour as the greatest asset of the organization having their interest in mind and communicating them effectively.<br/>All the factors of production in firms are useless and cannot yield anything without human direction and effort.<br/>Labour should understand that employers would benefit and be happy if they should put in all their best to improve productivity and work towards that. They should see with the management in times of crisis in firms and maintain their loyalty with the management.<br/>Management should equally know that their effective communication to labour through the trade unions, their involving them in decision making, motivating them, setting up an effective leadership will help to promote relationship between the two groups and productivity will be on the increase.<br/>An aggrieved worker is usually depressed, has a suggesting or law morale and poor attitude to work which affects productivity.<br/>Thus, there is need for harmonious understanding between management labour in any firm in order not to allow the firm to run into chains of problems which hinders productivity and efficiency.<br/>This study therefore reviews the importance of good management labour relationship and its effects on productivity in a telecommunication firm hence NITEl Plc, Enugu as a case study.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>Many factors have been hindering the good relationship that should exist between management labour in many organizations which NITEL Plc is not an exception. This unhealthy relationship between management/labour has a force which hinders productivity which is the main goal of any oriented organization.<br/>The neglect of workers’ interest as revealed in certain behaviours by workers of NITEl Plc, Enugu was observed by the researcher.<br/>i. Employees may not be satisfied over the management’s attitude on the handling of performance appraisal system which is not taken into consideration in areas of training and promotion of staff.<br/>ii. It is not clear whether there is any motivational incentives for the staff of NITEL Plc who stand as the key officers of the firm and are more exposed to risks in the course of discharging their duties.<br/>iii. Ineffective trade union in NITEL Plc which does not represent the employees well in the management most often makes the workers feel that their interest is not protected by the trade union leaders on the management level.<br/>iv. Employees spend a valuable man-hour discussing manager’s behaviour as it affects them and this attitude is likely to affect productivity which is the key objectives of setting up a firm.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The purpose of this work is to identify how good management labour relations of NITEL Plc will help to bring to the knowledge of the management: specifically, the study seeks to investigate:<br/>1. The dissatisfied state of the workers over the handling of performance appraisal records as it concerns promotion and training of staff.<br/>2. The need for motivation in any firm especially as regards to the workers of NITEL Plc.<br/>3. The incompetent trade unionism in the firm which does not make a good representative of the workers.<br/>4. The need for good management labour relationship in a firm such as in NITEL Plc.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>This project work will be of immense benefit to NITEL management and also to other employers of labour, policy makes and those who want to get the desired result of setting up firms.<br/>On the side of employees both at NITEL or any other organization, the work will help them to realize that employers need their honesty and loyalty in discharging their duties. This will help them (employees) to reap the benefits of where they work because when an organizational goals are achieved.<br/>Furthermore this study will contribute to policy formulation that will provide checks on the interactions between management labour and creates an environment that will sustain established industrial harmony.<br/>When the finding of this study are implemented by government or any organization, they will improve the relationship between the management and labour which will create efficiency and effectiveness and high productivity at the working places. It will also help to maximize human resources as much man-hour would be utilized in production than in an endless confrontation and dialogue.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>This project work which uses NITEL Plc as the case study is carried out in NITEL Plc, Enugu, Enugu State.<br/>The researcher took time to study the type of relationship that exists between labour/management of NITEL Plc and the effect this has on productivity of the firm.</p> <p><strong>1.6 RESEARCH QUESTIONS </strong><br/>The following research questions will guide the study:<br/>1. Are the NITEL workers satisfied over the use of annual performance appraisal records by the management?<br/>2. Are there some motivational incentives for the staff of NITEL Plc?<br/>3. Does the performance of the trade union of NITEL Plc encourage or discourage workers?<br/>4. Does the management of NITEL relate well with its employees?</p> </div> </div>\n\nMANAGEMENT/LABOUR RELATIONS AND ITS EFFECTS ON PRODUCTIVITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MANAGEMENT/LABOUR RELATIONS AND ITS EFFECTS ON PRODUCTIVITY", "id": 45}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>FACTORS AFFECTING STUDENTS PERFORMANCE IN SHORTHAND </p> <p>(A Case Study Of Imt Enugu)</p> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>This study investigated the factors affecting students’ performance in shorthand, a case study of institute of management and technology (IMT) Enugu.

Then little consideration was giving to such factors as aptitude, interest and ability. Today, things have changed. One needs to choose an occupation, which will enable him to move forward for full development. This development was followed by the recognition of mechanical skill as being important role in business offices. Business executives and professionals were eager to use this devices in order to enhance business transaction. As such, shorthand had been invented in the past ages as a system of recording spoken language. Since it can be written rapidly, millions of people have used this system as a means of earning a livelihood, and today throughout the world, whenever accurate and immediate legible recording of spoken sound is required in particular and congresses, in business sector, court of justice and again in offices of every size and sort. This technical innovation later on led the invention of pitman’s shorthand by sir Isaac pitman in 1873and this has been the widely acceptable system of shorthand and happened to be his first edition followed by the second edition which appeared in 1840.also there was an invention of the viable typewriter in 1813 by Christopher Lethan soles and as these, this two skills were combined later and become useful in business world. In Nigeria, the uses of shorthand during the colonial period were run mainly by private schools. However, from 1960’s federal and state government began to establish staff training centers where among other business courses shorthand was thought. According to pitman, shorthand is an act of represent spoken sound with written signs while chamber dictionaries defined it as a method of swift writing using strokes and dots to show sound. The essence of its study or learning is to be able to write at a faster rate far beyond the maximum speed at which longhand (English language) can be written. It is by this means that proceeding; address and other information are recorded. Due to the importance of shorthand, most teachers of shorthand spend more time in teaching their students. The students are taught to grasp the rudiments of shorthand, which the principles are stated simply and briefly completed in sequence similar to their presentation. The consonants, the vowel, diphthong, trip hones, etc. The practice gives the students better foundation in their study of shorthand.<br/>On the other hand, the teachers in public commercial schools. Many times they rush the shorthand lesson without allowing the students to grasp the rudiment of it. This practice is not encouraging because it affected student’s performance in shorthand. <br/>The Nigeria society has a lot to gain and nothing to regret of by a full development of the knowledge in shorthand as course. A good system of education according to Sir Alex clergy (1963) “auris at admitting all children of an area and exposing them to a variety of practical, social intellectual experience and offering the greater possibility of adjusting educationally to meet the needs of individual.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>The general notion has been that shorthand is a difficult subject. Its difficult nature can only be compared with that of mathematics according to students’ belief.<br/>A good number of students believed that shorthand is beyond human comprehension and as a result of this attitude; many of them have lost interest in the studying of the course. <br/>Some student due to the previous fear they have for shorthand even before the dictation start, begin to shiver thereby putting their outlines wrongly and find it difficult to be able to transcribe well <br/>Taking cognizance of this negative attitude developed by students in this topic as a solution to his problem of poor performance in shorthand.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong><br/>Many students who opt do either secretarial studies or business education (secretarial option) finds the mastery of shorthand an obstacle to the realization of their education ambition.<br/>This research will focus on identifying the factor that influence students’ performance in shorthand. It will also find out the factor responsible for student believe that shorthand is a very difficult course, highlight some of these factors and also suggest some possible solutions. <br/>This approach will remove some fear that shorthand is for the never-do –wells. To also cushion the ideas that shorthand is a very difficult Subject. To encourage the students of the values gained after the completion of the Course. And also to find solutions to some fault in the teaching methods etc.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY.</strong><br/>This research work will be of a great advantage to the entire students of secretarial<br/>Studies to be aware of the factors that affect them in learning shorthand and produce adequate solution to these problems. <br/>It helps them to develop good attitude towards shorthand that help them in increasing their knowledge of the course in order to meet up. <br/>The result will be of benefit to business establishments especially those businesses that require the service of confidential secretaries. <br/>The researcher believes also that the study will help as an extra curriculum for planners, teachers and institutions of learning as well as examining bodies in future. Also teachers will benefit by adopting methods that will provide facilities to improve students’ performance.<br/>Furthermore, it will help shorthand writers mostly the beginners who are venturing into the unknown to get the basic principles and techniques behind this course. <br/>Finally, it is hoped that the society at large will enlightened the more of the importance of learning shorthand.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study is limited to one of the institutions of learning in Enugu metropolis- this institution of management and technology IMT Enugu and it emphasis on the negative factors affecting the student’s performance in shorthand. <br/>This investigation will also be limited to students of the department of Secretarial Administration IMT Enugu.</p> <p><strong>1.6 RESEARCH PROPOSITION</strong> In order to conduct this study, the following research question are formulate<br/>1. Why is shorthand a problem course offered by secretarial studies?<br/>2. Does background knowledge of English language contribute any quota to the learning of shorthand?<br/>3. Does student attitude, belief, interest orientation have any influence in the mastery of the subject.<br/>4. Does the method of teaching influence the understanding of shorthand?<br/>5. What measurers can be adopted to improve student mastery of shorthand?</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>SHORTHAND: This is the art of representing spoken words by character or signs.<br/>VOWELS: These are sounds produced when the mouth passage is left so open as not to course audible friction. When the mouth is left so open as not to cause audible friction. We have twelve (12) simple vowels<br/>DIPHTHONGS: These are two consecutive vowels pronounced in separate syllabus or separately pronounced.<br/>TRIPTHONGS: This refers to a small tick attached to a diphthong representing any vowel immediately following the diphthong. <br/>PERFORMANCE: This refers to the level of attainment of students in the art of learning shorthand.<br/>RATE: It refers to a value measured by its relation to some other amount.</p> </div> </div>\n\nFACTORS AFFECTING STUDENTS PERFORMANCE IN SHORTHAND<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FACTORS AFFECTING STUDENTS PERFORMANCE IN SHORTHAND", "id": 46}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> ROLE OF A SECRETARY IN OFFICE ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT <p>(A Case Study Of Ministry Of Finance Enugu)</p> </div> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>This topic is the role of and management with particular reference to the ministry of finance, Enugu.<br/>To carry out this study effectively. Five research questions were formulated. Due to the descriptive survey nature of this work both primary and secondary sources of data collection used. Data were got from the eighteen (18) senior and forty-two (42) junior secretaries that were selected form seven departments of the ministry used for the data collected the students cluster mean statistical tools were employed. The major findings of the study were.<br/>i. That secretaries performed such roles as information processing, storage and dissemination as well as assisting their bosses in administrative and personnel matters. <br/>ii. That there are various effort played by government in uplifting the states of secretaries in the employ.<br/>iii. That there are various factors militating against the effective functions in the ministry.<br/>iv. That secretaries are not paid enough remuneration for their roles in the organization <br/>v. That there are views on whether the modern facilities needed by the secretaries in the organization adequate.<br/>The researcher therefore recommended that:<br/>i. A board should be set up to look into the immediate problem of secretaries with a view towards resolving <br/>ii.

Hence any complex industrial society would rapidly come to a stand still if the office is not there. This an efficient organization must provide its management with efficient and sufficient information, planning control and financial services. <br/>It is limit to expenditure on administrative services. If every one were engaged in office work there would be imbalances between productive activities and administration. The correct balance must be struck between the resources devoted to directly to productive activities so as to sustain rapid economic development of that nation.<br/>Little Mill Standing ford and Appleby (1986) remarked that administration is that part of the management process concerned with the institution and carrying out of procedures by which the programme is held down and communicated the progress of activities is regulated and checked against target and plans.<br/>Essentially the purpose of the office is to provide services of communication and records. This can be amplified under five headings as follows receiving information recording information giving information arranging information and safeguarding of asset.<br/>Office can make only these vital contributions if there is both efficient office services by general management and department manager. ( that is the production manager, the marketing manager the secretary and others).<br/>Today the office is becoming such a complex place and more demanding that the executive finds it difficult to cope with the task. In other words she needs someone that would help her accomplish her tasks hence the need for a secretary. On the whole a secretary today is part and parcel of the executive and so is very indispensable. She is the person who assists the executive by displaying an export skill (imitative tact judgment and others) in performing her office function without close supervision by the executive. Thus she should posses the ability to relieve the executive of designated administrative detail when the need arises.<br/>The role of a secretary in office administration and management to a large extent depends on the type of office she work in the post occupied by the boss and her qualification (s). the secretary deals with the boss staff visitors and all paper works.<br/>This study is therefore an attempt to identify and analyze the role of a secretary in office administration management using ministry of finance, Enugu state as the reference point. <br/><br/><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong><br/>Secretaries play multiple roles in any organization. They are the life wire of establishment or business outfit. By virtue of their position and the performance of their job, there exists some imminent problem. Such problems are likely to influence the role of secretaries.<br/>1. Lack of respect and recognition to secretaries from employers of labour who look down on secretarial administration and regarded those who practice it as never-do-wells <br/>2. Inadequate modern equipment used by secretaries hinders their efficiency and effectiveness of their jobs.<br/>3. Secretaries are not apportioned to use or manipulate the required equipment</p> <p>necessary for their profession thereby making them not fit for their profession <br/>4. Secretaries are always regarded as a professional servant to the executive<br/>5. Some bosses use their secretaries as scope goat and dehumanize them <br/>before their visitors because such bosses see the secretaries as supporting staff who he believed cannot stand on their own <br/><br/><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The main purpose of this study is to identify the role of a secretary in office administration and management specifically the study intends to:<br/>1. Find out the role of secretaries in office administration and management <br/>2. Ascertain the played by government in uplifting the state of secretaries in their employ<br/>3. Determine the factors militating enough for their roles in their organization <br/>5. Find out if modern facilities needed by secretaries in organization adequate. <br/><br/><strong>1.4 SCOPE OR DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>The study delved into the role of secretaries in office administration and management. It focus mainly on the ministry of finance Enugu.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS </strong><br/>1. What are the roles of secretaries in office administration and management?<br/>2.To what extent have government at various tiers succeeded in uplifting the states of secretaries in their employ?<br/>3. What are the factors militating against the effective performance of the secretaries function in any organization <br/>4. To what extent have secretaries been remunerated for their role in their various organization?<br/>5. To what extent are the facilities needed by the secretaries in the organization adequate?</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>It is only when the result of any research is effectively used that the time and resources invested on it can be justified. Thus the result of this study would be of great importance for effective discharge of secretarial functions in all the office of ministry of finance. At least all the secretaries would be recognized hence their roles.<br/>Office administration and management is a crucial issue as no organization can function without a properly managed office. The result would extent to the public services and business houses all over the country, as the role of a secretary would be adequately known and discharge.<br/>This study would equally be of immense benefit to those students who whish to take secretarial administration as a profession.<br/>It is hoped that the result of this research would educate the general public as to who a secretary is and the importance attached to the profession. Equally it would educate the secretary in understanding more about herself her role prospects constraints and chosen profession.</p> </div> </div>\n\nROLE OF A SECRETARY IN OFFICE ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ROLE OF A SECRETARY IN OFFICE ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT", "id": 47}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> INVESTIGATION INTO THE CONSEQUENCES OF OFFICE TECHNOLOGIES IN SECRETARIAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM IN NIGERIAN POLYTECHNICS <p>(A Case Study Of Institute Of Management And Technology, Enugu)</p> </div> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>This study was carried out to discover the possible consequences posed by the office technologies in secretarial education curriculum in Nigeria Polytechnics.

This is because new machines, are threatening to take over the jobs performed by secretaries thereby making them face job hazard of redundancy, retirement and retrenchments and mass unemployment.<br/>Presently, Nigeria is undergoing technological revolutions just like any other developing country of the world. This technological advancement has actually revolutionized most office activities and procedures. Until recently, the study of secretarial educations programme in our polytechnics especially in Institute of Management and Technology (IMT), Enugu was based mainly on shorthand, typewriting and office practice. But the activities had greatly changed since supervision of the polytechnics by the NBTE.<br/>The task and activities these categories of workers in most offices and business circles have also increased tremendously because of the high office responsibilities expected of the secretary to now handle with little or not supervisions, the scope of the course they now cover before qualification, has also greatly increased.<br/>They now have to be trained and educated in too many courses and have to acquire more technical skills to be able to handle and manipulate the very modern office automated machines now inherent in most business offices. This will make them to be marketable and employable.<br/>Secretarial profession now has to battle with the skills of handling the electric typewriters, scanners, word processors, the facsimile (Fax) machines, the computer etc. Will enable her meet up with the increasing demand of collecting, processing, storing and disseminating information as and when urgently required unlike the era of manual typewriters and filing cabinets that waste time.<br/>It should be noted that these automatic high-technological machines cannot do everything or operate themselves without human aid, thus making the needs and quests for the professionals in the secretarial field necessary.<br/>The most current and implicating question in the minds of the present day secretarial studies educators and curriculum planners is what to do in order to keep pace with the new technological changes in secretarial office automated equipment. This is because the more knowledgeable the secretaries are in the use of these office automated equipment, the better prepared our country will be to develop technologically.<br/>Hence in the opinion of Kanu (1987), there must be positive attitude towards continuous up-dating of knowledge for everyone, especially the secretaries, if this age of technological advancement is to be acquired and improved advancement and inter-personnel skills developed.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong><br/>The incessant changes and advancements in office automation has given rise to an urgent and constant training of the employees who handle and operated these new machines. It should be realized that most of these new high technological equipment like the computers, which stole into the business offices throughout the world unnoticed are very expensive to acquire and maintain and no organization would like these all cost effective equipment to lie idle, waste or become obsolete within a short period simply because there is no capable hands or professional to handle them. Therefore, these technological changes therefore represent a very demanding implication on the secretarial education curriculum.<br/>Since a lot of office work is based on the basic knowledge of keyboarding and clerical skills, it becomes apparent that if secretarial education curriculum in out polytechnics is not reviewed, revisited and updated from time to time, to adequately take care of these technological changes, the products turned out with this curriculum might not be able to face challenges they are bound to meet when they are finally employed.<br/>If therefore, becomes apparent that those concerned with the training and education of secretaries in out polytechnics and other institutions of higher learning should always adjust their curriculum so as to catch up and stay afloat with the incessant technological changes and advancements. The problem then is how far have Polytechnic especially Institute of Management and Technology, Enugu been able to adjust its curriculum to reflect the current development? How far have they been able to purchase the required equipment necessary for the training of Secretaries? Do they have qualified personnel to handle these equipment? Are the students being adequately prepared for the business world/ These and many more are what they research is out to answer.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The main purpose of this research work is to:<br/>i. To find out the consequences of office technologies in secretarial education curriculum in I.M.T., Enugu.<br/>ii. Find out cause of frequent changes in educational curriculum especially that of secretarial education programme performance.<br/>iii. To ascertain whether these office technologies that are used in different offices today are available in the department of Secretarial Studies of Institute of Management and Technology (IMT), Enugu which is actively involved in the training of secretaries <br/>iv. Identify whether the curriculum planners recognized these consequences before going on the drawing board, especially as it concerns Secretarial Duties.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Technological development has taken a rather tremendous new dimension since the middle of this century. According to Ndubuisi (1981), since there is need to promote interest in more and advanced technology, provision should also be made for institution and Nation as a whole, curriculum planners and business world.<br/>By finding out the effects of consequences of office technology on the secretarial educations curriculum in our polytechnics especially the Institute of Management and Technology, Enugu all that are involved in the training of these category of professionals and the curriculum planners, will be able to adjust their curricula and course contents to suit the needs of the expanding technological business world. Their products, the students secretaries would then be prepared well enough to enter the new world of automated offices and still face squarely the challenges inherent in high technological environments without fear of retrenchment.<br/>The study will among other things, serve as a guide to the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) in determining these new trends that are destined to become an integral part of business studies and include same in the program/school syllabus.<br/>Finally, the country and the business parastatals will also benefit from this study since the school of business has been producing very proficient and marketable personnel that will stand the vigorous test of time through updated planned curricula, especially in this era of technological advancement.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>In order to obtain more purposeful and significant results from the data analysis, the following questions will be tested in the course of the study.<br/>a. What are the consequences of office technologies in the Secretarial Education Curriculum in Institute of Management and Technology (I.M.T), Enugu?<br/>b. Is the Institute prepared to meet up with the consequences in training students for today’s and future sophisticated technological office environment?<br/>c. What effect have the frequent changes in curriculum brought to the secretarial Studies Department?<br/>d. Being aware of the technological changes in the country do you think the frequent changes will have any effect in your career as secretaries?</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE/DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>As a result of the broad nature of secretarial education curriculum, the researcher limited this work to office technology aspect of the curriculum.<br/>However, the research will concentrate his research work on the Institute of Management and technology Enugu. It is within this precinct that this study is delimited.</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>Breeding unemployment Graduates:<br/>Training and turning-out of graduates who cannot be employed because they lack the required skills for handling and manipulating modern office machines and equipment.<br/>Curriculum:<br/>Subject/courses included in course of study like secretarial studies or taught in a particular school or college.<br/>Office Technologies:<br/>The application of the use of modern office machines and equipment in performing office tasks for quicker and greater productivity.<br/>Computer Literacy<br/>Being educated or enlightened on the uses, functions an operations of the electronic data processing machine called the computer which is capable of handling, processing, storing and retrieving information at the shortest possible time.<br/>Office Automation<br/>The use of different types/kinds of machines aided devices to work in an office in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the employed manpower.<br/>Technological Revolution<br/>Drastic change/shift from the use of old fashioned machine and equipment to the recently manufactured (modern) ones.<br/>Techniques<br/>Methods of getting things done.</p> </div> </div>\n\nINVESTIGATION INTO THE CONSEQUENCES OF OFFICE TECHNOLOGIES IN SECRETARIAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM IN NIGERIAN POLYTECHNICS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INVESTIGATION INTO THE CONSEQUENCES OF OFFICE TECHNOLOGIES IN SECRETARIAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM IN NIGERIAN POLYTECHNICS", "id": 48}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> FACTORS INFLUENCING STUDENTS PERFORMANCE IN SHORTHAND <p>(A Case Study Of Modern Ideal College Cmic Abakpa Nike Enugu)</p> </div> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>The study identifies many factors affecting students’ performance in shorthand, such as language teaching method, lecturers impact, students’ interest, technical factors and lack of dexterity (the ability to do something well); nervousness, emotional instability on the part of students, the payment of teachers’ salaries regularly and improvement on their conditions of service.<br/>The study shows the level of the effect of the factors on the students’ performance by comparing lecturers’ and students’ response to the question asked.<br/>It may be understood that shorthand is not exceptionally difficult.

Isaac Pitman spent more than fifty (50) years studying and improving on shorthand system. Other scholars and expert writers made their own contributions to improve shorthand. To many people throughout the world, shorthand system serves as a means of livelihood. It is used during meetings in the courts of Justice and other offices where fast recording is required.<br/>Kanu (1993) shorthand is a system of writing which is based on the science of phonetics that is related to articulated sounds2. It appears prominently in the curriculum of secondary/commercial schools. It has been considered as an important commercial subject on which business and management revolve in recent time. It is unique because it is the act of writing symbols that represent sounds. As a result of the importance of secretaries in the organization, the Federal Government has created more secondary and commercial schools.<br/>For sometime the Modern Ideal College (M.I.C) Abakpa – Nike has recorded a low rate of successful turnover of its students. Only very few of the students who were admitted in the school could be able to finish in the school because of shorthand. They saw the subject (shorthand) as a very, very hard subject. Also most of the students and house helps whom their madam’s mission is just to complete the agreement with the parents of their housemaids. Most of them do not give them enough time to read because the subject needs time to need constant study so that the person will learn it very well.<br/>Despite today’s technological development, shorthand is still being taught for both personal and vocational use. The former as a means of keeping one’s confidential matter in record form of security and safety from third party as well as for the sake of knowing it while the later is to earn a living in a world of work. Note that” in modern times, shorthand has been the tool of many men who rose to prominence. Presently, shorthand has assumed prominent in realization of this,<br/>“Shorthand is till very much in and demand in the business world; and this is because most business executives and top government<br/>Officials in Nigeria as well as other parts of the world are well aware of the need of a secretary with shorthand skill can save them time and money”.<br/>Skill subjects have peculiar characteristics that must be demonstrated by the learner. It only not emphasizes the psychomotor, but cognitive and effective domain since knowledge is a pre-requisite to acquiring skill. Talking about shorthand skill, Oladunjoye says “these people (business executive and government officials) are willing to pay high salaries for those with the skill3.<br/>From the above, undoubtedly, shorthand has become an important skill in the modern business world and will continue to occupy a prominent position getting information needed by management and clients recorded at a fast and accurate speed.<br/>If shorthand is a skill subject, it must be learned as a skill subject. Skill acquisition and autoimmunization is far more than intellectual exercise. Skills must be over learned to the point that they can be exercised when something else is uppermost in the situation of the learner – otherwise hen are not skill. Therefore,<br/>“The test of any skill is the ability to<br/>use it, not the knowledge a person<br/>may have about it. If a student knows how to form shorthand outlines correctly according to rule but cannot take dictation because he has not mastered shorthand”.<br/>Though, intellectualization is a basic for autoimmunization, the later is the goal skill course. Therefore, shorthand skill must skill be automatized and not intellectualized. The extent or level to which this should be has been established by various examination bodies and institutions of learning in consultation with the business community. Since shorthand has been in the Nigerian secondary school curriculum for sometimes the Royal Society of Arts (R.S.A) (now WAEC) NABTEB/NECO) and pitman professional bodies have been responsible for certification until some years back when polytechnics colleges of education and some courses in their curriculum and has been turning out graduates – NCE, ND, HND, B.SC, B.ED. etc. Despite the increase in number of schools now offering secretarial course, and renewed interest of students in enrolling for the programme, the performance rate has been encouraging. This was attested to by student taking shorthand examination from professional bodies who have been recording a high sounding failure rate.<br/>The same applies to full-time students in our institutions of learning. The need thus arises to identify the various factors that influence students. Performance in shorthand.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>From general observation, students perform poorly in shorthand.<br/>The reason for the poor performance could be classified into two factors could be classified into two factors.<br/>- Personal factors<br/>- Instructional factors<br/>(1) Personal factors: Some students are psychologically defeated right from day one in the department. This mostly occurs when students take to the course as a last resort. The general belief by such students is that they can never do well in the course. The major problem is not that the students have such psychological problems but how to cure them of such problem and this is one of the principal reasons for this study. Other problems that fall for this study. Other problems that fall under this category are the students’ inability to define their personal goals, lack of interest, lack of adequate writing materials, lack of concentration and poor hearing, and irregular attendance to shorthand lectures.<br/>(2) Instructional factor:- In most schooling offering secretarial courses, dearth of shorthand instructors which is a strong factor affecting the teaching of shorthand stands out. This being the case, performance is bound to be poor because most of the course may not be well informed or equipped academically to impart the required knowledge. And this confirms the saying that ?No education system can rise above the quality of its lecturers”. Therefore, it becomes a problem to train the trainer that should fill the vacuum created by the dearth of instructors.<br/>In additional to this there is the problem created by lack of instructional materials such as the recorded cassettes, and relevant textbooks. In most cases, students don’t regard this as vital instruments for good performance in shorthand where they are available.<br/>These and may other problems constitute the problems for this study<br/><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>(1) To find out the causes of students’ inability to conquer shorthand.<br/>(2) To find out students’ perception, that is the ability or factors affecting their performance in shorthand<br/>(3) To make recommendations based on the findings.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The importance of this study is to enable both students and the lecturers as well as the general public to be aware that shorthand is not difficult to comprehend, learn and teach. It is a skill that is easy to acquire if some adverse (unfavourable) factors are identified and well handled and treated.<br/>Consequently, the project work will help the students to identify their areas of weakness in the course and try to make immediate remediation, that is those lacking behind to cheer up. It will be helpful to all those who aspire closing desire) to attain high speed in the “wizard art” of pitman shorthand. This study will be helpful for all those who wish to work in all areas of human endeavour like:<br/>- Law offices, assembly offices, government offices and business offices<br/>The question here is to whom would the result of this study be useful? <br/>Of what value would the outcome (the result of an action) of the study be to the students, lecturers, institutions and the education system.<br/>It is hoped that the result of the study would enable the learner and those concerned with secretarial education, to know the various factor that flight against the good performance of students in shorthand. The result will also show the performance spread of model ideal college, Abakpa – Nike Enugu.<br/>The study will help the educational planners or educational administrators and secretarial lecturers to identify those factors that cause the problems that are falling shorthand students and as a result, equip them with the skills required to remedy it.</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>For the purpose of this study, the following questions were used:-<br/>1. Could poor background knowledge of English have any effect in the learning of shorthand?<br/>2. Could lack of training materials contribute to the problem of learning of shorthand?<br/>3. Why is shorthand the most problematic subject for these students?<br/>4. Do lecturers contribute to the problems of these students?<br/>5. are students performance being influenced by some factors<br/>6. Why are there mass failure in shorthand?<br/>7. What are the acceptable performance level expected of students of pre – ND, ND, HND, B.SC; and B.ED at the end of their course?<br/>8. Is shorthand really beyond human comprehension?<br/>9. How long does it take one to get mastery of shorthand?<br/>10. What are the most effective methods in the teaching of shorthand?<br/>11. What efforts have lecturers of shorthand in the institutions made to alleviate (to ease) students poor performance in shorthand?</p> <p><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>Shorthand:- This is defined as the art of representing spoken sound with written sign. It can be also defined as any method of writing that allows the individual to increase the speed of visual record of language.<br/>Personal: This refers to knowledge acquired for private and individual use only.<br/>Vocational: This refers to knowledge acquired with the aim of using it in the world of work in order to earn a living.<br/>Performance:- This refers to level of attainment of student in the art of learning shorthand.<br/>Practicing secretaries:- This refers to those individuals who earn their living through the application of skill they already acquired towards the economic growth of the country.<br/>Skill:- This refers to all activities that acquire control, physical movements to be made under guidance of the mind.<br/>Limitation:- Due to the fact that the researchers are faced with serious time and financial constraints, the study could not be extended to secondary and commercial and comprehensive schools. Again, due to logistic problems, ex-students of secretarial profession could not be located within the period the study covers.<br/>This notwithstanding, the findings of the study will be generalized to all institutions offering shorthand and all students and all students of shorthand in Nigeria.<br/>Delimitation:- The study is carried out among the students of modern ideal college, Abakpa – Nike, Enugu.<br/>The purpose is to determine the factors that are consulting their problems in shorthand?</p> </div> </div>\n\nFACTORS INFLUENCING STUDENTS PERFORMANCE IN SHORTHAND<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FACTORS INFLUENCING STUDENTS PERFORMANCE IN SHORTHAND", "id": 49}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES OF STUDENTS POOR ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE STUDY OF SECRETARIAL ADMINISTRATION IN TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS <p>(A case study of Enugu State)</p> </div> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>The purpose of carrying out this research was to investigate on the causes of students poor attitude towards the study of secretarial studies in tertiary institutions in Enugu state. In order to obtain the requires data, the researcher use some selected tertiary institutions in Enugu State with a total population of 610 respondents, 400 respondents were used as the sample size while instrument for data collection were questionnaire, text books and personal observation. Three research questions were formulated for the study.<br/>The findings showed that:<br/>Enough equipment were not provided for imparting of the course.<br/>The financial involvement of the course is very high.<br/>Most of the students were not properly, guided by guidance and counsellors before enrolling into the department.<br/>The researcher finally made some useful suggestions and recommendation on the provision of required equipment for department of secretarial studies, that Government should come to the aid of tertiary institutions that are running this course since the equipment are very expensive. The researcher also recommended that guidance and counsellor services should be given to the students before choosing their courses also that there must be good report between students and lectures. </div> <div>TABLE OF CONTENT</div> <div>Title Page <br/>Approval Page <br/>Dedication <br/>Abstract <br/>Acknowledgement <br/>Table Of Content<br/><br/><em><strong>Chapter One<br/>1.0 Introduction</strong></em><br/>1.1 Background Of The Study <br/>1.2 Statement Of Problem <br/>1.3 Purpose Of The Study <br/>1.4 Significance Of The Study <br/>1.5 Scope Of The Study <br/>1.6 Research Questions<br/><br/><em><strong>Chapter Two<br/>2.0 Literature Review </strong></em><br/>2.1 Definition An Historical Background Of A Secretary <br/>2.2 Distinguish Between A Secretary And Other Categories Of Clerical Staff<br/>2.3 Duties And Qualities Of A Secretary<br/>2.4 Difficulties Faced By A Secretary<br/>2.5 Derision Of A Secretary<br/>2.6 Motivation Factors Of Secretaries<br/>2.7 Provision Of Adequate Facilities Equipments<br/>2.8 Importance Of Guidance And Counseling Before Choosing A Career<br/>2.9 Summary Of Literature Reviewed  <p><strong><em>Chapter Three<br/>3.0 Research Design And Methodology</em></strong><br/>3.0.1 Research Method<br/>3.1 Design Of The Study<br/>3.2 Area Of The Study<br/>3.3 Population Of The Study<br/>3.4 Sampling Of The Study<br/>3.5 Sampling Techniques<br/>3.6 Discrimination Of The Instrument For Data Collection<br/>3.7 Validation Of Instruments<br/>3.8 Administration Of Instruments<br/>3.9 Techniques For Data Analysis</p> <p><strong><em>Chapter Four<br/>4.0 Presentation And Analysis Of Data</em></strong><br/>4.1 Testing Of Research Questions</p> <p><strong><em>Chapter Five<br/>5.0 Summary Of The Findings Conclusion, And Recommendation</em></strong><br/>5.1 Summary Of Findings<br/>5.2 Conclusion<br/>5.3 Recommendations<br/>5.4 Suggested Areas For Furthers Study<br/>5.5 Limitations Of The Study<br/>References<br/>Appendix<br/>Questionnaires</p> </div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY:</strong><br/>Secretarial studies, simply put, is education for secretaryship which includes the training necessary to develop secretarial skills. These skills include human relation skills e.g. writing and translating shorthand with typewriter, knowing how to operate typewriter both manual and electric and finally being a computer literate. All these sub-skills prepare one for the secretarial functions for which a good secretary must possess. Secretarial studies is also part of the business education which many scholars have written on the subject, all have seen it as education that equips the learner with the skills which they required for use in business offices.<br/>Secretarial studies is one of the most literate course one can offer among other related course. Those who successfully graduated from this course of study are always in terms of job opportunities.<br/>In Nigeria for example, the demand for secretary by various business concern are exhaustible. In the recent past, the secretary by virtue of the training, specialization and responsibility takes the position of an administration which is a step below that of a manager.<br/>At present, responsibility below on a secretary varies from one business concern to another and that is aspiring to the managerial post. All these are dependent on hand work, further training and experience.<br/>Even with the technological revolution in the office, the place of the secretary remains unthreatened. The secretary has unlimited career protests, she is sometimes referred to as a live-wire of an organization or office encyclopaedia among other befitting names.<br/>Secretaries receive adequate training to cope with versatility in an increasingly complex and automated modern office.<br/>But amidst all these available opportunities for the secretary, there has been a negative attitude among the present day students in studying the course in the tertiary institutions especially among the males. The scarcity of proficient secretaries has been remarkable in our developing economy.<br/>Over the years, the secretary has been misrepresented, misapprehended, and misinterpreted as well, with this ugly development, a lot of students aspiring to professionalise on the ever increasing demand of secretaries in our fast developing economy?<br/>Hence the dire need for the study, the “causes of students poor attitude towards the study of secretarial studies in tertiary institutions” with a view of finding out the problems and then solving them.<br/>Perhaps, the most crucial and challenging questions in the minds of secretarial administration educators is what to do in order to keep pace with technological change in the secretarial office equipment and not poor enrolment into the course.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS:</strong><br/>For quite sometime now, there has been a decline on the number of prospective school learners who offer secretarial studies in tertiary institutions.<br/>Moreover, a higher percentage of those who apply to read the course nowadays has been observed to be females.<br/>In another development, some students offering the course claimed that it was their inability to fit into other various prestigious discipline that made them to settle for the secretarial profession.<br/>This ugly development has continued as a matter of fact to be a source of worry to business educators and management of tertiary institutions that offer this course.<br/>It is however envisaged that if this situation continues unchecked, there will be a serious scarcity of efficient and proficient secretaries to man the various business offices spans up in every part of the country.<br/>In a similar development, some secretarial positions demand a masculine hand equally avoid all these feminish “leaves” prominent among the female secretaries.<br/>It has also been observed that some students do not receive guidance and counselling in order to know the importance of the course.<br/>It is in view of these enormous indispensable and challenging studies of the present day secretary that the researcher delved into the study in order to investigate, analyse the cause for students poor attitude towards the study of secretarial studies in tertiary institutions in Enugu State and this recommend valuable and lasting solutions too.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</strong><br/>1.

It gives the history of the circumstances surrounding the topic<br/>The internet has mad changes in almost all aspect of our lives as it plays important role in most of what we discuss today about access to distribution and retrieval of information. According to Cachage “Internet explorer” (2001) he declared that Internet explorers have high expectation of internet services which range from a simple desire to find something interesting (for no particular reason) to searching for useful information on a specific issue as a result of the great diversity and volume of information contained in he internet. Chen et al (1998) stated that internet can enable the user to have access to information on diverse and specific areas that can meet his needs.<br/>According to Paul (2002) he said that the internet which began in the 1960’s as a project of a few researcher has grown to be a commercial success with billions of dollars of annual decades into a mass developed within three decades into a mass medium that influences most or all domains of life from education to recreation, from business to medicine and from academic to politics. He notes further that today’s mega-trend and vision of the global village and globalization are based on and influenced by this technology. The influence of the internet allows all aspect of life. In developing as well as developed countries.<br/>Statistics show that the use of the internet has grown in the most urban area in Africa relatively rapidly in much the same way as the adoption of the mobile phone which followed shortly after. Jensen (1996) observed that over half of African countries have despite their poor telecommunications infrastructure developed some form o low-cost dial up store end e-mail service with a gateway to the internet – 33 of the 54 nations on continent as at 1996, that of these 20 countries have live internet cities. E listed these as Algeria, Angola, central African Republic, Benin, Cote d’ ivory, Madagascar, Mauritius, Morocco, Tanzania, Tunisia, Egypt, Senegal, Ghana, Uganda, Kenya, Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Mozambique and of course South Africa, which is among the top 20 countries on the internet when ranked by number of the internet nodes. He noted further that an additional eight countries had well advanced plans for establishing an internet node, namely Burkinafso, Botswana, Gabon, Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania, Guinea, Sierra Leone, as can be seen from the foregoing, Nigeria of which Delta state is part had no live internet public access services in her cities at that time<br/>At present every capital city and major towns in Nigeria have internet public access services. As indicated by 2002 status report on the Africa internet (1) as of mid-2002 the internet of dial-up internet subscribers was close to 1.7m in Africa, 20 percent up from the previous year mainly bolstered by growth in a few of the larger countries such as Egypt, South Africa, Morocco and Nigeria, that charred public access and the use of corporate networks is continuing to grow at greater rates than he number of dial-up users. The report further notes that there are now many thousands of cyber-café in the major cities of Nigeria run by small entrepreneur who are allowed by the regulator of provide VOIP services as part of the cyber-café license, which costs about $500 a year. These cyber-cafes are growing in number at the passing of each day.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong><br/>This means the reasons why the researcher have chosen to study a particular research. Cyber-café has variety of problems that affect them. It include<br/>a. High cost of internet connectivity<br/>b. Frequent/occasional loss of contact with internet service provider (ISP)<br/>c. Frequent electricity interruption<br/>d. The poor state of high telecommunication charges in Nigeria.<br/>e. High cost of maintaining equipment.<br/>HIGH COST OF INTERNET CONNECTIVITY<br/>Cyber-cafes have thus become very important in Nigeria, as the cost of having internet connectivity is so high that private individuals cannot afford it.<br/>However, some educational institution (especially tertiary institutions) corporate organization and business centers do have computer in the country – though except in a very few organization and some cyber-cafes, most of these computers are not connected to the internet. This is due to the high cost of connectivity.<br/>FREQUENT/OCCASSIONAL LOSS OF CONTACT WITH INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER (ISP)<br/>It is common place to experience loss of contact from internet service provider when one is using cyber-café. The loss of contact could last for a few second, minutes, hours or could last for a day to several days and is very discouraging hen it is experienced.<br/>FREQUENT ELECTRICITY INTERRUPTION.<br/>There are a number of circumstances which prevent cyber-café from offering more and better services in addition to internet access provision. From time to time electricity supply is interrupted in the country and this affects the provision of internet services by cyber-café<br/>POOR STATE OF AND HIGH TELECOMMUNICATION CHARGES IN NIGERIA<br/>Local telephone systems are very important for the widespread use of the internet but the Nigeria telecommunication limited (NITEL) current infrastructure has too low a capacity for the internet.<br/>In Nigeria communication technology development is restrained by NITEL the sole distributors of telecommunication services <br/>HIGH COST OF MAINTAINING EQUIPMENT<br/>Computer consultant is very important in cyber-café to help the customer who need assistance and to ensure that café runs smoothly.<br/>However, in Delta state consultant are scare in that it is difficult for the cyber-café to have or invite a good consultant for services when the equipment breakdown. Therefore any consultant in the cyber-café could get to service the equipment usually charge them very high.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong><br/>This means what exactly the researcher is ging to do. The researcher’s target which she set out to reach are as follows<br/>a. The main purpose of this study is to identify the problems of cyber-café in Delta state<br/>b. On the other hand, to find out if such problems exist<br/>c. To know the extent of these problems if they exist<br/>d. To suggest solutions where necessary<br/>e. To recommend actions to be taken to avoid problems of cyber-café in Delta state.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This mean the benefits to be derived from the study<br/>This study is significant to that its findings should enable stakeholders to know the current state of cyber-café in the state and then take steps to increase public access to the internet.<br/>It is also significant to relevant authorities to moderate the amount charged for internet connection so as to encourage people to establish internet cafes.<br/>The findings and recommendations would thus enable individuals and corporate bodies to put more efforts to set up more cyber-cafes, especially in the rural areas, to cater for the teaming population of the state.<br/>Its findings should enable students, business men and women, lecturers etc to know the existence, the importance of the internet and access to and use of the internet.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTION</strong><br/>These are questions posed by the researcher which will be help her find solution to the problems. It is the objectives of this study to know<br/>a. What are the causes of high cost of internet connectivity<br/>b. Why do cafes have occasional loss of contact with internet service provider<br/>c. How does electricity interruption affect the cafes<br/>d. What are the causes of poor state of and high telecommunication charges in Nigeria.<br/>e. What are the effect of high cost of maintaining equipment</p> <p><strong>1.6 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>CYBER-CAFÉ: This is a café from which people can access the internet. It is also a chartroom or can be called a business center.<br/>INTERNET: It is global network which anybody can hook onto. It is rich online sources of information from bulletin, boards electronics mail, exchange of audio/video, data to business transaction face to face discussion with any body in the world or distant relations and friends. <br/>INTERNET EXPLORER: This mean any person who uses internet for internet or enjoyment.</p> </div> </div>\n\nSURVEY OF PROBLEMS OF CYBERCAFÉ<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SURVEY OF PROBLEMS OF CYBERCAFÉ", "id": 51}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> SURVEY OF THE PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT OF A SECRETARY IN A DEPRESSED ECONOMY <p>(A Case Study Of Institute Of Management And Technology (Imt) Enugu)</p> </div> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>This research work aims at finding out the problems inherent in the training and development of secretaries in a depressed economy.<br/>The main purpose of this study is to survey these problems and find out management problems in the training and development of secretaries.<br/>The background of the study was discussed in chapter one.<br/>In the literature review the problems were outlined and discussed by many authors.<br/>The research instruments used consist of questionnaire and interview, the data analysis was presented in percentage form.<br/>From the findings, it was clear that management do not show interest in the training and development of secretaries and that secretaries are not adequately equipped with modern technological equipment.<br/>It was recommended that the management of the tertiary institutions should look into these problems and improve the conditions.</div> <div>TABLE OF CONTENT</div> <div>Contents <br/>Title Page<br/>Approval Page<br/>Dedication<br/>Acknowledgement<br/>Abstract<br/>Table Of Content<br/>List Of Tables  <p><strong><em>Chapter One<br/>1.0 Introduction </em></strong><br/>1.1 Background Of The Study <br/>1.2 Statement Of The Problem <br/>1.3 Purpose Of The Study <br/>1.4 Significance Of The Study <br/>1.5 Scope Of The Study <br/>1.6 Research Questions <br/>1.7 Definition Of Terms<br/><br/><em><strong>Chapter Two<br/>2.0 Literature Review </strong></em><br/>2.1 The Concept Of Training And Development Of A Secretary <br/>2.2 Training And Organizational Objectives <br/>2.3 Approaches To Training Programme <br/>2.4 Problems Inherent In Training And Development Of A Secretary <br/>2.5 Effects Of Untrained Secretaries In Tertiary Institutions <br/>2.6 Nigeria Depressed Economy <br/>2.7 Effort To Eliminate The Problems <br/>2.8 Summary Of Literature Review<br/><br/><em><strong>Chapter Three<br/>3.0 Research Methodology </strong></em><br/>3.1 Research Design <br/>3.2 Area Of Study<br/>3.3 Population Of The Study<br/>3.4 Instrument For Data Collection<br/>3.5 Validation Of The Research Instrument<br/>3.6 Reliability Of The Instrument<br/>3.7 Administration Of Instrument<br/>3.8 Methods Of Data Analysis</p> <p><strong><em>Chapter Four<br/>4.0 Presentation And Analysis Of Data</em></strong><br/>4.1 Administration Of Questionnaire<br/>4.2 Analysis Of Data According To Research Question<br/>4.3 Summary Of The Findings / Results</p> <p><strong><em>Chapter Five<br/>5.0 Discussion Of Findings / Results</em></strong><br/>5.1 Conclusion<br/>5.2 Recommendations<br/>5.3 Areas For Further Research <br/>5.4 Limitation Of The Study<br/>References </p> </div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>A secretary is an indispensable asset to any organization or institution. No tertiary institution whether government or private can in any way thrive in isolation of secretarial duties. The duties of a secretary in any tertiary institution is an inescapable practice or function. They play major role in both private and government tertiary institutions. Private and government tertiary institutions are found in Enugu metropolis Enugu occupied an enviable political and economic position in the history of Nigeria. It was the seat of government of the defunct east central state, old Anambra state and presently Enugu state or Nigeria.<br/>According to Austin (1998), a secretary is a person who has acquired the basic secretarial skill of shorthand and typewriting plus enough knowledge and practical experience in office work to be able to cope with filling simple office machine and reception duties.<br/>Secretaries are trained in tertiary institutions especially in polytechnics. Considering the special nature of secretarial courses, peculiar instrument or equipment are normally used in secretarial training. Lack of exposure to these special equipment makes a graduate of secretarial studies uncomfortable and unprepared to face squarely the challenges of the job and office automation as a result of technological advancement.<br/>Osuala (1999) agrees that a secretary has to grow with technology in order not to be displaced from the job. For secretaries job to be more efficiently and effectively done, government tertiary institutions should be training and developing their secretaries with the machine, like computer, word processor etc to enable their secretaries fit into the modern office. But the remains that most of the government tertiary institutions today lack some of the equipment needed in training and developing secretaries.<br/>Adeyonye (1990) said that ‘many government institutions no doubt consider the question of insufficient fund to be the main bottle-neck in training and developing secretaries’. Finance is of course, utterly important to success in business. Some tertiary institutions find it difficult to train their secretaries due to lack of fund. Another problem inherent in training and development of a secretary is in non-promotion of the secretary after undergoing an advancement training in secretarial duties.<br/>Osuala, (1999) agrees that the constraints to the training and development of a secretary became alarming and worrisome, with the depression in the Nigerian economy. Before the oil glut, the constraints were passable, but since then, petroleum was no longer attracting the anticipated revenue, the country’s external reserve became depleted, the local currency was devalued to an insignificant position, unemployment became pronounced with major reductions in social spending. Training and development of a secretary was not spared.<br/>Appraisal at the adequate time also frustrated secretarial training and development. Management fail to see the job of a secretary as the center wheel that turn any organization and that is the reason, some tertiary institutions especially the institute of management and technology, Enugu, finds it difficult to sent them on training.<br/>This research therefore is designed to set out as concisely as possible, the problems inherent in training and development of a secretary in tertiary institutions especially in the Institution of Management and Technology, Enugu, in a depressed economy.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>Effective secretarial training and development strategy should be comprehensive, future oriented, continuous and implementable with a formal framework.<br/>There appears to be a shortage or inadequacy of well trained secretaries to cope with the new trend of technological development in tertiary institutions. <br/>Moreover, there are less potential secretaries in tertiary institutions that have attained the required training and development considering the present technological development.<br/>Therefore, it is in the light of these observed inefficiencies that inspired the researcher to survey such problems that are encountered in the training and development of a secretary in tertiary institutions.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The major purpose of this study is to find out the problems inherent in the training and development of a secretary. Specifically, the study will<br/>1. Find out management problems in the training and development of secretaries.<br/>2. Ascertain problems secretaries encounter in undergoing training.<br/>3. Find out the effect of untrained secretaries in tertiary institutions.<br/>4. Identify the efforts the management have made to eliminate these problems.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The researcher believed that this study will be of great importance to secretaries and managers of tertiary institutions, for this will enable them to identify clearly the part to play in order to eradicate the problems inherent in training and development of secretaries.<br/>The study will help the administrations of higher institutions to see the areas which call for their attention and this will help promote inter-personnel relationship between the employers and their secretaries when their needs are supplied.<br/>Finally, the study will help future researchers in this field or related areas, as the information contained herein will be a reference point.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The researcher is centering mainly on the problems inherent in the training and development of a secretary in a depressed economy using the Institute of Management (IMT) Enugu as a case study.</p> <p><strong>1.6 RESEARCH QUESTION</strong><br/>1. What are the problems inherent in the training and development of a secretary?<br/>2. What are the management problems inherent in the course of training and development of their secretary?<br/>3. What are the effects of untrained secretaries in tertiary institutions?<br/>4. What are the efforts made by management to eradicate such problems?</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>In the course of this research, the following terms are frequently used and will be defined here, so as to help the reader to better appreciate and understand the relevance of this research work.<br/>SECRETARY: An executive assistant who possesses a mastery of skills, who demonstrates the ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision; who exercise initiative and judgement and who makes decisions within the scope of assigned authority.<br/>TRAINING: It is the systematic process of altering the behaviour of an employee to increase organizational goals.<br/>DEVELOPMENT: This deals with the activities undertaken to expose an employee to perform additional duties and assume position of importance in the organizational hierarchy.<br/>DEPRESSED ECONOMY: This is when the economy is not functioning at full capacity, that is, there is absence of balance between income, savings, investment and output.<br/>OFFICE EQUIPMENT: These equipment generally refer to all relevant and vital equipment used in business offices towards efficiency of its operation. Summarily, it includes al labour saving devices commonly used in an office, which goes by various identity, like office appliance, office machines etc.</p> </div> </div>\n\nSURVEY OF THE PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT OF A SECRETARY IN A DEPRESSED ECONOMY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SURVEY OF THE PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT OF A SECRETARY IN A DEPRESSED ECONOMY", "id": 52}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> IMPACT OF SECRETARIES IN IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF SERVICES IN GOVERNMENT PARASTATALS <p>(A Case Study Of Nepa Enugu)</p> </div> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>Generally, our society today tends to misunderstand who a secretary is and his impact in improving the quality of services rendered by both government parastatals and private sector.<br/>As a result secretaries are looked upon and neglected because the society assume that their duties goes beyond typing and writing shorthand.<br/>In this project, the researcher aims at finding and investigating their impact in improving the qualities of services rendered by government parastatals and find out what hinders them from performing effective functions. And that both public and private sectors can perform without effective secretary.<br/>During data collection, the study was restricted to only one government parastatal (NEPA) where questionnaires was administered to confidential and general secretaries selected at random and numbering thirty (30).<br/>Analysis of their responds shows that secretaries contributes a lot in improving the quality of services rendered by government parastatals so that researcher concluded by recommending that secretaries should be cared for, be encouraged and remunerated in form of training to enable them advance in their career.</div> <div>TABLE OF CONTENT</div> <div>Title Page <br/>Approval Page <br/>Dedication <br/>Acknowledgement <br/>Table Of Content <br/>List Of Table <br/>Abstracts  <p><em><strong>Chapter One<br/>1.0 Introduction </strong></em><br/>1.1 Background Of The Study <br/>1.2 Statement Of The Problem <br/>1.3 The Objective Of The Study <br/>1.4 Significance Of The Study <br/>1.5 Limitation Of The Study <br/>1.6 Research Question <br/>1.7 Definition Of Terms</p> <p><em><strong>Chapter Two <br/>2.0 Review Of Related Literature </strong></em><br/>2.1 Definition Of The Secretary <br/>2.2 What A Government Parastatals Is <br/>2.3 The Impact Of Secretaries In Improving The Quality Of Services. <br/>2.4 The Peculiar Problems Secretaries Encounter <br/>2.5 Difference Between A Secretary And A Typist <br/>2.6 Summary Of Related Literature</p> <p><em><strong>Chapter Three<br/>3.0 Methodology </strong></em><br/>3.1 Research Design <br/>3.2 Area Of Study <br/>3.3 Population Of The Study <br/>3.4 Sample And Sampling Techniques <br/>3.5 Instrument For Data Collections <br/>3.6 Validation Of Instrument <br/>3.7 Reliability Of The Instrument <br/>3.8 Method Of Data Collection <br/>3.9 Method Of Data Analysis</p> <p><em><strong>Chapter Four <br/>4.0 Data Presentation And Result </strong></em><br/>4.1 Summary Of Results.</p> <em><strong>Chapter Five <br/>5.0 Discussion, Implication And Recommendation </strong></em><br/>5.1 Discussion Of Results <br/>5.2 Conclusions <br/>5.3 Implication Of The Result <br/>5.4 Recommendation <br/>5.5 Suggestions For Further Study <br/>5.6 Limitations Of The Study <br/>References <br/>Appendix </div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Government owned parastatals are those created in order to carry out special tasks for the welfare of its citizens. These types of tasks cannot be carried out by private individuals or people due to the nature of the financial involvement and the effectiveness of its services. They are nonprofit oriented, since their aim is not to maximize profit, it is sub-divided into two viz:- federal and state owned parastatals. Federal owned parastatals. Federal owned parastatals are those owned by the federal government. Some of the federal government owned parastatals are: National Electric Power Authority (NEPA), Nigeria Telecommunications Limited (NITEL), Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA), Nigeria Postal Services PLC (NIPOST), Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC), Nigeria Teaching Hospital (NTH), Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN), Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) etc State owned parastatals are those owned by the state government. Some of the state government owned parastatals are: Enugu State Broadcasting Service (ESBS), Enugu State Water Corporation, Enugu State Schools, and State Hospitals etc.<br/>Their responsibilities – NEPA are responsible for the generation and distribution of power. NITEL are responsible for Telephones, Telex, Telefax, installation and servicing. NIPOST are incharge of postal services, telegram, overseas mails and parcels. Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) are incharge of transport by train Nigeria Airways Corporation (NAC) are in charge of transport by air or plane. Nigeria Broadcasting Corporations (NBC) are responsible for radio and Television broadcast services. Water Corporations are responsible for treatment and distribution of water to the people. Hospitals are in charge of treating the sick and immunization.<br/>These government parastatals are only established and run by the government to ensure equitable distribution of its services to the generality of people, for it the parastatals are left in the hand of private sectors or individuals, they may tend to politicize it, thereby distorting the assumed equitable services or equitable distribution services or equitable distribution rendered.<br/>According to Akande (1999) government parastatals or public corporation means business organizations that come into existence through appropriate enabling Acts of parliament, Decrees or Edicts in a particular country or state. They may be commercially oriented or public service oriented. Most of them have been commercially oriented in Nigeria in recent time.<br/>Its characteristic features are:<br/>(i) They are usually state or federal owned.<br/>(ii) They are established purposely to render public services.<br/>(iii) Over-reliance on government subventions survive.<br/>According to any Anyanwuochi (2002) Public Corporations are sometimes called state enterprises. In a mixed economy, public corporations involve economic activities undertaken by the state. They form what we normally refer to as the public sector. Although, they are operated on commercial basis, the intention behind their establishment is for the benedict of the members of the public. They are not usually established to maximize profit although, in some cases they are expected to at least break-even. Through these parastatals the government now provides the services which could have been too expensive and unprofitable for private sectors.<br/>Besides, the word secretary is one of the most misunderstood concepts in contemporary life. Almost any body who involves him or herself in skill jobs such as typing, writing of shorthand is been referred to as secretary. But secretary in this case is a person who have been trained for this noble profession and equally have work experience as a secretary, people do not know the importance of secretary in those government owned parastatals. Secretaries are the life wire of every business organizations. They are the keeper of secrets, public relations experts, handling of mails and correspondences, a staff assistant and boss’s office memory, meeting organizers etc. They are the representative of their organizations and their employers gives good human relations in working with the employees in the organizations.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>The government of any nation has the legitimate responsibility of providing certain essential services for the welfare of all individuals governed by that nation, sometimes, government hijacks the provision of certain essential services which, if left to the hands of private sector would led to out right exploitation of the masses, thus the rationale for the establishment of certain government owned parastatals would be achieved. These government parastatals are known to have been rendering certain services to people. At times, the quality of these services are proved by people and some other times, the quality of their services are also condemned because of their healthiness. The problem is that it has not been known whether secretaries in those government prarastatals within. Enugu urban do contribute at all towards the improvement of the quality of services which their organizations render to the public. It has also not been known how well the management of those government owned parastatals appreciate the duties of secretaries.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The purpose of this study is to:-<br/>i. Investigate the impact of secretaries in improving the quality of services rendered by government parastatals.<br/>ii. Find out, the peculiar problems secretaries encounter in government parastatals.<br/>iii. Find out the extent a secretary’s job is evaluated in an organization.<br/>iv. Ascertain certain obstacles that hinder a secretary from performing his or her functions effectively.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The importance of this study will be of immense benefit to NEPA management and also to other employer of labour, policy makers and those who want to achieve the desired goal in setting up organizations. On the other hand, both of NEPA or an other organization need mostly the services of secretaries before the organizational goal can be achieved.<br/>Furthermore, this study will contribute to the understanding of the word secretaries and even lead to upgrading them, when the findings of this project are implemented secretaries then render effective services to government parastatals in Enugu urban.</p> <p><strong>1.5 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study is limited to only the impact of secretaries in improving the quality of services in government parastatals with particular reference to NEPA District Headquarters, Enugu. The researcher took time to study how secretaries make handsome contributions towards the growth and survival of NEPA.</p> <p><strong>1.6 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>The following research questions will guide and direct the study:<br/>1. What are the impact of secretaries on improving the quality of services rendered by government parastatals in Enugu Urban 2.<br/>2. What are the peculiar problems that secretaries in government prarastatals encounters.<br/>3. To what extent are secretary’s job evaluated in an organization?<br/>4. What are the obstacles that hinder a secretary from performing his or her functions effectively?</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>Secretary means one who is next to the executive, knowing the office skills, being able to assume responsibilities and execute his or her work without much supervision.<br/>Typist means a junior staff in an organization. The main duty of a typist is to type documents from the manuscripts and to the clerical work.<br/>Stemographer means a skilled worker who combines the skill of shorthand-writing and that of typewriting.<br/>Public co-operations is defined as an organized commercial undertakings which possess characteristics, such as being wholly owned by the state and being created by a special law incorporating them and defining their powers and duties.</p> </div> </div>\n\nIMPACT OF SECRETARIES IN IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF SERVICES IN GOVERNMENT PARASTATALS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF SECRETARIES IN IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF SERVICES IN GOVERNMENT PARASTATALS", "id": 53}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING THE FUNCTIONALITIES OF IN-SERVICE TRAINING OF SECRETARIES IN MODERN BUSINESS ORGANIZATION <p>(A Case Study Of Enugu State)</p> </div> <div>ABSTRACT</div> <div>The importance of training both old and new employees in an organization particularly in modern business organizations cannot be over emphasized. It is eviolent that new jobs usually required training in new skill.<br/>The fact that in service training helps to eliminate the numerous problems faced by old employees in coping with the new technological trends is self evialent <br/>In addition the motivation of employees who have just been used or promoted is likely high. Though training may become more problematic when it involves experience employees who require additional training to enhance their performance. The training needs of such employees are not always easy to determine, even when determined the individuals involved may resent being asked to change their established way of doing their jobs.<br/>The purpose of in service training is usually to achieve some set goals, which will be beneficiary to both the individuals and the organizations. This training is usually mapped out mainly for people already in service and it is geared towards improving their abilities in their jobs.</div> <div>TABLE OF CONTENT</div> <div>Title Page<br/>Approval Page<br/>Dedication<br/>Acknowledgement<br/>Abstract<br/>List Of Table<br/>Table Of Content<br/><br/><em><strong>Chapter One<br/>1.0 Introduction</strong></em><br/>1.1 Background Of The Study<br/>1.2 Statement Of Problems<br/>1.3 Purpose Of Study<br/>1.4 Research Questions<br/>1.5 Delimitation Of The Study<br/>1.6 Significance Of The Study  <p><strong><em>Chapter Two<br/>2.0 Literature Review</em></strong><br/>2.1 Concept Of In-Service Training<br/>2.2 Relevance Of Training<br/>2.3 Strategies For Improving The Functionalities Of In Service Training Of Secretaries.<br/>2.4 The Need For In Service Training<br/>2.5 Types Of In Service Training<br/>2.6 Planning Of In Service Programme<br/>2.7 The Focus Of In Service Training<br/>2.8 Importance Of In Service Training.<br/>2.9 Summary Of Related Literature</p> <p><strong><em>Chapter Three<br/>3.0 Research Methodology</em></strong><br/>3.1 Design Of The Study<br/>3.2 Area For The Study<br/>3.3 Population For The Study<br/>3.4 Sample And Sampling Procedure<br/>3.5 Instrument For Data Collection<br/>3.6 Validity Of The Instrument<br/>3.7 Reliability Of The Instrument<br/>3.8 Method Of Data Collection<br/>3.9 Method Of Data Analysis</p> <p><strong><em>Chapter Four<br/>4.0 Data Presentation And Result Of Findings</em></strong></p> <p><em><strong>Chapter Five<br/>5.0 Summary, Discussion And Recommendation</strong></em><br/>5.1 Research Findings<br/>5.2 Discussion Of Findings<br/>5.3 Summary<br/>5.4 Conclusion<br/>5.5 Recommendation<br/>5.6 Suggestion For Further Study<br/>5.7 Limitations Of The Study<br/>Appendices I<br/>References</p> </div> <div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div> <div> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>In introduction topic a survey of the strategies for improving the functionalities of ins service training of secretaries in a modern business organization in Enugu state, we must first understand when in-service training is all about.<br/>There are many definition of in service training but I will highlight on just a few in order to see ways of improving its functionalities for a modern secretary.<br/>Otto and Sender (1964) stated that in service training is a continued education of person while they are in service.<br/>Hass (1964) stated that in service training include all activities engaged by professional personnel during service and designed to contribute to professional improvement.<br/>Dillon Peterson (1981) defines in service training and professional growth for individuals within a respectful, supportive, positive organizational climate having as its ultimate aim to better learning. Having seen the definitions of in service training, ,let us consider the strategies of improving its functionalities. <br/>The aim of in service training for the secretaries being to help them overcome many challenges posed to them by the modern technologies such as computers, fax machines, word processors etc. to now improve the functionalities of this training for secretaries it becomes imperative to train them in the use of these equipment to enhance their productivity and efficiency<br/>To also improve on the functionalities of in service training for secretaries in a modern business organization, such must be well articulated and well designed toward personal and organizational goals.<br/>According to Wyn Reilay (1979) he said that there are two schools of thought as to the extent the design and running of their services we are more interested in the second school of thought which agrees that trainees should participate in determining what should constitute an in service training for them. For it helps to develop a sense of responsibilities.<br/>Granti8ng study leave instead of on the job training will improve the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in no small measures, in that they will have enough time to consulate on the training and also remove stress which will not help in the training.<br/>Attachment of incentives like promotion, monetary reward etc, can as well enhance the functionalities of in service training of secretaries. The type of personnel assigned to conduct the training will equally in no small measure improve the functionalities of this training, seeing that in service training si a two way course that really involves a trainee and a tutor. How the tutor handles the course will go a long way to arouse the interest and dedication of the trainees. Using qualified personnel will in turn bring in new motivation, fresh insights, whose teaching techniques is based on many years if experience will impact and improve the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in a modern business organization in Enugu sate. <br/>A good communicator is e1qually a great asset to this course of study.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>The inability of employers to send their staffs for in service training posses a lot of problem and pulls down efficiency and productivity.<br/>Most modern business organizations in Enugu state lack qualified secretaries. They employ secondary school leavers as secretaries, when they don’t even know who a secretary is not to talk of what her duties are. There in experience and lack of training posses a great problem as to what assets of training to give them. <br/>The establishment of staff development and distant education for staff training is one thing but lack of facilities,, non chalet attitude of employers and lack of funds are militating against the up-liftment of such projects like in service training of secretaries.<br/>Some of these employers lack adequate knowledge as to how in service training can really improve their workers and in turn bring about greater productivity and efficiency <br/>Selfishness and greediness is another problem facing the improvement of the functionalities of in service training og secretaries in modern business organizations in Enugu state in that over use these secretaries and at the same time pay them very little amount of money as salary, which makes it difficult for such secretaries to go for in service training and when the attempt to attend one is usually not a very qualitative one and the result is usually learning little of nothing at all.<br/>These days, people are mainly interested in the acquiring of certificates and not really on skill acquisition of learning what they are suppose to learn. In this situation, such secretaries will inevitably receives what they have asked for which is inadequate training.<br/>Considering the above background, the study therefore, awareness should be created in the need for improved functionality of in service training of secretaries in modern business organizations in Enugu state, to be able to promote efficiency and increase productivity.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF STHE STUDY</strong><br/>The study is therefore designed to <br/>1. Examine the literature on in service training of secretaries with the intension of improving the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organization in Enugu state.<br/>2. Determine if secretaries in modern business organization in Enugu state are given adequate training<br/>3. Determine the need for improving the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organizations in Enugu state,.<br/>4. Create awareness on the needs of employing qualified secretaries and on he need of sending them for an improved in service training.<br/>5. Offer immediate and long term suggestion for the improvement of the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organizations.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>This study will seek to answer the following questions\\<br/>1. What literature can be examined to improve the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organizations in Enugu state<br/>2. How far are secretaries in modern business organization given adequate training<br/>3. To what extent is the need to improve the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organization in Enugu state.<br/>4. What level of awareness is to be created in the needs of employing qualified hands in modern business organizations and on the need of sending them for an improved in service training programmes.<br/>5. What immediate and long term suggestion should be offered for the improvement of the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organizations in Enugu state.<br/><br/><strong>1.5 DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study limits itself only to determining the strategies of improving the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in a modern business organization in Enugu state. It is noy the intention of this study to extend into examining the strategies of improving the functionalities of the in service training of other group of workers, though references will be made (in passing ) when necessary and for clarity purposes.<br/>In the same vein, this research does not intend to study the strategies of improving the functionalities of in service training of workers outside Enugu state, but that of a modern business organization in Enugu state.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study is significant for the following reasons <br/>1. It will go a long way in helping to create the necessary awareness required of employers in achieving an improved in service training of their secretaries, for an improved functionalities of these secretaries. Thee by making them more productive and deficient in their jobs to the benefit of the employers and to their joy and satisfaction.<br/>2. It will help build the desire for self development as the secretaries are provided with the opportunity of self evaluation, which will in-turn move them to strive for greater competence in their job to the benefits of the employers.<br/>3. This study will serve as a guide and also as a motivational tool for both the secretaries and the employers of labor in modern business organization in Enugu state.<br/>4. This will help the Nigerian labor congress to put-up a common front and fight against mediocrity in the employment and training (in service) of the secretaries in modern business organizations in Enugu state, thereby creating job opportunities for qualified secretaries and creating good ground for qualitative and improved in service training of same. <br/>5. The study is significant in that it will help our policy makers take into account the strategies of improving the functionalities of in service training of secretaries in modern business organizations ion the state, thereby formulating development plans to favor them. The policy makers can even go to the point of making a uniform and standard rule on how the in service training of secretaries in modern business organizations in the state should be carried out. This in turn will put the secretaries in the lime-light and also make for their better utilization <br/>6. It will take away redundancy and make the secretaries feel fulfilled. </p> </div> </div>\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING THE FUNCTIONALITIES OF IN-SERVICE TRAINING OF SECRETARIES IN MODERN BUSINESS ORGANIZATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING THE FUNCTIONALITIES OF IN-SERVICE TRAINING OF SECRETARIES IN MODERN BUSINESS ORGANIZATION", "id": 54}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CAREER PROSPECTS OF </strong><strong>CONFIDENTIAL SECRETARY IN A </strong><strong>PUBLIC ESTABLISHMENT</strong> <strong>(A CASE STUDY OF OSUN STATE POLYTECHNIC, IRE</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong><br/><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY </strong><br/><strong>1.0       Introduction </strong><br/>Secretaries can be founding many areas of employment such as government establishment, industries, commerce, charity organizations and are services of all these, it is perhaps industry which has most to gain by employing the best secretaries and most at loss in employing poor ones. <br/>In the recent time government establishments have seen many changes. One aspect of this change is the increased foreign competition brought about such things as improved freight facilities. <br/>Another significant factor in public establishment has been the extensive use of computer systems which has to reduction in routine paper work. These two elements have combined together to heighten the rivalry between business organizations. Each wants to excel at the expense of its problems which have to be financed by fever and better staff within the organizations concerned. A careful selection process is possible for each vacancy advertised; there is a wealth of suitable applicant. <br/>The secretary, like the chameleon has to adapt to her surroundings, she has to master new skills such as operating word processors and computers. Telex and electronic mall have becomes part of everyday life for her and the business letter does not occupy as much of her days as it used to be in the past. The secretary today is finding less of her time being spent behind the typewriter and more time being spent attending to other aspects of her work.</p> <p><strong>Historical Background Information of Osun State Polytechnic, Iree.  </strong>  <br/>This history of Osun State Polytechnic, Iree dated back to 1981 when the campus was one of the four satellite campuses of the polytechnic, Ibadan Following the creation of Osun State in August 1991, it became necessary for the new state to have her own Polytechnic. Government therefore decided to establish Osun State Polytechnic, Iree in the state to cater for the educational needs of the citizens. <br/>The bill establishing Osun State Polytechnic, Iree was assented to by the first Executive Governor of Osun State, Alhaji Isiaka Adetunji Adeleke on 12th October, 1992. by that act of Government, Osun State Polytechnic, Iree became a successor to the Iree satellite erstwhile campus of the Polytechnic, Ibadan. Similarly Osun State College of Technology Esa-Oke was established as a successor to the Esa-Oke satellite campus. <br/>The state had a mission for the institutions. The mission was to rationalized the courses between the two sister institutions with orientation towards commerce. Science and Technology at Iree while Esa-Oke was marked for Engineering and Environmental Studies.    <br/>However, in view of the advice given by the NBTE that Polytechnic should offer core courses in Engineering, the vision is being revised along that line, plans are therefore in the pipe-line to introduce engineering and environmental studies, at Iree viz: - Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Engineering. <br/>The institution has an imposing library block which serves the academic interest of both staff and students. It keep a fairly sizable number of books for it’s and reading public. Plans are underway to increase its book stock and services particularly in the areas of provision of photocopy services, photographic services and audio visuals. <br/>The institution also has a health centre where staff and students receive medical care. However, serious cases are referred to hospitals at Iree, Ikirun and Osogbo. The works and the services department located near the institutional structure and equipment and provide municipal services e.g. water, electricity etc to staff and students. <br/>With this humble and beginning, management will appreciate the contributions and sacrifices of all staff, students, and the general public at large to an orderly and progressive of development of this young institution. <br/>The environment provides adequate challenges to all concerned and it is our hope that we would all been working together for cooperation, understanding to build osun State Polytechnic, Iree into enviable edifice.  </p> <p><strong>1.1       Statement of the Problem </strong><br/>The problem of the study is to determine:</p> <ol><li>The promotion prospects of the secretary in a public establishment.</li> <li>The training prospects of the secretary in a public establishment.</li> <li>The occupational mobility prospects of the secretary in a public establishment.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.2       Research Questions </strong><br/>1.         What are the promotion prospects of the secretary of a public establishments? <br/>2.         What are the training prospects of the secretary in a public establishment? <br/>3.         What are the occupational mobility prospects of the secretary in a public establishment?</p> <p><strong>1.3       Purpose of the Study </strong><br/>In many of our national Institutes of learning today there are few candidates applying for the secretariat studies. Those who are eventually admitted for the course are mostly faced with a lot of problems before they can become secretariat. <br/>It is the purpose of this study however to find out whether the course provides job satisfactions in term of salary, promotion, frige benefits. The study plans to find out what secretarial practice include in Nigeria offices.</p> <p><strong>1.4       Significance of the Study </strong>      <br/>The study will discuss extensively why few candidates apply for secretarial studies. It will also reveal the job opportunities for secretaries in public establishment.

Horn by (2001) defines record “as written account of facts, accounts put down as hey occur and stored small collection of data about a specific) that exists as a units of information in machine readable form facts know about the past or somebody or something”<br/>Samdanel (1998) defines record “as large of document e.g. letters, memorandum, report etc which are created, processed, stored and reviewed in any business organization or office.<br/>In other words, record management refers to the sum total of all activities designed to control the lifecycle of records from its disposition.<br/>Record management deals with the creation, distribution, presentation, maintenance, preservation, retrieval and disposal of records.<br/>Mills and standingford (1983) see record management as “a direct connection between the practical working and the clerical operations”.<br/>Record management entails the following:</p> <ol><li>To account for the goods which have purchased as far as practicable, to trace them through the business until it have been develop and changed to  the customer or client.</li> <li>To report on stock bases and wastage</li> <li>To report on transaction of an office</li> <li>To report on goods held on ordered in relation to requirements for production and selling programmes.</li> <li>To report on inactive stocks.</li> <li>To provide information for department changing or costing purpose.</li> <li>Computers are now found in every field of human activities from space explanation to literacy studies.</li> </ol> <p>There are few or no area in an organization which are likely to escape the impact of computerization since business need for providing information are increasing in volume and complexity, the use of computer as a machine, which can receive, process present information in to it, at a very speed is essential.<br/>It is claimed that application of computer to record management in an office has made record management easier and more reliable.

In 1957, Farrell already investigated the question how to measure efficiency and highlighted its relevance for economic policy makers. \"It is important to know how far a given industry can be expected to increase its output by simply increasing its efficiency, without absorbing further resources\". Since that time techniques to measure efficiency have improved and investigations of efficiency have become more frequent, particularly in industry. Nevertheless, the measurement of efficiency of public administrative efficiency remains a conceptual challenge. Problems arise because public administration has multiple objectives and because public sector outputs are often not sold on the market which implies that price data is not available and that the output cannot be quantified.<br/>e-Government programs remain at the top of most countries policy agendas (UN, 2002). The emphasis on e-Government may be due to the potential of information and communication technologies (ICT) to transform public administration (PA) to an efficient system, enhance public services quality, establish trust between public administration and citizens and realize economic objectives (OECD, 2003; UN, 2004). In fact, e-Government aims at providing an efficient government management, better service delivery, and empowerment of citizens through access to information and participation in public policy decision making (UN, 2005). For these benefits, the PA in most countries develops Web sites, portals and electronic services delivery (UN, 2002; 2003; 2004; 2005). However, differences in worldwide adoption of e-Government are considerable. The e-Government readiness index estimated for each of UN countries varies between 0, 9062 in the United States of America and 0, 0011 in Liberia (UN, 2005). The Web Measure Index varies between 0 (no presence for countries like Haiti, Zambia, Liberia, etc.) and 1 in the United States of America.<br/>Certainly, the diffusion of the Web in PA leans on a political will that mobilizes the necessary human, material and financial resources. But, this diffusion depends also on social and economic variables (UN, 2002). UN (2005) affirm that e-Government readiness is a function of a country’s situation of technological and telecommunication infrastructure and of the level of its human resource development. Nevertheless, “the number of variables - social, legal and institutional as well as economic and technological - which might retard the diffusion process is virtually limitless’’ (Rosenberg, 1972, cited by Erumban and de Jong, 2006, p.303). Recently, several researchers show the importance of culture in IT adoption and justify the divergences between countries in the adoption of ICT, in general (Erumban and de Jong, 2006) and of specific technologies, such as Internet, PC, fax machines, cellular phone, telephone and pagers (Bagchi and al., 2004; Gong and al., 2007) on the base of the cultural variables. According to Zghal (2001), cultures include both favorable factors to ICT exploitation and unfavorable ones that may hinder an efficient implementation of these technologies. So, this research tries to answer this question: what is the impact of the national culture on the adoption of the e-Government by the PA? The analysis starts with the definition of e-Government and the presentation of its stages of evolution. Then, an explanation of the differences between the countries use of the e-Government is advanced on the base of a cultural perspective and the hypotheses are formulated. After the precision of the methodology, the results and their interpretations are presented.</p> <ol><li><ol><li><strong>Statement of the problem</strong></li> </ol></li></ol> <p>The objective of assessing the effect of internet culture on administrative efficiency is to enhance the effective use of the various forms of online communication in contributing to the overall economic development of the country through effective administration. But the objective cannot be achieved in a situation where the would-be beneficiaries are not even aware of the existence of such platforms. Moreover, the few who are aware of these platforms do not even bother to apply them at their place of work due to stringent work style, therefore, there is the need to proffer solutions to these problems to ensure the growth and development of our economy.<br/><strong>1.3   Significance of the study</strong><br/>The research will be of benefit to the government – Federal ministry of communication technology. It will provide a framework for the critical evaluation of the various forms of internet culture and how it affects the efficiency of an administration. It will provide a basis for the modification of the use of internet for communication in the ministry and identify loopholes where necessary.<br/>It will also benefit other researchers, forming a basis for further research on the subject in future.

As information users we expect reliable information at our fingertips, continual connection to people wherever they are, and equipment that fits into a top pocket. Whether we are consumers, clients, students, professors, employees or managers, we expect the digital world to work for us. The concept of information overload is not new, but with the continued growth of digital technology and the plethora of tools and channels for digital communication, the challenge of managing all that information is not getting smaller, and it is increasingly everyone’s responsibility to deal with it.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Todays office business, professional or Government is in a state of change. This change is reflected in the office structure and office positions from entry level to Executive Office Manager Level. Hence attention is now given to what the office does and the way in which office activities can be accomplished in an efficient and an effective way an office manager is responsible for the smooth operation of the day-to-day business of the company, a good office manager makes it possible for other people to function efficiently. Office managers work closely with the company partners, owner, or president to meet their company's staffing, equipment, and organizational needs. Duties may include pricing products from vendors, interviewing job applicants, managing payroll, and reimbursing members of the firm for out-of-pocket business expenses, and so the need for information technology had to come into play as information technology has replaced the traditional equipment used by an office manager to perform his tasks.<br/> Montgomerie (2004), defines information technology as the handling of vocal, pictorial, textual and numerical Information by means of micro-electronic based equipment in computing and telecommunication. This clearly brings about the advantages of information delivery through technological means, since almost all aspects of office work can adequately be taken care of. Aronu (2000) defines Information Technology as the combination of two technologies, computing and the main purpose of which is to transmit representation of information signals between remote locations. The concept of “core competence” has been defined and studied at the organizational level in the management literature as well as in information systems, as exemplified Sambamurthy and Zmud’s work on managerial IT competence. These latter authors state that such competency enables an organization “to effectively acquire, deploy and leverage its IT investments in pursuit of business strategies and in support of business activities” and helps fulfill the objective of aligning IT strategies and business strategies. However, competence at the individual level is required for the creation of core competence at the organizational level. Research on this individual component is incomplete. This paper explores the concept of the IT competence of individual business managers. Based on an examination of the literature in several disciplines and consultations with business and IT managers, we define the IT competence of business managers and identify its sub-dimensions. We also present a theoretical model of the link between IT competence and business-led technology leadership. The model is designed to be empirically tested and used to explore differences in the managers’ leadership in IT projects and partnerships with IT departments.</p> <p>Overtime in the business world, information technology has grown to be one of the cardinal pillars. The importance of information technology cannot be overemphasized in the 21stcentury. Information technology was known to be indispensable in stretching from the early 19th century. Information technology simply put can be regarded or defined as the application of computers to store, retrieve, transmit and manipulate data, often in the context of a business or other enterprise.</p> <p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has been identified as a vehicle with the potential to improve the competency of managers and every staff as well as the efficiency and service delivery of organizations both in the developed and developing countries. Information and communication technologies have changed the face of the world we live in (Benson, 1998).</p> <p>ICT enables people to communicate with family, friends and colleagues around the world instantaneously, gain access to global libraries, information resources and numerous other opportunities. Nelson, 2010 opined that information systems strategy is still not properly understood while ethics and behavioural issues are of concern. There are still staggering losses involved in information technology investment.</p> <p>Competence is defined as the knowledge and skills required for performing and supporting business processes. They represent the basis for creating value in an organization. The following competencies are needed to achieving organizational and managerial success in the field of information technology; Technical Knowledge, Work Coordination, Problem Solving and Prevention, Communication and Service encompass and Accountability which eclipses those skills and abilities required to make decisions and take responsibility for work.</p> <p>Since the year 2001, there has been a revolutionary growth in the telephony industry which is a major branch of information technology in Nigeria. Two years after the introduction of GSM in Nigeria, some researchers conducted an interview among medical practitioners in some organisations to find out the current level of utilization of telephones for customer care service delivery. They noted that managers of the organizations used their personal mobile phones to facilitate customer care at their own detriment. Currently, the number of GSM service providers in the country has increased significantly and all of them keep rolling out several service options or packages including internet services with varying benefits to attract customers (Agboola, 2003).</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The poor performances of businesses in organizations have grossly affected the overall gross domestic product of economic productivity of Nigeria; this has led to the present harsh economic condition, this May be as a result of the poor knowledge and application of information technology in businesses and organizations There is a problem of complexity of managing information technology and systems especially in the corporate environment where a lot is required in the effective application of information technology which has a lot to do with the competency of managers in the adoption of information technology.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Aims and Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to research on information technology competence on business managers. Meanwhile, the main objective of this study is to know the effect of Information technology competency on business managers. Specific objectives are:</p> <p>1.   To know whether business managers can competently use information technology in carrying out their duties.</p> <p>2.   To determine the level of competence in information technology among business managers.</p> <p>3.   To know whether business managers are up to date with technological trends.</p> <p>4.   To ascertain the factors limiting the use of information technology by business managers.</p> <p><strong>1.4. Research Questions</strong></p> <p>1.   Can business managers competently use information technology in carrying out their duties?</p> <p>2.   What is the level of competence in information technology among business managers?</p> <p>3.   Are business managers up to date with technological trends?</p> <p>4.   What are the factors limiting the use of information technology by business managers?</p> <p><strong>1.5   Research hypotheses</strong></p> <p><strong>Hypothesis I</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho</strong>: Business managers cannot competently use information technology in carrying out their duties.</p> <p><strong>H1:</strong> Business managers cannot competently use information technology in carrying out their duties.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis II</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho: </strong>The level of competence in information technology among business managers is very low.</p> <p><strong>H1: </strong>The level of competence in information technology among business managers is very high.</p> <p><strong>1.6   Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>This research will serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research on information technology and its effect in the business world.

Tough described by many as an elusive trend, globalization is a multi-dimensional, highly complex process with tending forms and a complex mix of effects in all places it touches. It is a process that has been referred to as \"multi-faceted in its operation, massive in its reach and implications and elusive as a concept\" Dele and Robertson (2003:14).<br/>Globalization, the term may be relatively new one. But the development it refers to has been known for quite a long time. In African for example the movement and traffic in human beings and other resources across the Sahara into the Arab world, and later across the Atlantic into the American and European were definitely a significant episode in the process. Similarly, the sustained Islamic and Christian missionary campaigns in Africa as well as the subsequent colonization and domination of the continent by foreign powers marked another important phrase. But in the modern and restarted sense in which the concept is used today, globalization as such refers to \"The forging of a multiplicity of linkages and interconnections between state and societies, which make up the modern world system\". Allen and Thomas, (2000:20).  The process aim at making the world into one large global village /neighbourhood so that events, decision and activities in one part can come tot have significant consequences for people and communities in quite distant parts. The concept of globalization, as Ahrens explains has made a remarkable career in recent years because world wide processes in the field of economics, communication, transport of ideas, and migration of religion have gained such an enormous speed that in many people's consciousness it appears as if our globe were shrinking Ahrens (2000:286). Social relations acquire as it were relatively distance less and borderless qualities as human beings are turned into actors in a single but open stage with their actions and interactions more and more being conducted and organized on the basis of one world unit. Globalization has significant military, political, legal and cultural dimensions. <br/>Information Technology has replaced the traditional equipment used by a secretary and the way in which secretarial task are performed is being modified. In the next ten years, as organizations try to stop the missing cost of paper work and to provide more information in a timely, usable format, electronic technology will be extended to the executive/managerial work station Iredia, (2002). <br/>Information technology abbreviated as (IT) is an act of the technology computer and communication. In the word of Carroll, information technology is \"term that describes the disciplines encompassing computer system, telecommunication networks and multi media applications\". <br/>Globalization is no doubt producing new ways of using and thinking about information technology. It is universally acknowledged that globalization requires as well as produces new channels, networks and practices of communication which are not dependant on state or quality. Globalization narrowly refers to the growing economic interdependence of countries world wide Kevin (2001:116). <br/>Office service according to Mark (2003:11) are work that are being carried out in the office by the office professionals e.g. telephone answering services, from message bas, transcription, editing document, design and many other office services.</p> <ul><li><ul><li><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></li> </ul></li></ul> <p>This research work is focused on the effects of Globalization of information technology on office service.

The changes that information technology is bringing to individuals and economics are creating significant new uncertainties. Organizations and people are forced to adapt to new circumstances and to new requirements at the work place and outside, and these adaptation processes are complicated and often initially difficult. <br/>However, there is the fear of losing ones job due to information (electronics) technology explosion and the fear of complex equipment being introduced into the system the fear of secretarial ability and skills changes, also the fear of changes in secretarial job title.</p> <ul><li><ul><li><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></li> </ul></li></ul> <p>This study is designed towards identifying some of the effects of globalization of information technology on office services.

If it is a well known facts that records that are properly kept and manage help in the success of any organization. Therefore the role of a female  secretary in the management of record cannot be over emphasized, this is because proper record management forms the basis of secretarial profession.</p> <p>Organization is made-up of human and material resources. These resources are brought together in order to accomplish a set goal. The activities of an organization revolved around the female  secretary, infact, no organization can do without the service/assistance of a female  secretary.</p> <p>The role of the female  secretary in today’s office has changed greatly with the introduction of modern office technology such as computer, electronic typewriter, photographing-Marching etc There is a need for well trained female  secretary to handle this high technology. Today, the position of the female  secretary is more pronounced, she is an intelligent personality whose present is a must for all organization.</p> <p>The National secretarial Association (international) (1990) defined a female  secretary as “an assistant to an executive who possesses mastery of office skills and ability to assume responsibilities without direct supervision, one who displays  initiatives exercise judgment and make decisions  within the scope of her authority. Another definition of female  secretary is given by the World book.</p> <p>Encyclopedia (1991) as “a person whose duties includes maintaining office files and records, taking dictation,  typing correspondence, sorting mails, aiding visitors, answering telephone, and make  travel arrangements.”</p> <p>The role of a female  secretary are very numerous the female  secretary can be seen as one who performs a lot of tasks in an organization such as keeping, retrieving, and recording information.</p> <p>Horison (1976) outline the various role of a female  secretary as follows:</p> <p>Ø    Receiving and transcribing dictation on a typewriter</p> <p>Ø    Filing of documents for quick retrieval </p> <p>Ø    Receiving visitors, handling calls</p> <p>Ø    Take care of the office petty –cash book</p> <p>Ø    Keeping your boss diary and making out his honorary </p> <p>Ø    Supervising of your secretarial /staff</p> <p>Ø    Attending meetings and recording minutes.</p> <p>Segal (1978) describes the female  secretary of  the upper extremes of the role m may even deputize for her employer during his absence in the sense that she will handle the day today affairs, deferring  in decision making at more important level  till  her boss return.  </p> <p>The United State Business Management (1965) describe a competent female  secretary as one who is familiar with the  full range of her executive responsibilities and activities her personal ambitions and the co-relation between his performance goals and organizations objectives. She is a practical  person with  intelligent and sound memory  to handle most of the routine without  supervision in accordance with the laid down principles and procedure of the organization.</p> <p>The service that make female  secretary to be demanded in organization. Female  secretary plan and implement for the smooth running of her office, there is the need for a female  secretary to plan how to utilize her subordinates and the use of office machines at the appropriate time, preparation of cinerary in order to know the movement of her boss. For instance, what need to be done , as the boss will be traveling to Lagos net week on a four days tour? How will his air ticket be booked in advance and accommodation? Which of the driver will take him to the airport? His schedule of time has to be arranged. Otherwise he would be stranded in his tour and also female  secretary serves as public relation office, because  of the nature of her office female  secretary prepare and organized things to be discuss in a meeting for any organization to achieve its aims and objective, must acquire the service of the female  secretary.</p> <p>Tarr (19730 said that “planning is to direct a project in a way that will produce maximum useful work output form a minimum number of staff.”  This implies that planning is the direction of a business affair for the attainment of set goals.</p> <p>The demand for secretarial service in pubic and private organizations cannot be over emphasized, it is against the background that this study is carried out in Bank of the North (BON), Union Bank of Nigerian Plc (UBN), Nigerian telecommunication (Nitel), New Nigerian development Company (NNDC) all in Kaduna metropolis about prospects and  problems  of demand for secretarial service  Gem (1984) defined  prospect as an “expectations, chance for success, view or over look. Also Harbby (1991) describe problems as ‘things that are difficult to deal with or understand “ in essence, what has proved difficult to solved or deal with understanding  in the secretarial services.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>Some organization predicts that, as we are moving towards paperless office, the work of a female secretary will be less demanding. Some even thought that the female secretary lack modern skill and cannot fit in the offices to day where modern technology foster, because they do not have the modern training in computers.</p> <p>Most organization under-estimate the services/ role played by the female secretary in an organization.</p> <p>On the other hand, most of the female secretaries do not know the demand of their profession in an organization.</p> <p>Moreover, female secretary have limited level of promotion which serve as a master obstacle in their career.</p> <p><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of the study is to find out the prospects and problems of female secretaries in some selected organizations in Kaduna metropolis,  They are as follows:</p> <p>Ø    To evaluate the problems in which female secretary is facing  in an organization.</p> <p>Ø    To identify  the various prospects of a   female  secretary in an organization</p> <p>Ø    To  identify the various roles/service of a female  secretary in an organization</p> <p>Ø    To investigate what factors preen female  secretary form having promotional opportunities unlike his colleagues in other professions.</p> <p>Ø    To find out the effect of modern technology planning and smooth running of office services.</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>Ø    Why are there problems and prospects for female xzdsecretarial services in an organization</p> <p>Ø    What are the various roles play by female  secretary in an organization</p> <p>Ø    What are factors that hinders female  secretary’s promotional opportunities</p> <p>Ø    How does the modern office technology aids the planning and smooth running of the organization.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Due to the important position, the secretaries occupy in an organization make her indispensable. This study becomes imperative, and would be useful to the following </p> <p>i.        <strong>Employers of labour</strong></p> <p>This study will be of great benefit to employer of labour who requires the service of secretaries.

According to Merriam-Webster (2007) technology is making usage and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems or methods of organization in order to solve a problem or perform a specific function. The word technology comes from Greek, the term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: example include construction technology and information technology.</p> <p>Technology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology h as helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes product unwanted by-products: known as pollution and deplete natural resources, the determinants of the earth and its environment. Various implementations of technologies influences the value of a society and news technology often rises new ethical questions examples include the rise of efficiency interm of human productivity, a term originally approved to machines and the challenge of traditional norms.</p> <p>According to Franklin Ursula (1952) Traditionally, new technology has been concerned with the construction of machines, structures, and tools on a relatively large scale. The development of materials for building bridges or sky scrapers is an example of this, as is the development of the internal  construction engine and the nuclear reactor. While such activities involve all the sciences, from chemistry to nuclear physics, the overding goal has been the same to improve the human condition by finding better ways to deal with the macroscopic world.</p> <p>Jaulius Adama's (1999) in his views says: Since world War II, the focus of technological activities has undergone a major change while the old activities are still pursued, they have largely superseded by applications of technology at the microscopic level instead of building large-scale structures and machines modern-day technology tends to concentrate on finding improved ways to transfer information and to develop new materials by studying the way atoms come together. The silicon clip and micro electronics typing the new technological trend, as does the blossoming of genetic engineering. The trend can be expected to continue into the fore seeable future. <br/>With the changing world of technology this day, it is important to say that modern technology has come to stay, and it plays significant role in the improvement of the secretary's job which in turns enhances productivity in all aspect.</p> <p>However Eric Schalzbery (2004) in his views says that with the high rate of technological development in this \"global village\" era, the secretary has come to terms with the reality of having her job greatly enriched and complete business activities going on in modern office. The secretary plays important role in ensuring the proper utilization of these machines for greater productivity.</p> <p>In the past, most office work had been carried out manually although them the volume of office work had been small and there was less sophistication in the industrial art, hence there was no significant demand for modern technology. But today, when one looks at the basic tasks. In an office, whether it be writing, calculating, filling, sorting or analysis, it is found that office machines cam be used to dot he job better and faster which leads to great achievements and professionalism in the field. There has never been grater need for efficiency in business than there is today. All kinds of businesses. Must employ modern methods in their offices. The raw material of an office is information, and the responsibility of an office is lit that of a clearing house, receiving and sending out information, processing storing facts in various forms. Therefore, the ever increasing size of business organizations has increased the development of new techniques in office management. Unlike in the past, where the secretary made use of old model manual typewriter that does not enhance efficient. Since the secretary is a medium through which the organization actions and policies are conveyed to the public. In readable and disenable form, it is wise that she is exposed to office machines and understand their proper usage so that she can efficiently carryout the routine job of the office. By so doing the organization concern can benefit highly form the services of the secretary.</p> <p>The secretary is part of the management team since she is completely involved in the affairs of the office and in making and implementation of business plans. She deals with letter drafting and typing, filing processing and storing of information as well as disseminating information. With the office automation such as electronic typewriter Word process, computer, telephone, fax machine, internet, e-mail, photocopier and calculating machines at her disposal, her job is sure to progress swiftly and a boost to attaining productivity in the organization where she works.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </strong><br/>Even though modern technology is regarded as important and of high value in ensuring quality work output in an office, as well as bringing about productivity. It is equally believed that these machines can cause job. Displacement. This is the fear that many employees suffer from when new machines are being purchased for use by their organization. The machines are cost effective. Some organizations do not really apply the use of some of the modern machines and this lead to poor performance, this is because they seem not to attach great importance to these machines and most secretaries are ignorant of their uses.</p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>The study intend to achieve the following: <br/>  To examine the concept of modern technology and its effect on the secretary's profession. <br/>  To examine whether modern technology causes job displacement of secretaries in organizations.</p>\n\nIMPACT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON SECRETARIAL PROFESSION IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON SECRETARIAL PROFESSION IN NIGERIA", "id": 61}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ONLINE BUS TICKET RESERVATION </strong><strong>SYSTEM (A CASE STUDY OF AKWA IBOM TRANSPORT COMPANY [AKTC])</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong><br/>The study examines the design and implementation of an online bus ticket reservation system. The system solves the problem of inconveniencing passengers who may not be physically present at the bus terminal to buy a bus ticket at a particular time. The system was achieved using the PHP and MYSQL technologies.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong><br/><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>Bus Ticket Reservation System enables the bus company's customer to buy bus ticket online; this is an easy method which saves a lot of time, it will enable customers in their comfort zone, to search for available tickets and get their data easily without any prior experience with queuing at the counter.<br/>E-ticket is the easier and quickest way to take bus. The online system is a new system because it hasn’t exists in Bus Company and even in AKTC. Currently, staffs at the bus ticket counter are using an internal system to sell ticket at the counter. Customers are unable to buy bus ticket online at this moment and have to go to the counter to buy bus ticket. Sometimes, customer needs to queue up a long queue to buy bus ticket and ask for information. This brings a lot of inconvenience to the customers. <br/>With the Internet now routinely being used as a resource for Bus Ticket Reservation, customer can buy bus ticket, make payment, and ask for information online easily. Furthermore, staffcan sell bus ticket using Bus Ticket Reservation System after checking bus ticket availability for the customer and print the bus ticket to the customer that queue up in the counter.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong> <br/>Akwa Ibom State Transport Company currently operates a manual way of issuing out bus tickets. This system is usually cumbersome for a prestigious company with a large customer base. Customers sometimes queue in lines to buy tickets, thereby wasting precious and productive time for both the transport company and the passengers.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>   <strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objective of this study is to develop an Online Bus Ticket Reservation for AKTC.

The study revealed that guidance and counseling programme has made positive impact in the life of the student with (77.3%) agree as most of the counselors organized career week treated them like mothers and fathers and for all advice and assisted them for career choice on what they will become in future through subject choice (with 54.1%) even though time for counseling is inadequate with other problem that may not be avoided, the researcher recommended that adequate measures should be made for the provision of professional and trained counselors with good enabling environment for them to work.</em></div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0     INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1     BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></div> <div>Guidance and counselling is a field of study that has been introduced in our school curriculum in order to produce professionally trained personnel who will render retentive and problem solving services to individuals or group in all area of life shows that its services are needed almost every where both hospitals, nursing home, rehabilitation centre, schools, banks, social welfare’ units, police stations, church and mosque e.t.c although here in Nigeria, the services of guidance and counselling is most pronounced in the schools.</div> <div>The knowledge of guidance and counseling is most pronounce who practically applied to students to guide tern against problem that might arise due to wrong decision making and action and also aim at proffering solution to existing problems.</div> <div>The existence of guidance “and counselling can be said to be as old as mankind, right from creation, man has never been all-knowing; he lacks knowledge in one things or the other and there fore seeks help from other people towards the solution of his problems.</div> <div>Traditionally, the importance of guidance and counselling can not be over emphasized people sought for advice and help from other who are more knowledgeable, experienced or rise from solution of their problems, the traditional counselling could be those men and women who possessed supernatural power of healing, foreseeing the future and mediating between man and the god, these people served as consultant and then preferred solution to most of the problem brought before them due to the simplicity of man and his environment then.</div> <div>However, due to the complexity of the environment and the society at large, the overall philosophy and objectives of the nation of the word, the service provided by the traditional counseling apparently become inadequate. Various problems and confusion are encountered by people in all areas of human Endeavour as Rocher (1991 .1) notes;</div> <div><em>With the tremendous increase in the number of students in the institution of higher learning extremely wide range of course of study and job opportunities, rapid charging mo/work of work and great complexity of students needs and problems, there is a definite need for providing a fine nucleus of guidance and counseling by matured, experience and professionally qualified person for the development of all the unique potentialities of the students for individual fulfillment in particular and social (p1) and natural upliftment in Nigeria.</em></div> <div>This fact makes tend to have professionally trained guidance and counseling personnel in all works of life especially in our Educational institution very compelling this win minimized what would have been in mistakes to a very minimal and bearable degree.</div> <div>From the aforesaid, there is no doubt that the realization of our Education institution objectives depends mostly on a full guidance and counseling programme. The Federal Government of Nigeria is realized its immense importance of therefore is regarded it’s as a vital tool for the realization of the national objective and clearly state in that National Policy on Education that;</div> <div><em>In view of apparent ignorance of many young people about career prospects and in view of personality maladjustment among school children, career offices and counseling will be appointed in post primary institution. (F.G.N 1998 p43).</em></div> <div>Base on this, “counseling is expected to be on integral cost effective component of the Educational process aimed at curbing wastage of talent and enhancing appropriate decision making and personal adjustment”</div> <div>According to Denga (1986) “it was also envisaged tat by 1980, a school in Nigeria”.</div> <div>However, in spite of this laudable gesture by the Federal Government and the higher expectation and aspiration of people, there seen to have been no impressive impact of Educational institution. Many students clue to parental, peer groups, societal (environmental) influenced among other reasons make devastating mistakes that hamper their happiness in life and add to the already existing societal problem.</div> <div>It is therefore very pertinent that most of the ill and vice in our society should be check through our institutions of learning to achieve this effort should be made to improve the situation through guidance and counseling programme school especially in our secondary school where most of the Educational and societal problems have their foundation.</div> <div>To this effort therefore, the Federal Government of Nigeria come up with the National policy on Education with, emphasis on the introduction of guidance and counseling in our schools. This fact gives rise to this study which focuses attention on the evaluation of guidance and counseling programmes in secondary school in Nasarawa state.</div> <div>According to the information made available by Mallam A. in his book titled “Guidance and counselling beginners guidance (page 11) (2000) the practice of guidance and counselling is not new in the society right from the creation and early time, the need for man to exist well in his society and satisfy his wants have been there, man exist in ignorance and when guided, he performs and achieves his optimum goals.</div> <div>Also in the traditional society our fore fathers practiced guidance and counselling, they led their children through a vocation e.g Fishing, caving, weaving and wood cutting.</div> <div>But modem guidance and counselling as practiced now in our school system originated for America in the Late Eighteen ninety (1890s). It started with complicated environment force couple with social force such as Family disorganization, mental / health movement programme the increasing student population problem who terribly, literogeneous terms of their learning readiness, professional and psychological worries and many other problems that live of the people.</div> <div>Frank Parson of Boston viewed the above problem and saw the need for starting a vocational guidance in 1908 whom today is regarded as the Father of guidance. Frank Parson wrote a book on choosing a career or a vocation in 1909.</div> <div>In his book parson (1908) outlined the three phases in dealing with problems of vocational choice as follows;</div> <div>1)    <strong>Knowing the person:</strong> through understanding of the person through the data collected about him or her.</div> <div>2)    <strong>Knowing the job:</strong> Understanding the work and the nature of the desired job entry requirement, condition for advancement and other remunerations.</div> <div>3)    Making a match between the person and job based on a reasoned consideration of the two factor above</div> <div>Another notable contributor to the movement was Jessie B. Danes who applied the process of career in choice laid down by person to locate himself in teaching profession. In addition he emphasized the development of character in his book, moral and vocational guidance services in settle Washington where she helped students to excel in the stiff competition to find a place in life since then guidance and counselling as a discipline has been adopted in many countries of the word including Nigeria by Annay Reed established.</div> <div><strong>1.2.1 THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF GUIDANCE AND COUNSELLING IN NIGERIA</strong></div> <div>However, the development of guidance and counselling in Nigeria according to Mallam A. Yakubu (2000) is started at the close of 1959 when a group of reverend Irish sisters at St. Theresa’s college, Oko-Ado, ion Ibadan saw the need for vocational guidance of the final year school. Certificate female student of their college. Then invited twenty (20) outsiders who were Government officials from the ministries and some prominent men from Ibadan community to advice them on placing of sixty (60) of their girls leaving school that December, 1959. These men were not trained counselors but they definitely know more about the emerging word of work than the students and the religious sisters. This led to the establishment of Ibadan career council in 1961. The same body became Nigeria career council in 1967.</div> <div>According to Akingboye (1907) and Donga (1983) can be traced back to the effort of the publication in 1977 of the National policy on Education which under scoped the need for the programme. It also outlined its significance toward the effective implementation of the Nation’s now Education policy the 6-3-34 system.</div> <div>This new system of Education gives the students an ample opportunity to use the first three years of secondary school Education to explore all the subject areas both in art and, science to determine where be or she fits in well. The student is also exposed to different vocations to make himself retired after his Education. Thus, the formation of guidance and counselling body called Nigeria career counselling in 1967 for the dissemination of career information and attending to problems relevant to careers. So to support this white man in 1961 to serve in the Federal ministry of Education.</div> <div>This source has it that this official gesture went a long way to stimulate and guidance and counselling in the then western Nigeria which has already established an advised teachers collage at Ibadan that the fist worship on vocational guidance and counselling in Nigeria was organized in 1961 by the Federal ministry of Education.</div> <div>From all indication, it can be deduced that the first indigenous few fledge department of guidance and counselling in Nigeria started at the University of 1.badan in 1975 and the inauguration of the counselling association of Nigeria (CASSON) in 1967 at the some university.</div> <div>Today, one is glad to observe that many universities in Nigeria – Ibadan, Jog, Ilorin, Nsuka, Benin, Zaria, Abuja, among other have programmes for training of guidance and counselling specialists.</div> <div>However, there are still some teaching problems militating against its defective’s growth. Examples of those problems are: – Lack of fund, lack of office accommodation, and shortage of training counselors and so on this is fully described in chapter two.</div> <div><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></div> <div>The emergence of guidance and counselling in our Educational systems is very timely given the type of society we found ourselves. Despite it’s a numerous advantages to the systems, the discipline if aced with a lot of problems which are militating against its effective – hence this research undertake her research work to evaluate the guidance and counselling programme in some selected secondary schools in Lafia area inspectorate office, Nasarawa state.</div> <div>To do this the researcher will seek the answer to:</div> <div>1)    Area the trained personnel available?</div> <div>2)    Area the necessary facilities to make the job of the guidance and counselling effectives provided?</div> <div><strong>1.3     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></div> <div>This study is intended to evaluate the guidance and counselling programmed in secondary schools under study. To achieve her objective, the researcher will critically examine the way and manner the programme is run in the state so- as to:</div> <div>1.     Determine the extent of development of the programme in the area under study</div> <div>2.     Identify the major factor affecting the performance in the state.</div> <div>3.     Gives suggestion on how to improves on the programme.</div> <div><strong>1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></div> <div>This study is important because if diligently carried out will serve as a tool to identify the extreme of development of guidance and counselling programme in the state and identify the major fact that hampers its effectives utilization as one of the Educational for services iii the realization of the Nation objective utilization as and goal.

It deals with the use of electronic computer software to convert, store, protect process, transmits and securely retrieved information.</div> <div>It has been observed that the term Information technology has been broaden explicitly to cover the field of electronic communication and therefore it is abbreviated as ICT (Information and Communication Technology), and it can also be referred to as IT and standing for Information Technology. Consequently, whether it is Information Technology or Information and Communication Technology, we are simply refereeing to one which preferably the researcher calls the Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Information and Communication Technologies has today virtually become synonymous with the computer. It is the technology that supports activities involving the storage, manipulation and communication of information, which has been integrated into one easy to use system of data processing, delivery and management. Muhammad,(2007).</div> <div>Ngurukwem, (2005) observed that ICT is a convergence of technologies that include the computer and microprocessor technology, communication satellite technologies and networking technology.</div> <div>However, there are some problems associated with the ICT which include; introduction of malicious code, acts of terrorism, system hardware and software  failure and natural or environmental disaster, attacks on the system by external networks or hacker, users initiated issues either through error or malicious act, et cetera. Therefore, strategies have to be employed in order to prevent this danger for suitable development. </div> <div>There is no doubt that the Secretary remains the life-wire of any organization. Contributions and effectiveness of a secretary depends on how he/she can cope with the modern technologies. However, with the development of new technology, secretarial profession is becoming increasingly challenging and more sophisticated compared with the common traditional role of Secretaries.</div> <div>The science of computing has developed quickly and large, therefore, the researcher feels it is important to understand the problem associated with ICT applications on the secretary’s profession, recognizing the vital roles secretaries play in organizations.</div> <div><strong>1.2        HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE CASE STUDY</strong></div> <div>The Federal Polytechnic Nasarawa was established in 1983 by the Federal Government of Nigeria. The intention of the Federal government in establishing polytechnics was predicated by the Government’s drive to revolutionize the society technologically. This is spelt out in the objectives of the polytechnics contained in the Federal Polytechnic decree No.28 of 1987. Among the objectives is:</div> <div>·                 To train people to acquire technical Vocational skills which are needed for the economic and social development of Nigeria especially in the fields of agriculture, commerce and industry.</div> <div>At the Federal polytechnic Nasarawa, academic work commenced in January 1984 at the central primary school temporary site with an initial intake of 220 students in two schools: schools of Environmental and Business Studies. A department of Liberal Studies courses with the responsibility of General Study’s courses and administration of pre-National Diploma programs. An important land mark in the development of the polytechnic was the initial accreditation of all the programs in 1985 and commencement of all the programs in Business Administration and Management, Accountancy. Secretarial studies Town and Regional Planning in the year 1986. The then Minister of Education, Professor Jibril Aminu cut the sod to begin the physical development at the permanent site.</div> <div>The rapid academic development continued in 1992/1993 session with commencement of ND programs in electrical Electronics Engineering technology, Science Laboratory Technology and Statistics. These programs had associated with them requisite laboratories and workshops fully equipped to meet the requirements for accreditation. Indeed with these developments, the Polytechnic can now be said to be a full-fledged Technical institution offering  programs in core Engineering, Applied Science, Environmental and Business Studies.</div> <div><strong>1.3                        </strong><strong>       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></div> <div>The arrival of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has assisted Secretaries in no small measure in the effective and efficient performance of Secretarial duties<strong>. </strong>In today’s office, traditional job like filing, keyboarding reprography, treatment of incoming and outgoing mail and other clerical activities have now lent themselves to automation. Attention is now shifting from the usual traditional secretarial skill to a more modernized practice. The central focus of this study is to examine the problems associated with Information and Communication Technology and its effects on Secretaries.</div> <div>However, the specific problems to ICT operation are fraudulent misuse, viruses, hackers, unauthorized users activity, unprotected downloaded files.</div> <div>Information and Communication Technology in recent years has created a great deal of opportunities to Professional Secretaries, considering the current rapidity in the growth and use of ICT, there is a reasonable prospect that  Information and Communication Technology will drive  all duties/ tasks of the Secretaries in  every organization in the sense that in no distant time, every office work will done using one ICT equipment or the other  and that implies that the service of a Secretary who has no expertise in using or operating the Information and Communication technologies will not be useful.</div> <div>Again these advancements in communication technologies have led to the need for secretaries to reposition themselves in order to continue to be relevant in their performance of office functions as well as cope with the trend of technological changes in today’s modern offices.  </div> <div><strong>1.4                        </strong><strong>       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></div> <div>The purpose of this study is to examine some of the problems and prospects of ICT to the secretary. Specifically, the study intends to:</div> <div>1.           Identify the problems of Information and Communication Technology.</div> <div>2.           Examine the effects of ICT on Secretary’s performances</div> <div>3.           Determine the prospects/opportunities offered by ICT to Secretaries.</div> <div><strong>1.5         </strong>          <strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></div> <div>1.              What are the problems associated with ICT?</div> <div>2.              What are the effects of ICT on Secretary’s performances</div> <div>3.              What are the opportunities offered by ICT to Secretaries?</div> <div><strong>1.6                     </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></div> <div><strong>T</strong>his research work will be of great benefits to Secretaries, ICT end users and researchers. ICT end-users those who make use of the equipments or applications to help them in their work. They make use of ICT in their day-to-day activites in their homes and offices for the efficiency of the service.  To the Secretaries, the study will enlighten them on the problems that are associated with ICT, review to them the effects of those problems on their works as they carry out their duties and how to avoid them<strong>.</strong>  The study will also be of great importance to professional Secretaries, staff and other workers in Federal Polytechnic Nasarawa (FPN) who make use of  ICT equipments in their offices as it will enlighten them on problems that they are likely to face with Information and Communication Technologies as they carry out their duties and how to handle it.  The study is important to researchers because it gives the direction to research with similar area or problem.  </div> <div><strong>1.7                        </strong><strong>          SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></div> <div> The scope of ICT is a very wide one that covers office automation, transaction processing, and management information system etcetera.

A major provision of this policy was the introduction of the teaching of business education subjects at the junior secondary school level with emphasis on the acquisition of practical skills, values and knowledge that would enable individuals like in the society.</p> <p>        One of the rational for the emphasis on business subject is the fact that is skilled subject, which would equip its grauduates with the needed skills for gainful employment even if they terminate their formal education at the junior secondary school level. ome basic neccsity for the achievement of this would ensure that course are taught according to the curriculum and using appriopiate methodologies for the subjects.</p> <p>        According to Nolan (1971), it is not possible to teach a student to operate a keypunch machine effectively without keypunch machine, nor is it possible to teach a student to operate a proportional spacing typewriter without such a typewriter. For a teacher to teach the business subjects he must have through knowledge of the business subject and be certified in that area, so that he can demonstrate the skills properly for the students to understand and emulate, where they stressed that the individual will acquire skills and reach the stated goals by watching an export and by practicing.</p> <p>This view believed that the individual in addition to this should be given enough practice period to enable him master the art.</p> <p>        In order to enhance the study of the business subject Malsbery (1966), stated that there is the need for students to go on field trip for their visits permits students to study equipment and the layout of the offices and stores, to observe employee at work, routine business procedure and to study the relationship between departments.</p> <p>        The new national policy on education (1981), pointed out clearly that business education is an area of national need. Hence Anyaduba (1987), said “all citizen of the country need business subjects in order to function well and effectively in the society irrespective of their occupation in life.</p> <p>        Moreover, this stems for the fact that ou country has experienced a marked growth in different business fields.</p> <p>So there is the urgent need to improve the business education system in order to meet up with the new demands and requirements for the jobs. That is to say that it has become mianfest that the health of any national largely depends on is human resource. The more human resource out capital and other resources into material resource that determine the nature and rate of economic and social development.</p> <p>The new national policy on education in Nigeria now place emphasis on the study of vocational subjects particularly at this level comprises, the following subjects: typewriting shorthand, office practice, commerce bookkeeping and English.</p> <p>        Business education has always tended to educate student in a chister skill distributive education office and clerical practice provided basic skills for subjects, the students been at least minimally competent in many specific tasks,and develop the attitude of service that are required in business office.</p> <p>1.2 statement of the problem.</p> <p>Evidence from the recent studies shows that a large proportion of those who teach business education subjects.</p> <p>In most schools are not very qualified to teach business education or teach subjects outside their area of specialization Njoku (1990).</p> <p>        Some teachers who teach business subjects are complaining on the problems encountered in the teaching of these subjects. In the light of these, the researcher therefore decided to find out the problem encountered by the teachers. In the teaching of business subjects in junior secondary schools.</p> <p>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>        This study is aimed at achieving the following objectives:</p> <p>-      To find out the extent to which the teaching of business subjects is being funded.</p> <p>-      To determines which facilities are adequately provided for teaching of business subjects.</p> <p>-      To find out the extent to which adequate and qualified teachers are available for teaching business subjects.</p> <p>-      To find out whether the time allotted for the teaching of business subjecs and the method used are adequate and effective respectively.</p> <p>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>1. To what extent is the teaching of business subjects adequately funded?</p> <p>2. to what extent are teaching facilities provided for teaching business subjects.</p> <p>1.5 STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</p> <p>1) HO: does an investigation into the problem of teaching business subject in junior secondary school contributed to the problem of teaching business subject in secondary school?</p> <p>        HI: the investigation into the problem of teaching business subject in junior secondary school has contributed a lot.</p> <p>2) HO: Does government individual played any important role towards, investigation into the problem of teaching business subject in junior secondary school?</p> <p>        HI: government or individual has contributed a lot to the investigation into the the problem of teaching business subjects in junior secondary school.</p> <p>1.6 significance of study.</p> <p>It requires little thinking discovering that this research will be of immense benefit to Anambra state ministry of education. It will enable them to become aware of the problem that exist in Orumba north &amp; south local government area. With a view to improve situation.</p> <p>          The findings in  the study will also contribute in this little way to the feedback which the federal government will received on the implementation of her National policy on Education and this feedback will help the government to decide when and where modification are necessary in the new national educational policy.</p> <p>Parent and guardian will discover from the findings of this research parent the problem encountered by their children in the learning of business subject and will therefore, take steps through their parents/teachers association of Orumba north &amp; south local government area will probably be the first to appreciate the contribution of this research.</p> <p>It can be seen that research findings will be of great significant to a variety of people.</p> <p>1.7 scope of the study</p> <p>This research work, covers of the junior secondary schools in Orumba north/south local government area.</p> <p>1.8 Defintion of terms</p> <p>TEACHING: is the act of impacting knowledge into human beings, either orally or practical, according to google teaching is idea or principle taught by an authority.</p> <p>BUSINESS: As we know it involves two or more people coming together to exchange good &amp; service for money.

It was concluded that (i) Preparing presentation and creating spreadsheet is important to secretaries (ii) Word processing and transcription is essential to secretaries employed in secondary schools (iii) Secretaries employed in Secondary schools must master document management for the effectiveness of their job.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>        Secretary has always been a vital link between those who make management level decisions and those who react to and implement the decisions. In the present role of administrative assistant, however, a competent and responsible secretary serve not only as a link between management and staff but also a key support person for the executives.</p> <p>        The word secretary has been understood in different ways by different people. Some see if as a typist or a receptionist or even as an office clerk.</p> <p>        According to Azuka and Agomuo (1993) secretary is  a person employed by another person, society or corporation for the purpose of conducting correspondence, keeping business records and transacting other business. He acts as an aide and the close assistant to the boss. He is the vehicle through which his boss or organization’s actions are conveyed to the public in readable and discernable form.</p> <p>        A secretary is therefore a person overseeing business confidentially, usually for powerful individuals. A secretary can also be seen as a person, whose work consists of supporting management, including executives using a variety of project management, communication and organizational skills. These functions may be entirely carried out to assist one other employee or may be for the benefit of more than one.</p> <p>        In other hand, a secretary is an officers of an organization who deals with correspondence admits new members and organizes  official meetings and events. According to Merrian Webster secretarial Handbook (1993) the administrative expansion of the secretaries function is reflected in the definition of a secretary provided by professional secretaries international. A secretary was defined as an executive assistant who demonstrates the ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision who exercises imitative and judgment and who makes decisions within the scope of assigned authority. From the definition the real secretary is an assistant to the executive. A secretary as a result of training process mastery of office skills, discharges his duties unsupervised and displays initiative resulting from a good knowledge of his organization.</p> <p>        Whitehead (1977) in Elendu (2001) observed that “behind every successful executive, there is a first class private secretary who acts as an alter ego or other self”. For this reason, secretaries should possess some qualities and skills to enable them act as alter ego to their executives. These requirements include: business knowledge, secretarial skills, language skills and so on. The duties of secretaries have contributed to the growth and fast changing of the organizations. The quality of secretaries in this modern era has made it easy to meet social, political, economic and educational needs of the society, Onwuka (2005).</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>        In many organizations, secretaries are seen as disposable employee who should be hired and fired at will (Azuka and Agomuo 1993). This is as a result of poor skills acquisition and poor attitude of these secretaries. In the past, many secretaries were placed in positions of responsibility but lacked enough authority to carry out their responsibility. The current foster pace of business and the resulting functions and more advanced skills available help to delegate both more responsibility and more authority to the secretaries. While the qualifications for different job slots, vary with the nature of the particular job and the requirement of each executive, the trend today is towards better educated secretaries who are willing and qualified to perform as many tasks as can be delegated to them (Webster’s secretarial Handbook).</p> <p>        Therefore, the problem of this study posed as a question to identify the knowledge, skills and attitude of secretaries that work in secondary schools to enable them face the current roles and responsibilities of secretaries in this modern era.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        The major purpose of this study was to determine the competencies required of secretaries employed in secondary schools in Aguata local government area of Anambra state.</p> <p>Specifically the study was to:</p> <p>1.          Identify the communication skills required of secretaries employed in secondary schools.</p> <p>2.          Find out computer skills required of secretaries in secondary schools.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANNCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will contribute to the re-examination of the skills of school secretaries, the expansion of their work in this contemporary era. It will also help the executive of secondary schools to understand the importance of secretaries should possess to enable them perform their duties.</p> <p>        The findings of this study will help secondary school administrators to have a better administration. In allocation of duties the findings of the study will help them to know the necessary skills and attributes the secretaries should possess to enable them serve their organization well. It will also help the secretaries in secondary schools to realize themselves as the image maker of the school.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>        The study sought answers to the following research questions:</p> <p>1.          What are the communication skills required of secretaries employed in secondary schools?</p> <p>2.          What are the computer skills required of secretaries in secondary schools?</p> <p><strong>1.6   DELIMINATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>        This study is delimited to the knowledge and skills required of secretaries employed in secondary schools.

According to Merriam Webster (2007), technology is making usage and knowledge of tools, machines techniques crafts, systems or methods of organization in order to solve a problem or perform a specific function. The word Technology comes from Greek, the term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: Example include construction Technology and information technology. </p> <p><strong>1.1   Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Information Technology has dramatically changed all aspects in business and industry in modern society. These technology developments have adversely affected the jobs of many people. To understand information Technology, Bennett (1997) defines it as acquisition, processing, storage and dissemination of information using computers. </p> <p>        However, Eric Schalzbery (2004) in his views says that with the high rate of technological development in this “global village” era, the secretary has come to terms with the reality of having her job greatly enriched and complete business activities going on in modern office. The secretary plays important role in ensuring the proper utilization of these machines for greater productivity. </p> <p>        In the past, most office work had been carried out manually although then the volume of office work had been small and was less sophisticated in industrial art, hence there was no significant demand for modern technology. But today when one looks at the basic tasks in an office, whether it be writing, calculating, filling, sorting or analysis it is found that office machines can be used to do the job better and faster which leads to great achievements and professionalism in the field. There has never been greater need for efficiency in business than there is today. All kinds of business must employ modern methods in their offices as the raw materials of an office is information, the responsibility of an office is like that of a clearing house, receiving and sending out information, processing, storing facts in various forms. Therefore, the ever increasing size of business organizations has increased the development of new techniques in office management unlike in the past where the secretary made use of old model manual typewriter that does not enhance efficiency. </p> <p>        Since the secretary is a medium through which the organizations actions and policies are conveyed to the public in readable and disenable form, it is wise that she is exposed to office machines and understand their proper usage so that she can efficiently carryout the routine job of the office. By so doing, the organization concern can benefit highly form the services of the secretary. </p> <p>        The secretary is part of the management team since she is completely involved in the affairs of the office and in making and implementation of business plans. She deals with letter drafting and typing, filing, processing and storing of information as well as disseminating information with the office automation such as electronic typewriter, word processor, computer, telephone tax machine, internet, e-mail, photocopier and calculating machines at her disposal, her job is sure to progress swiftly and a boost to attaining productivity in the organization where she works. As a result, the naming is changing. Popular titles now are administrative assistants, executive assistants, office manager, coordinator and specialists. Communication skills and class are required for tasks such as preparing conferences, working with clients and coaching staff. Secretaries and administrative assistants will keep on playing an essential role in majority of organizations and technical inventions cannot replace these personal skills. </p> <p>        The government has not lagged behind in the development of information technology. According to information technology for development, an internal journal; information technology has great relevance for government and social economic development programs. For information Technology development of telecommunication, infrastructure is considered to be an important pre-requisite. Information Technology is dependent on human resource development which means development for technical manpower. The government has introduced E-government in its operation today and this shows the importance the government attaches to information technology. </p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of the Problems</strong></p> <p>There are problem encountered despite the benefits of information technology. Even though modern technology is regard as important and of high value in ensuring quality work output in an office as well as bringing about productivity, it is equally believed that these machines can cause job displacement. </p> <p>The machines are cost effective therefore some organization do not really apply the use of some of the modern machines and this lead to poor performance. </p> <p>There is however a great loss of job from typing pools (Rackham, 2001). Many workplaces previously manned are fully automated and many jobs are being changed as the new technology is introduced this has however led to reduction of employees including secretarial staff. </p> <p>This study is therefore aimed at examining how information technology could be utilized by  secretaries to be more productive in their areas of work and put in place, possible solution that shall give the secretary the comfort to hold on to the profession without fear of future extinction. </p> <p><strong>1.3   Purpose of the study</strong></p> <p>The major purpose of this study was to determine  the benefits of information technology on the job performance of secretaries in polytechnic specifically, the study was to;</p> <p>1.          To examine the concept of modern technology and its effect on the secretary’s performance. </p> <p>2.          To examine whether modern technology causes job displacement of secretaries in organizations. </p> <p>3.          To identity the roles information technology plays among secretaries. </p> <p>4.          To find out challenges facing secretaries in utilizing information technology. </p> <p><strong>1.4   Research Questions</strong></p> <p>This study sought answers to the following research questions;</p> <p>1            What role does information technology play in secretary’s job performance?</p> <p>2            To what extent has information technology improved the secretary’s performance?</p> <p>3            What are the challenges facing secretaries in utilizing information technology</p> <p>4            Does modern technology cause job displacement of secretaries in organizations. </p> <p><strong>1.5   Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>Information technology is like a magic, it must be learned because it is a challenge. This research tends to determine and focus its findings on the benefits attached to information technology.</p> <p>        Students, lecturers, employees and managers would be at advantage to gain from the result as it would assist in enhancing and eliminating the misconception posed by critics who through ignorant of the secretary’s job content assure that the computer is a substitute for secretaries. </p> <p>        The secretaries would benefit mostly from the findings of the study by understanding how information technology could enhance their performance. The study will also be an eye opener to them, since information technology poses threat to their career. The study will also help managers and top executives on how best to utilize secretaries and especially on delegating their duties to them. </p> <p>        The study is also meant to help other researchers conducting research on information technology and its impact on performance of secretaries. They would be able to use it as a source of reference for literature review. </p> <p><strong>1.6   Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study focuses on the roles information technology plays among secretaries and also looked at he specific challenges facing secretaries in utilizing information technology. </p> <p><strong>1.7   Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>The terms used in this study which have unique meaning that could be subjected to different interpretations by different readers of this project report are as follows:</p> <p>Benefit                     An advantage or profit gained form </p> <p>something. </p> <p>Information              All types of equipment and programs </p> <p>Technology              Which are used in the processing of </p> <p>information (Rackham, 2001).</p> <p>Job performance      An individual’s output in terms of quality </p> <p>and quantity expected from every employee in a particular job. </p> <p>Secretary                  An executive assistant who possesses a mastery of office skills, who demonstrates the ability to assume responsibility without direct supervision, who exercise initiative and judgement, and who makes decision within the scope of assigned authority (Okolo A.N, 2012). </p>\n\nBENEFITS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON THE JOB PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIES EMPLOYED<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " BENEFITS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON THE JOB PERFORMANCE OF SECRETARIES EMPLOYED", "id": 68}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p><em>The topic of this research is the role of industrial Training scheme on the Development of manpower in selected business Establishment in Anambra state.

This was supported by Dr. Akinku in his book “Nigeria Today” when he said; we are yet to find out what it is, are the 4m’s absent in our midst. All efforts to improve on our productivity yield no result. Referring to his 4m’s, he meant Man, Materials, Machines and Money.</p> <p>          With the turn of events, and increased awareness both the developed and developing countries have come to appreciate the problem of employee development and training in many organizations.</p> <p>          In his inaugural lecture on supervisor management training course. Layemo said that the basic problem of developing countries is not lack of natural resource but the underdevelopment of their human/manpower resources.</p> <p>          In a similar perspective, Eze in his book” sources of management motivation”, showed that manpower in the third world countries are underdeveloped. </p> <p>          In support of this, a report by Ashby of (1959:58) showed that manpower resources in the third world countries were still developing.</p> <p>          Following Ashby’s recommendation, the National manpower Board was established in 1962. As a follow up, the manpower in 1963 undertook a comprehensive manpower survey which brought to governments notice the following.</p> <p>a.     The quality of management in all level is one of the major problems of economic development.</p> <p>b.     The need for effective co-ordination to avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts  in manpower training.</p> <p>In 1969, the International Labour Organization (ILO) emphasized the inadequate of manpower development programmes in Nigeria which was necessary for her to carry out her economic development plan occasioned by the civil war, hence the need for rehabilitations, required to develop technical and progression of manpower training.</p> <p>     The second National manpower development plan (1970:74) also said that there was high level of incompetence in positions in our industries and it identified the following factors as  being responsible for it</p> <p>a.     Inadequacy of education and professional qualification</p> <p>b.     Poor quality of employees</p> <p>c.      Inadequate experience.</p> <p>Irrespective of these poor quality skilled manpower, employers have neglected the need to train their workers for increased productivity and efficiency of their work. The federal government create industrial training fund in 1971 by decree No 47 and its main objective is to promote and encourage the acquisition of skills with a view to generate a pool of indigenous trained manpower sufficient to meet the developing needs of the country.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>          As stated earlier, the setting up of the industrial training fund has the central objective of promoting and encouraging the acquisition of skills in industry and commerce. In essence, the ITF is expected to provide high quality personnel to man our manpower resource/organization. ITF always claim in its bulletin to have done a lot to meet manpower development needs of co-operation from employees of labour who need the training.</p> <p>Their complaint entails</p> <p>Nonpayment of contributions by contributing companies.</p> <p>Some organizations fail to patronize them in their industrial training programme.</p> <p><strong>1.3     Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>          This study aims at investigating the activities of IF with a view to access the impact of its training programme on manpower development in the country. It would also see if there is justification for the little enthusiasm and greater critism being leveled on the ITF, in view of the above, the purpose of the study include:</p> <p>1.     To ascertain whether ITF meets the training needs of the contributing companies.</p> <p>2.     To determine the extent at which ITF’s training effect the acquisition of skills of its participant.</p> <p>3.     To identify the place of industrial training in achieving organizational objective.</p> <p><strong>1.4     Research Question</strong></p> <p>          The study sought answer to the following questions.</p> <p>1.     To what extent does ITF meets the training needs of the contributing companies?</p> <p>2.     To what extent does ITF training affect the acquisition of skills of its participants?</p> <p>3.     What is the place of industrial training in achieving organizational objective?</p> <p><strong>1.5     Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>          This study when successfully completed will be immense important to employees of labour in order to know the quality and effect of industrial training programmes offered by ITF.

that if all the recommendations are implemented, this research work will be of immense benefit to secretarial career, students and employers and institutions that train secretaries.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p><p> INTRODUCTION </p> <p><strong>1.1  Background of the study</strong></p> <p>     The secretarial functions and its effectiveness depends much on the availability of office technology and equipments, as well as the skills and competencies of the secretary.  Many organizations have come to appreciate the role and importance of the secretary, and also the need of providing the needed office machines and equipments for the efficacy of the secretary’s performance of his/her functions.</p> <p>     For decades now, fast changes have been taking place in all facets of life including the office environment.  This is as a result of technological advancement. Every office today requires facts and accurate information for quick decision- making and high productivity. </p> <p>     The office worker including the secretary expects certain supports from the organization into which he/she is employed.  This support can be technological (machines and equipments) and human.  In the past offices, manager dictates memo and letters, while the secretary types them.  Most recently, word processors have been developed and used, personal computers are relied on and even electronic mail in an effort to lesson the need for secretarial supports and make the employee (secretary) very productive, (Ezoem 1995, Osuala 2004)</p> <p>     As a result of the changes in technology, the role of the secretary has changed tremendously from that of typewriting and shorthand, dictation, answering of telephone calls and processing of mails.  Today’s secretaries are exposed to office technology/automation including the Internet that makes work easier and knowledge more accessible (Edwin 2008).  It is now easier to send messages by telex, electronic mails (e-mails) fax and telephones. Other office gadgets available to the secretary are photocopying machine, duplicating machines, dictating machines, and printing machines etc.  This is the era of computers and information technology, which has become an enabler of greater convenience.  Three of the most popular types of computer software programs are:</p> <p>a.            Word processor, which helps the user (secretary) to write and edit         memos, letters and reports.</p> <p>b.      Data management programs or data based, which </p> <p>               helps the user (secretary) to use long lists of data.</p> <p>c.      Spreadsheet programes, which handles tables and numbers.          (Duller and Fielden 1999).</p> <p>     Secretaries now have many technologically advanced office gadgets to ease their jobs and enhance proficiency and productivity, leading to improved access to good and services.</p> <p>     The office of today is highly mechanized/automated.  In many companies, the rate of turnover among office employee continues to be high with the result that proposed reduction in manpower requirements, are compensated by these technological innovations.  Many people have wrong views of who a secretary is, some takes a secretary for a typist, clerk or a receptionist in the paper on the impact of modern technology in today’s offices (Nerner 1972)</p> <p>     Having said much on the general effects, it is good to talk or see how modern technology affects the secretary one by one.  Technology has greatly affected secretarial performance much to the improvement of the profession.  Technology has completely enveloped secretarial performance in a way that it is now safe for one to say that without technology, there is no effective secretarial performance.</p> <p> Some of the ways by which technology has affected secretarial performance includes:</p> <p>a.      The speed and accuracy with which documents are produced are          unrevealed in the history of human skills (Ukeje 2000)</p> <p>b.      Technology has enriched secretarial job and this enrichment has          resulted job satisfaction on the side of the secretaries. (Harding          1985).</p> <p>c.      Technology has brought the whole world to the secretary’s table          he takes organization to the world and brings the world to the          organization. For this reason, every member of the organization          including his boss respects him (NAPSSON 2002).</p> <p>d.      Technology is gradually revising the general misconception and          poor perception of secretaries in the society.  Instead of their          downgrading, they are now being respected and instead of looking          down on secretaries as in previous cases, they are now being          looked upon  (NAPSSON 2002).</p> <p>e.      Technology has broadened the scope of secretarial performance it          has severed the secretary from the derogatory appendage status          to an independent member of the organization, information          manager and custodian of organizational information          reservoir.(NAPSSON2000).</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>     It was discovered that many secretaries graduate with low knowledge and skills of operating machines like computer, duplicating machines etc. because of inadequacy (Okonye 1992).  However most secretaries have problem in their workplace, because they were unable to operate these machines.</p> <p>     Another problem uncounted by secretaries is technological   unemployment, which sometimes result from advancement in technology.  The most common technological unemployment occurs especially when workers have no knowledge of the newly improved equipment.  This problem may result to the displacement of the secretary.</p> <p>     Furthermore on the problem is that most of the machines are very costly ands most small- scale organization finds it difficult to afford them.  When they are able to acquire them, they find it difficult to sponsor their secretaries for the required training.</p> <p>      This study is focus on investigating the extent to which these modern technology, contributes positively or negatively to the secretarial performance.</p> <p>1.3    <strong>Purpose of the study</strong></p> <p>     The objective of this research work is:</p> <p>a.      To determine if modern technology really contributes to the                 secretary’s unemployment.</p> <p>b.            To determine if modern technology truly enhance the              effective   performance of the secretary.</p> <p>c.      To suggest how secretaries should ensure efficiency and          improvement in their performance.</p> <p>1.4       <strong>Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>         The significance of the study arises due to vital role modern          technology plays in the secretarial performance:</p> <p>a.      Since computers, which enables information to be communicated          rapidly are available in most of our offices, secretaries should have          knowledge of these new facilities to avoid inferiority complex.</p> <p>b.      This study will offer suggestions to secretaries on the ways of             improving and encouraging them with the use of these modern          technological facilities.</p> <p>c.      The study will also give suggestions to the management and          governments to provide all these modern facilities and also          training institutions for secretaries.</p> <p>1.5       <strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>     As a guide to the study, the following research questions have been formulated.</p> <p>1.           Is your office automated or equipped with modern   technological         machine?</p> <p>2.      Do modern technological facilities encourage secretaries to          pass information rapidly throughout the organizations?</p> <p>3.      Does the innovation of these modern technological gadgets affect          the attitude of secretaries?</p> <p>4.   Does the introduction of modern technological facilities,     contributes     to the elimination of secretaries from their job?</p> <p>1.6       <strong>Delimitation of the study</strong></p> <p>This research work is limited Institute of Management and Technology (IMT) Enugu, where the management staff and students from selected departments were interacted with and the information gathered sufficiently validated the research work.</p> <p>1.7           <strong>Limitations of the study</strong></p> <p>     This research was hindered by many factors, among which are: unfriendly attitude of our target respondents, also is the problem of and finding suitable materials.   Again the distribution and collection of questionnaires seems very difficult to come by.  , some communication difficulties coupled with the problem of respondent’s failure to return their completed questionnaires.</p> <p>     On the problem of finance and transportation in which the researchers has to pay several visits to offices and lecture rooms and had to wait for several hours on each visit to enable the respondents collect and return the questionnaires and pay attention to the oral questions and finally supplied answers.  There was also meager  time to carry out this research work.</p> <p>1.8       <strong>Definition of terms</strong></p> <p>     For the purpose of this research work, the following key words are defined as follows;</p> <p>a.      AUTOMATION; This means the use of machines to perform          the    routine functions formally done by people or manually.</p> <p>b.       COMPUTER; It is an electronic device that accepts data inform of    input, process the data and produce an output, it also stores and   retrieve information.</p> <p>c.        SECRETARY:  This is employee who combines the major skills of           stenography with competence of filing, reprographics and     telephone techniques in the performance of his/her duties<strong>.</strong></p> <p>d.       REPROGRAGPY:  It is producing several copies of documents out of           the original copy.   </p> <p>e.       VALIDATE: It means to show that something is reasonable or         logical.</p> <p>f.        PERFOMANCE: This is the ability to do something.</p> <p>g.       MODERN TECHNOLOGY:  This is the newly innovated and               improved machine manufactured in industries.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY ON SECRETARIAL PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\"

Pebbles or stones were used after counting, the stones were kept as a reminder of the number of yams remaining in the barn. Sticks were also used to shape and keep record by the people of old like noting the number of sheep and goats in the compound. Some important documents were kept in the local boxes holes were dugged in the ground where money is being saved. The early method of counting, distributing information, communicating and keeping records could not solve some disturbing problems of counting and record keeping. So man still went into discoveries as to have better and fast means of counting, storing messages and distributing information and some other of his undertaking as a result, a lot of discovery and invention of modern machines like computer, telephone, calculator, word processor, electric typewriter, photocopy machines etc.</p> <p>The above mentioned machines/equipment cannot function on its own without somebody operating it or them.</p> <p>Dynamic is the best way to describe today’s office environment that undergoes rapid changes can be seen in office structures and in office positioning from entry level to executive manager’s level. Attentions is now given to what the office does and the way in which office activities previously taken for granted can be accomplished.</p> <p>Aronu (2002) defines information communication technology as the combination of two technologies, computing and the main purpose of which is to transmit representation of information signals between remote locations.</p> <p>The introduction of information and communication technology into the organizations the changes cut across all aspects of works and the office professional as a whole.</p> <p>Information communication technology has replaced the traditional equipment used by office management which are now considered obsolete and office activities and functions are today being undertaken by electronic and computer based technology leading to office automation and a paperless office.</p> <p>Collins (2005) defined Information Communication Technology (ICT) as an application of practical science to industry, commerce, technical method, skills and knowledge. This clearly brings about the advantages of inter-connectivity system used in acquiring, storing manipulating, controlling displaying, transmitting and receiving of information through the internet facilities by means of telephone connected to a computer Montgomeries (2004) defined Information Communication Technology as the handling of pictorial, vocal and numerical information based in a combination of computing and telecommunication. Today’s modern business world has been reshaped and connected to a global system of communication that ensures speedy information and business transaction in an organization.</p> <p>Job performance assesses whether a person performs a job well. Job performance, studies academically as part of industrial and organizational psychology (The branch of psychology that deals with sources management), also forms a part of human resources management. Performance is an important criterion for organizational outcomes and success.</p> <p>John Campbell (2005) described job performance as an individual level variable, or something a single person does. This differentiates it from more encompassing constructs such as organizational performance or national performance, which are higher level.</p> <p>Statement of the Problem</p> <p>The emerging growth of information communication technology and drastic change in office technology operations is posting serious changes to office managers.</p> <p>Golfberg (2005) opined that changes will continue to occur in office technology as well as in the structure of the office to accommodate people and machines to information needs, concern associated with changes should be anticipated job due to information communication and the fear of complex equipments such as video conferencing, facsimile transfer and so on, being introduce into the system has created fear and instability in the office manager.</p> <p>Purpose of the Study</p> <p>The major purpose of this study is to determine the impacts of information communication technology on the job performance of workers in tertiary institution in Anambra State.</p> <p>Specific objectives are as follows;</p> <ul><li>To determine the extent to which computer application influences organizational effectiveness.</li> <li>To ascertain the extent to which IT influences organizational value.</li> <li>To determine the extent to which internet connection influences organization efficiency?</li> <li>To evaluate the extent to which application of modern technology influences workers productivity.</li> </ul> <p>Research Questions</p> <p>The researcher asked the following questions to act as a guide in the study;</p> <ul><li>To what extent does computer application influences organizational effectiveness.</li> <li>To what extent does IT influence organizational value.</li> <li>To what extent does internet connection influences organizational efficiency.</li> <li>To what degree doe applications of modern technology influence works productivity?</li> </ul> <p>Significance of the Study</p> <p>This study will be beneficial to organizations, office practitioners and students. It can also be used for further research.</p> <ul><li>Organization: The study will help treat and improve some existing theories on information as they apply to organizations as well as the office professionals in the areas of human resources management.</li> <li>Further Research: It is also hoped that the findings of this study will contribute to the existing knowledge and information in the area of research.</li> <li>Office practitioners: The significance of this research work is immeasurable both to the practitioner, office professionals, chief executives, personnel managers, the management of the organizations and the public at large. It is expected that the following findings and recommendations of the study will guide the area of study to consider introducing information communication for their office professional efficiency and other human resources departments for effective administration of personnel matters.</li> <li>Student: The study will be useful to student who may wish to write or make some research on a similar topic using this as a point of reference and to re-orient them towards their profession, future research or practical endeavours.</li> </ul> <p>Scope of the Study</p> <p>The study covers ICT as the main key to organizational growth.

Business organizations, especially the banking industry of the 21st century operates in a complex and competitive environment characterized by these changing conditions and highly unpredictable economic climate. in contemporary time the banking system has witnessed a lot of innovation and development in the area of introduction Automated Teller Machine (ATM), telephone banking, internet banking, branch networking, interbank fund transfer and the most recent of all which is now a fad in the banking industry which is the Cashless attention which tend to reduce the amount of money in circulation in the economy.</p> <p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is at the forefront of these global changes. the question now arises ”what is information communication technology”, information can be referred to as processed data or output i.e. any development or action that is meant to be worked upon effects decisions .Irechukwu (2010).</p> <p>Communication can be said to be the means or methods of getting information past from one location to another. i.e. a method through which relationship are established, extended  and maintained through a predefined codes. Elizabeth N. et el(2009)</p> <p>Technology is said to be the process of using state of the art equipment</p> <p>To perform operations efficiently and effectively Laudon and Laudon, (2009).</p> <p>Information communication technology (ICT) is acquisition, processing, storing and dissemination of vocal, pictorial, textual and numerical information by microeconomic base combination of computing and telecommunication (Macmillan et al 2010).</p> <p>Grossman G. and E Helpman 2009, ascert that information communication technology (ICT) stresses the role of unified communication technology and integration of communication (telephone lines and wireless signals) computer middle ware as well as software, storage and visual system which enable users to create ,access ,store, transmit and manipulate information.  Laudon and Laudon, (2009).contend that managers cannot ignore Information Systems because they play a vital role in contemporary organization. They point out that the entire cash flow of most fortune 500 companies is linked to Information System.</p> <p>The application of information and communication technology concepts, techniques, policies and implementation strategies to banking services has become a subject of fundamental importance and concerns to all banks and indeed a prerequisite for local and global competitiveness. ICT directly affects how managers decide, how they plan and what products and services are offered in the banking industry. It has continued to change the way banks and their corporate relationships are organized worldwide and the variety of innovative devices available to enhance the speed and quality of service delivery.</p> <p>Harold and Jeff (2008) contend that financial service providers should modify their traditional operating practices to remain viable in the 2000s and the decades that follow. They claim that the most significant shortcoming in the banking industry today is a wide spread failure on the part of senior management in banks to grasp the importance of technology and incorporate it into their strategic plans accordingly. Woherem (2010) claimed that only banks that overhaul the whole of their payment and delivery systems and apply ICT to their operations are likely to survive and prosper in the future . He advices banks to re-examine their service and delivery systems in order to properly position them within the framework of the dictates of the dynamism of information and communication technology. The banking industry in Nigeria has witnessed tremendous changes linked with the developments in ICT over the years.</p> <p>The quest for survival, global relevance, maintenance of existing market share and sustainable development has made exploitation of the many advantages of ICT through the use of automated devices imperative in the industry. This study evaluates the response of Nigerian banks to this new trend and examines the extent to which they have adopted innovative technologies in their operations and the resultant effects.</p> <p>1.2     Statement of the Problem</p> <p>The advent of information and communication technology on the performanceof the United Bank For Africa among other sectors has brought about several noticeable developments but at the same time, it brings about its attendant problems. There is the problem of banks unable to strictly comply with the mission statement /corporate mission. With information technology, some bank management does not adequately plan to meet the services quality. For example, the required number of customers to be attended to by a cashier within the daily working     hours to guide against long queues is neglected- this causes delay in service delivery time leading to long queues in the banking hall.</p> <p>Another problem is the high incidence of bank fraud borne information technology. This fraud   ranges from ATM card fraud, internet banking fraud, email and text message fraud,     fund transfer to untraceable offshore accounts, among others.</p> <p>1.3    Objectives of the Study</p> <ol><li>To identify how the introduction of information and communication technology has influenced bank performances.</li> <li>To find out the reason why banks nowadays have to abandon the former ways of operations to modern banking.</li> <li>To investigate into the extent of effectiveness and efficiency in banking sectors after the introduction of information technology.</li> <li>To access how information technology helps in the reduction of cost and benefit in increasing the revenue profit of the bank.</li> <li>To access how information technology has affected the customer base of the banks.</li> </ol> <p>1.4     Significance of the study</p> <p>The banking system is required as a catalyst for a rapid macro-economic development of other sectors of the economy; hence, its stability should be the priority of the government most especially during the democratic dispensation. Going by the recent distress in banking industry in Nigeria, the level of public confidence in the sector has dwindled and this has led to the instability syndrome in the sector and as such the public assurance and confidence on efficiency in the private sector in decaying.</p> <p>The major cause of this syndrome can be attributed to the problems inherited in the banks operational system. The quest for globalization and commercialization has brought about innovations in technology. The digital age and the potential threat posed by non-traditional competition which necessitates innovation has made it inevitable for Nigerian commercial banks to improve upon their operation as they face evolving revolution are being confronted with increasingly sophisticated customer base compelling  them to offer today what their customers would be expecting tomorrow. Banks have to deviate from just being a profit making bank to a more conscious customer centered institution.</p> <p>This research will enable banks to identify ways of remaining competitive in the global and domestic financial industry. It also helps prepare banks repositioning towards meeting the challenges imposed by global banking.</p> <p>Also, it is expected that the work will contribute to the bank’s future projections on strategies to be used in attracting depositor’s funds, reduce queues in the banking hall, the bank’s management policies.</p> <p>Finally the research work will also be a contribution to knowledge in academic field and serve as a source of reference to researchers who would carry out research on similar study in the future.</p> <p>1.5     Research Questions</p> <ol><li>How the introduction of information technology does has influenced bank performances.</li> <li>To find out the reason why banks nowadays have to abandon the former ways of operations to modern banking.</li> <li>To investigate into the extent of effectiveness and efficiency in banking sectors after the introduction of information technology.</li> <li>To access how information technology helps in the reduction of cost and benefit in increasing the revenue profit of the bank.</li> <li>To access how information technology has affected the customer base of the banks.</li> </ol> <p>1.6     Scope of the study.</p> <p>The research work covers the impact of information and communication technology on the operations of Nigerian banks in Nigeria. Specifically, the information in this research work is limited to happenings in the UBA Plc, Kaduna. The period of the study is to be focused on 2004-2010.</p> <p>1.7     Limitation of the study.</p> <p>The major limitations of this research work are the constraints encountered in the use of questionnaires for generating data information. Bank customers often find the efficiency of the operational system of the bank in different ways or perspectives; hence, it is not possible to determine the exact level of differences between belief and practice in the banking operation.</p> <p>The bank staffers are not ready to give out information in any form particularly in writing as it may be required in the case of questionnaires due to secrecy. To get information or data from these groups of people, the researcher has to exercise a lot of patience.</p> <p>Due to time and financial capability, the researcher was not able to cover all the products of the bank that has been made possible through information technology.</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY ON THE PERFORMANCE OF UNITED BANK FOR AFRICA PLC<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY ON THE PERFORMANCE OF UNITED BANK FOR AFRICA PLC", "id": 72}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p><em>This project research “The Impact of Modern Communication Facilities on the performance of the Secretary in an Organization”.

Is a fact that all human activities are interdependent on one another socially, economically, culturally and politically. No human being can live in isolation, that is to say human being must pass on and also receive information in every activities that must be done. Communication is one of the fundamental functions of the office and process which is essential to all forms of business. It is the means of conveying information from one person to another, which can be through Telephone, post office, Teleprinter, Mobile phone, Messenger services, Computer and many other means. Communication is done in order to pass or receive information, ideas and knowledge from one person to another.</p> <p>During the past few decades there have been development and improvement in office communication system. This makes the work of today’s trained secretaries to be easier.</p> <p>Azuka (1990), states that the word Secretary is taken from the Latin word “Secretaries”. This means that the Secretary is the ability to keep information or knowledge away from others. But in your own views a secretary is the keeper of secret.</p> <p>Little (1976), defines Communication as “the process by which information is passed between individuals and organization by means of previously agree symbols such as words, fiscal grimaces, gestures, postures, pictorial or usual display etc.</p> <p>1.2    Statement of the Problem</p> <p>The Advent of modern communication facilities has spured up radical changes in the secretarial profession. These changes have been characterized by new methods of doing this, with emphasis on Information and Communication Technology (ICT).</p> <p>According to Ali and Akinbi (1995), technology is an alteration in the life of an equipment, character, knowledge and method of doing things. The impact of these modern communication facilities this resulted into the acquisition of the needed competencies by secretaries, to effectively and efficiently operates these facilities in order to be relevant in the world of Labour. This is because, prior to this time, the communication facilities obtainable in the office were; Analog, Telephone, the manual typewriter, Teleprinter, Duplicating machine, reprographic machines etc.</p> <p>Today Modern Communication facilities which include, computer, internet, mobile phones, fax machine, telegram etc. have replaced the persons existing ones. This had also created another impetus on the secretary, as there is an improvement in the way/she discharge his/her duties. However, the impact of modern communication gadget on the organization goals, have not been properly felt for instance the says in some organization are not still efficient even though there gadget. The problems of modern facilities seem to care a problem for instance some says it must undergo many loose of their job.</p> <p>1.3    Purpose of the Study</p> <p>The overall purpose of this study is to examine the impact of modern communication equipment on the Secretary and the profession. However, the specific objectives of the study are:</p> <ol><li>To identify the modern communication gadgets is the use in organization.</li> <li>To find out the impact of modern communication facilities on the organization goals.</li> <li>To assess the impact of modern communication gadgets on the efficiency of the Secretary.</li> <li>To outline the problems which modern communication facilities pose to the secretary profession.</li> </ol> <p>1.4    Research Questions</p> <ol><li>What are the modern communication gadgets in use in organizations?</li> <li>What are the impacts of modern communication gadgets on organizational goals?</li> <li>What is the impact of modern communication gadgets on the efficiency of the Secretary?</li> <li>What are the problems of modern communication facilities to the Secretary profession?</li> </ol> <p>1.5    Significance of the Study</p> <p>It is hoped that if the importance and the roles of Secretaries in the usage of modern communication equipment in communication is identified, the secretary will benefit from it, because by providing the modern facilities such as computer, mobile phone, Teleprinter, and Printing machine, photo-copy to improve its skills. Also secretarial students will benefit from this modern communication facilities.</p> <p>1.6    Scope/Delimitation of Study</p> <p>The essence of the research work is to find the effects of modern communication facilities on the Secretary. The research work is however, delimited to the following areas: What is communication? Identify the modern communication gadgets in use in organizations, the impact of modern communication facilities on the secretary assess. Communication gadgets on the efficiency of the Secretary and outline the problems which modern communication facilities pose to the secretarial profession.</p> <p>1.7    Definition of Terms</p> <p>These are definition of some words which might sound strange to the readers and which will also make the research work comprehensive and readable.</p> <ul><li><em>Secretary: </em>A person employed by an organization to deal with papers and correspondence keep records and assist his/her boss in the day to day running of the organization.</li> <li><em>Communication: </em>The process of passing ideas, information and documents from one person, location etc. to another though usage of a specified channels.</li> <li><em>Modern: </em>This is the present or recent time(s) or things.</li> <li><em>Impact: </em>The effect or the importance.</li> <li><em>Equipment:</em> Tools or machinery use for specific purposes.</li> <li><em>Secretarial: </em>Duties of a secretary</li> <li><em>Profession:</em> Individual areas of specialization or occupation.</li> <li><em>Computer: </em>It is a machine or an electric device which accepts information from an input device, it also performs arithmetical logical operations in accordance with a pre-defined programme and fully transfer the processed data to an output device either for further processing or in final printed form like business document.</li> <li><em>Word Processing: </em>Getting ideas into words, words into papers and then to the final result and communications.</li> <li><em>NCC: </em>Network Control Center</li> <li>    <em>VDU: </em>Visual Display Unit</li> <li>    <em>CPU: </em>Central Processing Unit</li> <li>     <em>SCPC: </em>Single channel perceiver</li> </ul>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MODERN COMMUNICATION FACILITIES ON THE SECRETARY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF MODERN COMMUNICATION FACILITIES ON THE SECRETARY", "id": 73}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Abstract </strong></p> <p>We live in a digital world in which the amount of information available for human consumption doubles every three years. As information users we expect reliable information at our fingertips, continual connection to people wherever they are, and equipment that fits into a top pocket. Whether we are consumers, clients, students, professors, employees or managers, we expect the digital world to work for us. The concept of information overload is not new, but with the continued growth of digital technology and the plethora of tools and channels for digital communication, the challenge of managing all that information is not getting smaller, and it is increasingly everyone’s responsibility to deal with it.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Todays office business, professional or Government is in a state of change. This change is reflected in the office structure and office positions from entry level to Executive Office Manager Level. Hence attention is now given to what the office does and the way in which office activities can be accomplished in an efficient and an effective way an office manager is responsible for the smooth operation of the day-to-day business of the company, a good office manager makes it possible for other people to function efficiently. Office managers work closely with the company partners, owner, or president to meet their company's staffing, equipment, and organizational needs. Duties may include pricing products from vendors, interviewing job applicants, managing payroll, and reimbursing members of the firm for out-of-pocket business expenses, and so the need for information technology had to come into play as information technology has replaced the traditional equipment used by an office manager to perform his tasks.<br/> Montgomerie (2004), defines information technology as the handling of vocal, pictorial, textual and numerical Information by means of micro-electronic based equipment in computing and telecommunication. This clearly brings about the advantages of information delivery through technological means, since almost all aspects of office work can adequately be taken care of. Aronu (2000) defines Information Technology as the combination of two technologies, computing and the main purpose of which is to transmit representation of information signals between remote locations. The concept of “core competence” has been defined and studied at the organizational level in the management literature as well as in information systems, as exemplified Sambamurthy and Zmud’s work on managerial IT competence. These latter authors state that such competency enables an organization “to effectively acquire, deploy and leverage its IT investments in pursuit of business strategies and in support of business activities” and helps fulfill the objective of aligning IT strategies and business strategies. However, competence at the individual level is required for the creation of core competence at the organizational level. Research on this individual component is incomplete. This paper explores the concept of the IT competence of individual business managers. Based on an examination of the literature in several disciplines and consultations with business and IT managers, we define the IT competence of business managers and identify its sub-dimensions. We also present a theoretical model of the link between IT competence and business-led technology leadership. The model is designed to be empirically tested and used to explore differences in the managers’ leadership in IT projects and partnerships with IT departments.</p> <p>Overtime in the business world, information technology has grown to be one of the cardinal pillars. The importance of information technology cannot be overemphasized in the 21stcentury. Information technology was known to be indispensable in stretching from the early 19th century. Information technology simply put can be regarded or defined as the application of computers to store, retrieve, transmit and manipulate data, often in the context of a business or other enterprise.</p> <p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has been identified as a vehicle with the potential to improve the competency of managers and every staff as well as the efficiency and service delivery of organizations both in the developed and developing countries. Information and communication technologies have changed the face of the world we live in (Benson, 1998).</p> <p>ICT enables people to communicate with family, friends and colleagues around the world instantaneously, gain access to global libraries, information resources and numerous other opportunities. Nelson, 2010 opined that information systems strategy is still not properly understood while ethics and behavioural issues are of concern. There are still staggering losses involved in information technology investment.</p> <p>Competence is defined as the knowledge and skills required for performing and supporting business processes. They represent the basis for creating value in an organization. The following competencies are needed to achieving organizational and managerial success in the field of information technology; Technical Knowledge, Work Coordination, Problem Solving and Prevention, Communication and Service encompass and Accountability which eclipses those skills and abilities required to make decisions and take responsibility for work.</p> <p>Since the year 2001, there has been a revolutionary growth in the telephony industry which is a major branch of information technology in Nigeria. Two years after the introduction of GSM in Nigeria, some researchers conducted an interview among medical practitioners in some organisations to find out the current level of utilization of telephones for customer care service delivery. They noted that managers of the organizations used their personal mobile phones to facilitate customer care at their own detriment. Currently, the number of GSM service providers in the country has increased significantly and all of them keep rolling out several service options or packages including internet services with varying benefits to attract customers (Agboola, 2003).</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The poor performances of businesses in organizations have grossly affected the overall gross domestic product of economic productivity of Nigeria; this has led to the present harsh economic condition, this May be as a result of the poor knowledge and application of information technology in businesses and organizations There is a problem of complexity of managing information technology and systems especially in the corporate environment where a lot is required in the effective application of information technology which has a lot to do with the competency of managers in the adoption of information technology.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Aims and Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to research on information technology competence on business managers.

Different methods and approaches have been adopted severally to savage the situation, but it has yielded no particular positive result. Bad teaching method, poor reading habits, poverty, ill-equipped laboratories and libraries, are among the claims put by scholars that had caused that standard of education in Nigeria. This paper examines the need to enhance the learning and teaching process in tertiary education through balance student-staff and student–student relationship to achieve a sustainable tertiary education system that will produce optimal results thereby salvaging the falling standard of education in Nigeria.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>Abstract</p> <p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Background of Study</p> <p>Statement of the problem</p> <p>Purpose of the Study</p> <p>Research Question</p> <p>Chapter II</p> <p>Literature Review</p> <p>Chapter III</p> <p>Findings</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>Recommendation</p> <p>Reference</p> <p>CHAPTER I</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Background of the Study</p> <p>‘‘In view of the central nature of staff relationship, and the almost universal assumption that institution benefits management staff, and the importance of scholarship, it is perhaps surprising how relatively few institution have specific policies in place to either monitor or to develop and maximize these  beneficial synergies’’, (J.M consulting 200, p.16).</p> <p>Academic leaders and managers need to understand the conditions likely to facilitate links between management staff of an institution and the relationship existing within them (member of staff) and those that inhibit connections and seek to compartmentalize academic activities (Locke, 2004, pp. 108)</p> <p>This publication seeks to support institutional policy- makers to enable their institutions to maintain a cordial relationship between the members of staff and discipline – based scholarship more effectively. The focus however, is on supporting the relationships between staff and the inter-relationship among member of staff a higher institution of learning with respect to policies and practices.</p> <p>In terms of the work of the higher education academy, we seek to support its strategic aim of working with institutions in their strategies for improving the students learning experience’’ (higher education and academy, 2005a.) and to ensure that the advice is based on research evidence. Ultimately, the central issue that national system and institution hade decide is ‘’what is distinctive about higher education?’’ however, what is distinctive about higher education is supporting student and the wider society understanding of the complexities of the worlds in which we live</p> <p>Although, for many staff, their motivations and the sense of their role is highly shaped by both their own appreciation of, and belief I the value of relationship to other member wider society. While there is evidently much practice in realizing these values we also have to recognize that it is unevenly distributed, much is implicit and many institutional policies in this area are poorly developed and sometimes work against nexus.</p> <p>In the long run, more recent research demonstrates the potential value of staff relationship to student learning and for motivating student to learn. This research also how that the linkage is not automatic, and has to be built systematically into the curriculum, department institutional and national planning questioning the value or possibility of the link also stems from the realities of mass higher education. Thus, the linkage might once have been readily assumed or delivered with small classes, selective student entry, and staff with time to teach and relate effectively clearly, if that golden age ever existed, it has now gone.</p> <p>Paul Ramsden (2001), then pro-vices- chancellor (learning and teaching) at the university of Sydney and now chief executive of the higher education academy, expressed this works perspective when her stated ‘’the main hope for relating a genuinely student-centered undergraduate education lies in re-engineering the enter academic institution of higher learning. The word ‘engineer’ suggests that the link does not occur automatically; it has to be designed; ‘created’; constructed; and brought about. The word ‘reengineer’ suggest that even if once the linkage did exist, it now needs significant ‘re-inventing’ to ensure it is in place or, even better, that it is embedded in many places and processes. Therefore, there is much that individual, course teams, department and national systems can and should do to forge these links (Jenkins et al, 2003).</p> <p>Statement of the Problem</p> <p>“The mission statement included retaining a core commitment to learning-based teaching and enhancing scholarship through clearly linking research, professional practice and teaching. However, it was difficult to find this mission executed in the policy statement. For example the only instance in the process of appointment, continuation, promotion, performance review, or application for study leaves for promotion to the rank of senior lecturer, whereby there was a criterion under the teaching  category, ‘ application’ of research to teaching. There was no reference to the nexus in proposal for new course student evaluation forms, review of department or internal grants procedure. We suggest that if such a case study was conducted in most universities, there would be a similar pattern of rewarding the parts separately, but rarely the nexus. It is therefore not surprising that the context in which academic works is part of the explanation as to why there is a zero relationship between teaching and learning.

The Webster Dictionary of English (2005) however, defined a Secretary as one trusted with secret of or confidence of a superior, adviser, confident or one employed to handle correspondence   and manage routine and detailed work for a superior. This depicts that a secretary is a skilled personnel who possess both executive and personal attributes in managing the affairs of any organization effectively and efficiently in order to achieve organizational objective. From this description, Onasanya (1990) defines a Secretary as someone who possess adequate knowledge of administration or organization and the ability to achieve results through hard work and management of resources or people on behalf of his/her boss. Its classification depends basically on experience and their functions are diverse and this depends largely on the field of specification. The cadre of secretaries tends to determine and at the same time modify the function of such secretary.</p> <p>According to Rule and Byars (1983), performance is the degree of accomplishment of the tasks that makes up on individual job, but the performance of these function can be greatly inhibited by certain functions.</p> <p>According to Alancik and Fetter (1977) a job is satisfying when there is a match between the characteristic of the job and the needs of the individuals. The determinants include self-evolution, expectation, social norms, social comparisons, commitment etc, for instance, if on e expects a job to be paying well,  and it is not, them he/she will be dissatisfied. Also if one is not evaluated up to the standard, she will also not be happy (dissatisfied).</p> <p>The Secretary’s satisfaction leads to organization commitment, while dissatisfaction result in behaviors is know to the organization. (Turnover, absentee’s, low morale, etc).</p> <p>Those who are dissatisfied with their work never reach psychological maturity. They feel frustrated. Employees who like their jobs and other job related factors will be loyal and devoted employees. However, employees who strongly dislike and dissatisfied with their job or any other job related factors will often exhibits these feelings by taking absent or by taking more convert actions to disrupt the organization.</p> <p>A Conflict is a serious disagreement or argument. Conflict has become a feature of labor management relationship in Nigeria while Secretaries and   Bosses in the industries should work harmoniously together for the betterment to the fulfilled in practice. Secretaries and bosses tend to have opposite views. This is because of the divergence between the expectation of management and labor in an Establishment.</p> <p>Statement of the problem</p> <p>The Secretary is flexible, technically good in their jobs and they are determined. Public concern regarding the conflicts of bosses and secretaries in Nigeria has been on the increase in recent times. It is observed that many qualified secretaries desecrate their jobs and take to other professions entirely different from Secretarial profession. Many Secretaries that choose to remain in the profession do not seek ways of improving their management in an organization.</p> <p>Generally, the concern is more on the conflicts between Bosses and Secretaries; no mention is ever made of the factors responsible of these conflicts. Certain questions need to be asked in an attempt to recognize those factors that causes the conflicts in state owned establishment.</p> <p>Purpose of the Study</p> <p>        The major purpose of this study is:</p> <ul><li>To basically investigate some of the causes of conflicts between Bosses and Secretaries in State owned Establishment.</li> <li>To examine the damages which conflicts between bosses and secretaries caused to different industries</li> <li>To find out the consequences of such conflicts</li> <li>To suggest remedy and strategies for solving conflicts between Bosses and secretaries in state owned establishment.</li> </ul> <p>Significance of the Study</p> <p>The study is significant for the following reasons:</p> <p>The result of the study will enable the Management to formulate a policy toward conflicts resolution in establishment industries.</p> <p>It will help to highlight some of the factors which cause conflict between bosses and secretaries in a state establishment (AHOCOL) so that management will appreciate the seriousness of the problem.</p> <p>The study will also enable the management to formulate policies towards conflicts resolution in industries.

The result is increased performance and productivity. If a job fails to appear compelling or interesting and leads to employee dissatisfaction, it means the job has to be redesigned based upon the feedback from the employees’ Some advantages of job enlargement are a variety of skills, improves earning capacity, and wide range of activities. Variety of skills-Job enlargement helps the organization to improve and increase the skills of the employee due to organization as well as the individual benefit. Improves earning capacity-with all the new activities a person learns from job enlargement, they are able to try to get a better salary when they apply for a new job. Wide range of activities-Employees are able to learn more activities which can help a company save money by reducing the number of employees they have. However results have shown that this process can see its effects diminish after a period of time, as even the enlarged job role become the mundane, this in turn can lead to similar levels of demotivation and job dissatisfaction at the expense of increased training levels and costs. The continual enlargement of a job over time is also known as 'job creep,' which can lead to an unmanageable workload. <strong>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong> Business organization exist because they have goals to attain. It is through people that organizational goals are achieved. In fact people are the most important assets of any organization. Their performance determined the success or failure of an organization. It is the concern of management that workers carry out their task effectively. Therefore the human factor must be managed properly for positive impact on productivity by provision of a goal. Job design is the way job are structured, designed or tailored towards achievement of organizational goals. Organizations needs job designed that will enhance their performance and help them achieve their self-esteem. Job design is important to an organization because the way job are structured designed or coordinated has direct and significant impact on the performance of the organization. Job design concerns the content functions and relationships of jobs that are directed towards the accomplishment of organizational purpose and satisfaction of the personal needs of the individual’s job holders. This also showed that a secretary needs a good job design that will help her to enhance her potentials as well as help in accomplishing organizational goals. According to Onasanya (1990), stated that the secretary is an important officer in any establishment. The contributions and effectiveness of a secretary can either enhance or diminish the efficiency of an organization. He also stated that the title secretary may either refer to a chief administrator of an organization or to a person who performs the functions of organizing and recording the proceedings of a meeting. The duties of a secretary could be likened to that of the executive because the secretary is aware of nearly every action of the executive, many organizations attach little or no importance to the qualities of a secretary not to talk of giving them a benefiting job design. Stanwell and Shaw (1978) defined secretary as a staff who is concerning with the preparation, preservation and transmission of all types of communication as well as the conventional secretarial duties of confidential nature at various levels. Eni (1989) also defined the secretary as a member of clerical staff whose fundamental function are concerned with the preparation of correspondence or communication in all form with and outside the organization. From the above definitions, it can be seen that secretary is an indispensable management personnel in an organization and outside environment. Considering the job of a secretary in an organization they deserve a job design that is motivating. Also, Durcker (1978), stated and asserted that an organization needs the best performance a man is capable of and a man needs more than a job he can perform. He need a job that will provide the greatest scope of his abilities and talent the best opportunity for growth and for superior performance. The secretary position varies widely depending on the size of the organization the number of workers employed, the nature of the business as well as personal qualities. Today the secretary’s job has also been hanged due to computerization their job became more challenging than ever because of the current technological design. A research on job design will not be complete without making mention of motivation. Motivation is a way of stimulating people into action. Therefore, the redesigning of a secretary job will not only focus on the key job characteristics, dimensions of contents function and relationships, but also considering the important of individual differences in relation to job design consequences. Birdchall (1975) stated that an understanding of human motivation is essential to the job designer. The job which he creates may be technical depending upon the cooperation and involvement of the job holder. Therefore, he must be aware of the important role of work in a man’s life in order that he is better able to engineer a fit between human needs and technical requirement of the work. Work is an aspect of life which gives man his status and binds him to the society. Discontent may result from individual failure to find satisfaction in his job not meeting his psychological and social needs. The feeling that his contribution to the organization is not being adequately compensated rewarded or recognized by the organization. The high level of job specialization promoted by scientific management approach created a number of problems centering on the individual workers moral and behavior example low satisfaction, high absenteeism and low turnover were partially attributed to the boredom and monotony created by highly specialized routine nature of individual employee’s work. The introduction of an effective job design in the job of a secretary will show improvement in the secretarial job performance. These changes come through job content function, relationship and feedback of jobs. <strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong>             These are the problems which the researcher intended to find out the solution at the end of           the study.             Most secretaries cannot perform better due to the kind of job design structure given to      them.             Sometimes job design given to them create a feeling to them that their contribution are not adequately compensated, recognized or needed in the organization. They feel demoralized when they see their job as the one that have no definite sequence or procedure for doing it. Because they feel demoralized or humiliated by their broiling managers they feel they cannot satisfy their psychological and social needs             These problems and so many others are what the researcher intend to find out the             solution to in this study. <strong>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong> The following are the purpose of this study</p> <ol><li>To find out the effects of improper job design on secretarial performance</li> <li>To examine some of the job design strategies that exists in most organization.</li> <li>To investigate if a secretary’s work is that have a definite job design</li> <li>To find out if secretaries satisfy their psychological and social needs.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong> The research questions used in this project work is: 1.      Does job design have any effect on secretarial performance of proper job? 2.      Does job design has strategies that exists in various organization? 3.      Does a secretary’s work have a definite job design? 4.      Does secretaries satisfy their psychological and social needs? <strong>1.5       RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS </strong><strong>            Hypothesis i</strong>             Hi: There is no significance relationship between job design and secretarial proper job        performance proper job             Ho:  There is a significance relationship between job design and secretarial proper job performance proper job  <strong>1.6       SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong> This simply means the geographical and subject area of the study. The scope of the study is delimited to the effect of job design on a secretarial performance in Ethiope West Local Government Council. <strong>1.7       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY.</strong> This study will help managers to understand fully how an effective job design will enhance performance of their secretaries. It will also help organizations to identify those factors inherent in the secretarial job design that will affect the performance of the secretary and             Finally it will help the students and lecturers in the future as a reference material in the      library. <strong>1.8       </strong><strong>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong>                         The short period of time given for the work of this nature is rather too sort and      another limitation faced was the problem of collecting data suitable for this research work.                         The research of this nature requires large amount of money, due to the economic    situation and given d fact that as a student who depends of the goodwill of others to source       financial support. The finance require for this project was not readily available to the tone             it requires, hence the research did all she could to get the best result to be little or limited resource available. <br/><br/></p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF JOB DESIGN ON SECRETARIES PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF JOB DESIGN ON SECRETARIES PERFORMANCE", "id": 77}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>              Our society is dynamic and not static.

In today’s business, important decisions and policies are based upon the availability and up-to-date information through proper and effective filing of documents.</div> <div>           The risks are too great for the executive decisions to be based upon hear-say or rumors therefore, a business man cannot hope to remain in a field that is competitive without a comprehensive and sufficient information system.</div> <div>           A sole business has little need for filing as the information is either booked or recorded in his mind. However, as the business grows into partnership into public limited company, there will be increase on the volume of paper. The modern office is defined with various documents in forms of letter, sales of bulletin orders, way bills, wages record, delivery note, remittance, cheque, statements of account, or received from credited customers and governments’ agencies. Most of these records may be requiring in future for references.</div> <div>            If these records are not properly kept, it may be difficult to get them when they are needed for any action.</div> <div>             As every organization received and sent out great deals of correspondence every day, these documents are kept where they can be in the future through the process of filing. Communities of modern days rely greatly on filing.  It is important for business, social clubs or activities government.</div> <div>             Filing is the activity relating to the organization and which are kept for future purpose. They are predicted for the continued and successful operations of firms. The keepings of file are memory of an organization. It is followed by terms, which bore an important filing, find it impossible to continue operating. More so, an organization that overlooked the importance of filing system will disorganize and get crumble for example, developed countries like USA, UK, to mention just few of them could attach their development to onward improvement upon what has been achieve in times past rough ages by being able to handle the kings and scribes, applications of machine and equipment data management and improvements on them.</div> <div>                    It is therefore imperative for any organization to take a very good care of its record by grouping them as they are produced daily, weekly, and monthly and so on, into different categories according to the needs of their preservation.</div> <p>                    As a result of the above, the sufficient of running of an office depends widely in the existence of a good and effective filing system manned by competent staff and aided by s good indexing system through the use of files.<br/></p>\n\nIMPACT OF EFFECTIVE FILING SYSTEM IN ORGANIZATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF EFFECTIVE FILING SYSTEM IN ORGANIZATION", "id": 78}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></div> <div>The secretary success book is computer the core skill needed by any secretary seeking promotion or a move into management.

Since some organizations or industries are purely profit oriented, it is quite a big responsibility on the part of the employer to make the working condition suitable and attractive to the employee for maximum output in production. The sole responsibility of this working condition is channelled through the personnel manager who serves as a link between the employee and employer. The investigation was carried out under the following headings: Chapter two deals with different people’s opinion about the topic. This comes under literature review.

One of the most important responsibilities of any organization is the management and development of people. Without management, an organization is but a muddle of men and machines. It is the human factor, which binds a group together and motivates it towards goals. Management activities such as planning, organizing and decision-making are dormant until the manager triggers the power of motivation in people and guide them towards their goals.</div> <div>Personnel management according to Ojiakor (2011) is “that part of human resources which co-ordinates, controls and directs other resources, such as materials, money, etc to achieve the desired objectives. This definition has two implications. Firstly, personnel managers are concerned with managing activities involved in optimizing the performance of the human resources.</div> <div> Ibekwe (1984) defines personnel management as the directing, co-ordinating and controlling of all the responsibilities for supply of required human resources and optimizing their performance.</div> <div>Adam (1966) defines personnel management as “the organizing and training of people at work with the objective of getting each employee to make the highest possible contribution to the success of organization and to be happy in his work”.</div> <br/> <div>Therefore, personnel management is indispensable to all organizations and other collective enterprise since industries and organizations are purely profit oriented. It is quite a big responsibility on the part of employer to make the working condition suitable and attractive to the employees for maximum output. The sole responsibility of this working condition is channelled through the personnel manager who serves as link between the employees and the employer. </div> </div>\n\nINVESTIGATING INTO THE PROBLEMS OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT AND ITS EFFECT ON WORKERS’ PRODUCTIVITY <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INVESTIGATING INTO THE PROBLEMS OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT AND ITS EFFECT ON WORKERS’ PRODUCTIVITY ", "id": 80}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This research project titled “The impact of on-the-job training to effective performances of secretaries” was carried out using Union bank of Nigeria PLC, Challenge, Ibadan as case study.

Also the word “secretary” is taken from the Latin word “Secretus” meaning “A notary scribes are professional letters writers and were known to be keeper of secret. Therefore, the term “secretarial practice” combines all the duties performed and carried out in the administrative department of an organization and all these duties can be performed by a trained secretary.</div> <div>          Secretarial profession is for specialists who have undergone some special training in secretarial activities. It is a kind of profession that some wayward professional and academicians cannot venture into, because it requires sound knowledge of short hand writing, typing, knowledge of reception and telephoning activities, recording of minutes of the meetings, knowledge of filling and indexing, employers correspondence and knowledge of accounting.</div> <p>          Secretarial practice is not for those who do not acquire secretarial skills as people believe that anybody can perform secretarial duties. <br/></p>\n\nSECRETARIAL PRACTICE IN THE BANKING SECTOR: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SECRETARIAL PRACTICE IN THE BANKING SECTOR: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS", "id": 87}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1      INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div>            The secretarial has to come a long way.

Offices are now equipped with how modern  electronic machine.</p> <p>At the turn of the century most written information was compiled  by hand, in pen and ink, copies  were  made by hand, an communication was by letter,  telegraph or in person. Today most of the  tedious  functions related to information handling  and processing  and done through the  computer and telecommunication systems, these systems have evolved to the point where a manager can be in touch with his  business  form his or her home, car or in mid-flight</p> <p>Managing  information is one of the most challenging tasks facing most business offices today, be it private public, government  or multo-national corporations. Recants innovations information technology have necessitated  the need for constant review of  new technical  method and equipment in information  processing. This  will also  result in constant review of our information  processing  system. This new innovations should help keep the business  information  system current and every accurate  so that quality  decisions can be made at every level.</p> <p>Today, the outcome of technology is newspaper less  office occasioned by office information and communication system  with the tools of information  and communication system such as E-mail, internet,  fax telex, telephone, world wide web (www) and  video conferencing the etc. office and services  have  become much easier, faster, and satisfaction  the world has  turned  into a computer age,  through the element of office  information and  communication system. It was and is still the key enabler  to this new way of working  that has  transformed the landscape  of todays business  (Umunnah, 2003) .</p> <p>In the view of O. bring (2002) office information  and communication system is the  use of microelectronic  equipment  for processing information and communication. Information  and communication system is the  discipline encompassing  computer systems, telecommunication  networks and  multi- media application, little wonder Ojukwu and Ojukwu, (2002) defined the term as the acquisition  processing, storage, and dissemination.  Of vocal  pictorial  textual and numerical  information  by microelectronic  based  on combination of computing  and telecommunication. Office information  and communication  system are  advantageous in changing workers attitude  to work especially the secretaries  investablishign efficiency in communication,  in profit, in operating new jobs and effective in mass education. In deed, office  work would have been cumber some and organization goals  and objective unattainable without the tools of office information and communication system.</p> <p>There is need that current development  in the  area of office information and communication system, should  be investigated with  view of identifying  skills  that  should be infused onto  today’s secretaries.</p> <p>This is necessary so as to  bridge the gap between institutional training  and work  place demands for specific skill o3 brim (2002) urged business  and office educators to use  appropriate methodology to  discover what requirement  and abilities (ie skill) are needed  by secretaries  in the todays business  to respond technological advances in the collection,  processing, storage and retrieval of  information he opined that the new ability  requirements  should be converted into educational objectives  in forma of performance  goals  that  explicitly  and unambiguously  described jobs  and task in  the business  of today.</p> <p>The need for secretaries to posses skills  in handling office  information and communication  system  for effective job performance in the  business of today cannot be over emphasized no business  of today can function or flourish  effectively with out proper application  of office information and communication  systems in this period of sophisticated information  and communication  technologies  and succeed in face at stuff  competitions from rivalries in todays business. So  far that these office information and communication  system are indispensable  for  efficient  management  information  and  communication , therefore, the secretary’s  skills  are the  major determinate to the level of success to be achieved in the applicator of these  system.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p> The sophistication  of office  information  and communication  systems  no doubt has crated a lot of problems that  need to be taken care of . for all  types  of organization to succeed in today’s rapidly  changing  environment , they  need to be able to  process  data and use  information  effectively. In conducting their day- to-day operations, organizations use information  for functions such as planning, controlling organizing  and decision  making. For  instance  most secretaries  in todays business  cannot operate modern equipment that  is used or found  in the office  today. For  example faxing, E-mailing, and  sourcing for information in the web, securing information  by using  password.</p> <p>Therefore the problem of this study is to ascertain the office information and communication  system  skills needed by secretaries in today’s business.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        The  main purpose  of this study is to investigate on the  basic office information and communication system skills needed by secretaries  in todays business.</p> <p>Concisely, this study seek to ascertain the following such as.</p> <p>    To identify the office information  and communication system  skills needed  by secretaries in  today’s  business  for operating fax machine.</p> <p>    To determine the telephone skills needed by secretaries in today’s</p> <p>    To find out the telecommunication  skills needed  by secretaries  in today’s business.</p> <p>    To assess the skills needed by secretaries on computer/word processing operation.</p> <p>    To analyze the communication system skills needed by secretaries  in the operation of internet relay chart and video conferencing.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        It is hoped that this  study will be great benefits to management  in business organization and government  parasites, as it will make  them  identify  know more about office  information and communication system  skills required in any modern business organization.</p> <p>Many, if not most business uses  computer  to process  data into useful information. There are few  modern offices  which have not introduced some aspects of compute operations into their  information processing tasks. It is  therefore very likely thatm upon entering the business environment  the secretary will be required to use a compute to interact with her company’s computer-based  information system  to perform  many of her processing  tasks.</p> <p>Therefore, it is crucial that successful office information  and communication system  skills should  enhance  the qualify  of work life for a majority</p> <p>Of employees while facilitating business processes. Secretaries cannot be complacent and rely on their basic  office skills. The ability to be  corner sant will computer, word  processing , desktop publishing  equipment, data-base, spread sheets, computer  application  and future  innovation will be an essential requirement needed.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>    What office information and communication system skills needed by secretaries in today’s business for operating fax machine?</p> <p>    What E-mail skills is needed secretaries in today’s  business?</p> <p>    What telecommunication skills needed by secretaries in today’s  business?</p> <p>    What are the skills needed by secretaries in computer/ word processing operation?</p> <p>    What communication system skills needed by secretaries in the operation of internet relay chart and video conferencing.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study aims at convening  the office information and communication system skills needed by secretaries  in today’s  business.The study covers the entire Owerr using  selected corporate business establishment both  public and private  organization.</p>\n\nIMPACT OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY  IN TODAY’S BUSINESS  ENVIRONMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY  IN TODAY’S BUSINESS  ENVIRONMENT", "id": 94}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/> The survey of good filing system and classification is one that has got to do with a classification in use in the personnel department of federal polytechnic Nekede Owerri.   In an office where there is no good filing system and classification, it is bound to fail in its dealings within and outside the organization.  The survey of filing system is very significant and cannot be over emphasized in terms of records filing.  It is easier to refer to a particular document at nay point in time especially when documents are properly filed.  A faulty filing classification will make the record keeping of an organization to be a very tedious job just because the information are no readily handled and also available.</p>\n\n EFFECT OF GOOD FILLING SYSTEM ON PRODUCTIVITY OF A SECRETARY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  EFFECT OF GOOD FILLING SYSTEM ON PRODUCTIVITY OF A SECRETARY", "id": 95}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/></p> <p>This project studied office skills competencies needed by secretaries for effective job performance.

Background to the study </strong></p> <p>For decades now, fast changes have been taking place in all facets of human life including the office environment. This is as a result of technological advancement. Every office in today’s business world, be it government, industry or other human endeavors, require facts and accurate information for quick decision-making. The office worker, including the secretary, expects certain support from the organization into which he/she is employed. This support can be technological (machines and equipment) and human. In offices of past, manager’s dictated memos and letters and secretaries typed them. Most recently, business have developed word processing centers and relied on personal computers and even electronic mail in an effort to lessen the need for secretarial support and make the employee-secretary very productive (Ezoem, 1995; Osuala, 2004).</p> <p>As a result of changes in technology, the role of secretaries in business has changed tremendously from that of typewriting and shorthand dictation, answering of telephone calls and processing of mails. Today’s secretaries are exposed to office technology including the internet that make work much easier and knowledge more accessible (Edwin, 2008). It is now easier to send messages by telex, electronic mails (e-mails), fax and telephones. Other office gadgets available to the secretary are photo-copy machines, duplicating machines, dictating machines, printers, among others. This is the era of computers and information technology which has become an enabler of greater convenience. Three of the most popular types of computer software programs are word processing, which help the user to write and edit memos, letters and reports, data management programs or databases, which help the user/ secretary to use long lists of data and spreadsheet programs, which handle tables and numbers (Dulek and Fielden, 1999).</p> <p>Secretaries now have many technologically advanced office gadgets to ease their jobs and enhance proficiency and productivity leading to improved access to goods and services globally (Wofersohn, 2001). There are wide range of office machines and equipment which now enable secretaries to improve their performances. Such new machines take the form of electronic typewriters that have replaced the manual ones. Word processors with milt-purpose facilities, computers and other sophisticated office machines and equipment are now provided by employers. Some of the physical equipment used by secretaries includes computer communication equipment and electronic pocket organizers (Lucas, 1997).  New technological equipment that has altered the procedures and technique for office functions include the computers, electronic mail/ commerce, voice mail, and the Internet.</p> <p>However, these new developments brought by technological challenges require even more knowledge and skills beyond being a professional secretary. For the secretary to be abreast with the changing times, face the challenges and overcome the old ways of doing things she or he needs training requirements in recent times to help meet organizational objectives. Information technology has affected many professions in recent times. The roles of secretarial professionals have been turned around by technology. It has provided the tools that shift the role of secretaries from that of information recorders to business strategists (Appah and Emeh, 2011). Several other authors are of the view that the secretary has to be well equipped to meet the present challenges of a modern office.</p> <p>The ministry of Education is one of the key ministries for the Government of Ghana. The overall goal of the Ministry is to provide relevant and quality education for all Ghanaians especially the disadvantaged to enable them acquire skills which will make them functionally literate and productive to facilitate poverty alleviation and promote the rapid socio-economic growth of the country.  In order to achieve its broad objectives the ministry has employed a significant number of secretaries to perform clerical works. This study seeks to examine the level of productivity of the secretaries in the context of modern office technologies.</p> <p><strong>1.2. Statement of The Problem</strong></p> <p>An automated office, undoubtedly, offers new roles and responsibilities for the secretary. Such new roles presuppose that additional training and qualifications are required from the secretaries. The relevance of automation in business was identified by Aromolaran (2003) as follows</p> <p>i.) Creating a distinct career path for the secretary.</p> <p>ii.) Automation creates a prominent place for the secretary on the organization chart.</p> <p>iii.) It creates routine and assigned roles for the secretary.</p> <p>iv.) With automation the secretary now spends less time in correcting, revising, proof-reading and reproducing documents.</p> <p>Cameron (1982), a very long time ago, commented that it takes up to 10 to 15 years between the introduction of new equipment in the market and its installation in small organizations. This is particularly peculiar to private business organizations in developing countries. In modern times, it is not uncommon to find some organizations still subjecting secretaries to the use of manual typewriters. When secretaries are not provided with efficient and effective working tools, productivity is definitely bound to be low.</p> <p>Duniya (2011) also observed that due to the introduction of sophisticated technological (electronic) office equipment into today’s office and the role secretaries need to play in ensuring accuracy and efficiency in their jobs, the secretaries need to meet the challenges by acquiring new skills and competencies for efficient operations in the electronic office. There is continuous advancement in technology which has affected the secretarial profession in terms of the quality, speed and accuracy of works performed.</p> <p>This study is therefore undertaken in order to gain understanding about the perception of students on office technologies on secretaries’ productivity in Osun state polytechnic, Iree</p> <p><strong>1.3 Aim and Objectives of Study</strong></p> <p>The main aim of the study is to examine the impact of modern office technologies on secretaries’ level of productivity at the Head office of the Ministry of Education. Specifically, the research aims at achieving the following objectives.</p> <p>    To ascertain the range of new office technologies existent in Osun state polytechnic</p> <p>    To investigate the level of usage of these new office technologies in Osun state polytechnic</p> <p>    To identify the level of productivity of the secretaries in Osun state polytechnic</p> <p><strong>1.4 Research Questions</strong></p> <p>In order to achieve the objectives of this study a number of questions would be explored. Consistent with the topic and objectives the following questions will guide the study;</p> <p>    What are new office technologies in Osun state polytechnic?</p> <p>    What range of new office technologies exist in Osun state polytechnic?</p> <p>    What is productivity and how is it measured in Osun state polytechnic?</p> <p>    Does the introduction of office technologies impact on secretaries’ productivity?</p> <p><strong>1.5 Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>Geographically, the study covers Osun state polytechnic, Iree, which is situated at the ministry enclave in the Accra metropolis as a case study. Contextually, the study focuses on students perceptions technologies and their impact on secretaries’ productivity.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>To date, just a handful studies have been published that looks at modern office technologies and secretaries’ productivity in African nations and more particularly, in Nigeria. This study intends to contribute to a greater comprehension of the subject of matter. From a practitioner’s perspective, the results of the study will provide a benchmark that can be used in assessing the effectiveness of the implementation of new office technologies in an office environment as well as define key productivity factors.  </p> <p>Finally, this study will provide a foundation for future researches as this will serve as a motivation for many researchers to further examine other aspects of the subject matter.</p> <p><strong> 1.7 Organization of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study is organized into five chapters. Chapter one of the thesis discusses the overview of the study, problem definition, research question, research objectives, significance of the study. Chapter two presents all the relevant literature review on waste management and its related concepts.  Chapter three addresses the identification of the most suitable research methodology for this research and chapter four presents a data analysis of findings gathered from the field. Finally, chapter five presents the summary of findings, conclusion, and made relevant recommendations.</p>\n\nSTUDENTS PERCEPTION OF SECRETARIAL PROFESSION IN THE ERA OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STUDENTS PERCEPTION OF SECRETARIAL PROFESSION IN THE ERA OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY", "id": 97}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>        An office cannot effectively function without secretary. A secretary is very important in every organization. Secretary is the pillar of every organization. The objectives of an organization can hardly be achieved if a secretary is not employed. The success or failure of any organization depends on the secretary. The impression the secretary creates influence the attitude of the public towards the organization. Every secretary must be able to handle office equipment such as typewriter, converting hand written materials into printed forms mail room equipment, dispatch and receive of mails telephone instrument for communication purposes and the computer, a powerful equipment which renders itself to various uses. All these activities and many others not described here from the duties attributable to confidential secretaries.</p> <p>        Therefore, before appraising the major roles confidential secretaries play in the civil service of Anambra State. Let us have a brief concept of which a secretary means. Confidential secretary has been defined in various ways.</p> <p>        A confidential secretary is an assistance to an executive possessing a mastery of the office, the person must demonstrate the ability to accept responsibility without direct supervision assigned direction.</p> <p>        A mere servant, his position is that he has to do what he is told and no person can assume he has any authority to represent anything at all.</p> <p>        The above definition was made when the education status of secretaries has not been enhanced and their duties not clearly identified. As time goes on the positive of confidential secretaries has started to experience what can be termed as modification is occasioned by technological development, which afforded advancement in secretarial field. Many scholars and association formulated a coherent definition of secretary. Homby (1942) in his dictionary identified a secretary as: An employee in an office who deals with correspondence, keeps records, make arrangement and appointment for a particular member of the staff and usually called private secretary.</p> <p>        The importance of a secretary and his work in any organisation cannot be overemphasized he is the gateway of every employer as he is the first person to be seen.</p> <p>        According to Unwin (1982) a secretary is an ambassador of an organization, more often. He is the first person whom customer or members of the general public come in contact. A secretary is also a person to speak than on the telephone, and first impressions are important, therefore, the secretary has the responsibility of representing the organization.</p>\n\nAN APPRAISAL OF THE ROLES AND POSITION OF CONFIDENTIAL SECRETARIES IN THE CIVIL SERVICE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN APPRAISAL OF THE ROLES AND POSITION OF CONFIDENTIAL SECRETARIES IN THE CIVIL SERVICE", "id": 98}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>This study was carried out on the impact of office environment on the job performance of office workers, Abeokuta metropolis was used to elicit information’s from the (3) local government which are: Odeda local government, Abeokuta North Local government and Abeokuta South local government.

The study revealed that a better office environment motivates employees. Inadequate facilities and salary structure were major challenges affecting the job performance of office workers. This study recommends that government should provide adequate facilities and equipments for workers. Also, proper illumination should be provided and good security should be provided.  </em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The efficiency of office employees is directly or indirectly affected by the conditions under which they are required to do their work which affect the performances of workers and the achievement of organizational objectives for this purpose, this study will focus its attention on the impact of poor office environment on the job performance of office workers in an organization.</p> <p>Pillai (2005) defines an office as a place where records for the purpose of control, planning and efficient management of the organization are prepared, handled and preserved.</p> <p>Egbe and Ejiofor (2007) defined office as a place where clerical activities take place.</p> <p>In a clear statement, the office is a service delivery unit of an organization; such services may include secretarial, clerical, accounting and research duties. These are vital duties that complement or facilitate the work of executives that complement or facilitate the work of executives of an organization. An office reflects the company’s value, attitude and wealth, an office is the company’s handful image for both the workers and visitors and it provides the stage on which the more active element of the company performs for their customers, staff and community. Above all, an office is designed to stimulate environments that encourage activity.</p> <p>Therefore, an office cannot be defined without the knowledge of its environment. An office environment is a business community where socio-economic or business activities are performed with a view to achieve organizational goals. It should be known that every business system lies within an environment in enhancing work motivation and job satisfaction is necessary in all organization. An organizational management should look into work motivation and conducive environment as antidote for enhancing productivity and influences the amount of work interest and happiness of workers.</p> <p>The office environment are consisted of office building, furniture and layout, lighting, good ventilation, color decoration, sound and physical conditioning in which workers operate under a safety measure.</p> <p><strong>1.2              </strong><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>It is a fact that human beings are one important resources available to the organizational and prove to pressure and influences such as noise, poor lighting and unsuitable work tools as this always creates discomfort in the work place and tend to urge the employees to seek more suitable conditions outside the work station.

It is the environment that will greatly motivate the workers to increase their job performance.</p> <p><strong>1.3              </strong><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of research study is to find out:</p> <p>v  The effect of office environment on the job performance of the office workers.</p> <p>v  The effect of inadequate office furniture and fittings, modern machine on the job performance of workers.</p> <p>v  The effect of good lighting, ventilation on the job performance of workers.</p> <p>v  The impact of salary structure on the job performance of workers.</p> <p><strong>1.4              </strong><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>v  What are physical conditions that make up a good office environment?</p> <p>v  In what ways does a good office environment assist the office workers on their job performance?</p> <p>v  What impact do lighting and ventilation have on the performance of office worker?</p> <p>v  What is the impact of salary structure on the job performance of workers?</p> <p><strong>1.5              </strong><strong>Scope Of The Study </strong></p> <p>The scope of the study was the effect of poor office environment on job performance of office workers in Abeokuta metropolis.</p> <p>The study which is based on the impact of poor office environment on the job performance of office workers will identify the important of office environment; know the impact of environmental conditions on the life of workers.

At the end, summary, conclusion and recommendations were made that organization should be able to organized training programmes to enable them manage records appropriately, there is need for the organization to identify specific competence required by their secretaries in records keeping, Professionally trained staff should be employed over time and existing staff be sent for necessary training to ensure effective records keeping.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION 1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Record keeping occupies a strategic position in the efficient and effective management of the organization. In fact, it is central in the administration of the business organization because it documents the planning and implementation of appropriate information allowing proper monitoring of work. The approach is for records created in the course of day-to-day business of the organization to be stored and kept in hard copies as evidence of an action, decision or process. However, the process of record keeping provides a framework for keeping, maintaining and providing for the disposition of records and what is contained in them. They are therefore intended to benefit all members of staff by facilitating continuity and evaluation of services and preserving privacy. This framework is provided for by guidelines designed to educate people on decisions regarding professional record keeping. For instances, American Psychological Association (APA 2007) contains the “Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct” generally required for the maintenance of appropriate records of psychological services. Unfortunately, the Nigeria situation in the business of record keeping and management especially in most business organizations system has not been too successful because of lack of management components (Omeyi 1997). It is hoped that if these options are adopted in the business organizations, perhaps most if not all the problems associated with record keeping would have been addressed. It is on this premise that this research work set out to examine factor affecting effective record keeping in business organizations.</p> <p>1.2   PROBLEM STATEMENT</p> <p>Perhaps it would not be an overstatement to say that record keeping problems are common to the different levels of the business organizations. It is however becoming clearer that it is more pronounced because accurate, reliable and trustworthy records that fulfill evidential requirements are being created but not properly managed. This therefore becomes an issue of great concern to government, stakeholders and office managers, individuals and organizations. In the past, frantic efforts to improve the situation in many organizations through the introduction of computers and internet services as well as development of database management system do not seem to have helped the situation much because the record management system is still conventionally paper-based and manual in operation. Many management staff complains of funds, and material resources. The reality reveals gross inadequacy of qualified personnel, facilities, students’ explosion and space problem. This study is therefore a response to the challenge by striving to empirically identify these problems and well defined management options that could improve record keeping processes in universities especially in the study area.</p> <p>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The main purpose of the study is to examine the factor affecting record keeping in business organizations. In specific terms the purpose of the study are as follows:</p> <ol><li>To examine the benefit of records keeping to the organization.</li> <li>To examine the extent to which management secure record in modern business organizations.</li> </ol> <p>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The research work is intended to evaluate the factors affecting record keeping in business organization. This study will be beneficial to people in the secretarial field to help them improve on their records keeping skill and processes. It will also benefit students who have the quest for more knowledge on the factor affecting record keeping in business organization as well as solution to students who are researching into similar topics, most especially, students in of the office technology and management department and other management students institution of higher learning.</p> <p>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>Answers to the following questions were provided in this study.</p> <ol><li>What are the benefits of records keeping to the organization?</li> <li>To what extent does management secure record in modern business organizations?</li> </ol> <p>1.6 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</p> <p>H01:  There is no Benefit of record keeping to the organization.</p> <p>H02: Management does not secure record in modern organizations.</p> <p>1.7 SCOPE AND DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The scope of the research work is limited to selected some selected banks in Rivers State, which include First Bank of Nigeria PLC and Union Bank Nigeria Plc.</p>\n\nFACTORS AFFECTING EFFECTIVE RECORDS KEEPING IN BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FACTORS AFFECTING EFFECTIVE RECORDS KEEPING IN BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS", "id": 100}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER   ONE <br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Information, in recent time and in most organization and business places has a wide scale of importance, based 0n its (information) ability to control the in and out 0f the business. As it can be understood that information is a processed data or analysis in which conclusion can be reached in order to operate plan, and control the business. An office becomes very important sophisticated administrative centre when important facts are told, heard or discovered  Elendu, E. O (2001).</p> <p>(Oxford 6th edition Dictionary).For the office work to remain essential to an enterprises operations, for the office to contribute significantly to the achievement of goals and to the success of the 0rganization, and for it to remain vital; it must deal with one of our greatest resources or instrument which is information.</p> <p>The road since that information is essential to all levels of decision making process 0f any organization is not a hidden one, because without information the organization or the business can die. The success of any organization depends on how effective information comes in and goes out, with proper management. It can be agreed that the existence of modem business depends very much on information.  In modem business contract, reports are containing information which will enhance the successful operation of the organization. Activities in an organization can be evaluated or stopped by an office manager or secretary based on the straight of the information as it can be understood, is not only used in business places or organization alone, but it is also a real instrument to almost everything we do even to our personal affair, and relationship with people around us Mills, G. and Standingford O.(1978).</p> <p>Information can be used in different levels such as; schedule of appointment with other organization; making 0f invoices by checking and communicating through the various computers and internets. Information is a universal tool which can be used to bring promotion and also to bring people from different places together. The storage retrieval and disposal of information is very essential and one need secretary to be careful with it as a secretary. Secretaries try to avoid the flood of irrelevant and unnecessary information. A problem sometimes arises on how to handle information for easy reference and what system to adopt for the storage. If having more information reduces risk and increases the chances of making a good decision then having all the information available changes every thing (Business by Pride, Hughes &amp; Kapoor “Seventh Edition).</p> <p>1.2     STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>It was discovered that due to ineffectiveness and mismanagement of information by secretaries and office managers, in organizations, and the zeal to know and acquire the skill of effective management of information, certain problem has emerged. It is a pity that sudden awareness of the relevant and important of information management in an organization has resulted into keeping unnecessary and ineffective information that clog the communication channels of business which has impede the successful flow of useful information.</p> <p>Proper management of information system was considered to be a rising concern in many organizations in River state. The high level of lose of important information that would have brought about transformation, reformation and careful dealing of employee problems, has become the talk of some vibrant business organization in the state.  This strategically is pointing out some problems faced in the office, when important decisions should have been taken, and proper information and documents are not available.</p> <p>There is a common statement today among executives, which says that there is lack of information which acts as a guide for the implementation of projects which are beneficial to the organization. When there is lack of vital or the right kin durance that it can not aid of information.</p> <p>When there is lack of vital or the right kind of information, there is an assurance that it can also result to poor planning and targeted goals can not be achieved as intended.  To ascertain the heights needed by capable office managers, one need to be more careful when it has to do with handling important information to avoid loos of information in organizations.</p> <p>1.3     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The aim of this study is to see how information can be properly managed by any one who serves in the capacity of a secretary or an office manager. Other sub aims are:</p> <p>(1)     To find out if effective management of information leads to the achievement of organizational goal.</p> <p>(2)     To find out if information management system adopted by an organization affects its success or contribute to it.</p> <p>(3)     To explain if the information from all relevant sources enables management to make affective decision.</p> <p>(4)     To examine the various types of information managed by     the secretaries and how information aid in the effective management of an organization.</p> <p>1.4     RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>The following questions were designed by the researcher to enable her reach conclusions through the responses that will be given to it by professionals and practitioners.</p> <p>(1)     How does effective management of information mean successful achievement of the organizational goals?</p> <p>(2)     Does information management system adopted by an organization affect its success or it contributes it.</p> <p>(3)     To what extent do information from all relevant sources enables management to make effective decision?</p> <p>(4)     What are the various types of information managed by secretaries, and how do they aid effective management of the organization.</p> <p>1.5     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>One important significance of this research is to enlighten different organizations on the importance and inevitability of effective information management, and therefore encourage them to adopt the appropriate method of handling information coming and going out of the organization.</p> <p>This study will also be of great value to every office manager, employees, young and professionals secretaries, giving them good office practice and managerial skills to execute their duties with at lest 95% perfectivity. There could be a slow down in business transaction if there is no good management of information in the organization.

Therefore, these have given a propelling force to this study into the various problems of record management in organizations. The study look at adequate devices of record management in order to sharpen the skills of record. Personnel and the availability of the equipment for record management, level of its effectiveness and other problems like poor staffing, lack of expertise and poor staff motivation. The researcher investigates into negligence of record activities in the hand of junior staff, lack of comprehensive record policy which led to the disability of method from organization to organization. The awareness of the significant role of record management is created from the finding of the study. Chapter four focuses on the presentation and analysis of various data collection from certain organization in Rivers State. Summary, conclusion and finally recommendation are made on the subject matter- the record management and effective job performance in an organization.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE<br/> INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Information is imperative in the administration of any corporate affairs. Records management has been defined by Omorogie in Idih etal (2012), as “a planned programme for creation maintenance, retention, transfer and disposition of records”</p> <p>In addition, idih et al (2012), defined records management as “that area of general administrative management concerned with achieving economy and efficiency in economy and efficiency in the creation, maintenance, use and disposal of records of an organization throughout their life cycle and making the information they contain available in this support of the business of that organization”. Thus records management is concerned with the creation, use, safety, retrieval and distribution of information to support the business activities of an organization.</p> <p>Organizational records may include personnel, financial, production, sales forecast and stocks. Other forms of records may be texts (letters, addresses, agreements, receipts, etc). Graphic materials (pictures, drawings, photographs) and electronic records as well as artifacts. Records management is important in an organization because it enables management of organization to make policies, plan and take decisions. It enhances good risk management, increased productivity, enhances operational effectiveness, improves ability to meet organizational and community expectations and makes for better management and delivery of services amongst others.</p> <p>Effective job performance in any organization requires the establishment of an effective management programme. This means that organization should determine the type, nature and structure of records to be created and the technologies to be used; determines how records are to be organized and used; preserved records and making them available to meet business expectations, comply with legal and regulatory requirements and ensuring that records are maintained in a safe and secure environment. Organization should ascertain how long records are to be kept and identify opportunities for improving the effectiveness, efficiency or quality of its processes decisions and actions.</p> <p>Every organizational job is performed according to specifications and standards dictated by good records management practice. Correspondence writing, engineering and architectural works, production of goods/services, filing, accounting and clerical jobs, medical examination and treatment of patients, recording mails and distributing them are dependent upon good records management practices.</p> <p>It therefore, follows that poor records management practices would have some effects. These include poor decision making caused by incomplete information, time is wasted in searching for information, money is wasted in storing records. Others include severe legal liabilities, increased organizational risk and low quality of service to customers. The above factors seem to indicate that poor records management practices could affect job performance in an organization.<br/><br/></p> <p>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>More often than not, management seems not to be concerned about proper record management. Despite all the benefits derived from good record management practices, decisions are rarely accurately made.</p> <p>However, the problems surrounding this are multi-dimensional. Most organizations lack appropriate and capable record management personnel in their organizations. These personnel lack the various office skills/techniques for an effective and efficient record management and they may be carrying out jobs haphazardly without regards to the attainment of the goals of the organization.</p> <p>Moreso, most organizations lacks the needed funds to procure  record management materials and equipment such as filling cabinets, file jackets and  computers etc., are grossly lacking in various establishments. Over the years, lack of typing sheets, office pins etc have become common complaints in both public and private establishments. This may have resulted from the fact that the organizations lack adequate funds with which to procure materials for the maintenance and safety of organizational records.</p> <p>Moreover, various records personnel are irresponsive to technological developments in records management. The record management personnel are afraid of either insecurity or retrenchment associated with the introduction of automation.</p> <p>Hence, Hadget (1982), stated that technological changes in organizations could cause uncertainty in the minds of employees if they see them as posing a threat to their jobs. This causes frustration and anxiety which adversely affects their job performance or productivity.</p> <p>Another problem is poor attitude of workers and the influence of bribery and corruption which have eaten deep into the fabrics of the Nigeria work force. In the words of Eze (1998), Nigeria workers show general apathy or Lukewarm attitude towards public service. This is not unrelated to the problem surrounding record managements, in organizations. Files are indiscriminately lost and very important records altered as well as the disclosure of classified office information by staff in the pursuit of selfish gain ranging from poor supervisor.</p> <p>Quite close to the above is yet the problem of lack of defined record management policy in many organizations. Otamiri (2002) added to this when he said, in order to ensure efficiency and uniformity in record management a company policy and procedures on records management practice must be formulated and used for the guidance of all concerned. About 98% of all corporations in Nigeria lack a formidable and coherent record management policy thereby  leaving such an important aspect of the general management process frustrated.</p> <p>In most cases records are left in the hands of junior staff to manage. It is in the light of the above that this study attempt to investigate into the problem of records management in organization.<br/><br/></p> <p>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The major objective of this research work is to examine the effect of records management on effective job performance in organizations. Other sub-aims include the following.</p> <ol><li>To identify the method of records management practices adopted in organization.</li> <li>To examine whether workers are satisfied with the record management practices being adopted by organizations</li> <li>To ascertain the effects of poor records managements practices on staff performance in organization.</li> <li>To proffer solutions to the problems associated with the effect of poor records management on staff performance.<br/><br/></li> </ol> <p>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The objective of the study is to determine the effects of records management on job performance in organization. The study will invariably make valuable contributions towards the improvement of our economic life more especially as it concerns the management of public corporations.</p> <p>Primarily, the study is designed towards ensuring that sound proper record management practice is applied in the administration of both private and public enterprises for goal attainment.</p> <p>Again, the study will enlighten the business communities, private individuals and the government on the need to maintain proper record managements, in their establishments. In the same vein, it will proffer solution to the problems of record management and equip management of organizations with the basic tools and techniques of managing records.</p> <p>The study will increase the volume of existing literatures on records management and would serve as a reference material for scholars who may wish to research into various aspects of record management.</p> <p>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>The following research questions were formulated to guide the study.</p> <ol><li>What method of record management practice are adopted to support job performance in organizations?</li> </ol> <p>2 How are workers satisfied with the records management practices in operation within the organizations?</p> <p>3 What are the effects of poor record management practices on the corporate image and operational performance of organization?</p> <ol><li>What are the solutions to the challenges of poor records management practices on job performance in organization?</li> </ol> <p>1.6 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</p> <p>Research hypothesis are tentative statement which express the truth regarding relationship between two or more variables. In this work the following hypotheses were formulated and would be tested based on the research questions.</p> <p>Ho:  Records management does not increase organizational job performance.</p> <p>H1:  Records management increase organizational job performance.</p> <p>1.7 DELIMITATION’S OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The study is concerned with the investigation of the effects of records management on performance in business organizations in Rivers State.</p> <p>The study covers such areas as the nature of records management in organizations, the effects of poor records management on the activities of firms and the level of awareness on  proper records management.</p> <p>Besides the measures to improve upon record management will be looked into. It is hoped that the result of the research can be effectively generalized to other business organizations in the state and the federation.</p> <p>1.8 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Despite the measures taken to obtain data on the subject matter there were a lot of problems which constrained the research from putting up a comprehensive survey.</p> <p>Lack of textbooks, journals and other useful literatures on record management with which to work, affected the study. Beside, the researcher had limited time as the work has to be combined with academic work to complete and submit the research. it was therefore difficult to combine the research with class work.</p> <p>Moreover, financial constraints, transportation difficulties and high cost of materials were nevertheless serious bottlenecks. Above all the researcher tried her best to make the job worthwhile.</p>\n\nRECORD MANAGEMENT AND EFFECTIVE JOB PERFORMANCE IN AN ORGANIZATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RECORD MANAGEMENT AND EFFECTIVE JOB PERFORMANCE IN AN ORGANIZATION", "id": 103}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1. Background to the study</strong></p> <p>For decades now, fast changes have been taking place in all facets of human life including the office environment. This is as a result of technological advancement. Every office in today’s business world, be it government, industry or other human endeavors, require facts and accurate information for quick decision-making. The office worker, including the secretary, expects certain support from the organization into which he/she is employed. This support can be technological (machines and equipment) and human. In offices of past, manager’s dictated memos and letters and secretaries typed them. Most recently, business have developed word processing centers and relied on personal computers and even electronic mail in an effort to lessen the need for secretarial support and make the employee-secretary very productive (Ezoem, 1995; Osuala, 2004).</p> <p>As a result of changes in technology, the role of secretaries in business has changed tremendously from that of typewriting and shorthand dictation, answering of telephone calls and processing of mails. Today’s secretaries are exposed to office technology including the internet that make work much easier and knowledge more accessible (Edwin, 2008). It is now easier to send messages by telex, electronic mails (e-mails), fax and telephones. Other office gadgets available to the secretary are photo-copy machines, duplicating machines, dictating machines, printers, among others. This is the era of computers and information technology which has become an enabler of greater convenience. Three of the most popular types of computer software programs are word processing, which help the user to write and edit memos, letters and reports, </p>                                                         \n\nMODERN OFFICE TECHNOLOGIES AND CHALLENGES FACING SECRETARIES IN EDO NORTH SECRETARIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MODERN OFFICE TECHNOLOGIES AND CHALLENGES FACING SECRETARIES IN EDO NORTH SECRETARIES", "id": 104}]
