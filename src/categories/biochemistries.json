        "content": "EVALUATION OF NUTRITIVE PROFILE OF A VEGETABLE, PIPER METHYSTICUM, LOCALLY KNOWN AS AWA USING ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1       Herbs\n\nAn herb is a plant that is valued for flavor, scent, medicinal or other qualities other than its food value (John, 2000). They are used in cooking, as medicines, and for spiritual purposes. Herbs have a variety of uses including culinary and medicinal usage. General usage differs between culinary herbs and medicinal herbs (John, 2000).  Herbs are “generally recognized as safe” by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA), at least at concentrations commonly found in foods (Kaefer et al, 2008). Medicinal plants continue to provide valuable therapeutic agents, both in modern medicine and in traditional system (Reaven, 1983). The leaves, roots, flowers, seeds, root bark, inner bark (cambium), berries and sometimes the pericarp or other portions of the plant might be considered in medicinal or spiritual use (John, 2000). In the medicinal uses, herbs (plants) contain phytochemicals that have effects on the body (John, 2000).\n\nUntil the 20th century, (Sanusi et al, 2008) most medicinal remedies all over the world were obtained from plants. For example, purple forglove was found to be helpful in dropsy, the opium poppy for pain, cough, and diarrhea, and the cinchona bark for fever. With the emergence of chemical and pharmacological methods in the 20th century, it became possible to identify the active ingredients in the plants and study them. Furthermore, once the chemistry was understood, it was possible to synthesize related molecules with more desirable properties. According to (Sodimu et al, 2008), today, the two most effective and widely accepted drugs for the treatment of malaria today emerged through herbal traditional medicine viz: Quinine from the bark of the Peruvian cinchona tree and artemisinin from the Chinese antipyretic Artemisia annua L. Hence, throughout history, the medicinal benefits of herbs are quoted (John, 2000). There may be some effects when consumed in the small levels that typify culinary \"spicing\", and some herbs are toxic in larger quantities. For instance, some types of herbal extract, such as the extract of St. John's-wort (Hypericum perforatum) or of awa (Piper methysticum) can be used for medical purposes to relieve depression and stress (John, 2000). However, (Milner et al, 2008), large amounts of these herbs may lead to toxic overload that may involve complications, some of a serious nature, and should be used with caution. One herb-like substance, called Shilajit, may actually help a lower blood glucose level which is especially important for those suffering from diabetes.\n\nIn comparative terms, (Metuh, 1987) the western idea of medicine and the traditional African conception differ in scope. In the traditional sense, it refers to a wholistic view of well being, while in the western sense, it is strictly limited to bodily therapeutic purposes. Nze in his own comparative analysis of medicine underscores the peculiarity difference, which defines the traditional wholistic perception of medicine (Metuh, 1987).\n\nAccording to (John, 2000), modern pharmaceuticals had their origins in crude herbal medicines, and to this day, many drugs are still extracted as fractionate/isolate compounds from raw herbs and then purified to meet pharmaceutical standards. Some herbs are used not only for culinary and medicinal purposes, but also for psychoactive and/or recreational purposes; one such herb is cannabis (John, 2000).\n\nHowever, many herbs and their bioactive components are being investigated for potential disease prevention and treatment at concentrations which may exceed those commonly used in food preparation herbs (Milner et al, 2008). It is therefore imperative to identify any potential safety concerns associated with the use of various dosages which range from doses commonly used for culinary purposes to those used for medicinal purposes since there are often unclear boundaries between the various uses of herbs (Milner et al, 2008).\n\nOther uses of herbs other than medicinal uses are:\n\nSacred uses:\n\nAccording to “Chinese herbal medicine” Herbs are used in many religions for example, myrrh (Commiphora myrrha) and   frankincense (Boswellia spp) in Christianity, the Nine Herbs Charm in Anglo-Saxon paganism, the Neem tree (Azadirachta indica) by the Tamils, holy basil or tulsi (Ocimum tenuiflorum) in Hinduism, and many Rastafarians consider cannabis (Cannabis sp) to be a holy plant (John, 2000). Siberian Shamans also used herbs for spiritual purposes. Plants may be used to induce spiritual experiences, such as vision quests in some Native American cultures (John, 2000). The Cherokee Native Americans use sage and cedar for spiritual cleansing and smudging.\n\nUses as pest control:\n\nHerbs are also known amongst gardeners to be useful for pest control. Mint, spearmint, peppermint, and pennyroyal are a few such herbs. These herbs when planted around a house's foundation can help keep unwanted critters away such as flies, mice, ants, fleas, moth and tick amongst others. They are not known to be harmful or dangerous to children or pets, or any of the house's fixtures (John, 2000).\n\n1.2       Objectives of study\n\nPiper methysticum being a plant used for its medical and social purposes (Johnston et al, 2008), may have been of great benefits in human health due to its biochemical, pharmacological, and medical properties. This study, therefore, was undertaken to evaluate the trace – element composition of the leaf extract.",

        "content": "DETERMINATION OF PH VALUE OF PURE WATER SACHET AND BORE HOLE WATER\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.1         BACKGROUND OF STUDY\n\nWHAT IS WATER?\n\n            Water is the most abundant liquid on earth it covers three quarters of the earth surface. Oceans cover wsout 72% of the earth and the average depth is 2.5 miles. The oceans are the source of 97% of all water. The rest consist of 2.1% in glaciers, 0.6% fresh water in lakes and rivers 0.6% ground waters and 0.1% in brine well and brackish waters.\n\n            Water is the major components of living things for example, the water content of human adult is 70% the same proportion as the earths surface. Water is a liquid, which is colourless, odourless and tasteless. Human activities and settlements hinge on the availability of water. In man, three quarters of the fluid in him are made of water, water forms the essential medium in which the chemical reactions of his cells processed.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF WATER\n\n            Our physical biological environment play important role on water. As a vapour, it absorbs radiation to influence the heat balance and temperature of the environment thereby bringing moisture to the containment through the water cycle. Human activities and settlement also generate important role on water availability which is used as a medium into which man disposes his wastes which could be industrial domestic or agricultural. Water is so important that it is involves in almost every activity in man.   \n\n1.2         STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nThe research her realised that some of the pure water sachets and boreholes water have a lot of problems interms of not using the adequate or sufficient PH value recommended by the NAFDAC. As this has direct effect with the general interest of the consumers positively or negatively which influences the all round achievement in pure water sachets and borehole water. So in doing this, the following questions call for attention.\n\n1.            Are pure water sachet companies in Benin City have too much acid content?\n\n2.            Are the borehole water have too much acid content\n\n3.            Is effluent from sewage plant properly treated?\n\n4.            Are all the pure water sachet companies registered with the NAFDAC\n\n5.            Does drinking water have taste, odour and colour?\n\n1.3         PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe relevance of this research work is to examine and make a report on PH value of sachet water samples and borehole water sample in Benin City. Some of the drinking water has already been contaminated, that is to say, the packaging and that of the nylons used to package the treated water are not properly checked. This research work is also aim to determine to what level pure water sachet and borehole water contained too acid and also to check whether all the pure water sachet companies are registered with NAFDAC (national Agency for food and Drug Administration Company).  \n\n1.4         AIMS AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY \n\nThe aims and objective of this study is to provide possible solutions that will sustain pure water sachet companies and borehole water in Benin City, Edo State.\n\n1.            To ensure consumer buy pure water sachet registered with NAFDAC.\n\n2.            To encourage consumers to report to the NAFDAC, if they see pure water sachet not registered being sold for drinking.\n\n3.            To ensure pure water companies, the PH value of the water produced for consumption are within the standard recommended by the WHO for drinking water.\n\n4.            To check packaging and ensuring that the nylons used to package the treated water do not contaminate the water put into it or give it some unwanted odour or taste.\n\n5.

        "content": "ASSESSMENT OF SOME HEAVY METALS IN SOIL SAMPLES ALONG GUTTERS IN NKPOR, ANAMBRA STATE\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\nTen representative soil samples were collected along major gutters within Nkpor metropolis. The soil samples were digested using mixtures of HF and aqua regia in ratio1:1. The heavy metals contents of the digested soil samples were determined via Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer FAAS. Sample A had the highest concentration of heavy metal and the trend was Ni > Cr > Hg >\n\nZn > As ~ Cd, it was followed by sample B with Ni > Cr > Zn > Zn > Cd >g >\n\nAs, sample C had Ni>Cr >Zn>Hg>Cd>As, sample E had Ni > Zn > Cd > Cr > Hg > As. While sample D had Cr > Ni > Zn > Cd > Hg > As. Also the results of the sequential extraction of each soil sample indicated that Ni had the highest percentage bioavailability (49.61%), Hg (47. 72%), Cr (42. 19%), Zn (39.66%), Cd (35.10%), As (0.00%). The high concentration of Hg, Cr and Cd in most areas of the metropolis indicated gross contamination, which could have resulted from human activities, hence the need to adequately monitor the release of these toxic metals to the environment.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.0 GENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\nMinerals, metals and metalloids, toxic or essential, are present in soils or sediments in various forms with varying bioavailability, toxicities and mobilities.\nHeavy metals\nare natural components of the earth’s crust and the ecosystem with variations in concentration. They cannot be degraded or destroyed and they enter our bodies via food, drinking water and air [1].\n\nUnlike organic contaminants, most metals do not undergo microbial or chemical degradation and the total concentration of these metals in soils persist for a long time after their introduction [2].\n\nThese metals are a cause of environmental pollution (heavy-metal pollution) from a number of sources. For example lead in petrol, industrial effluents and leaching of metal ions from the soil into lakes and   rivers by acid rain [3].\n\nLiving organisms require varying amounts of “heavy metals”. Iron, cobalt, copper, manganese, molybdenum and zinc are required by humans. Excessive levels can be damaging to the organisms. Other heavy metals such as mercury, plutonium and lead are toxic metals that have no beneficial effect on organisms and can cause serious illnesses (3).\n\nTherefore, with greater public awareness of the implications of contaminated soils on humans and animal health, there has been increasing interest among scientific communities in the development of technologies to determine the total concentrations of these elements of interest in the soil as well as their chemical forms.\n\nThe use of sequential extraction techniques to fractionate metals in soils and evaluate their potential effects has become very useful and well recognized (4)\n\n1.1 SCOPE OF STUDY\n\nThis research covers the analysis of six heavy metals in each of the five selected drainage pathways or gutters in Nkpor. The heavy metals are mercury (Hg)\n\nNickel; (Ni), Zinc (Zn), Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), Mercury (Hg) \n\nSoil samples were collected from each of the drainage systems as follows:\n\nFive soil samples each along Nkpor/Enugu Old Road, Nkpor/Obosi Road (site for Geolis Cables Industry), Limca Road Nkpor, New Market Road Nkpor and Nkpor/Enugu Express Road.\n\nThe samples will be collected at a distance of 10 meters each to avoid bias. A total of 25 soil samples will be analysed to determine the total concentration of each metal in each sample.\n\n       1.2 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF STUDY\n\nHeavy metal content of soil sample in some selected drainage systems in Nkpor will be investigated. As earlier on stated, heavy metals are dangerous because they tend to bioaccumulate i.e increase in their concentration over time. Also heavy metals can enter water supply by industrial and consumer waste or even from acidic rain and release heavy metal into streams, lakes, rivers and ground water.\n\nHence, the study will help in assessing the potential environmental impacts of these metals by determination of their concentrations in soils as well as the chemical form of these metals in the soil.\n\nOBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY\n\nThe objectives of this study are:\n\n(a)               To determine the total concentration of some selected heavy metals in gutter.\n\n(b)              To use sequential extraction technique to fractionate metals in soil samples.\n\n1.3 LITERATURE REVIEW\n\nA heavy metal is a member of an ill defined subset of elements that exhibit metallic properties, which would mainly include the transition metals, some metallic lanthanides and actinides. Many different definitions have been proposed – some based on density, some on atomic number or atomic weight and some on chemical properties or toxicity [5]\n\nPollution is the release of substances which alter the environment and make it unfavourable to man, animals and plants [6]. Water, air and soil stand the risk of being polluted.\n\n1.3:1      SOIL POLLUTION\n\nSoil pollution is the introduction of undesirable materials such as solids, liquids or even gases into the soil, which interfere with its sustenance of plant or animal life [7]. Soil particles may hold chemicals and nutrients making them available for plant roots and keeping them from moving into lakes or streams or entering the ground water [8]. Metals from soils come from various sources. They may have been present in the geologic rock, or they may occur as atmospheric additions of copper, mercury, lead and zinc [9]. Metals also may have been deposited by past industrial activities, such as; battery productions, brass and steel manufacturing industries, mining and many different processes involving Nickel, Cadmium, Copper and Lead. Lead is especially evident in the soil near roadways because of automobile emissions. [10]. Again as lead paints and some soldered pipes used in houses wear and deteriorate they add lead to nearby soils [11]. Other on-going sources of metals and organic waste materials in the soil are landfills [12] and dump sites that are poorly maintained or unregulated [13]. Land fill materials eventually decompose and form a highly variable type of unseen soil. Heavy metals remain in topsoil layer which is a result of chemical reaction between heavy metals and organic matter [14].\n\n1.3.2    SOIL POLLUTION AND PLANT GROWTH\n\nMetal contamination on a site maybe evidenced by plant growth [15], animal behaviour [16] or paint flasks containing lead from older building [17]. Many plants simply cannot grow well where the level of certain metals is high. Other plants grow well in contaminated soil but fail to set seed or do not grow as well as expected [15]. Absence of  plant growth in a locality is a warning sign that a site may be severely contaminated. Metals may be present at a site but with no risk for gardening or recreation, depending on the soil properties, drainage and vegetation at the site.\n\n1.3:3  SOIL ORGANISMS AND BIOCHEMISTRY\n\nSoil is made up of mineral particles and organic matter [12] as well as the decomposed remains of living things [18]. Bacterial fungi and other micro organisms are largely responsible for breaking down dead plants and animals in the soil. Small organisms (microbes) have negatively charged sites where soil nutrients and metals can bond to form soil aggregates and compounds [19]. Earthworms and larger animals eat and digest organic materials and minerals; transform them into soil aggregates and deposit them as waste.\n\n1.3:4      SOIL ACIDITY\n\nAn acid is a substance that has positive charge and usually yields hydrogen ions when dissolved in water. The pH scale (1-14) is a common measure of soil reaction [12].\n\nThe lower the number, the greater the acidity. The midpoint of the pH scale is neutral (7.0) which is a good level for the growth of most plants. Changes in soil reaction, as measured by pH, have significant effects on metals in soils. Metal  toxicity to plants and animals increases in strongly acid soils with low pH (3.5) [20]. Metals in these soils are released from negative sites back into soil solution. At a higher pH (8.5), the metals often are sequestered in the soil [21]. The term ‘sequestered’ indicates that the positively charged metal ions are   bound tightly to negatively charged sites in the soil [22]. These sites may be on clays, mineral compounds, or organic matter, including the surfaces of some microorganisms.\n\n1.3:5     HEAVY METAL POLLUTION\n\nThese metals are a cause of environmental pollution from a number of sources including lead in petrol, industrial effluents and leaching of metal ions from the soil into lakes and rivers by acid rain [3].\n\nHeavy metals occur naturally in the ecosystem with large variations in concentration. Today, anthropogenic sources of heavy metals ie pollution, have been introduced into the ecosystem. Wastes derived fuels are especially prone to contain heavy metals so there should be a central concern in a consideration of their use.\n\nHeavy metal pollution can arise from many sources but most commonly arises from the purification of metals   e.g. the smelting of copper and the preparation of nuclear fuels. Electroplating is the primary source of chromium and cadmium. Through precipitation of their compounds or by ion exchange into soils and mud. \n\n1.3:6   HEAVY METAL RELATIONSHIP TO LIVING ORGANISMS\n\nSome metals are necessary for humans in minute amounts (cobalt, copper, chromium,\n\nNickel etc). Some of them are dangerous to health or to the environment even at low concentration (mercury, cadmium, arsenic, lead, chromium etc). Some are harmful in other ways e.g. Arsenic may pollute  catalysts, whilst others are carcinogenic or toxic thereby affecting, among others, the central nervous system (mercury, lead, Arsenic), the kidneys or liver (Mercury, lead cadmium, copper) or skin, bones or teeth ( Nickel, cadmium, copper, chromium) [23]. Certain elements are normally toxic to some organisms while others may be beneficial e.g. Vanadium, tungsten and cadmium [24]. In medical circle, heavy metals are loosely defined [24] and include all toxic metals irrespective of their atomic weights. Heavy metal poisoning can occur when excessive amounts of Iron, Manganese, Aluminum or Beryllium (the fourth lightest element) or such as semi metal as Arsenic are present in the environment. Early farmers in the New Zealand suffered from bush sickness which was later discovered to be a\n\ndeficiency in cobalt [ 24 ]\n\n1.3:7  REPORTED CASES OF ENVIRONMENTAL  POLLUTION\n\nIn 1932, sewage containing mercury was released by Chisso’s Chemical works into Minamata Bay in Japan. The mercury accumulated in sea creatures, leading   eventually to mercury poisoning in the population.\n\nAgain, Denis L. Feron and others used a secret discharge pipe to deliberately pump hundreds of tons of heavy metal wastes into the Mississippi River from 1986 to 1996. Feron is now an international fugitive and one of the Environmental Protection Agency’s most wanted man because of the environmental hazards caused by his\n\npollution of the River.\n\nIn addition to that, the first incidents of mercury poisoning appeared in the population of Minimata bay in Japan, in 1952. This was caused by consumption of fish polluted with mercury which brought about over 500 fatalities. [25].\n\nIn 1986, in Sandoz, water used to extinguish a major fire carried C. 3ot fungicide containing mercury into the upper Rhine. Fishes were killed over a stretch of 100km. The shock drove many Federal Environmental Agency (FEA)  projects forward.\n\nAlso, toxic chemicals in water from a burst dam belonging to a mine contaminated the\n\nCoto De Danana nature reserve in Southern Spain, C.5  in Southern Spain, C.5 million\n\nM-of mind containing sulphur, lead, copper, zinc and cadmim flowed down the Rio Guardimar. Experts estimated that Europe’s largest bird sanctuary as well as Spain’s\n\nAgriculture and fisheries suffered permanent damage from this pollution.[25]\n\n1.2.8  EFFECTS OF CADMIUM ON THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\nCadmium derives its toxicological properties from its chemical similarity to zinc an essential micro element for plants, animals and humans (25).\n\nIn humans, long-term exposure is associated with renal disfunction. High exposure can lead to lung disease and has been linked to lung cancer. The average daily intake for humans is estimated as 0.15 mg from air and 1 µg from water. Smoking of 1 packet of 20 cigarettes can lead to the inhalation of around 2.4 µg of cadmium. [25]\n\n1.3:9  EFFECT OF ANTIMONY ON THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\nAntimony is a metal used in the compound antimony trioxide, a flame retardant. Exposure to high levels of antimony for short period of time causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. There is little information on the effects of long-term exposure, but it is a suspected human carcinogen. Most antimony compounds do not bioaccumulate in\n\naquatic life. [25].\n\n1.3:10  EFFECTS OF COPPER ON THE ENVIRONMENT\n\nCopper is an essential substance to human life, but in high doses it can cause anaemia, liver and kidney damage. It can also lead to stomach and intestinal irritation. People with Wilson’s disease are at greater risk from over exposure to copper. Copper normally occurs in drinking water from copper pipes and also from additives designed to control alga growth.\n\n1.3.11  EFFECTS OF CHROMIUM ON THE ENVIRONMENT\n\nChromium is used in metal alloys and pigments for paints, cement, paper and rubber. Low-level exposure can irritate the skin and cause ulceration. Long-term exposure can cause kidney and liver damage and damage to circulatory and nerve tissues. It often accumulates in aquatic environments thereby adding to the danger of eating fish that may have been exposed to high levels of chromium.\n\n1.3.12  EFFECTS OF LEAD ON THE ENVIRONMENT\n\nLead is a trace metal that is present naturally in soils and water in trace amounts (26). In humans, exposure to lead can result in a wide range of biological effects depending on the level and duration of exposure. Various effects occur over a broad range of doses, with the developing foetus and infant being more sensitive than adult. High levels of exposure may result in toxic biochemical effects on humans, which in turn cause problems in the synthesis of hemoglobin, effects on the kidneys, gastro intestinal tract, joints and reproductive system and acute or chronic damage to the nervous system. [25].\n\nAverage daily lead intake for adult in UK is estimated at 1.6 µg from air, 20 µg from drinking water and 28µg from food. Although most people receive the bulk of their lead intake from food, in specific populations, other sources may be more important, such as water in areas with lead piping and air near point of source emissions, soil, dust, paint flakes in old houses of contaminated land. [25]\n\n1.3.13  EFFECTS OF MERCURY ON THE ENVIRONMENT\n\nMercury is a toxic substance which has no known function in human biochemistry and physiology and does not occur naturally in living organisms. Inorganic mercury poisoning is associated with tumor and/or minor psychological changes together with spontaneous abortion and congenital malformation.\n\nMonomethyl mercury causes damage to the brain and the central nervous system, it also gives rise to abortion, congenital malformation and development changes in young children. [25]\n\n1.3.14    EFFECTS OF NICKEL ON THE ENVIRONMENT\n\nSmall amounts of nickel are needed by the human body to produce red blood cells. In great amounts, it can become mildly toxic. Long term exposure can cause decreased body weight, heart and liver damage but short-term over exposure to Nickel is not known to cause any problems. nickel can accumulate in aquatic life, but its presence is not magnified along food chain. [25]\n\n1.4       SOLUBILITY OF HEAVY METALS IN SOIL.\n\nSolubility of heavy metals is directly related to sorption capacity of residuals and soil. Soil pH and iron oxides are very important factors controlling metal solubility in these systems. Sorption is an important chemical process that regulates partitioning of heavy metals between solution and solid phases in soils. Recent studies on this have shown that heavy metal solubility and availability in land applied residuals is governed by fundamental chemical reactions between metal constituents and soil and residual components [27].\n\n Iron, aluminum and manganese oxide soil minerals are important sinks for heavy metals in soil and residual amended soils. Heavy metal cations sorb to soil organic matter (som) and other forms of humified natural organic matter (NOM). The type of sorption by NOM affects the environmental fate of heavy metals. Heavy metal cations form sparingly soluble phosphates, carbonates, sulphides and hydroxides. Sorption and many metal precipitation processes are highly pH dependent. The pH of the soilresidual system is often the most important chemical property governing sorption and precipitation of heavy metals. [27]\n\n1.5 PHYTO AVAILABILITY OF HEAVY METALS IN RESIDUAL –\n\nTREATED SOILS.\n\nApplication of residuals to soil affects phytoavailability by introducing heavy metal into the soil and / or redistributing heavy metal into different chemical pools that vary in phytoavailability (28). Application of biosolids increases heavy metal solubility and availability in soil. Increases in availability are a function of metal type and metal loading. Transmission of heavy metal through the food chain is affected by the soilplant barrier (29). The barrier limits transmission of metal through the food chain either by soil chemical processes that limit solubility (e.g soil barrier) or by plant senescence (showing sign of old age) from phytotoxicity (e.g. plant barrier). The soil plant barrier limits transmission of many heavy metals through the soil-crop-animal food chain, except aluminum, zinc, molybdenum, and selenium. Cadmium, which has lower affinity for metal-sobbing phases (e.g. oxides, NOM), has the greatest potential for transmission through the food chain in levels that present risk to consumers (30).\n\n1.6 LONG TERM ENVIRONMENTAL FATE AND BIOAVAILABILITY OF\n\nHEAVY METALS IN RESIDUAL TREATED SOILS.\n\nHeavy metals do not degrade in soil and many are considered persistent bioacumulative toxins (PBTs). The risk to human and ecosystem health from land application of PBTs in residuals depends on solubility and bioavailabilty of these contaminants in the residual – treated soil. Uncertainties exist in the effect of decomposition of soil organic matter complexes that bind metal and uncertainties of the effect of slower long term reactions between metals adsorbed to inorganic oxide surfaces in soils on metal solubility and bioavailability. Recent research findings show that heavy metal is adsorbed to oxide phases of Biosolids (31). Heavy metals sequestered to oxide surfaces will likely remain sequestered longer than metal complexed by biosolids NOM. However, the stability of metal sequestered by oxide depends on the metal and the mineral oxide surface. Long term mineral crystallization reactions may “eject” metals from the solid phase into solution. The long-term stability of sequestered metal bounded to metal oxide surfaces remains uncertain.\n\n1.7 SOLUTE INTERACTIONS IN SOILS IN RELATION TO\n\n  BIOAVAILABILITY AND REMEDIATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\nFor diffuse distribution of metals (e.g). Fertilizer-derived cadmium input in pasture soils), remediation options generally include amelioration of soils to minimize the metal bioavailability.\n\nThe bioavailability of a chemical in the soil environment has been defined as the fraction of the total contaminant in the interstitial pore water (i.e., soil solution) and soil particle that is available to the receptor organism [32]. Bioavailability can be minimized through chemical and biological immobilization of metals using a range of inorganic compounds such as lime and phosphate (p) compounds (e.g. apatite rocks), and organic compound such as “exceptional quality” biosolids [33]. Reducing metal availability and maximizing plant growth through inactivation may also prove to be an effective method of in situ soil remediation on industrial, urban, smelting and mining\n\nsites.\n\nThe more localized metal contamination found in urban environments (e. g chromium contamination in timber treatment plants) is remedied by metal mobilization process that include bioremediation (including phyto remediation) and chemical washing.\n\nBioavailability of metals in soils can be examined using chemical extraction and bioassay tests. Chemical extraction test includes single extraction and sequential fractionation [34]. Bioassay involves plants, animals and microorganism [35]. A number of amendments are used either to mobilize or immobilize heavy metals into soil solution, which is subsequently removed using higher plants. In contrast, in case of the immobilization technique, the metal concerned is removed from soil solution either through adsorption, complexation and precipitation reactions, thereby rendering the metals unavailable for plant uptake and leading to groundwater. \n\nSince one of the primary objectives of remediating contaminated sites is to reduce the bioavailability of metals, in-situ immobilization using soil amendments that are low in heavy metal content may offer a promising option. However, a major inherent problem associated with immobilization technique is that although the heavy metals become less bioavailable, their total concentrations in soils remain unchanged. The immobilized heavy metal may become bioavailable with time through natural weathering process or through breakdown of high molecular weight organic metal complexes.\n\n1.8 A CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE BIOAVAILABILITY AND IMPACTS OF HEAVY METALS IN MUNICIPAL SOIL WASTE COMPOSTS.\n\nThe concentration, behaviour and significance of heavy metals in composted waste materials is important from two potentially conflicting aspects of environmental legislation in terms of: (a) defining end-of-water criteria and increasing recycling of composted residuals on land and (b) protecting soil quality by preventing contamination. All types of municipal soil waste (m s w) compost contain more heavy metals than the background concentrations present in soil and will increase their contents in amended soil. [36] Total concentrations of heavy metals in such segregated and green waste compost are typically below UK PAS100 limits and mechanical segregated material can also comply with the metal limits in UK PAS100 , although this is likely to be more challenging [36]. Zinc and lead are the elements presents in the largest amounts in MSW-compost. Lead is the most limiting element to use of mechanical segregated compost in domestic gardens, but concentrations are typically below risk based thresholds that protect human health.\n\nThere is general consensus in the scientific literature that aerobic composting processes increase the complexation of heavy metals in organic waste residuals, and that metals are strongly bound to the compost matrix and organic matter, limiting their solubility and potential bioavailability in soil. Lead is the most strongly bound element and nickel the weakest, with zinc, copper and Cadmium showing intermediate sorption characteristics. The strong metal sorption properties of compost produced from m s w or sewage sludge have important benefits for the remediation of metals contaminated industrial and urban soils.\n\nThe availability of metals in soil depends on the nature of the chemical association between a metal with the organic residual and soil matrix, the pH value of the soil, the concentration of the element in the compost and the soil, and the ability of the plant to regulate the uptake of a particular element.\n\nHowever, there is good experimental evidence demonstrating the reduced bioavailability and crop uptake of metal from composted biosolids compared to other types of sewage sludge. [36] The total metal concentration in compost is important in controlling crop uptake of labile elements, like zinc and copper, which increases with increasing total content of these elements in the compost.\n\n1.9.1 HEAVY METALS TRANSPORT IN THE SOIL PROFILES UNDER\n\nTHE APPLICATION OF SLUDGE AND WASTEWATER.\n\nThe results of packed-column studies may be overly optimistic in predicting soil immobilization of metals, by pass flow via preferential flow paths in field soils may allow significant metal transport to ground water (37). The lack of significant metal deposition in subsoil may not be reliable evidence for immobility of sludge application metals (38).\n\nAlloway and Jackson (1991) cited several studies reporting some downward metal translocation in soil, noting a potential correlation with climate (39). Soluble and colloidal organics have been shown experimentally to moblize metals (40). Land application of sludge or compost can have both beneficial and harmful aspects. Its organic matter content, which constitutes approximately 50% of the solid fraction, may improve soil physical properties. Nitrogen and phosphorous, ranging from 2 to 8% and 1 to 4% respectively, in sewage sludge and sludge compost are nutrients essential for growth of crops. Municipal sludge, however, often contain undesirable chemicals which may be toxic to plants and/or eventually toxic to animals and human that consume edible parts of such plants (41).\n\nIt was concluded that the use of wastewater and sludge application in agricultural lands, enriched soils with heavy metals to concentrations that may pose, potential environmental and health risks in the long term.",

        "content": "ENHANCING THE PROPERTIES OF COAL BRIQUETTE USING SPEAR GRASS (IMPERATA CYLINDRICA) AND ELEPHANT GRASS (PENNISETUM PURPUREUM)\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe urgent need to protect our forest, to mitigate health hazards faced by the people from the use of firewood for cooking and to find an effective means of managing agro wastes has prompted a research on improving the properties of coal briquette using spear grass (Imperata cylindrica) and\nelephant grass\n(Pennisetum purpureum). In the research, proximate analysis and the elemental composition of the plant materials were carried out alongside with a coal sample. Briquettes of different composition were produced by blending the plant materials with the coal at various concentrations: 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% and 100%. The physical, mechanical and combustion properties of the briquettes were compared. It was found that the ignition, burning rate and reduction in smoke emission showed improvement with increase in biomass concentration. Compressive strength and cooking efficiency - water boiling time and specific fuel consumption showed initial improvement and rendered to break with briquette containing biomass concentration of 50% for elephant grass briquette. For spear grass, the compressive grass was at maximum at biomass concentration of 30%.     \n\nCHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 Background of the Study\n\nNigeria, like other sub-Saharan countries, has faced forest degradation problems due to combination of factors. Some of the factors are clearing of land for agricultural and industrialization purposes, over grazing, bush fires, drought, over exploitation, ever- increasing deforestation along with the increased in the consumption of fuel wood etc.\n\nAbout 80% of Nigerians live in the rural or semi-urban areas and they depend solely on fuel wood for their energy needs. Fuel wood accounts for about 37% of the total energy demand of the country. Investigations showed that out of the total wood demand from the forest, 90% goes to fuel wood. Presently, Nigeria reportedly consumes about 43 x 109 kg of fuel wood annually [1] and it will be far more than this by the end of 2010 if the present trend continues [2]. However, it is very obvious that reduction in the use of fuel wood will drastically reduce the pressure mounted on the forest in search of wood. \n\nMeanwhile, it was reported that the total forest cover of Nigeria is still less than 10% of the land area, which is far below the 25% recommended by the United Nation Development Programme (UNDP) [2]. Therefore, it is imperative that concerted efforts are needed to address this situation.\n\nFurthermore, in the recent years, global warming has become an international concern. Global warming is caused by green house gasses which carbon dioxide is among the major contributors. It was shown that increased emission of CO2 in the atmosphere in the recent time has exacerbated the global warming [3]. Part of the reasons for this can be explained from the fact that the forest resources which act as major absorbers of CO2 have been drastically reduced owing to the fact that the rate of deforestation is higher than the afforestation effort in the country.\n\nApart from environmental effects, the use of fuel wood for cooking has health implications especially on women and children who are disproportionately exposed to the smoke. Women in rural areas frequently with young children carried on their backs or staying around them, spend one to six hours each day cooking with fuel wood. In some areas, the exposure is even higher especially when the cooking is done in an unventilated place or where fuel wood is used for heating of rooms. Generally, biomass smoke contains a large number of pollutants which at varying concentrations pose substantial risk to human health. Among hundreds of the pollutants and irritants are particulate matters, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde and carcinogens such as benzo[α]pyrene, 1,2–butadiene and benzene [4].Studies showed that indoor air pollution levels from combustion of bio fuels in Africa are extremely high, and it is often many times above the standard set by US Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) for ambient level of these pollutants [5].\n\nAlso, consistent evidence revealed that exposure to biomass smoke increases the risk of a range of common diseases both in children and in adults. The smoke causes acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) particularly pneumonia in children [6, 7]. Among the women, it causes chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (Progressive and incompletely reversible air ways obstruction) [8,9]. Eyes irritation (sore, red eyes, tears) from the smoke is also a common experience in the use of fuel wood. A hospital based case – control studies proved that a person exposed to smoke of biomass has high risk of cataracts disease [10]. This evidence was further substantiated by an experiment carried out on animals which showed that biomass smoke is capable of damaging eye lens [11]. \n\nIn the whole, it was summed up that the total deaths attributed to the use of fuel wood in Nigeria are about 79,000. Also nearly 45% of the national burden diseases are related to solid fuel use, according to a WHO Survey [2]. Again, combustion of raw coal has equally been reported to have detrimental effects on both environments and the health of the people. Among other effects, inhalation of coal smoke increases the risk of lung cancer [12].\n\nFrankly speaking, transition to electricity or gas would have been the healthiest solution to these problems but the likelihood of a complete transition in the poorer urban and rural communities in the near future is minimal. Therefore it is pertinent that other intervention measures especially ones recommended by WHO [4] should be adopted to mitigate these health risks to the lowest possible level and equally to relieve the forest resources from pressure mounted on it.    \n\nFortunately, researches have shown that a cleaner, affordable fuel source which is a substitute to fuel wood can be produced by blending biomass (agricultural residues and wastes) with coal. Nigeria has large coal deposit which has remained untapped since 1950’s, following the discovery of petroleum in the country. Also, millions of tonnes of agricultural wastes are generated in Nigeria annually. But it is unfortunate that farmers still practise “slash–and-burn” agriculture. These agricultural wastes they encounter during clearing of land for farming or during processing of agricultural produce are usually burnt off. By this practice, not only that the useful raw materials are wasted, it further pollutes the environment and reduces soil fertility. \n\nFire affects soil below ground biodiversity, geomorphic process, and volatilizes large amount of nutrients and carbon accumulated in the soil organic matter [13]. Furthermore, during process of burning of agricultural wastes on the field, if it is not properly controlled, it can inadvertently lead to bush fire, destroying further the forest which has suffered much from the hand of wood seekers.\n\nForest fire is one of the severe environmental problems in Nigeria and every year various forest types are burnt as a result of fire set up deliberately or inadvertently through careless or uncared acts. Forest fire destroys the fresh saplings, seedlings and arrest regeneration of native species [13].\n\nHowever, these health hazard faced by people from the use of fuel wood, along with the agricultural wastes management and reduction of pressure mounted on the forest can be mitigated if Nigeria will switch over to production and utilization of bio-coal briquette; a cleaner and environmental friendly fuel wood substitute made from agricultural wastes and coal. Moreover, this will offer a good potential for utilization of a large coal reserve in Nigeria for economic diversification and employment generation through bio-coal briquette related SMEs.\n\n1.2    Literature Review\n\n1.2.1 Briquetting Process\n\nBriquetting is a mechanical compaction process for increasing the density of bulky materials. This process is used for forming fine particles into a designed shape. It can be regarded as a waste control measure in the case of production of briquettes from agricultural wastes. However, depending on the material of interest, briquetting can be used to provide fuel source as a preventive measure to many ecological problems. Briquetting is a high- pressure process which can be done at elevated temperature [14] or at ambient temperature [15, 16] depending on the technology one wants to employ. \n\nDuring this process, fine material is compacted into regular shape and size which does not separate during transportation, storage or combustion. In some briquetting techniques, the materials are simply compressed without addition of adhesive (binderless briquettes) [17, 18] while in some, adhesive material is added to assist in holding the particles of the material together [15, 16].\n\nGenerally, briquetting process has focused more on the production of smokeless solid fuels from coal and agricultural wastes. There are various techniques which have been used to produce smokeless solid fuel from coal fine. The most common technique is the use of roller press using only moderate pressure and binder. Note that the machines employed for this process are also used to make other kind of non-fuel briquettes from inorganic materials such as metal ores. However, briquetting of organic materials (agricultural wastes) requires significantly higher pressure as additional force is needed to overcome the natural springness of these materials. Essentially, this involves the destruction of the cell walls through some combination of pressure and heat. High pressure involved in this process suggests that organic briquetting is costlier than coal briquettes.\n\nVarious briquetting machines have been designed, ranging from very simple types which are manually operated to more complex ones mechanically or electrically powered. Generally, briquetting operations have developed in two directions, mechanically compression (hydraulic or pistons) and worm screw pressing types.\n\n1.2.2 Historical Background of Briquetting Process [18- 21] Although, compaction of loose combustible materials for fuel making purposes is a technique which has been in existence thousands of years ago but industrial method of briquetting seems to be dated back to eighteenth century. In 1865, report was made on machines used for making fuel briquettes from peats and are recognized as the predecessors of the present briquetting machines. Since then, there has been a wide spread use of briquettes made from brown coal and peat etc. \n\nThe use of organic briquettes (biomass briquettes) started more recently compared to coal briquette. It seams to have been common during World War and during the 1930s depression. The modern mechanical piston briquetting machine was developed in Switzerland based upon German development in the 1930s. Briquetting of saw dust are widespread in many countries in Europe and America during World War II because of fuel shortages. However, after the World War, briquettes were gradually phased out of the market because of availability and cheapness of hydrocarbon fuels. \n\nAs time went on, the use of organic briquette was revitalized due to high energy prices in the 1970s and early 1980s mainly for industrial heating in USA, Canada and Scandinavia, etc. In Japan, the use of briquette seems to be very common especially the use of “Ogalite” fuel briquettes made from saw dust and rice husk. The Japan technology has spread to Taiwan, and from there to other countries such as Thailand, Asia, USA and some other European countries. This type of briquette has been in use in Japan since 1950s as a substitute for charcoal which was then a widespread fuel source.\n\nFurthermore, in Great Britain, the first fuel briquette was manufactured by the Powell Dul Fryn Company in 1938 by heating anthracite chips bound with pitch to a temperature of around 750oC to produce a briquette known as phurnacite and this production was taken over by the National Coal Board in 1942. They were able to produce half a million tonne of coal annually. It was also reported that the same technique was tried on production of smokeless coal briquette from low-rank coal containing as much as 30-40% volatile materials. But the problem was how to reduce the volatile component of the coal to prevent smoke formation and at the same time, retaining sufficient active constituents to give an easily lighted bright fire with a high radiation. It was found that moderate heating (carbonization) of the low rank coal not only drives off a portion of the volatile matter but appears to change the remaining volatile portion in such a way that it does not smoke even with a volatile content as high as 23%. Phurnacite was produced from low-rank coal by heating the coal bound with pitch to 200oC. Since then, other technologies for production of smokeless briquettes were developed in Britain. These include the multi heat briquette marketed by the National Coal Board. This brand of smokeless briquette was made by curing pitch bound briquette in a bed of sand which is fluidized and kept at a temperature of about 380oC. Other types of briquettes developed were home fire and room heat. \n\nToday, many other developing countries have adopted and developed briquetting technology, owing to high cost and scarcity of fuel. Common types of briquettes so far in use are coal briquettes, peat briquettes, charcoal briquettes and biomass briquettes, etc. Most recently, researches showed that blending of coal and biomass will give rise to a briquette with better combustion properties and pollutants emission reduction. This type of briquette is known as bio-coal briquette. Some authors simply called it biobriquette [16]. \n\n1.3  Bio-Coal Briquettes\n\nBio-coal briquette is a type of solid fuel prepared by blending coal, biomass, binder and sulphur fixation agent [23,24]. Other additives may also be added. A research showed that   bio-coal briquettes may be prepared by blending the following [15]:\n\n•          Biomass (25% to 50%)\n\n•          Coal (75% to 50%)\n\n•          Sulphur fixation agent (up to 5%)\n\n•          Binder (up to 5%)\n\nAlso, according to clean coal technologies Japan, bio-coal briquettes are prepared by blending: \n\n•          Biomass (10% to 25%)\n\n•          Coal (75% to 90%)\n\n•          Sulphur fixation agent (depending on the sulphur content of the coal).\n\nIn this process, Ca(OH)2 acts as both sulphur fixation agent and the binder [16]. Also, activators such as iron oxide, potassium manganate and sodium chloride have been reported to have the ability of improving the thermal efficiency of the briquette [26].  \n\nThe high pressure involved in the process ensures that the coal particles and the fibrous biomass material interlace and adhere to each other as a result, do not separate from each other during combustion, transportation and storage. During combustion, the low ignition temperature of the biomass simultaneously combusts with the coal. The combined combustion of both gives a favorable ignition and fire properties; emits little dust and soot, generates sandy combustion ash, leaving no clinkers [16, 24]. Also the desulfurizing agent such as Ca(OH)2 in the briquette effectively reacts with the sulphur content of the coal to fix about 60-80% of it into the ash [16]. It was showed that lime (CaO) as a desulfurizing agent was able to capture up to 90-95% of the total sulphur in the coal, leaving only 5-10% emitted as sulphur oxides [25]. The equation of the reaction is as follows: \n\n                  CaO(s) + SO2 (g) + ½ O2 (g)            CaSO4(s).\n\nEvidence also revealed that lime when used as desulfurizer also acts as a binder. Also clay has been reported to be a good desulfurizing agent. Clay contains CaO and MgO which acts as desulfurizing agents. Also it contains Fe2O3 which has been shown to have a catalytic effect on the sulfation reaction [25].  \n\nThere are various biomass resources available for production of biocoal briquettes. Some of them are straw, sugar bagasse (fibrous residue of processed sugar cane), corn stalk, groundnut – shell, wheat straw, palm husk, rice husks, corn cob, forest wastes, and other agricultural wastes. Several researches on bio–coal briquette have been carried out using some of these biomass resources. There are records of researches carried out on production of bio-coal briquettes using sawdust [27], rice straw [28], olive stone [29, 30] and maize cob [24], etc. \n\nFurthermore, it has been shown that any grades of coal can be used for bio-coal production, even low grade coal containing high sulphur contents [24, 26]. This implies that, by this technology, extra cost of carbonizing low grade coal before briquetting is saved.  \n\nBinder is an adhesive material which helps to hold the particles of the material together in the briquette. Apart from its function to hold the particle from separation, it also protects the briquette against moisture in case of long storage [13]. There are several binders that can be used. Some of them are starch (from various starchy root such as cassava, and cereals), molasses, clay and even tree gum, etc. Some chemical substances have also been used as binding agent for production of briquettes. Some of them are asphalt [31], potassium [32], magnesia [33], ammonium nitrohumate [34] and commercial pitch [35]. Though the use of starch as binder is satisfactory in every respect, it disintegrates under moist or tropical condition. However, the use of small additional hydrocarbon binder such as pitch or bitumen has been reported to improve the water resisting property [36]. Moreover, the nature of the binder has influence in the combustibility of the briquette produced. For instance, briquette produced using clay takes longer time to ignite than the one produced using starch [13]. The reason for this is because of non-combustibility of clay compared to starch.\n\n1.3.1 Characteristics of Bio-Coal Briquettes\n\n(1)    Bio-coal briquette decreases the generation of dust and soot up to one-tenth that of direct combustion of coal [16]. Combustion of coal generates dust and soot because, during the combustion, the volatile components of the coal are released at low temperature (200-4000C) as incomplete combusted volatile matter. For bio-coal briquette, since the biomass component of the briquette ignites at low temperature compare to the coal, this ensures that the volatile matter in the coal which would have otherwise been liberated as smoke at low combustion temperature combusts completely. By so doing, there is a significant reduction in the amount of dust and soot generated. Note that smoke is a complex mixture of air-borne solid and liquid particulates as well as gases evolved on pyrolysis or combustion of material [45].\n\n(2)    Bio-coal briquette has a significant shorter ignition time when compared with coal or conventional coal briquette [15]. This is because of the biomass component of the briquette. Biomass has low ignition time.\n\n(3)    Bio-coal briquette has superior combustion-sustaining properties. Because of low expansibility and caking properties of bio-coal briquette, sufficient air flow is maintained between the briquettes during combustion in a fire-place. Hence it has very good combustion-sustaining properties and does not die out in a fireplace or other heater even when the air supply is decreased [16]. This property offers the opportunity of adjusting the combustion rate of the bio-coal briquette easily.\n\n(4)    Bio-coal briquette emits less SO2. It contains desulfurizing agent and the high pressure involved in the process enables the coal particles to adhere strongly to the desulfurizing agent. During combustion, the desulfurizing agent effectively reacts with the sulphur content of the coal to form a solid compound instead of being released as oxides of sulphur to the atmosphere. However, it is widely accepted that bio-coal briquette technology is one of the most promising technologies for the reduction of SO2 emission associated with burning of coal [24,37]. \n\n(5)    Bio-coal briquette has high breaking strength for easy transportation. The high pressure involved in the process coupled with the binder, compressed the raw materials into a rigid mass which does not break easily, hence can be stored and transported safely [16].\n\n(6)    Bio-coal briquette generates sandy ash which can be utilized in agriculture for soil improvement [38]. In the briquette, since the fibrous biomass intertwined with the coal particles, the resulted ash after combustion does not adhere or form clinch-lump, therefore, the ash is always sandy.\n\n(7)    Bio-coal briquette burns nearly perfect; therefore the flame has significant higher temperature than simple biomass burning [39] or coal [26].\n\n1.3.2 Table 1: Comparative Tests of Bio-coal Briquettes [40]\n\nBriquettes\n\nCalorific value (kcal/kg)\n\nMass(in kg) of\n\nEvaporated water by 1kg of the briquette\n\nTime(in minute) to cook a mixture of 1kg of mansuli rice, 0.25kg of rahar dal and 0.5kg of potatoes \n\nMass (in kg) of fuel consumed.\n\n75% coal\n\n(Jumlepani ghorahi coal) and 25% biomass (Lumibini bagasse.\n\n4222.5\n\n1.5\n\n64\n\n1.535\n\n80% coal (40% Jumlepani Ghorahi coal and 40% lignite) and 20% biomass (Lumbini bagasse) \n\n____\n\n____\n\n104\n\n1.650\n\n20% coal (Abidara coal) and 80% biomass (Chitiwan rice husk)\n\n3806\n\n1.0",

The heart begins beating some few weeks following conception and beats throughout life (Khader, 2004). It is also the strongest muscle in the human body and functions to maintain a constant circulation of blood throughout the body, it also acts as a pump and its action is composed of a series of events known as the cardiac cycle. The heart is composes of three layers of tissue which are; the pericardium, the myocardium and the Endocardium. The heart acts as a pump which drives blood into and through the arteries, but the right and the left side of the heart functions separately from one another some of the diseases associated with the cardiovascular system includes coronary heart diseases (CHD) which is the most common of heart diseases and it occurs when the arteries supplying blood to the heart narrow or harden from the build-up of plaque (Gina, 1996.),Ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease( CeVD),peripheral vascular disease, Heart Failure etc and some of the pharmacological treatment includes Angiotesin commonly prescribes includes Benazepril, Captopril, Moexipril, Beta Blockers which includes, Acebutolol, Betaxolol,etc.\n\nThe heart marker enzymes includes creatine kinasse(CK-MB)which is the enzyme used as the definitive serum marker for the diagnosis or exclusion of acute myocardial infarction (Andreas,2009).\n\nTroponin 1 Rapid test which is a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of cardiac Troponin 1(CTn1)and its complex in human serum or plasma at the level equal or higher than 1ng/ml. Myoglobin which is also designed for qualitative determination of myoglobin in human whole blood serum or plasma as an aid in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) and myoglobin is also a low molecular weight cytoplasm protein which is released into the blood stream when muscle cells are damaged and this protein is released into the blood stream more rapidly than any other myocardial marker and elevated levels can be detected as early as one (1) hour after the onset of AMI(Penttila,2002). Demodium velutinum has been suggested to have some therapeutic effect in the treatment of cardiovascular disorder and in the reducing of high cholesterol content in the body. Demodium Velutinum is one of the few shrubs species that has been identified as a well adapted to acid tropical soil and a good nutritive value(Schultze-Kraft, 2002).Every culture has relied on the variety of natural medicines found in healing plants for the therapeutic properties\n\n(Armstrong,2004).Researchers find that food and their individual constituents perform similar fashion to modern drugs and sometimes better without the dreaded side effect. The leaves and young stems are rich in crude protein and mineral elements and can provide higher levels of some nutrient (Bakker, 1994). Natural plants have been valuable sources of mineral agent with proven potential of treating infectious diseases and with lesser side effects compared to the synthetic drug agents(Guyton, 2002).Hence potentially useful drugs can often be recognized from their relative importance and uses in folk medicine. Extract of Desmodium velutinum stem are used traditionally in some diseases condition particularly headache and may be a source of a pharmacological active agent useful in the treatment of aches and pain(Anowi,2012). This work aimed at investigating any hypocholesterolemic activity in the N-hexane extract of Desmodium Velutinum stem. ",

        "content": "THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY OF Crateva Adansonii DICHLOROMETHANE FRACTION.\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\n Crateva adansonii is a medicinal herb commonly used in parts of Africa because of the side effects of Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID), like heart diseases and kidney failure. Inflammation is a major public heart issue in the world but treatment is becoming complex because of the side effects of antiinflammatory pharmaceutical drugs. Hence the need for alternative drug is highly required. This research work investigated the anti-inflammatory activity of dichloromethane fraction of methanol extract of Crateva adansonii stem bark, using rodent model. Adult Swiss albino rats (110-200g) of either sex were randomlydivided into 5 groups of 4 animals each. Groups 2, 3, 4, and 5 received different doses of the extract (300mg, 500mg, 700mg, and 900mg) in 3% v/v tween 80 administered intraperitonally respectively. Control group-1 received volume of 3%v/v tween 80 and standards group received 100mg/kg Ibuprofen. One hour later acute inflammation was induced by injection of 0.1ml of undiluted egg albumin into the sub planter of the right hand paw of rats. The volume of the paw was measured by mercury displacement before and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 & 3 hours after egg albumin injection, while the standard was measured at internals of one hour, for up to 4 hours. Edema formation was assessed in terms of the difference in the zero time per volume of the injected pair and its volume at the different time after egg albumin injection. For each dose of extract, percentage inhibition of edema was calculated percentage inhibition. Result show that Crateva adansonii may have anti-inflammatory effects. This finding supports the use stem bark of Crateva adansonii in not only traditional medicine for the treatment of inflammation.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nResearch on analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs has gained great attention for the past ten years (Farouk et al., 2008). However, the number of new drugs remains low. Most analgesic and anti- inflammatory compounds available on market have adverse effects, including life-threatening, bleeding or perforation of gastro duodenal tract (Buttgereit et al., 2001). Consequently there results the need to search for more active compounds with less adverse effects.\n\nFree radicals and reactive oxygen species are by products of numerous physiological and biochemical processes. Natural antioxidants and antiinflammatoryeffects have been found in a number of food and agricultural products like seed, roots, stem bark. Besides the traditional resources used for antioxidants, many plant species have been investigated in the search for natural antioxidants and anti-inflammatory effect.\n\nThere is renewed and increased interest in plants as source of new pharmaceutical drugs. Crateva Adansonii commonly known as the garlic pear and temple plant and many other names in a variety of dialect has been viewed to have great anti inflammatory effect, thus studied here on.(Banias et al. 1992).\n\nAnti-inflammation is therefore understood as a process in which the body responds to antigenic stimulus to injuries and infections in a coordinated manner in order to contain a site of change, localize the responds and restore tissue function .it involves the reaction of vascularized tissues to local injury and the local reaction and resulting morphological changes, the destruction or removal of infectious material etc. (Koch 1972).\n\n1.1     Crateva Adansonii\n\nThe flowering tree is called the sacred garlic pear and temple plant, genus: Crateva, Family: Capparaceae. The tree is sometimes called the spider tree because the showy flowers bear long, spidery stamens. It is native to Japan, Australia, much of Southeast Asia and several South Pacific islands. It is grown elsewhere for fruit, especially in parts of the African continent. The fruit of the tree is edible. The nectar-filled flowers are attractive to a multitude of insects and birds. The pierid butterfly (Hebomoiaglaucippe) is a frequent visitor to this plant.  The rough back of this plant is faintly greenish especially when dried up.\n\nMostly, the bark of this plant stem, root and leaves are medicinal, and hence giving focus to the study of the stem bark for anti-inflammatory effect is highly proper and considerable.\n\n1.2     Research Aim and Objectives.\n\nThe research aim at the use of Crateva adansonii methanol extract to evaluate antiinflammatory activity of different fraction of the extract, by administration of this fraction on induced acute inflammation. Using fresh egg albumin, on adult albino rats. As an objective to compare the therapeutic potential, either to observe the physiological impact of Crateva adansonii methanol extracts fractions on white albino rats and determines the anti-inflammatory effect.",

        "content": "ELEMENTAL ANALYSIS ON PTEROCARPUS MILDBREADII (OHA)SEED\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\nElemental analysis is the qualitative detection and quantitative determination of chemical elements(atoms,ions)in a sample(Fritz Pregl 1923). To detect an\n\nixelement, one should fix an appearance of an analytical signal. The formation of precipitate or characteristic crystals, colour change, an isolation of gaseous products, an appearance of a definite lines in spectrum, luminescence, etc. To determine elements quantity, it is necessary to measure a value of an analytical signal; a precipitate mass, intensity of a current, solution absorption, spectrum line, luminescence or radioactivity, a reaction rate and so on.(www.intechopen.com).\n\nThis study was undertaken to analse the elements present in grounded Pterocarpus mildbreadii (Oha seed) using Atomic Absorption Spectrometer(AAS MODEL-AA320N).The seed was found to contain these essential macro minerals/elements sodium(Na),Potassium(K),calcium(Ca),magnesium(Mg),and the trace elements iron(Fe),copper(Cu),zinc(Zn), and selenium(Se)(Duffus,2002).The study established that Pterocarpus mildbreadii(oha seed) does not contain manganese and has high content of potassium which is necessary for good health.\n\n1CHAPTER ONE\n\n1.1 INTRODUCTION, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nA seed or mature ovule is a miniature plant with a protective cover in a suspended state of development. Most seeds contain a built-in food supply called endosperm, orchid is an exception. The endosperm can be made up of proteins, carbohydrates and fats.\n\nSeed can also be defined as a small embryonic plant enclosed in a covering called the seed coat, usually with some stored food. It is the product of the ripened ovule of gymnosperm and angiosperm plants which occurs after fertilization and some growth within the mother plant(Wikipedia).Seed protects a plant embryo so that it can grow into a new plant. Many seeds are edible, such as sunflower seeds, tomato seeds, corn and peas.\n\nSeeds contain three distinct structures. The inside of a seed contains an embryo, which is a baby plant with a shoot and a tiny root. The two halves of a seed are stored food that provides the nourishment necessary for seeds to germinate, or begin growing. Surrounding the seed is a hard, tough seed coat, which protects the seed during dormancy(Anville 2007).\n\nMost seeds contain a built-in food supply called endosperm. The endosperm can be made up of proteins, carbohydrates and fats. Seeds also contain anti-nutrients in\n\n2their seed coat. These anti-nutrients includes phytin, lectin, trypsin inhibitor activity, tannin and cyanide. In addition, they also contain minerals such as sodium, potassium,calcium,magnesium,phosphorus,zinc,manganese,iron,selenium and copper.(Balogun 2000)Oilseeds are energy dense foods; for example, sesame seeds provide 600kcal or 2470kj/1000g.Although oilseeds contain protein(|14-32g/100g)and carbohydrate(ranging from less than 1g/100g to more than 34g/100g),most of the food energy they provide is as fat(which provides 9kcal or 37kj/g).Oilseeds vary widely in their fatty acid composition but tend to be rich in MUFA(e.g peanut)r PUFA(e.g sunflower seeds).Some seed oils contain significant amounts of EFA, ALNA, an n-3 fatty acid, and linoleic acid(LA),an n-6 fatty acid. from these two fatty acids, the body can make all the fatty acids it needs. From LA, arachidonic acid can be produced, and from ALNA the long chain n-3 eicosapentaenoic acid(EPA)and docosahexanoic acid(DHA)can be made.(BNF 1999).\n\nGenerally, whole oilseeds are a source of fibre, phosphorus, iron and magnesium; many oilseeds are a source of vitamin E(an antioxidant),niacin and folate. Whole oilseeds also contain phytoestrogens, a group of substances including lignans and isoflavones. Phytoestrogens have a structure similar to the oestrogen hormone oestradiol and can bind to oestrogen receptors.Phytoestrogens may provide a protective effect against coronary heart disease as they have been shown to have a\n\n3\n\nlowering effect on blood cholesterol.Additionally,some phytoestrogens may have antioxidant properties(Goldberg 2003). \n\n\n",

Low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterols have been identified as independent coronary risk factors (Rodrigue et al., 2010). High level of blood cholesterol is responsible for circulatory system disorder. Increase level of low density lipoprotein (LDL) is alarming for cardiovascular diseases and their risk is increased many times (Harman et al., 2011). \n\nIn developing countries, the occurrence of heart diseases increases rapidly (Nordestgard et al., 2010). Medical studies show that about 70% of adults over 50 years old suffer atherosclerosis. (Sherien and Azza, 2009). A large number of synthetic hypolipidemic drugs are available in market. Long term use of these drugs cause serious side effects, and are costly.\n\nA medicinal plant is any plant which in one or more of its organ, contains substance that can be used for therapeutic purpose or which is a precursor for synthesis of useful drugs (Sivakumar et al., 2007). Plant contains a large number of bioactive phytochemicals that are responsible for pharmacological action of plants and used for development of drugs. Many medicinal plants have shown their antilipidemic effect and proved their efficacy in cardiovascular diseases (Nordestgard et al., 2010; Wang, 1999).\n\nOne of such plants used very often in the management of the disease by the traditional medicine practitioners of Eastern Nigeria is Desmodium velutium, a perennial plant erect or semi-erect shrub or sub-shrub up to 3m light. It is widely distributed in subtropical Asia and tropical Africa. (Amowi and Azode, 2012). \n\nExtracts of Desmodium velutium are used traditionally in some disease conditions particularly aphrodisiac and headache. Hence, Desomdium velutium may be a source of a pharmacological active agent useful in the treatment of aches, pains and diarrhoea. In Ghana, native doctors mix the root of Desmodium lasincarpum with some hot peppers and use it as enema to cure blood in urine. In Eastern States of Nigeria, the plant locally known as “Ikeagwuani”. (Onyegbule et al., 2012). In these present studies, I investigated the antilipidemic activity of the water (H2O) extract of\n\nDesmodium velutinum Leaves on albino wistar rats. ",

The useful physiological properties of yeast have led to their use in the field of biotechnology; fermentation of sugars by yeast is the oldest and largest application of this technology. The significant source of inhibiting fermentations in other to extend or elongate the shelf life of some industrial and domestic produce continues to be important to people that has more interest in improving the development of our industries and economic values. Though many industries rely on this same fermentation to carry out their daily productions such as the beer producing company, win producing company, bakeries, yogurt producing industries and so many more.\n\nIn this work the process of inhibiting fermentation is carried out using galactaric acid known as mucic acid which can also be called meso-galactaric acid obtained by nitric acid oxidation of galactose or galactose-containing compounds like lactose, dulcite, quercite, and most varieties of gum.It forms a crystalline powder which melts at 213 °C. It is insoluble in alcohol, and nearly insoluble in cold water.  This a process in which glucose comes in play with yeast in other for normal yeast action on sugar to occur which is fermentation and the galactaric acid plays it own role when introduced in to the mixture of  yeast and glucose. This work is carried out by observing their sugar level.\n\n1.1   AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nUsing galactaric acid to inhibit fermentation (yeast).",

Any abnormality involving these systems whether from medications or disease has a significant impact on the ability to develop and sustain erection; ejaculate and experience orgasm. (Laumann et al., 1999).The physiological process of erection begins in the brain and involves the nervous and vascular system. The chemicals that initiate erection are neurotransmitters present in the brain. Any kind of stimulation physical or psychological, causes nerves to send message to the vascular system which result in significant blood flow to the penis. Two arteries in the penis supply blood to erectile tissues and the corpora cavernous which become engorged and expand as a result of increased blood flow and pressures. Because blood must stay in the penis to maintain rigidity. An erectile tissue is enclosed by tunicae, which is fibrous elastic sheathes cinch which prevents blood leaving he penis during13electron. When muscle in the penis contract to stop the inflow of blood and open out flow channels and an electron is reserved.HORMONAL INVOLVEMENT IN ERECTION Oestrogen/Progesterone: (These are female hormones that cause clitoralerection. If the body has two much oestrogen and or too little testost erone, she ca n get very wet but can not erect her clitoral and G-spot. ( Haimen et al., 2002). Estrogen tends to increase the size of the bread, labia minors (inner lips) and clitoral hood, but shrinks the glans clitoris into the clitoral hood making it invisible. It also increases the thickness of the vaginal lining making the G-spot inaccessible. The mechanism of the clitoral and G-spot erection is the same as that of the penis. It is driven by the parasympathetic sexual nerve (The neurotransmitter acetylcholine) through the neurotransmitter. Nitric oxide and the erection dilator cGMP, which is continuously powered by the burning of testosterone without a testosterone burst and burning. She cannot pop the glans Clitoris and G-spot out. If she is on birth control pills there is a chance that her body is over flooded by estrogens and low progesterone. Over loaded liver cannot produce sufficient essential enzymes to synthesize sufficient NO, cGMP and testosterone to support the clitoral and G-spot erection infact excessive estrogen or progesterone in the body will shrink the penis, clitoral and G-spot, but likely increase the breast size (under the excessive estrogen action).14 Testosterone:- Testosterone is a hormone produced by the testicles and is responsible for the proper development of male sexual characters. The pump helps the penis to become erect while band maintains the erection.Circulating levels of testosterone correlate with NO, production. Testosterone treatment can reduce central adiposity and insulin resistance, which may contribute to its beneficial effects on vascular NO, and ED. Raising low testosterone levels improves ED and can restore erectile function in response to PDE-5 inhibitors.MECHANISM OF ACTION OF PDE-5 INHIBITION IN ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION.A spinal reflex and the L-arginine nitric oxide guanglyl cyclase-cyclic guanosine monophonsphate (cGMP) pathway mediate smooth muscle relaxation that results in penile erection. Nerves and endothelial cells directly release nitric oxide in the penis, where it stimulates guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP and lowers intracellular calcium level. This triggers relaxation of arterial and trabecular smooth muscle, leading to arterial dilation, venous constriction, and erection. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) is the predominant phosphodiesterase in the corpus cavernosum. The catalytic site of PDE-5 normally degrades cGMP and PDE-5 inhibitors such as sildenafil potentiate endogenous increase in cGMP by inhibiting its breakdown at the catalytic site. Phosphorylation of PDE-5 increases its enzymatic activity as well as the affinity of its allosteric (noncatalytic/GAF domains) sites for cGMP. Binding of cGMP to the allosteric15site further stimulates enzymatic activity. Thus phosphorlation of PDE-5 and binding of cGMP to the non catalytic site mediate negative feed back regulation of the cGMP pathway.In recent years a deeper understanding of the regulation of penile smooth muscle has led to greater insight into the physiology of normal erectile function and erectile dysfunction (ED), as well as the introduction of phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor for the treatment of ED. The oral PDE-5 inhibitors sidenafil has proved to be a safe and effective treatment for this disorder and has fostered further research into the underlying mechanisms of such drugs. This article will review the biochemical pathways involved in erection. The role of PDE-5 in these pathway and the molecular mechanisms involved in PDE activity.A penile erection result from the relaxation of smooth muscle in the penis .the process is mediated by a spinal reflex and incorporates sensory and mental stimuli. The Balance between factors that stimulate contraction and relaxation determines the tone of penile vasculature and the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum.\n\n\n",

It plays an important role in the maintenance of internal environment through its multiple and diverse functions. Liver is involved in several vital functions such as metabolism, secretion and storage. Hepatitis or inflammatory disorder involves inflammation and damage to the hepatocytes. Hepatitis is one of the most prevalent diseases in the world. Every year 18,000 people had been reported to die due to liver cirrhosis caused by viral hepatitis [L] Ectopic fat storage occurs in obesity particularly in the liver leading to a condition termed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD] characterized by varying degree of liver injury that progresses from steatosis to tratohepatitis, fibrosis and necrosis Due to its prominent association with IR (insulin resistance). Obesity, NAFLD is regarded as the hepatic manifestation of metabolite [3] syndrome. Liver has great capacity to detoxicate toxic substances.Kola pod is the traditional health food around the world. Kola pod Husk meal is the residue after grinding the pod of kola and filtration, and it is an excellent source in slightly high in fiber (16.74%), low in crude protein (9.98%), moderate NFE (42.391) and metabolizable energy 2497 kcal/kg, andash content is relatively high. (13.26%). when companied with the values reported by (Oluokun, 1999) ;(Hamzat and Babatunde, 2001). These differences might be due to varietals differenced and shelf life of the test ingredient before analysis. However, the crude protein content fairly put kola pod husk meal (KPHM) with feed ingredients like Sorghum while the fibre content put it in same proximate composition with Bremer‘s grains. Kola pod being one of the important pods for medical treatment in the world. The kola pod husk provides some essential materials for doth drying. The pod bark, when mixed with some ingredients is used in traditional medicine to reduce Labour pains. The bark is used in treating swellings and fresh wounds. The roots provide excellent chewing sticks for cleaning the teeth and the wood is used in local carvings coachwork and boatbuilding. Lipid refers to the different kind of fats present in the bodies of human plasma include triglyceride (TG), phospholipids (PL), cholesterol esters (CE), and free cholesterol (FC) and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA. Each lipid plays a different role in our bodies yet all of them except free cholesterol (FC) contain esters of long chain fatty acid in their structures. Lipids are insoluble in plasma due to their non- polar structures thus; they need some carriers that are soluble in polar and non- polar environment. Lipids are packaged and carriedin the form of lipoprotein, which is a molecule that contains both protein (i.e. apolipoprotein) and lipids.Statins (lipitor) are group of drugs approved for their Cholesterol reduction properties and are commonly used to treat atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. These drugs inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-COA) reductase. The rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis; which converts HMG.CoA to mevalonate. Apart from cholesterol, mevalonate is also the substrate for the synthesis of nonsteroid, isoprenoids such as coenzyme Q. Depletion of these isoprenoids results in the so called plelotropic effects of statins which are independent of cholesterol.Lowering effect.These plelotropic effects of anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and ant-proliferative effect. In addition, data from experimental and observational studies indicated that statins have neuroprotective effects and be a treatment option for neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system and the ocular structures particularly the retina (schemer, 2007). Statins (Atorvastatin) is widely used in the treatment of hepatic diseases. They have been widely used in chinning proactive as cholesterol lowering agents to reduce mobility and mortality from coronary artery diseases. It also has aneffect in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis.However, limited studies are available on the effect of kola pod husk meal treatment on hepatoprotective effect in high fat diet fed animal in this regard, the present study was aimed to investigate the effect of kola pod meal on high-fat fed rats related to different hepatoprotective effect by comparing Lipitor Treatment.",

        "content": "THE EFFECT OF ETHANOL EXTRACT OF DESMODIUM VELUTINUM STEM ON SOME MARKER EMZYME IN LIVER OF ALBINO WISTAR RATS\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nPresent investigations were carried out on the effect of ethanol extract of Desmodium velutinum stem on some liver enzymes of albino wistar rats fed with high fat from cow‟s brain. Twelve healthy albino wistar rats were divided into four groups. Group I rats were fed with balanced diet (normal feed, that is grower‟s mash) and tap water. Group II rats were fed with fat diet (cow‟s brain) (3.6g/day) alone. Group III rats received combined mixture of 70% fat diet (cow‟s brain) with 30% ethanol extract of Desmoduim elutinum stem (2.7g/day), Group IV rats were fed with fat diet (cow‟s brain) and were administered with a drug atorvastatin (5mg/rat/day). The rats were sacrificed at the end of the experimental (two weeks) period. The plant extract  was screened for its phytochemical constituents, using standard procedures. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of tannins, flavonoids, saponins and alkaloids. The liver function tests was assessed by measuring the total bilirubin, total serum protein, direct and indirect bilirubin and liver enzymes such as Alanine amino transferase (ALT), Aspartate amino transferase (AST), Alkaline phosphate (ALP), Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) on the liver of the albino wistar rat. The serum, ALT, ALP, AST and bilirubin concentration of the albino wistar rat increased significantly (P>0.05) compared to their total protein concentration. The result obtained indicate that the ethanol extract of Desmodium Velutinum stem possess hepatoprotective activity on the fatty liver of albino wistar rat fed with fat from cow‟s brain. The studied plant showed variable amount of phytochemicals including flavonoid, alkaloid, saponin, tannins, terpenoid  which were determined quantitatively using literature methods. The significant effect of the Desmodium velutinum stem  ethanol extract was compared with standard drug, atorvastatin. The result in the present study suggest that the ethanol extract of  Desmodium velutinum stem can be used in treating liver diseases.     \n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe liver is the largest and most complex internal organ in the body. It plays an important role in the maintenance of internal environment through its multiple and diverse functions. Liver is involved in several vital functions such as metabolism, secretion and storage. Hepatitis or inflammatory disorder involves inflammation and change to the hepatocytes. Hepatitis is one of the most prevalent diseases in the world. Every year 18,000 people had been reported to die due to liver cirrhosis caused by viral hepatitis (Wang et al., 2008). Ectopic fat storage occurs in obesity, particularly in the liver leading to a condition termed non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) characterized by varying degree of liver injury that progresses from steatosis to tratohepatitis, fibrosis and necrosis. Due to its prominent association with insulin resistance/obesity, NAFLD is regarded as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Liver has great capacity to detoxicate toxic substance and synthesizes useful principles. Therefore damage to liver inflicted by hepatotoxic agents is of grave consequences. Experimental studies have reported that animal fed a high fat diet (HFD) for more than two months develop weight, hyperlipidemic, hyperglycemia, oxidative stress and insulin resistance (IR). Besides, consumption of a calorie-rich diet results in lipid accumulation, excess production of inflammatory cytokines and macrophage infiltration that favours the progression of liver disease. Many medicinal plant/indigenous plant have been mentioned and well established as hepatoprotective agents.\n\nDesmodium velutinum is a medicinal plant around the world. The extract of Desmodium velutinum showed significant anti-pyretic activity on experimental rats used. Desmodium velutinum is very rich in alkaloids and related amino compounds. It is a source of flavonoid, saponins and pharmacological active agent useful in the treatment of aches and pains. It also showed that one of the uses is for erectile enhancing property. Desmodium velutinum being one of the important medicinal plant in the world may have effect on the liver. However limited studies are available on the effect of Desmodium velutinum treatment on hepatoprotective effect of its extract on high fat diet fed animal. In this regard, the present study was aimed to investigate the effect of ethanol extract of Desmodium velutinum stem on liver function tests on albino wistar rats fed with high fat from cow‟s brain  related to different hepatoprotective effect by comparing it to a known drug, atorvastatin treatment which is used to lower the level of cholesterol in blood. Since changes in the concentration and composition of plasma lipid and lipoproteins occur frequently in liver disease, these findings may be useful in following the clinical course of patient with liver diseases of various causes.\n\nLiver disease is associated with characteristic changes in the lipid composition of the surface coat of plasma lipoprotein particles. Cholesterol accumulate as hepatic secretion of lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase decreases, such abnormal circulating lipoproteins tend to induce corresponding changes in cell membrane lipid composition. Studies in both human and experimental liver disease confirm that this does occur and that it is wide-spread. Low density lipoproteins, which are rich in cholesterol can also be taken up by the liver or extrahepatic tissues by a receptor mediated endocytosis that specially recognizes apolipoproteins. It can be predicted that extra hepatic membrane dysfunction might be a general feature of severe liver disease. It is proposed that many of the cellular disturbances and metabolic abnormalities accompanying hepatic disease result from, or are exacerbated by lipoprotein induced changes in membrane lipid composition and function. Hence Desmodium velutinum may be a source of a pharmacological active agent useful in the treatment of high level cholesterol in the blood which has got both liver protecting and nutritional value.

        "content": "HYPOLIPIDEMIC AND ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY OF METHANOL LEAF EXTRACT OF KIGELIA AFRICANA IN ALLOXAN-INDUCED DIABETIC RATS\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 Background of study\n\nDiabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect of insulin secretion, which is insulin action or both. Insulin deficiency in turn leads to chronic hyperglycaemia with disturbances of carbohydrate fat and protein metabolism (Kumar et al., 2011).\n\nGlobally the estimated incidence of diabetes and project for year 2030, as given by international diabetes federation is 350million (Ananda et al., 2012). Currently available pharmotherapies for the treatment of diabetes mellitus include oral hypoglycaemic agent and insulin. However these current drugs do not restore normal glucose homeostasis and they are free from side effects (Bandawane et al., 2011).\n\nIn view of the adverse effect associated with the synthetic drugs and as plants are safer, cheaper, and as much effective. Conventional and anti-diabetic plants can be explored (Kumar et al., 2010). Over 400 traditional plants have been reported for the treatment of diabetes (Ramachandran et al., 2011).\n\nFurthermore after world Health Organisation recommended investigation of hypoglycaemic agents from medicinal plants has become more important (Kumar et al., 2010). Also diabetes has been treated orally with several medicinal plants or their extract based on folklore medicine since ancient times.\n\nKigelia africana (Lam) Benth (Family: Bignoniaceae) is widely distributed in south central and West Africa. It is known as the cucumber or sausage tree because of its huge fruits (average 0.6cm in length and 44kg in weight) which hang from fibrous stalks. It is also known as balm Khene in Hindi and it is distributed all over India but found in abundance in West Bengal. It is found mostly in water areas and spreads abundantly across wet savannah and riverine areas (Sofowaora et al., 1980).\n\nExperimentally, the plant has shown antibacterial, antifungal, antineoplastic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties (Saini et al., 2009). The roots, the wood and leaves have been found to contain kigelinone, vernolic acids, kigelin, iridoids, luteolin and 6-hydroxyluteolin (Picerno et al., 2005). Crude extract of herbs and species and other materials rich in phenolic are of increasing interest in the food industry because they retard oxidative degradation of lipids and thereby improving the quality and nutritional value of food (Frankel, 1995).\n\nThe baked fruits of Kigelia africana are used for fermentation of beer. It also has internal application including treatment of dysentery, ringworm, tapeworm, malaria, diabetes, pneumonia,   haemorrhage and tooth care (Gills, 1992).\n\nIn West Africa, the roots and unripe fruit are used as vermifuge and as treatment for haemorrhoids and rheumatism. The bark is traditionally used as remedy for syphilis and gonorrhoea. The fruits and bark ground and boiled in water are taken orally or used as an enema in treating children’s stomach ailment usually tapeworm (Walt et al., 1962)\n\n1.2 Statement of the problem\n\nAs impressive improvement has occurred in global health status in the past century which has become a cause for celebration. Therefore, public health professionals can feel proud of their contribution to these achievements even as they appreciate the complexity of the underlying driving force, many of which lie outside traditional public health work. But this satisfaction must be tempered by emerging concerns (Sen and Bonita, 2000) against the recent evidence suggesting that based current trends many low income countries are unlikely to achieve desired health target by 2015 due to devastating disease and overwhelming failing health system (Travis et al., 2004).\n\nThe literature review survey revealed that there is no experimental evidence of antidiabetic and hypolipidemic effect of the plant. Therefore the present work was undertaken to explore the antidiabetic and hypolipidemic potential of Kigelia africana methanol leaf extract of the plant in alloxan induced diabetic rats.\n\n1.3. Aim of the study\n\nThe research is aimed at investigating the hypolipidemic and antioxidant capacity of methanol leaf extract of Kigelia africana in alloxan induced diabetic rats.\n\n1.4 Objective of the study\n\nSpecifically the study sort to:\n\nDetermine the effects of Kigelia africana methanol leaf extract on antioxidant enzyme. Determine the effects of Kigelia africana methanol leaf extract on lipid profile of diabetic rats. Determine the effects of Kigelia africana methanol leaf extract on oxidative parameters of alloxan-induced diabetic rats.",

Diabetes mellitus is now a pandemic, affecting about 10million Nigerians (Ogbera et al, 2005) and about 350 million people worldwide (Ezzati et al, 2011) among who are pregnant women. It is well documented that the combined stress of diabetes mellitus and pregnancy creates a metabolic environment that is often life threatening to both the mother and the fetus (Freinkel, 1980; Metzger, 1991).\n\nHence, pregnancy among women that have pre-existing diabetes or gestational diabetes is associated with increased rate of adverse outcome for both mother and fetus (Kingsley, 2007; Shefali et al., 2006).\n\nThis is primarily due to altered maternal intrauterine environment, creating a situation in which the fetus is exposed to abnormal metabolic substrate (glucose) levels (Van Assche et al, 1991). There is an increased placental transfer of glucose from mother to fetus because of increased availability at the maternal site (Thomas et al, 1990). The compromised metabolic state of the fetus subsequently precipitates a variety of complications associated with ‘‘fuel-mediated teratogenesis’’ (e.g., hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and macrosomia) (Freinkel, 1980; Metzger, 1991). One particularly devastating effect of diabetic pregnancy is that these conditions affect the fetus not only in utero, but also extend throughout the life of the offspring (Padilha et al, 2007; George et al, 2010). Additionally, maternal hyperglycemia stimulates abnormal fetal growth (Aberg et al, 2001) due to the greater availability of glucose in the blood flow (Maayan-Metzger et al, 2009), and this high weight fetus carries a high risk for 17 developing insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus in childhood, adolescence and adulthood (Buzinaro et al, 2008; Simeoni and Barker, 2009)\n\nThe chances of reducing this poor outcome of pregnancy among diabetics are intricately related with the level of glycemic control (Shefali et al., 2006).\n\nThe fact that the economic cost of managing diabetes mellitus is high confers a very important role to medicinal plants in the management of diabetes mellitus especially in developing countries where resources are meager.\n\nConsequently, a number of plants indigenous to Nigeria have been studied, and found to have hypoglycemic effects. These effects were traced to phytochemicals like alkanoids called active principles that can be extracted from plants(Ojewale, 2006; Osadebe et al., 2004). One of such anti-diabetic plants is Garcinia kola, commonly known as Bitter kola. It is an evergreen tree, indigenous to sub-Saharan Africa and belongs to a family of tropical plants called Guttifera (Ofusori et al., 2008). The seed is a masticatory, used for traditional hospitality in cultural and social ceremonies. Every part of the plant has shown to be of medicinal importance and has a wide range of medicinal effects, hence the name ‘wonder plant’ as it is commonly called.\n\nAmong the litany of its medicinal effects are; antidiabetic effects (Iwu et al, 1990), weight reducing effets (Koshy et al., 2001), leptin like action (Hayamizu et al., 2003), antihepatotoxic effects (Akintonwa and Essien, 1990), antioxidative stress and anti DNA 18 damage (Farombi, et al., 2004), detoxification of the toxic effects of other chemicals (Esimone et al., 2002; Nwokocha et al, 2011), etc.\n\n  1.2 JUSTIFICATION FOR THE STUDY\n\n Diabetes mellitus is fast becoming the most common type of disease in school children (Pontiroli, 2004). This may be as a result of the reported more than doubling in therate of diabetes among expectant mothers between 2002 and 2008 (Lawrence et al., 2008).\n\nThe economic cost of managing diabetes is high. As a result, in the developing countries where resources are meager, there is a shift from contemporary to orthodox medicine since medicinal plants are relatively easier to find and less expensive alternative.\n\nCoincidentally, some of the commonly consumed plant materials in Nigeria have been found to poses anti-diabetic properties. One of such anti-diabetic plantmaterials Bitter kola seed is used as a stimulant. It is also taken by pregnant women to stop nausea.\n\nAlthough Bitter kolaseed is a known anti-diabetic, there is paucity of data on;\n\n(1) Its effects on pregnancies complicated by diabetes mellitus\n\n(2) Early postnatal development of the offspring’s of such pregnancies.\n\nHence, the present study was therefore designed to investigate these. \n\n 1.3 AIM\n\nThe aim of this study is to determine the effect of consumption of Garcinia kola extract by diabetic pregnant rats on the pregnancy outcome and early postnatal development of their offspring.  \n\n 1.4 OBJECTIVES\n\n To determine the effect of consumption of Bitter kolaextract by diabetic pregnant rats on;\n\ni.

        "content": "EFFECT OF MOMORDICA CHARANTIA LEAF FRACTIONS ON SERUM ELECTROLYTES AND RENAL FUNCTION INDICES IN ALLOXAN-INDUCED DIABETIC ALBINO RATS\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1Background of study\n\nDiabetes affects one hundred and thirty five million people in one year worldwide (King et.al., 1999) and this figure is projected to rise to three hundred million in 2025 ((King et. al.,1998). It is obvious that diabetes, a chronic non communicable disease, continues to have a tremendous impact on society in terms of the quality of life and straining health care resources. The costs incurred in managing or preventing it are enormous, both in Kenya and throughout the world. The disease causes substantial morbidity, mortality and long-term complications and remains a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In Africa, this disease continues to impact on the poverty levels of the people.\n\nDiabetes mellitus is a systemic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose due to absolute oxidative stress may cause tissue to be more susceptible to oxidative damage and progression of disease in renal glomerolus (Brownlee, 2001; Yao et al., 2009).Histopathological evaluations on the diabetic kidney show expansion of mesangial matrix and uniform thickening of basement membranes in glomerulus and tubules (Ziyadeh and Wolf, 2008).\n\nSince ancient times, plants have been a worthy source of medicine, which not only control hyperglycemia at low dosages but can also be taken for longer periods in contrast to synthetic hyperglycemic drugs (Grover et al., 2002). One of these plants is Momordica charantia (MC), also known as karalla, or bitter melon, which belongs to the cucurbitaceafamily, grows in tropical areas, including parts of the Amazon, east Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean, and is cultivated throughout South America as a food and medicine (Grover and Yadav, 2004).\n\nThe Momordica charantia (bitter melon) is a widely used plant in the traditional medicine for the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM). It has been shown that Momordica charantia (Mc) has hypoglycemic effects on animals and humans, however, we don´t know if this effect is present in a chronic time and if the plant extract (stem and leaves) participates in the antihyperglycemic effect.\n\nThe Momordica charantia (MC) contains anti-hyperglycemic chemicals include glycosides, saponins, alkaloids, fixed oils, triterpenes, proteins and steroids (Murakami et al., 2001; Erden et al., 2010). These chemicals are concentrated in fruits of the Momordica charantia (MC), therefore fruit of the MC has shown more pronounced anti-hyperglycemic activity (Grover and Yadav, 2004). Presence of antioxidants in the fruits and vegetables such as vitamin C, E, carotenoids, lycopenes and flavonoids are also important in prevent free radical injury (Semiz and Sen, 2007). Total flavonoid and phenol contents ofMomordica charantia (MC) extract were analyzed and revealed that MC extract possess potent diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity (Wu and Ng, 2008). Several studies have reported the anti-diabetic effects of MC on renal functional and histological changes in alloxan albino rats but only limited data is available on the anti-diabetic effects of MC on renal functional and histological changes in rats. 1.1. Aim\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Momordica charantia leaf fractions on some serum electrolytes and renal biomarkers in alloxan-induced diabetic rats.\n\n1.1.0 Specific objectives\n\ni.

        "content": "THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE FROM FISH\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nINTRODUCTION\n1.1.1          FISH: SOURCE OF FOOD FOR MAN.\n\nFood is one of the basic needs of man (Morey, 1940; Pierce, 2010). Since agriculture produces the food that provides the calories and micronutrients essential for a healthy and productive life, it is interlinked in many important ways to human nutrition and health (Michael, 2011). These nutrients include carbohydrates, proteins, fats and oil, minerals, vitamins and water. Of these nutrients, it is the proteins that supply the body with amino acids necessary for growth and repair of damaged tissues. The sources of protein include plants and animals. Animal sources are preferred because of the presence of essential amino acids and higher digestibility. However, the major disadvantage is higher cost. The animal sources include fish, poultry, dairy, pork, snail, and rabbit.\n\n Fish accounts for one fifth of world total supply of animal protein (FAO, 1991; Olagunjuet al., 2007).  It is an important source of protein to a large number of Nigerians. It provides 40% of the dietary intake of animal protein of the average Nigerian (FDF, 1997; Sogbesanet al., 2006). According to Adekoya and Miller (2004), fish and fish products constitute more than 60% of the total protein intake in adults especially in rural areas. \n\n Amiengheme (2005) enumerated the importance of fish in Human Nutrition as follows:\n\nFish food has a nutrient profile superior to all terrestrial meats (beef, pork and chicken) being an excellent source of high quality animal protein and highly digestible energy;\nFish is a good source of sulphur and essential amino acids such as lysine, leucine, valine and arginine. It is therefore suitable for supplementing diets of high carbohydrate contents;\nIt is an extremely rich source of polysaturated (Omega III) fatty acids, which are important in lowering blood cholesterol level and high blood pressure, reducing the risk of sudden death from heart attacks and reduces rheumatoid arthritis, lowering the risk of age- related muscular degeneration and vision impairment; decreasing the risk of bowel cancer and reducing insulin resistance in skeletal muscles.\nFish is also a good source of thiamine fat soluble vitamins (A, D and E), water soluble vitamins (B complex) and minerals (calcium, phosphorus, iron, iodine and selenium);\n In Nigeria, fisheries occupy a unique position in the agricultural sector of the economy (Kudi et al., 2008). Its contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rose from 76.76 billion in 2001 to N162.61 billion in 2005 (CBN Report, 2005). Nigerians are large consumers of fish, with an annual average demand estimate at 1.4 million metric tonnes, (Kudiet al., 2008). Domestic fish production of about 0.5 million metric tonnes is supplied by artisan fishermen (85%), and fish farmers (15%) (Adekoya and Miller, 2004; Emokaro, 2010; BusinessDay, 2011). However a demand and supply gap of at least 0.7 million metric tonnes exists nationally with import making up the short fall at a cost of 400 billion United States dollars per year. According to FAO (2007), this figure (0.7 million metric tonnes) makes Nigeria the largest importer of fish in the developing world.\n\n To take advantage of the large market created by this deficit, the immediate past and current Governments has promoted a backward integration plan for increased fish farming and production in Nigeria,  Nigerians are also complementing Government efforts by increasing their participation in aquaculture, with many fish farmers focusing on African flathead catfish, Clariasgariepinus as they have been shown to have a potential market value of two to three times that of other cultivable species like Tilapia and Heterobranchus (FAO, 2000; Fafioye and Oluajo, 2005; Emokaroet al., 2010; Businessday, 2011).\n\n A survey by Addo (2005) revealed that Nigerian children below the age of 18 years, who make up about 47% of our total population are still victims of stunting, wasting and under-weight, so with the increased establishment of more aquaculture in Nigeria, it is possible to reverse this trend of malnourishment among Nigerians in this age bracket.\n\nTHE AFRICAN CATFISH\nThe African catfish – Clariasgariepinus, an omnivorous freshwater fish, is a popular delicacy in Nigeria. It is a prominent culture species because of its fast growth rate and resistance to diseases and stress factors like over-stocking and poor water quality (Olojoet al., 2005). It is distributed mainly in fresh waters of Africa hence the name African catfish, although it is also seen in Asia. It is named ‘catfish’ because they possess prominent barbels which resemble cat’s whiskers. It has a slender body, flat bony head and broad terminal mouth with four barbels. The pectoral fins have spines. Its dendritic organ is an accessory breathing organ and it is a modification of the gill arches (Ahmed et al., 2008). The adult of about 1.5m weighs up to 29kg (Teugel, 1986).\n\n Habits: They are nocturnal omnivorous animals feeding on living as well as dead organic matter. They are capable of swallowing large prey because of large mouth (Teugel, 1986).They can crawl on the ground to escape drying pools but can also survive in shallow mud for long periods of time between rainy and dry seasons. They can produce croaking sound. They spawn mostly at night in the shallow areas of rivers, lakes and streams. Development of the larva is rapid as they are able to hatch 24 hours and swim within 48 – 72 hours after fertilization.\n\n1.3    ENZYMES AND THE GENERAL EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE\n\nThe living cell is the site of tremendous biochemical activity. Catalysis, through enzymes, makes possible biochemical reactions, which are necessary for all life processes.  Enzymes are responsible for bringing about almost all of the chemical reactions in living organisms. Without enzymes, these reactions take place at a rate far too slow for the pace of metabolism.\n\nLike most chemical reactions, the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is affected by temperature. Variations in reaction temperature as small as 1 or 2 degrees may introduce changes of 10 to 20% in the results. In the case of enzymatic reactions, this is complicated by the fact that many enzymes are adversely affected by high temperatures.\n\nThe enzyme Glutathione Peroxidase which catalyses the reduction of hydrogen peroxides is the main focus of this study. Understanding the effects of temperature on the activity of this enzyme in the catfish, could help in determining the best storage temperature for this fish such that harvested catfish can be kept fresh for a longwhile for consumption after\n\n 1.4. STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n\nDespite the clear increase in interest for aquaculture and fish consumption in Nigeria, a major problem of storage exists. This is clearly observed in the lack of fresh iced or well dried catfish options in the market. It is also manifest in the ‘point and kill’ marketing phenomenon, which has invariably restricted catfish farming to retail/subsistence levels intended for consumption by members of the immediate locale were the farm is sited, and discourages large scale catfish farming intended for consumers across state and even national borders.\n\n1.5. RESARCH OBJECTIVES \n\nThe aim of this study is to isolate the enzyme Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) from the liver of the African catfish (Clariasgariepinus) and carryout investigations in vitro to determine\n\nThe optimum temperature range wherein the enzyme Glutathione peroxidase best catalyses the reduction of hydroperoxides and other free radicals, thereby protecting the tissues of the Flat Head Catfish from oxidative stress and damage.\nThe temperature range wherein rate of the catalytic reduction activity of the enzyme Glutathione peroxidase is lowest.\n1.6. SCOPE OF STUDY \n\nThis study will be carried on only the African Catfish (Clariasgariepinus), as survey has shown that it is the by far the catfish variety most consumed by inahbitants of Eastern Nigeria.\n\n1.7. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY \n\nThe importances of this study are as follows:\n\nResults obtained at the end will accurately advise the best storage temperature for the Flat Head Catfish that will ensure optimum protection of its muscles and other edible tissues from oxidative stress and damage,\nThereby increasing its shelf life,\nEncourage farmers to engage in larger cultivation of this popular species of fish for wider consumption,\nThis in turn reduces production and processing costs; and wastage and loss due to deterioration and decay,\nEnsure that fish which is an important but currently expensive source of protein is made cheaper and consumed more frequently by citizens of all income and age brackets;\nAnd finally help reduce the malnutrition problem earlier mentioned in the last.\n\n",

        "content": "RODUCTION OF YOGURT FROM SOYMILK AND COW MILK USING PINEAPPLE (ANANASCOMOSUS) AS SWEETENERS\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\nInterest in functional foods has recently increased among consumers due to a greater consciousness of health and nutrition; as well as the need to cure diseases and also the increasing scientific evidence of their effectiveness. Fermented products are a significant part of many indigenous diets.\n\nYoghurt is a Turkish name for a fermented milk product. It is originated by early normadic herdsman, especially in Asia, Southern and Eastern Europe. Yoghurt is made by adding a culture of acid forming bacteria to milk that is usually homogenized, pasteurized and fermented. Yoghurt is defined as a fermented milk product that evolved empirically some centuries ago by allowing naturally contaminated milk to sour at a warm temperature, in the range of 40-50 °C (Kwon et al., 2011). The micro-organisms which are used conventionally in this process are referred to as “Starter Culture”. They include Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. The average size of Lactobacillus bulgaricus ranges from 0.8 to 1.0μm in diameter (Rakis .,1978 , Sanfu. , 2009).\n\nDuring the fermentation, hydrolysis of the milk proteins occurs, the pH drops, the viscosity increases and bacterial metabolites are produced that contribute to the taste and possibly to the health promoting properties of yoghurt. The sugars are fermented by the bacteria into lactic acid, which causes the formation of the characteristic curd. The acid lowers the pH of the yoghurt and restricts the growth of food poisoning bacteria (putrefactive or pathogenic).\n\nNot only is yoghurt a wonderful quick, easy and nutritious snack, but also research evidence point to the fact that milk and yoghurt may actually add years to life as found in some countries where fermented dairy products are a dietary (Wolf.,1978) Several health benefits have been reported for traditional yoghurt and this healthy image is enhanced by supplementation with probiotic bacteria ( ; Magenis, et al 2006).\n\nSoymilk is an aqueous extract of soya beans (Glycine max) and is quiet similar in appearance to cow milk (Agure-Dam, 1997). It is commonly characterized as having a beany, grassy or soy flavor, which reportedly can be improved by lactic acid fermentation, as in yoghurt-like products Microorganisms possess endogenous β-glucosidases which can be utilized to hydrolyze predominant isoflavone glucosides in soymilk to improve biological activity.\n\n It has been reported that probiotic organisms including Bifidobacteria and some other lactic acid　bacteria hydrolyze isoflavone glycosides into corresponding aglycones (Cheng., 1998).\n\nRecent reports indicate that some probiotic bacteria could better compete with yoghurt cultures in a soy-based substrate. Soy has been examined as a substrate for the Lactobacillus species such as L. Casei, L. helveticus, L. fermenti, L. fermentum and L. reuteri (Garro et al., 1999; Murti et al., 1993b;( Chumchuere and Robinson, 1999; Garro et al., 2004; Tzortzis et al., 2004).\n\nThe problems of which is beany flavor can be improved by lactic fermentation, so production of fermented soymilks such as soy yoghurt is important (Nsofor et al., 1992; AbdEl Khair, , 2009).\n\nDue to continuous increase in the population and inadequate supply of animal milk protein leading to malnutrition in Nigeria many research works have been geared finding alternative protein source from legume.\n\nSoymilk can serve as a very good alternative to the expensive cow milk as it contains all the essential amino acid even though some are in a low concentration\n\nIt is well known from experiment that diets containing containing casein or other animal protein could induce elevation of plasma total LDL cholesterol concentration but this can be prevented by vegetable protein such as soy protein (caroll and kurowska 1998)\n\n1.2 HISTORY OF THE YOGURT MAKING\n\nMilk fermentation is one of the oldest methods practiced by the human beings to preserve milk with an extended shelf life. The exact origination of milk fermentation is not clear; however, it seems that it is dated back to the dawn of the civilization.\n\nIt has been reported that the early civilizations such as the Samarians, Babylonians, Pharoes and Indians were well advanced in agricultural and animal husbandry practice. This can be supported by the findings of Copley et al., 2003 in which the dairy fat residues were found in pottery fragments from Neolithic Bronze-age and Iron-age settlements, which suggests that the practice of dairying had existed in Britain approximately 6500 years ago.\n\nHowever, it is questionable that the milk fermentation was practiced during this period. Therefore, the origin of the fermented milk products including yogurt remains unsolved. It has been reported that the Anatolian goatherds conserve their milk by thickening as they used to dry it in the sun and transport in animal stomachs. It is generally accepted among the historians that the fermentation of milk is discovered accidentally by the Neolithic people of Central Asia when they stored milk in primitive methods such as in sheep-skin bags in warm climates.\n\n With reference to yogurt, it can be suggested that it has been evolved in Turkey as the term “yoghurt” has been derived from a Turkish verb, “jugurt” that means “to be curdled or coagulated”.(Belleville, 2002)\n\nThe earliest writings about yogurt can be found from those of Pliny who lived in the first century A. D. and wrote about ancient barbarous nations that knew how to thicken the milk into a substance with an agreeable acidity. According to the literature,(Douglass et al.,2006) the founder of the Mongol empire, Genghis Khan and his armies lived on yogurt and spreading of this news among the people had made the yogurt consumption to spread throughout the East.\n\n Moreover, according to the Persian tradition, Abraham owed his fecundity and longevity to the regular ingestion of yogurt, and the emperor Francis I of France was said to be cured of severe diarrhea by consuming yogurt made of goat milk leading to introduce the health benefits of yogurt into the western world in 1542(Howell and Caldwell, 1978)\n\nThe first industrialized production of yogurt took place in 1919, in Barcelona, Spain at a company named Danone. Yogurt was firstly introduced to the USA in the early 20th century in the form of tablets especially designed for those with digestive intolerance. However, it became popular in the North America when Danone, a small-scale yogurt factory started manufacture of yogurt in New York in 1940(Fennel, 1966)\n\nEven though, yogurt has been evolved for centuries, it was subjected to a significant and dynamic evolution process in the 20th Century to originate a vast array of products. For instance, fruit yogurts, yogurts with fruit on bottom and blended yogurts were introduced in 1937, 1947 and 1963 respectively. It seems that the evolution process of yogurt has taken place in different regions of the world once it had been originated in the Central Asia. This might be the reason of having different types of yogurts and yogurt-like products in different names.\n\n1.3 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\n  Animal protein (milk) are more expensive in Nigeria  and not easily affordable by all for yogurt production necessitates the need to seek for ways of producing yogurts from plant protein (soy beans).Combination animal protein provides more complete amino acid , hence better nutrition .\n\nImproving product nutrient value by fruit addition and increased new product variety. Reduce postharvest losses of soybean due to underutilization in Nigeria.\n\nTherefore , many researches have been carried out on yogurt but none have being established on using pineapple as sweetener, aimed at achieving the aforementioned solution.  \n\n1.4 AIM/OBJECTIVES\n\nTo produce yogurt from plant protein (soymilk)\n\nTo evaluate the sensory attributes of yogurt made from soymilk and cow milk using pineapple as sweetener.\n\nTo determine the proximate composition attributes of the yogurt made from soymilk and cow milk using pineapple as sweetener.\n\nTo check if there is a significant difference in the texture, appearance, colour, taste and general acceptability of the yogurt produce using ANOVA\n\nTo check the proximate c",

        "content": "DETERMINATION OF PRION PROTEIN (PrP) AND CHANGES IN FERTILITY HORMONES WITH SLEEP DEPRIVATION IN ALBINO RATS\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWistar albino rats, numbering thirty five (35), were nurtured in the animal house of University of Nigeria Enugu Campus and used for this work. This work is designed to determine the presence of prion (PrP) in Wistar albino rats and the possible changes that sleep deprivation can cause in PrP and fertility hormones. Twenty four (24) of the animals (15 females 9 males) were successfully sleep-deprived for 14 days while 11 were not deprived of sleep. The non-sleep deprived rats were used as a control group in addition to PrPc commercial control, for the prion protein determination. The body weights of the rats were obtained before and after sleep deprivation. Serum samples were collected before and after sleep deprivation for the fertility hormone assay while brain tissues were extracted from each sleep deprived and non-sleep deprived rat after 14 days for prion protein determination and histological studies. Single platform sleep deprivation technique was used for sleep deprivation, ocular venipuncture for blood collection, euthanization for sacrificing the rats and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay method for both hormone assay and prion protein determination respectively. Part of the brain tissues were prepared histologically (sectioning and staining) using congo-red staining technique for possible sleep deprivation induced morphological changes. The presence of PrP as determined, was confirmed by comparison of the values of the two control groups and test samples while a significant increase (p < 0.05) in PrP concentration after sleep deprivation was observed when compared with non sleep deprived group of albino rats. Sex hormones such as testosterone and oestradiol, decreased significantly (p < 0.05). The concentrations of prolactin and thyroid stimulating hormone and the body weight of the rats also showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) after sleep deprivation compared with the normal control rats. The concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone had no significant (p > 0.05) changes after sleep deprivation when compared with control group of albino rats. There was decrease in oestradiol, testosterone, prolactin, thyroid stimulating hormones and body weight of rats while FSH, LH and brain tissues showed no significant changes. There were also no observable changes in the brain tissue morphology after sleep deprivation. In conclusion, there was PrPCinduction following sleep deprivation in albino rats. It is therefore recommended that sleep deprivation should be put into consideration in infertility cases and more work should be done on Prion proteins for neuropathological cases.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSleep is the natural state of bodily rest observed in mammals, birds, many reptiles, amphibians and fishes. It is equally a state of unconsciousness from which a person or animals can be aroused. In this state the brain is relatively more responsive to internal than external stimuli. In contrast, coma is also a state of unconsciousness from which a person or animals cannot be aroused (Max, 2006). Sleep is homeostatic; therefore it is controlled by the body’s internal balance (Max 2006). It is considered critical for maintenance of health, support of life, restoration of body and brain functions and promotion of neural-immune interaction (Aurell and Elqvist, 1985; Everson et al., 1989). These are reflected in the roles of sleep in the brain for memory co-ordination and teaching (Turner et al., 2007). Through its role in hormone activities such as in growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone and prolactin to mention a few, metabolic processes are properly co-coordinated and carbohydrate storages are carried out (Bonnet and Arand, 2003; Everson and Read, 1995).\n\nSleep deprivation, a general lack of necessary amount of sleep, which may occur as a result of sleep disorder or deliberate inducement or torture, is deleterious to health when it is prolonged. It has been scientifically observed that prolonged sleep deprivation may result in aching muscles, blurred vision, and clinical depression, and constipation, dark circles under the eyes, daytime drowsiness, and decrease mental activity and concentration, delirium, dizziness, fainting, hallucination, hand tremor, headache, hypertension, irritability, loss of appetite, memory lapses or loss, nausea, nystagmus, pallor, psychosis-like symptoms, severely yawning, sleep paralysis while awake, slowed reaction time, slowed wound healing, synaesthesia, temper tantrum in children, weakened immune system, weight loss, diabetes mellitus type II, obesity without weight gain and death (Gotlieb et al., 2005).",

        "content": "RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANAEMIA, GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY AND OXIDATIVE STRESS AMONG MALARIA PATIENTS VISITING ESUT TEACHING HOSPTIAL\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 Background of study\n\nMalaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease affecting humans and other animals caused by parasitic protozoans (a group of single-celled microorganisms) belonging to the Plasmodium type (WHO, 2014). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), malaria is a significant public health problem in more than 100 countries and causes an estimated 200 million infections each year, with more than 500 thousand deaths annually. Over 90% of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where the disease is estimated to kill one child every 30 seconds (WHO, 2011). In other areas of the world, malaria causes substantial morbidity, especially in the rural areas of some countries in Asia and South America.  Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death (Caraballo, 2014). Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten, If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later. The disease is most commonly transmitted by an infected female Anopheles mosquito. The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito's saliva into a person's blood (WHO, 2014). The parasites travel to the liver where they mature and reproduce. Five species of Plasmodium can infect and be spread by humans. (Caraballo, 2014). Most deaths are caused by Plasmodium falciparum.\n\n The role of oxidative stress during malaria infection is still unclear. Some authors suggest a protective role, whereas others claim a relation to the physiopathology of the disease (Sohail et al., 2007). However, recent studies suggest that the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) associated with oxidative stress, plays a crucial role in the development of systemic complications caused by malaria. Malaria infection induces the generation of hydroxyl radicals (OH•) in the liver, which most probably is the main reason for the induction of oxidative stress and apoptosis (Guha et al., 2006). Additionally, Atamna et al. (1993) observed that erythrocytes infected with P. falciparum produced OH• radicals and H2O2 about twice as much compared to normal erythrocytes. Higher level of this free radicals can lead to oxidative stress.\n\nOxidative stress, termed as an imbalance between production and elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to plural oxidative modifications of basic and regulatory processes, can be caused in different ways. Increased steady-state ROS levels can be promoted by drug metabolism, over-expression of ROS-producing enzymes, or ionizing radiation, as well as due to deficiency of antioxidant enzymes. The consequence of oxidative stress once it is high, it can cause damage to the brain, metabolic disorders affecting electron transport chain. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated by endogenous and exogenous sources, cause significant damage to macromolecules, including DNA (Salmon et al., 2004).\n\nFurthermore, Spermatozoa are highly vulnerable to oxidative attack because they lack significant antioxidant protection due to the limited volume and restricted distribution of cytoplasmic space in which to house an appropriate armoury of defensive enzymes. In particular, sperm membrane lipids are susceptible to oxidative stress because they abound in significant amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Susceptibility to oxidative attack is further exacerbated by the fact that these cells actively generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in order to drive the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation associated with sperm capacitation. However, this positive role for ROS is reversed when spermatozoa are stressed. Under these conditions, they default to an intrinsic apoptotic pathway characterised by mitochondrial ROS generation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase activation, phosphatidylserine exposure and oxidative DNA damage. In responding to oxidative stress, spermatozoa only possess the first enzyme in the base excision repair pathway, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase. This enzyme catalyses the formation of abasic sites, thereby destabilising the DNA backbone and generating strand breaks. Because oxidative damage to sperm DNA is associated with both miscarriage and developmental abnormalities in the offspring, strategies for the amelioration of such stress, including the development of effective antioxidant formulations, are becoming increasingly urgent (Aitken et at., 2016).\n\nThe process of lipid peroxidation involves a complex chain reaction utilizing the interaction of oxygen-derived species with polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g. docosahexaenoic acid, linoleic acid and arachidonic acid), resulting in highly reactive electrophilic aldehydes and free radicals (Esterbauer et al., 1991). This process is extremely detrimental to cellular functions as it disrupts membrane integrity, fluidity and function (Esterbauer et al., 1991). Lipid peroxidation is a self-propagating process involving initiation and propagation steps which continue through an ongoing free radical chain reaction until termination occurs. The retina is particularly prone to lipid peroxidation since it is highly enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (Catalase). The predominant PUFA in photoreceptor outer segments is docosahexanoic acid which is the most unsaturated fatty acid in the body.  Lifelong accumulation of chronic oxidative damage will lead to dysfunction in retinal cells and increase their susceptibility to exogenous and endogenous insults eventually culminating in loss of visual function and cell death (Esterbauer et al.,1991). Malaria infection has been found to be associated with lipid peroxidation accompanying reduction in antioxidant capacity of the infected patients especially Plasmodium falciparum infection. Instantaneous reduction in antioxidant potency in tandem with increased lipid peroxidation is also observed to be equally accountable for development of oxidative stress in malaria patients (\nDas and Nanda, 1999\n; \nUpadhyay et al., 2011\n; \nEgwunyenga et al., 2004\n). Any infection, including malaria, activates the immune system of body thereby causing release of \nreactive oxygen species\n as an antimicrobial action (\nKulkarni et al., 2003\n). In addition to host’s immune system, malaria parasite also stimulates certain cells in production of \nreactive oxygen species\n thereby resulting in hemoglobin degradation (\nLoria et al., 1999\n; \nPradines et al., 2005\n). One of the major reasons for development of malarial anemia seems to be oxidative stress (\nDas and Nanda, 1999\n; \nKremsner et al., 2000\n) while changes in micronutrient metabolism alter disease progression and severity (\nSingotamu et al., 2006\n).\n\nProteins are the largest constituent of the cellular milieu and are frequent targets of oxidative damage (Stadtman, 2004). Protein oxidation can involve direct reaction with amino acids, cleavage of the polypeptide chain, and conversion of the protein to derivatives that are highly sensitive to proteolytic degradation. It has also been established that all of these protein modifications can be mediated by metal-catalyzed oxidation systems. All amino acid residues of proteins are potential targets for oxidation by HO· or by H2O2 in the presence of metal ions. For example, oxidation of tyrosine residues is damaging to the red blood cells, as this amino acid is converted to a 3,4-dihydroxyphenylanine derivative, which itself can undergo redox cycling to generate further ROS (Sugiura and Ichinose, 2011).\n\nAntioxidants are molecules that inhibit or quench free radical reactions and delay or inhibit cellular damage (Young et al., 2001). Though the antioxidant defenses are different from species to species, the presence of the antioxidant defense is universal. Antioxidants exists both in enzymatic and non-enzymatic forms in the intracellular and extracellular environment. . Enzymatic antioxidants work by breaking down and removing free radicals. The antioxidant enzymes convert dangerous oxidative products to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and then to water, in a multi-step process in presence of cofactors such as copper, zinc, manganese, and iron. Non-enzymatic antioxidants work by interrupting free radical chain reactions (Young et al.,2001). \n\nThe antioxidants can also be categorized according to their size, the small-molecule antioxidants and large-molecule antioxidants. The small-molecule antioxidants neutralize the ROS in a process called radical scavenging and carry them away.\n\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common enzymopathological disease in humans. This disease is described as a widespread, heritable, X-chromosome linked abnormality (Reclose et al., 2000). It is estimated that it affects approximately 400 million people worldwide (Daloii et al., 2004). This disease is seen most frequently in approximately all of Africa, Asia, and the countries near the mediterranean Sea (Frank, 2005). G6PD enzyme was demonstrated to play an active role in survival of erythrocytes. It is known that in the pentose phosphate pathway of erythrocytes, glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme provides the production of NADPH and Glutathione (GSH). GSH, produced by pentose phosphate pathway can react with H2O2 and reduce it to H2O.  This prevents the generation of oxidative stress within red blood cells; oxidative stress can be induced in erythrocytes whose G6PD enzymes are deficient. In this situation, GSH is not produced and H2O2 is not reduced to H2O, leading to oxidative stress and hemolysis.\n\n1.2 Justification / Need for study\n\nThe need for this study is to carefully ascertain whether G6pD deficiency has an impact on oxidative stress and malaria infection. To known if G6pD can promote malaria infection in patient. This study is equally designed to give information about the prevalence of G6PD and malaria infection among malaria patient in Enugu metropolis.\n\n1.3 Statement of the problem\n\nSo many reasons have been attributed to susceptibility of G-6-PD deficient patients to malaria infection. Recall that the pentose phosphate pathway is essential in producing enough NADPH capable of reducing oxidized glutathione but when there is a default in the production of enough NADPH from PPP as the case may be in G-6-PD deficient patients, leading to a decrease in the level of reduced glutathione which leads to an increased in oxidative stress – a possible risk factor in the development of malaria infection will be complicated.\n\n1.4 Aim of the study\n\nThis study was undertaken to evaluate the relationship between oxidative stress among malaria patients visiting Enugu State University Teaching Hospital, Parklane, Enugu Nigeria.\n\n1.5   Objective of the study\n\n1. To screen patients for malaria infection.\n\n2. To assess anaemia in malaria patients.\n\n3. To assess G6PD deficiency in malaria patients.\n\n4. To assess oxidative stress indices (lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation) in malaria patients. \n\n\n",

Not eating enough or eating too much can create health risks, for both the pregnant woman and her developing fetus over nutrition during pregnancy is common in developed countries.\n\nMany woman experience increased appetite during pregnancy. This occurs partly because their hormonal balance is altered, but also because the growing fetus removes food by products from their blood. It is also possible for woman to consume too much during pregnancy and gain excessive weight.\n\nWoman who over consume during pregnancy increase their risk of obesity i.e. woman who gain excessive weight during pregnancy often fail to lose weight after childbirth and risk becoming overweight or obese, pre-exclaims psiai.e a condition which occurs in late pregnancy and s characterized by high levels of protein in the urine, hypertension and excessive fluid in tissues, gestational diabetes. Macros Omnia (fetus over- growth) can occur because a pregnant woman over consumers for example, excessive transfer of glucose and other nutrients can occur in pregnant woman with diabetes. As the nutrition a fetus receives in the womb pregnancies the metabolic system to function later in life over nourished fetuses have an increased risk of obesity and associated metabolic condition 5 such as type 2 diabetes later in life.\n\nThere is also evidence of an increased risk of the infant experiencing polycythemias the abnormally high red blood cell concentration seizures.\n\nEating too much sugar during pregnancy could affect your child’s intelligence and memory (American Journal of preventative medicine) consuming too much sugar acids gain weight. This added to me naturally increasing pregnancy weight, can lead to obesity, which can complicate the delivery. It also leads to containing sugars can lead to the fatty liver syndrome. It can also affect the fetal metabolism in life ( B.Sc Pharm MD and Erick Yoshida, MD MHSc FRCPC). It increases the risk of preeclampsia, high sugar, high sugar intake influences the risk of preeclampsia in pregnant women (EUR JCLIN NUTR. 2012) Aug. 66(8) 920-5 doi:10.103/ESCN 2012.61.

It’s look stands out from the normal kola as it look like a root and not a fruit like the others.\n\nThis plant grows in different states including Congo, Nigeria, and others. This plant is known as evergreen, and its seeds are widely used in medicine. However, more frequently it is used in herbal medicine rather than traditional.\n\n1.2     Statement of the problem\n\nThe consumption of added sugars (sucrose) over the last 200 years has increased exponentially and parallels the creased prevalence of chronic kidney disease. Data for animals and humans suggest that the consumption of added sugars leads to kidney damage and related metabolic derangements that increase cardiovascular risk. Importantly, the consumption of added sugars has been sound to induce insulin resistance and increase uric acid in humans, both of which increase the conversion of glucose and fructose via the payola pathway. The payola pathway has recently been implicated in the contrition and progression of kidney damage.\n\nTo mitigate this serious complications and a negative outcome of kidney disease, the plant Buccholzia coriacea can be used as therapeutic option readily available to cure the damage caused by high sucrose.\n\n1.3     Objective of the Study\n\nThe general of the, this study was to evaluate the biochemical/metabolic effect of sucrose on a sucrose fed pregnant rat and their offspring’s.

They also consume a lot of vegetable in their native diet and some of these plants are believed to cure some aliments. Ocimum gratissimum is one of the many found to lower glycaemia in Type-1 diabetes.\n\n            Many components of food such as secondary plants metabolites have been seen to alter biological processes which may reduce the risk of some chronic diseases in human such as diabetes.\n\n            Diabetes mellitus has its complications especially diabetes conditions among infected people, Ocimum gratissimum uses against various aliments has gained widespread acceptance in developing as well as developed nations (kolewale et al,. 2011). Diabetes mellitus is an important chronic metabolic disorder of public health concern, it occurs either as a result of pancreatic defects in insulin secretion or the failure of the effectively utilize secreted insulin or both. Hyperglycemia is a common consequence of uncontrolled diabetes, which may over time lead to serious damage to vascular tissue, heart, eye nerve and kidney.\n\n            Plants with known and suspected therapeutic potencies have been longed used in the alternative and complementary medicine. Numerous scientific reports exist, describing the relatively low toxicity and effectiveness in selected plants in management of diabetes.\n\n            Numerous scientific report exists, descending the relatively low toxicity and effectiveness of selected plants in the management of diabetes.

The use of medicinal plant in the treatment of diseases has been in practice since ancient time in different parts of the world especially in Africa. Plants have always been the most vital source of drugs mainly because most plants are autotrophs, and are able to synthesize a large variety of basic biochemical and organic substances such as carbohydrates, protein, terpenes, steroids, alkaloid and glycosides (N’guessanetal.,2009)\n\nThe plant kingdom provides a tremendous reservoir of various chemical substances with potential therapeutic properties. Generally, plants which produce constituents having medical values are designated as medicinal plants (Lawrence et al., 2008). In addition, all plants that taste bitter are used as medicine (Barrett, 2009).\n\nDiabetes mellitus is characterize by insufficient blood levels of the hormone insulin. If the blood concentration of insulin is too low, muscle and liver cells do not absorb glucose from the blood which in turn leads to increase levels of blood glucose (hyperglycemia), impaired metabolism of fats and proteins, ketosis and possible diabetic coma. (willam, et.al  2009)During the past 12 years, the world health organization has been collecting information on the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in adult communities worldwide. Within the age range of 30-64 years, diabetes was found to be absent or rare in some traditional communities in Melanesia, East Africa and South America. In communities of Europeanorigin, the prevalence of diabetes were in the range of 3-10% but migrant indian, Chinese and Hispanic American groups were at higher risk (15-20%). (Adetokunbo, et.al.,2003)\n\nA 2008 study completed in U.S. found the number of America women entering pregnancy with pre-exisiting diabetes is increasing. In fact, the rate of diabetes in expectant mothers has more than doubled in the past six years. (Lawrence, et.al.,2008). This is particularly problematic as diabetes raises the risk of complications during pregnancy, as well as increasing the potential for the children of diabetic mothers to become diabetic in the future\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\nMalnutrition is define as the lack of sufficient nutrients, which are essential for the body’s normal functioning. Over time it affects the bodily organs and results in mild to severe medical problems. One of the malnutrition facts is that the number of hungry people is more in the developing countries. If a pregnant woman is malnourished, it is understandable that the baby in the mother’s womb is not receiving enough nutrient.\n\nPregnant women who have been through malnutrition, deliver babies with low birth weight. Such children are prone to retarded growth, less coordination, poor vision, learning difficulty, and many other diseases. Anemia is one of the malnutrition dises that affects several pregnant women worldwide.\n\nAIM OF THE STUDY\nTo investigate the effect of high sucrose fed pregnant rats in their offsprings and know their pancreatic effect.

INTRODUCTION  \n\nPlants are important in our everyday existence. They provide our foods, produce the oxygen we breathe, and serve as raw materials for many industrial products such as clothes, foot wears and so many others (Ajibesin, 2011). The plant kingdom has proven to be the most useful in the treatment of diseases and they provide an important source in all the world pharmaceuticals.  The most important of these bioactive constituents of plants are steroids, terpenoids, carotenoids, flavanoids, alkaloids, tannins and glycosides. Plants in all face of life have served a valuable starting material for drug development (Ajibesin, 2011).\n\n Plants also have ethical values. Ethical values of plants are based on their religious or quasi- religious feelings of people of many cultures that life forms have intrinsic value and some degree of protection from destruction by humans. In every culture, human beings have different ways of using and protecting plant genetic resources. Ethno-botany is the scientific study of the dynamics relationships that exist between people and plants (Alcorn, 1995). Ethno-botany aims to document describe and explain complex relationship between cultures and plants, focusing primarily on how plants are used, perceived and managed by societies (Harazaki et al., 2013). The ethical values and sacredness placed on plants in cultures where they are found is to prevent them from being over exploited. Nirmal-kumar et al,. (2005) reported that in India traditional tales, mythological stories and events in the epics, religious practices of worship in household and in the temples, in festivals, birth and death are all replete with reference to plants.\n\n Medicinal plants are the sources of many important drugs of the modern world. Many of these indigenous medicinal plants are used as spices and food plants; they are also sometimes added to foods meant for pregnant mothers for medicinal purposes (Akinpela and Onakoya, 2006).  Medicinal plants are of great importance to the health of individuals and communities. It was the advent of antibiotics in the 1950s that led to the decline of the use of plant derivatives as antimicrobials (Marjorie, 1999). Medicinal plants contain physiologically active components which over the years have been exploited in the traditional medical practices for the treatment of various ailments (Ajibesin, 2011). The use of one plant or its parts for rituals or religious activities or festivals is not only good for health but also helps in conservation of biodiversity (Lui et al., 2002).\n\nNewbouldia laevis is commonly known as African border tree. In Nigerian major languages it is called ‘Aduruku’ in Hausa, Ogirisi” in Igbo and Akoko in Yoruba (Hutchinson and Dalziel, 1963). Newbouldia laevisis a medium sized, sun loving, fast growing drought tolerant angiosperm which belongs to the Bignoniaceae family (Arbonnier, 2004). It grows up to a height of about7–15 meters but is usually a shrub of 2–3 meters with many stemmed forming clumps of gnarled branches.\n\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, the plant is used in the management of a variety of ailments for example; the bark is chewed and swallowed for stomach pains and diarrhea as well as toothache (Lewis and Manony, 2007).  In Nigeria and Ivory Coast, the stem bark decoctions are used for treatment of epilepsy and convulsions in children (Tor-anyin et al., 2003). Similarly, Senegalese use the stem bark for the treatment of rheumatism especially painful arthritis of the knee. The plant also has medicinal therapy against ear aches, sore feet and chest pain (Burkil, 1985). Currently, leaf and root extracts of Newbouldia laevis have been shown to possess antimalaria and antimicrobial activities (Ogunlana and Ramstad, 1975; Ejele et al., 2012). For centuries rural people in several communities have used traditional medicine to diagnose, prevent or treat diseases worldwide. In Abia State, Nigeria, herbalists use the stem, bark and the pulp juice of Newbouldia laevis (Family Bignoniaceae) as an external antiseptic for wound dressing.  They squeeze out the juice and then apply it to the affected part for several days. Newbouldia laevis is a plant with so many medicinal properties as it is used in the treatment of malaria fever, constipation coughs, tooth ache, sexually transmitted diseases and breast cancer (Iwu, 2000).\n\nPhytochemicals are said to be chemical compounds that occurs in plants naturally are believed to be effective in preventing diseases due to their antioxidant properties (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1992). These chemicals are often referred to as “secondary metabolities” of which there are several classes including alkaloids, flavonoids, coumarins, glycosides, saponins, polysaccharides, phenols, tannins, terpenes and terpenoids (Harborne, 1973; Okwu, 2005). These compounds have been linked to human health by contributing to protection against degenerative diseases (Liu, 2004; Dandjesso et al., 2012).\n\nInvestigations of the plant have produced conflicting reports on the content of phytochemical compounds present in the plant leaf thus provide scarce and inaccurate information.\n\n1.1 Aim  \n\nThe aim of this study is to analyze and determine the qualitative and quantitative phytochemicals present in Newbouldia laevis leaves.",

Traditional medicine refers to health practices,  approaches, knowledge and beliefs incorporating plant, animal and mineral-based medicines, spiritual therapies, manual techniques and exercises, applied singularly or in combination to treat or to diagnose and prevent illnesses  or  maintain well being (World Health Organization, 2003). In developing countries where orthodox medicines are quite expensive, traditional medicine is widely practiced thus, screening for antimicrobial active compounds from ethno medicinal plants is vital so as to ascertain genuine active plants and active compounds. Ultimately, these phytochemicals will find their way into the arsenal of antimicrobial drugs prescribed by physicians (Cowan, 1999). Plants have been one of the main sources of medicaments either in the form of traditional preparations or pure active principles since the dawn of the human civilization. The utilization of plant based drugs in the world is flourishing and ever increasing. India has a wealthy ancestry of science on plant based drugs both for use in remedial and preventive medicine. Charaka S amhita reports the use of nearly 2000 vegetable remedies against various diseases. Nearly 60% of all pharmaceuticals are plant based. 300000 plants have already been explored for their medicinal properties. Every culture, including western culture has evolved indigenous system of traditional healing. Traditional healing in different cultures has a long history of ancestors creating primitive medicine during their struggle against natural calamities and diseases. Equally while searching for food; the ancient humans discovered that some foods have specific properties of relieving or eliminating certain diseases and maintaining good health. In recent years, secondary plant metabolites have been extensively investigated as a source of medicinal agents. It is anticipated that phytochemicals with good antibacterial activity will be used for the treatment of bacterial, fungal and viral infections. During the last two decades, there has been a considerable increase in the study and use of medicinal plants all over the world, especially in advanced countries. There was also a tremendous increase in the international trade and commercial exploitation of herbal medicines over the counter labeled products. In some countries, herbal medicines are still a central part of the medical system e.g. China, Ethiopia, Argentina and Papua New Guine\n\nChloris gayana kunth of the family of Poaceae and is commonly known as Rhode grass and it is mainly use for grazing of animals and most people use it as vegetable when cooking, As literature survey revealed that not much work had been reported on Choris gayana kunth, in the present study, the leaf portion of the plant was investigated for its pharmacognostical properties.  Preliminary photochemical out followed by the isolation and characterization screening has been carried of chemical constituents and the antibacterial and antifungal activity of the various extracts as well as the isolated compounds were examined against microbes. In the present study, an endeavour has been made to find out the antibacterial and antifungal activity of various extracts obtained from the plant.  \n\n1.2   AIMS OF STUDY \n\nü  To extract and characterize compounds responsible for this claim\n\nü  This research is aimed at evaluating the antimicrobial activity of Chloris gayana kunth used for the treatment of some illness caused by microorganism.\n\nü  To analyze whether the plant extract has capability to control the growth of the microorganism.              \n\n  1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe objectives of this study include the following: Antimicrobial investigation of the plant extracts. Collection and precise botanical identification of  the plant Determination of phytochemical ingredient contained in the plant\n\n 1.4 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THIS RESEARCH\n\nThe scope of this research work is aimed at evaluating Chloris gayana kunth found in Agbarho in Ughelli North local government area of Delta State, Nigeria. This will be done by evaluating the 3 systematical screening of Chloris gayana kunth through phytochemical screening, antimicrobial (antibacterial/antifungal screening), so as to better understand their properties, safety and efficiencey\n\n1.4 JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY\n\nThe choice of Chloris gayana kunth for phytochemical and antimicrobial analysis is based on the plant’s specialty and diverse use in the treatment of various illness amongst the Agbarho people of Delta State and its environs. This study will also aid with discovering other possible sources of producing anti- microbial drugs\n\n1.5     LITERATURE REVIEW\n\nPhytochemical are non-nutritive plant chemicals that have protective or disease preventive properties. There is growing interest in correlating the phytochemical constituents of a medicinal plant with its pharmacological activity.  Phytochemicals are primary and secondary compounds. Chlorophyll, proteins and common sugars are included in primary constituents and secondary compounds have terpenoid, alkaloids and phenolic compounds. The secondary metabolites of plants were found to be source of various phytochemicals that could be directly used as intermediates for the production of new drugs.\n\nThe currently available screening methods for the detection of antimicrobial activity of natural products fall into three groups, including bio autographic, diffusion, and dilution methods.\n\n1.6      DESCRIPTION OF THE PLANT \n\nChloris gayana kunth is a species of grass known by the common name Rhodes grass. It is native to Africa but it can be found throughout the tropical and subtropical world as a naturalized species.\n\nIt can grow in many types of habitat. It is also cultivated in some areas as a palatable graze for animals and a groundcover to reduce erosion and quickly     re-vegetate denuded soil. It is tolerant of moderately saline and alkaline soils and irrigation.\n\nThis is a perennial grass which can reach one half to nearly three meters in height and spreads via stolon’s. It forms tufts and can spread into wide monotypic stands. The inflorescence is a single or double whorl of fingerlike racemes up to 15 centimeters long. Each spikelet in the raceme is a few millimeters long and contains one or two fertile florets and up to four sterile florets.",

These plants are considered as rich resources of ingredients which can be used in drug development and synthesis. In many part of the world medicinal plant have been used for  antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities for hundreds of years  (Ali et al., 1998; Barhour et al., 2004; Yasunaka et al., 2005). More than 30% of the pharmaceutical preparations are based on plants (Shinwari and Khan, 1998). An increasing reliance on the use of these medicinal plants in the industrialized societies has been traced to the extraction and development of several drugs and chemotherapeutics from medicinal plants.\n\nRecent research has begun to reveal impressive fact about the scale of the developed world dependence upon medicinal plant and the monetary and social value that these usages represent (Farnsworth et al., 1991). Researchers are increasingly turning attention to medicinal plant and looking for new leads to develop better drugs against diseases (Ibrahim 1997; Tower et al., 2001; Koshy et al., 2009). They have identified number of compounds used in mainstream medicine which were derived from ethnomedical plant source (Fabricant and Farnsworth 2001).\n\nAccording to World Health Organization (WHO), medicinal plants would be the best source to obtain variety of drugs. An estimate of 80% individuals from developed countries uses traditional medicines, which has compounds derived from medicinal plant. Most populations still rely on traditional medicines for their psychological and physical health requirements (Rabe and VanStoden, 2000), since they cannot afford the products of Western pharmaceutical industries (Salie et al., 1996). These medicinal plant possess therapeutically properties which are useful in healing various diseases and the advantage of these medicinal plant are natural (Kalemba et al., 2003). These plants contain chemicals which are classified into primary and secondary metabolites. The primary metabolites are widely distributed in nature and are obtained from higher plants.\n\nPlants generally produce many secondary metabolites which provide definite physiological action on the human body and these bioactive substances include alkaloids, steroids, tannins, glycosides, volatile oils, fixed oils, resins, phenols and flavonoids which are deposited in their specific parts such as leaves, flowers, bark, seeds, fruits, root and are biosynthetically derived from primary metabolite and constitute an important source of microbicide, pesticide and many pharmaceutical drugs. These secondary metabolites have been directly or indirectly playing an important role in the human society to combat disease (Wink et al., 2005). Secondary metabolites are frequently accumulated by plant in small quantities than the primary metabolites (Karuppusamy, 2009). The most important of these bioactive compounds of plants are alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins and phenolic compounds (Edoga et al., 2005). Screening of these medicinal plants for antimicrobial and elementological activities are important for finding potential new compounds for therapeutic use.\n\n1.2            AIM OF STUDY\n\nEstablish the ethno medicinal claims on the aerial parts of ALCHORNEA CORDIFOLIA Characterize some compound(s) that may be responsible for the claimed ethno medicinal values.\n\n1.3            OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe purpose of this study is to\n\n i.  Determine the phytochemical ingredient contained in the plant\n\nii.            Investigate the antimicrobial activity of the plant extracts.\n\n1.4            SCOPE OF STUDY\n\nThis research is designed to screen alchornea cordifolia medicinal plant obtained from Awo-omamma community, Imo state, Nigeria, verifying the extent to which the medicinal plant can contribute to the treatment of various diseases.\n\nIn this study, there will be an investigation on the usage of this medicinal plant, through phytochemical screening, antimicrobial studies . It will also be evaluating the systematical screening of plant species with the purpose of discovering new bioactive compounds which will be of great important to chemistry and to pharmaceutical industry.\n\nJUSTIFICATION OF STUDY  \n\nThis study justifies the fact that medicinal plants have a promising future because there are about half a million plants around the world that are yet to be investigated. The choice of Alchornea cordifolia is based on its vast medicinal importance in Awo-omamma community of Imo State and other parts of the South-East region of Nigeria..\n\nTherefore, we have decided to screen the plant to know its microbial potency, phytochemical and bioactive constituents. This study will further help to clarify their role in the treatment of present diseases and however aid as a light to the synthesis of new drugs.",

The World Health Organization estimates that 4 billion people, 80% of the world population (WHO, 2002), presently use herbal medicine for some aspect of primary health care (Orisataoki and Oguntibeju, 2010). Eighty percent (80%) of African populations use some form of  traditional herbal medicine (WHO, 2002.) and the worldwide annual market for these products approaches US$ 60 billion (Willcox and Bodeker, 2004). Herbal medicine is a major component in all indigenous people’s traditional medicine. Medicinal plants have continued to attract attention in global search for effective methods of using plants parts (e.g. seeds, leaves, stems, roots, barks etc) for the treatment of many diseases affecting humans (Sofowora, 2008). This is as a result of the continuous need for less expensive means of diseasecontrol.\n\nMedicinal plants are plants which can be used for therapeutic purposes or which are precursors for the synthesis of useful drugs (Sofowora, 2008). Many important drugs used in healthcare today are directly derived from plants due to its bioactive constituents such as; alkaloids, tannins, steroids, etc. Examples include L-Dopa derived from Mucuna spp used for anti-parkinsonism, another is Caffeine, a CNS stimulant derived from Camellia sinensis and Quinine from Cinchona ledgeriana and used for Antimalarial, antipyretic.\n\nAs a matter of fact, well into the 20th century, much of the pharmacopoeia of scientific medicine was derived from the herbal lore of native people. Many drugs commonly used today are of herbal origin. Undisputedly, the history of herbology is inextricably intertwined with that of modern medicine. Many drugs listed as conventional drugs were originally derived from plants.\n\nSalicyclic acid, a precursor of aspirin, was originally derived from white willow bark and the meadowsweet plant (Zand, et al., 2003).\n\nPlants are very unique as their existence is very essential for the sustenance of the rest of the food chain. Based on the observations made through successive generations, superstition as well as traditional medicinal folklore, man has found and has been using herbs, barks, fruits, leaves, seeds, roots and stems of different plants of various climatic regions for therapeutic purposes (Sofowora,2008).\n\n1.2               GLOBAL BURDEN OFDIABETES\n\nDiabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease caused by a deficiency in the secretion or action of insulin (Nelson and Cox, 2005). This disorder is characterized by major symptoms as; polyuria (frequent and abundant urine), glycosuria (presence of glucose in urine) and hyperglycemia (glucose rate on an empty stomach higher than 1.2g/l in plasma blood and confirmed in at least two occasion) (N’guessan et al., 2009). Basically, there are two major clinical classes ofdiabetes\n\n.The type 1 diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and type 2 diabetes or non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) also called insulin resistant diabetes. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) 2014 updates, out of the world seven billion population, 387million people, aged 20–79 years worldwide are diabetic, (IDF, 2014) giving a comparative prevalence of 8.3%, while 46.3% cases are undiagnosed. In every 7 seconds, a person dies of diabetes, 4.9 million deaths in 2014. Seventy seven percent (77%) of people with diabetes live in low and middle income countries. Africa has recorded cases of 2,150,274 (5.05%) diabetic patients with over 13million undiagnosed cases. In Nigeria, there are estimated 374,651 diabetic cases, with another 172,339 undiagnosed cases. These figures account forabout\n\n4.64% Nigerian adults between ages 20-79 living with diabetes (IDF, 2014). In 2014, about 105,090 Nigerians died as a result of diabetes (IDF, 2014). An average diabetic Nigerian spent about 43527.16 naira (US $178.39) in 2014 due to diabetes treatment (IDF, 2014). With this alarming prevalence rate, diabetes mellitus poses a major challenge globally and accounts for a number of disabilities and deaths globally.\n\nCurrently, diabetes therapy is based on the use of hypoglycemic drugs (sulfonamides, biguanides, and insulin), on hygieno-diet measures, exercise, and requires a lifelong treatment. With the level of poverty in developing nations like Nigeria, the need for a better and cheaper medication cannot be over emphasized. Traditional medicine has always provided a cheaper and time trusted alternative for the treatment and management of various diseases overtime.\n\n1.3               STATEMENT OFPROBLEM\n\nThere is an urgent need to provide alternative and cheaper means for the management and treatment of diabetes.\n\n1.4               AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THESTUDY\n\nThis study is aimed at the evaluation of the anti-diabetic effects of water and mMETHANOLic extracts of Persea americana(avocado) seed on alloxan induced diabetic rats.\n\nThe specific objectives of the study are:\n\n1. \n\nTo determine nutritional and some anti-nutritional constituents of seed extracts of the plant\n\n2.

Among these are public statements by Church leaders, programs of action at local and international levels, organisations dedicated to bringing about peace, courses of study, commemorative days etc. In recent decades, Church leaders have frequently made statements in support of peace. In some cases these statements have been specific appeals for peace in particular circumstances, however, on other occasions they have also published more comprehensive statements on the need for peace and the means of achieving it. The teachings of Christianity which is guided by the dictates of the bible (word of God) has constantly encourage the members to ensure peace and harmony in the society.\n\nChristian leaders have always publicly stand for societal peace and harmony and against violence. It is now widely accepted that violent conflict is the major hindrance to the development of the African continent and Nigeria in particular. It inflicts human sufferings through death, destruction of livelihoods, constant displacement and insecurity (Barash, 2000). Violent conflict disrupts the process of production, creates conditions for pillage of the country’s resources and diverts their application from development purposes to servicing war. Violent conflict is thus responsible for perpetuating misery and under development in the country-Nigeria and the continent at large (Adetula, 2006).\n\nPeace is a universal phenomenon that everyone desires and wishes to enjoy endlessly. Traditions, cultures, religions and societies do have different prescriptions to attaining and enjoying peace. Whenever and wherever there is peace there tends to be development and longevity is enjoyed (Salawu, 2010). To this end, Christianity which is one of the predominant religions in the world today teaches peace and encourages all adherents to the faiths to pursue peace and live peacefully with one another. The above statement now seems to be questionable with the rise of intra, inter and ethno-religious conflicts in the world. While most Arab and some European countries are faced with intra-religious conflicts, an African country like Nigeria is faced with both intra and inter-religious conflicts. Nigeria, which is popularly known as Africa’s most populous black nation with a population of now about 170 million people, with more than 250 ethnic groups has Christianity and Islam as its predominant religions, though there is still in existence the African Traditional Religion (ATR).\n\nChristianity as a word means followers of Christ or Christ like. Christians therefore are those who follow and act the teaching of Christ in all ways of life. One of the climaxes of Christianity or Christian virtue is peace. Christians are enjoined in the Bible to embrace and live peacefully with their neighbors’. The following scriptures confirm this: Depart from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it (Psalm 34 vs 14). Blessed are the Peace makers for they shall be called the children of God Matthew 5 vs 9). Let him eschew evil and do good; let him seek peace and ensue it (1 Peter 3 vs 11). Follow peace with all men and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord (Hebrews 12 vs 14). If it be possible, as much as it lieth in you, live peaceably with all men (Rom 12 vs 18)\n\nThe word Peace in Christianity is translated from the Hebrew word ‘Shalom’, which is a key word in the Bible and its at the center of how God wants us to live on earth. One of the key things Jesus came to give humanity is Peace and expects us to live in peace as cited in the scriptural verses above. Peace was not only what Jesus taught but He also lived it, this in most cases is what scholars call pacifism, as Jesus never taught violence, even at his arrest by the Pharisees and one of his disciples struck the ears of the priest, Jesus rebuked the disciple and said that “those who live by the sword shall die by the sword” (Mathew 26:52, NKJV). In another place Jesus taught the people not to retaliate any evil done to them as it used to be, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, if one should strike you on the right cheek, turn the left cheek (Mathew 5:38-39, NKJV) but now to always forgive those that offend them and he charged them to forgive their neighbors even seventy times seven (Matthew 18:22, KJV). With all these scriptural teachings of the church, Christians are suppose to live in peace and harmony in the society.\n\n1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM \n\nThe church has always taught the members on the act of non retaliation as taught by Jesus which helps to absorb violence instead of escalating it, hence every cycle of violence provoking revenge, which in turn provokes more violence is broken by the simple act of tolerating the violence and avoiding retaliation. On the contrary, there has been increased cases of disruption to peace and harmony in the world today despite the church teachings of peace as stipulated by Jesus Christ. However, the researcher is examining the role of church in ensuring peace and harmony in the society. \n\n1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY \n\nThe following are the objectives of this study:\n\nTo examine the role of church in ensuring peace and harmony in the society.\n\nTo examine the dictates of the church as regards peace and harmony.\n\nTo identify the factors disrupting peace and harmony of the society.\n\n1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\nWhat is the role of church in ensuring peace and harmony in the society?\n\nWhat are the dictates of the church as regards peace and harmony?\n\nWhat are the factors disrupting peace and harmony of the society?\n\n1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY \n\nThe following are the significance of this study:\n\nThe findings of this study will be useful for the government, church leaders and the general public on the role of the church in ensuring sustainable peace and harmony in the society. This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.\n\n1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY \n\nThis study will cover the position of the church and Christianity in general as regards the issue of societal peace and harmony.\n\nLimitations of study\n\nFinancial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview). \n\nTime constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work. This consequently will cut down on the time devoted for the research work.\n\nREFERENCES \n\nAlbert I.O (2011), An Alternative Explanation of Religious Fundamentalism in Northern Nigeria.

In fact, out of the approximated 6400 plant species used in tropical Africa, more than 4,000 are used as medicinal plants (Stanley, 2009). So many medicinal plants have been used by traditional medicine practitioners in Nigeria for the treatment of different diseases. Traditional medicinal plants have positive role of in the prevention or control of some metabolic disorders like diabetes, heart diseases and certain types of cancers (Zhang, 1996).  One of the great advantages of these medicinal plants is that these are easily available and have no side effects (Mehta, 1982).\n\n       Plants are living organisms belonging to the kingdom plantae. They include familiar organisms such as trees. They are typically characterized by their green colour, which include common groups such as trees, herbs, flowers and fern and algae. Worldwide trend towards the utilization of natural plant remedies has created an enormous need for information about the properties and uses of the medicinal plants. Medicinal plants play a major role in the health care sector of developing nations for the management of diseases. Thus herbal medicines have a prominent role to play in the pharmaceutical markets and health care sector of the 21st century (Annan and Houghton, 2007).\n\n       In recent years, there has been a gradual revival of interest in the use of medicinal plants in developing countries because herbal medicines have been reported safe and without any adverse side effect especially when compared with synthetic drugs. Thus, a search for new drugs with better and cheaper substitutes from plant origin are a natural choice. The medicinal value of these plants lie in some chemical substances that produce a definite physiological action on the human body (Edeoga et al., 2005).\n\n       Phytochemicals are bioactive chemical compounds found naturally in plants that protect against diseases. They are non nutritive compounds (secondary metabolite) that contribute to flavor colour. Many phytochemicals have antioxidant activity and reduce the risk of different diseases known, for example carotenoids (from carrots) and flavonoids (present in fruits and vegetables).\n\n        Minerals are required by living organisms and can help to prevent occurrence of some diseases. Some sources state that sixteen chemical elements are required to support human biochemical processes by serving, structural and functional role as well as electrolyte.\n\n       Trichilia prieureana is a medium-sized tree in the moist forest, more shrubby in gallery forests, drier forests and savanna regions (Lovett et al., 2006). It is a tree up to 20m high, often low-branched and sometimes with low buttresses. It has its bark pale brown and rather flaky. It is called Monkey apple (english) and Mtimaji. Its leaves are impari-pinnate with opposite leaflets with the rachis slighty winged. The fruits are hardly stalked with sub-globose capsule. Its seeds are dark brown, glossy and covered with a red aril.\n\n1.1            Historical features of Trichilia prieureana\n\n       The trichilia genus consist of about 70 species, mainly distributed in tropical America and Africa, of which 43 species occur in Brazil. Chemical studies have revealed the presence of limonoids as the main bioactive agents (champagne et al., 1992).\n\n       Trichilia prieureana is a medium-sized tree in the forest, shrubby in gallery forests and savanna regions (Bolza et al., 1972). It is called monkey apple (english), banyunkikiet (senegal) and Urera (yoruba). T. prieureana belongs to the plantae family, the order ‘sapindales’ and meliaceae family.\n\n       Trichilia prieureana is a medium-sized tree in the moist forest, more shrubby in gallery forests, drier forests and savanna regions; as a tree to 20 m high and 40 cm, often low-branched, sometimes with small buttresses. Its bark is pale brown and rather flaky with slash fibrous, contoured, slightly scented. Its leaves are impari-pinnate with opposite leaflets, the rachis slightly winged.\n\n       The fruits are hardly stalked with a sub-globose capsule, 1.5 - 2.5 cm across, glabrous. Also, seeds are dark brown, glossy, for 1/3 - ¼ covered with a red fleshy aril. It is a shrub or small tree, 3–20 m high with bole buttressed and fluted, often low-branching, to 1–2 m girth carrying a dense spreading crown, or small and spherical, variable, in two subspecies, overlapping in distribution in the region.\n\n       Trichilia prieureana is an evergreen shrub or small to medium-sized tree up to 30m tall. They are usually conspicuously fluted, up to 100cm in diameter. The bark surface is shallowly fissured, grayish brown, peeling off in thin flakes or rectangular strips with its inner bark pale yellow or pink; crown hemispherical, dense with young glabrous branches.\n\n       The leaves alternate, imparipinnately compounds with 4 pairs of leaflets; stipules absent with petiole 10cm long; rachis 15cm long with petioules 2mm long; leaflets opposite, elliptical to ovate or obovate, cuneate at base, acuminate at apex, glabrous, pinnately veined; inflorescence an axillary panicle up to 10cm long, short-hairy; bracts ovate to triangular, up to 2.5mm long.\n\n        The heartwood is pale pinkish brown to reddish brown and distinctly demarcated from the creamy white to pale yellow sapwood. The grain is wavy or straight, texture fine. The wood is moderately heavy, with a density of about 750kg/m3 at 12% moisture content. It air dries moderately well to with difficulty; the rates of shrinkage are moderately high.\n\n       The wood is difficult to saw because of the presence of silica, which causes blunting of saw teeth and cutting edges. It planes satisfactorily, giving nice quarter-sawn surfaces. It polishes well. The nailing properties are good. The wood is moderately durable; it is susceptible to Lyctus attack. The heartwood is resistant to impregnation by preservatives, but the sapwood is moderately permeable. The wood dust may cause irritation to the respiratory tracts in wood workers.\n\n       The flowers of Trichilia prieureana are unisexual, male and female flowers very similar in appearance, regular, greenish white, fragrant; pedicel up to 2 mm long; receptacle cylindrical, up to 1.5 mm long; calyx cup-shaped, lobes 2 mm long; petals free, narrowly obovate to narrowly oblong, stamens 6 mm long, fused completely into a tube, hairy inside; ovary superior, ovoid to globose, glabrous or slightly hairy, glabrous or slightly hairy, stigma head-shaped or distinctly lobed. Its male flowers with rudimentary ovary, female flowers with non-dehiscing anthers.\n\n       Its fruit is an ovoid to globose capsule, often pink when ripe, dehiscent, up to 6-seeded. Seeds 10–17 mm × 7–12 mm, on a long funicle, seed coat partly fleshy and orange-red, remaining part glossy dark brown. Its seedlings undergoepigeal germination; with hypocotyl 4 cm long, epicotyl 3 cm long; cotyledons sessile, thick and fleshy, green.\n\n       In Sierra Leone Trichilia prieureana flowers in January-March, and fruiting is from March onwards. The flowers are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fleshy seed coat has been recorded in Gabon as an important food for monkeys and birds such as hornbills and turacos early in the dry season.\n\n       Trichilia comprises about 90 species, most of them in tropical America. In continental Africa 18 species occur, in Madagascar.Trichilia prieureana has an isolated position within the genus in Africa and has been placed in the section Moschoxylum. It is variable and 3 subspecies have been distinguished:\n\n§  Subsp. prieureana (synonym: Trichilia senegalensis C.DC.) occurring from Senegal to Nigeria, and characterized by usually 3-celled ovary, glabrous style and lobed stigma;\n\n§  subsp. vermoesenii J.J.de Wilde occurring from Côte d’Ivoire to Uganda and Angola, and characterized by usually incompletely 2-celled ovary, slightly hairy style but glabrous ovary, and head-shaped stigma;\n\n§  subsp. orientalis J.J.de Wilde occurring in southern DR Congo, Uganda, western Tanzania and northern Zambia, and characterized by usually incompletely 2-celled ovary, slightly hairy style and ovary, and head-shaped stigma;\n\n      Trichilia prieureana occurs in lowland forest and riverine forest up to 1300 m altitude, up to 1500 m in Zambia, often as an understorey tree. In West Africa it prefers drier forest types, with subsp. prieureana usually found in savanna woodland and forest-savanna mosaic, and subsp. vermoesenii in the rainforest region.\n\nIn Uganda subsp. vermoesenii occurs in rainforest in higher-rainfall areas in the western part of the country, subsp. orientalis in savanna woodland and forest-savanna mosaic in the northern and eastern parts of the country (Keay, 1989).\n\n       Trichilia prieureana does not suffer from genetic erosion because it is widespread and locally common, also in secondary forest. The 1000-seed weight is about 330 g. Seeds germinate 8-15 days after sowing. Logs split easily and therefore some care is needed during felling operations (Hawthorns et al., 2006).\n\n       The often sinuous and fluted boles of Trichilia prieureana hamper its applicability in the peeling industry, and the presence of silica, which makes sawing difficult, and easy splitting of the wood are other drawbacks (White et al., 1997). Therefore, the prospects as a commercial timber tree seem to be poor, and Trichilia prieureana may remain an undesirable tree in exploited forest, as it has often been, like other Trichilia species.\n\n1.2            Uses of Trichilia prieureana\n\n       Trichilia prieureana has a wide range of uses. Its bark have medicinal purpose serving as antidotes for venomous stings and bites; laxatives, vermifuges. Also, the bark and root function as genital stimulants/depressants, help in stomach troubles and veneral diseases. The fruit is taken as food and the seed have naso-pharyngeal effect. The timber is of great importance in building, fuel and lighting (Neuwinger, 2000). Below are some other uses of T. prieureana:\n\n1.            i.            The wood is used in Ethiopia for the construction of houses.\n\n2.         ii.            In Tanzania, it is used for tool handles and spoons.\n\n3.       iii.            The wood is suitable for heavy and light construction, railway sleepers, heavy and light flooring, joinery, interior trim, furniture works, cabinet work, sporting goods, toys, novelties, veneer, plywood, hardboard and particle board.\n\n4.       iv.   It is used for firewood and charcoal production; it is efficient burning slowly and generating great heat.\n\nAlso, T. prieureana has some medical applications and they include:\n\n1.   i.  In West Africa, the bark is used to treat veneral diseases, fever, cough, constipation, poisoning and ascites and it also serves as aphrodisiac.\n\n2.       ii.   In Central African Republic, a bark decoction is applied to scarification wounds and to treat pain caused by rheumatism and lumbago.\n\n3.    iii.   Leaf, bark and roots are applied against anaemia and they are also applied against syphilis.\n\n4.    iv.            Pulverized leaves are taken to treat stomach spasms.\n\n5.       v.            Twigs are used as chew-sticks.\n\n6.    vi. A decoction of leafy twigs is taken to treat bronchitis and oedema.\n\n7.  The leaves and pounded leaves are used to treat gonorrhoea.\n\n8.  Root and bark are administered as enema to treat piles.\n\n9.    ix.            Pulverized leaved are taken against ascariasis.\n\n10.   x.  The seed is one of the ingredients of a preparation to treat goitre.\n\n11.   xi.            It is used as a purgative.\n\n1.3   Analyis of Trichilia prieureana as a medicinal plant\n\n        Medicinal plants have bioactive compounds which are used for curing of various human diseases and also play an important role in healing. Phytochemicals have two categories, i.e, primary and secondary constituents. Primary constituents have chlorophyll, proteins, sugars and amino acids. Secondary constituents contain terpenoids and alkaloids.\n\n        T. prieureana with their phytochemical properties are medicinal plants that have antifungal, antibacterial and anti-inflammation activities. The phytochemical analysis of plants the plant, T. prieureana is very important commercially and has great interest in pharmaceutical companies for the production of new drugs for curing of various diseases.\n\n1.4 Phytochemicals\n\n        Phytochemicals are chemical compounds that occur naturally in plants. Some are responsible for colour and other organoleptic properties such as the deep purple of blueberries and the smell of garlic. The term is generally used to refer to those chemicals that may have biological significance such as flavonoids but are not established as essential nutrients. These phytochemicals are naturally occurring in medicinal plants, leaves, vegetables and roots that have defense mechanism and protect from various diseases.\n\n        Phytochemicals are present in virtually all of the fruits, vegetables, legumes (beans and peas), and grains we eat, so it is quite easy for most people to include them in their diet. For instance, a carrot contains more than a hundred phytochemicals. There are thousands of known phytochemicals, but only a few have been studied in detail.\n\n        Phytochemicals are a plant’s way of protecting itself. They shield tender buds and spouts from predators and pollution. These protective compounds are passed along to us when we eat plant foods. Oxalate, saponin, cyanogenic glycoside, alkaloid, tannin and phytate are secondary metabolites used by some plants for defense and protection. They are beneficial chemicals with predator and parasite repelling effects.\n\n        Phytochemicals, in the amounts consumed in a healthy diet, are likely to be helpful and are unlikely to cause any major problems. Some people assume that because phytochemical supplements come from “natural” sources, they must be safe and free from side effects, but this is not always true. Phytochemicals, in the amounts consumed in a healthy diet, are likely to be helpful and are unlikely to cause any major problems. Some people assume that because phytochemical supplements come from “natural” sources, they must be safe and free from side effects, but this is not always true. Phytochemicals are products of plant metabolism, mainly used by the plants for their defense. Hence attempts have been made to use them for therapeutic purposes. In humans and most animals, alkaloids and flavonoids have been observed to posses antidiuretic, antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.\n\n        However, they inhibit certain mammalian enzymatic activities such as those of phosphodiesterase, prolonging the action of cyclic AMP. These phytochemicals can induce actions of glucagons and thyroid stimulatinghormone even when it is not needed.\n\n        Phytochemicals have a number of functions. Antioxidant properties of plants help prevent damage that is associated with cancer, heart disease and other related human diseases. The presence of these phytochemicals has been attributed to the bioactive principles responsible for ethnopharmalological activities of most medicinal plant. This dictates why efforts have been expanded in studies aimed at elucidating their levels in medicinal plant. The medicinal values of plants and vegetables are dictated by their phytochemicals and other chemical constituents.\n\n        The important bioactive components in plants are usually the secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins and other phenolic compounds. Phytochemicals are products of plant metabolism, mainly used by the plants for their defense. Hence attempts have been made to use them for therapeutic purposes.\n\n        Although phytochemicals are said to be useful to the human body, they may have some toxic effects as well, as seen in the case of alkaloids. Alkaloids are reported to have cytotoxic activity which may be used in treatment of cancer. Hence, it is desirable to know the phytochemical composition of the plant material before testing its efficacy for medicinal purpose.\n\n       Phytochemicals are non-nutritive plant chemicals that have protective or disease preventive properties. They are nonessential nutrients, meaning that they are not required by the human body for sustaining life. It is well-known that plants produce these chemicals to protect themselves but recent research demonstrates that they can also protect humans against diseases. There are more than thousand known phytochemicals. Some of the well-known phytochemicals are lycopene in tomatoes, isoflavones in soy and flavanoids in fruits.\n\n\n",

        "content": "THE INHIBITORY EFFECT OF ETHANOLIC EXTRACT OF MORINGA OLEIFERA LEAF ON THE CORROSION OF MILD STEEL IN 5 M AND 1 M HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl)\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE - INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 Background of study\n\n            Corrosion of materials has continued to receive interest in the technological world as its effects on the structural integrity of materials has been a question for some time. Metallic materials are still the most widely used group of materials particularly in mechanical engineering and the transportation industry. In addition, metals are commonly used in electronics and increasingly also in the construction industry (Buchweishaija, 2009a).\n\n        However, the usefulness of metals and alloys is constrained by one common problem known as corrosion. Hence, it has been studied comprehensively since the industrial revolution in the late eighteenth century (Sato, 2012). Corrosion is a naturally occurring phenomenon defined as deterioration of metal surfaces caused by the reaction with the surrounding environmental conditions (Buchweishaija, 2009a). Corrosion can cause disastrous damage to metal and alloy structures causing economic consequences in terms of repair, replacement, product losses, safety and environmental pollution. Due to these harmful effects, corrosion is an undesirable phenomenon that ought to be prevented.\n\n       Scientists are persistent in seeking better and more efficient ways of combating the corrosion of metals. There are several ways of preventing corrosion and the rates at which it can propagate with a view of improving the lifetime of metallic and alloy materials (Buchweishaija, 2009a). Hunag and Chen (2012) highlighted the measures in preventing and control of corrosion as follows: use of resistant metal alloys, cathodic and anodic protection, use of protective coatings (Stack, 2002) and addition of corrosion inhibitors to the corrosion environment (Papavinasam, 2000).\n\n        Among the methods of corrosion control, the use of inhibitors is very popular. It is one of the acceptable practices used to reduce and/or prevent corrosion due to the ease of application. Mostly heterocyclic compounds containing oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen as heteroatoms serve as good inhibitors for corrosion (Kumar et al, 2009). To be effective, an inhibitor must also transfer water from the metal surface, interact with anodic and cathodic reaction sites to retard the oxidation and reduction corrosion reaction, and prevent transportation of water and corrosion-active species on the metal surface (Maqsood, 2011). Despite these promising findings about possible corrosion inhibitors, most of these substances are not only expensive but also toxic and non–biodegradable thus causing corrosion problems (Raja and Sethuraman, 2008).\n\nThe known hazardous effects of synthetic organic inhibitors, which have been in use (Popova et al., 2007; Li, et. al., 2009) and the need to develop cheap, non-toxic and ecofriendly processes have now made researchers to focus on the use of  natural product (Umoren et al., 2008; Umoren & Ebenso, 2008; El-Etre, 2008). Plants have been recognized as naturally occurring compounds, some with rather complex molecular structures and having varying physical, chemical and biological properties (Buchweishaija, 2009a).\n\nThe present work therefore, has been designed to evaluate the effect of the leaf extracts of Moringa oleifera on the corrosion inhibition of mild steel in 5M and 1M hydrochloric acid solution with a view to contributing to the search for further beneficial uses of plant extract. Gravimetric and gasometric methods were used for the investigation.\n\n1.2 Corrosion\n\nCorrosion is nature’s method whereby metals and alloys return to their unrefined naturally occurring forms as minerals and ores (Peter Maaß, 2011). Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by chemical attack or interaction with its environment (Acharya et. al., 2013). It can also be defined as the gradual eating away or disintegration or deterioration of materials by chemical or electrochemical reaction with its environment (Dara, 2007).\n\nCorrosion is a constant and continuous problem, often diﬃcult to eliminate completely. Prevention would be more practical and achievable than complete elimination. Corrosion processes develop fast after disruption of the protective barrier and are accompanied by a number of reactions that change the composition and properties of both the metal surface and the local environment, for example, formation of oxides, diﬀusion of metal cations into the coating matrix, local pH changes, and electrochemical potential (Rani and Basu, 2011).\n\n1.3 Cause of Corrosion\n\nIn nature, most metals are found in a chemically combined state known as an ore. All the metals except gold, platinum and silver exist in nature in the form of their oxides, carbonates, sulphides, sulphates, etc. These combined forms of the metals represent their thermodynamically stable state (low energy state). The metals are extracted from these ores after supplying a large amount of energy.\n\nMetals in the uncombined condition have a higher energy and are in an unstable state. It is their natural tendency to go back to the low energy state, that is, combined state by recombining with the elements present in the environment. This is the main reason for corrosion (Peter Maaß, 2011).\n\n1.4 Basic process involved in corrosion\n\nThe basic process of metallic corrosion in aqueous solution consists of the anodic dissolution of metals and the cathodic reduction of oxidants present in the solution:\n\nMM → M2+ (aq)+ 2e-M----------------- anodic oxidation (1.1)\n\n2Oxaq + 2e- M → 2Red.(e- redox)(aq)-------cathodic oxidation (1.2)\n\nIn the formulae, MM is the metal in the state of metallic bonding, M2+aq is the hydrated metal ion in aqueous solution, e-M is the electron in the metal, Oxaq is an oxidant, 2Red. is a reductant, and e- redox is the redox electron in the reductant.\n\nThe overall corrosion reaction is then written as follows:\n\nMM + 2Ox(aq) → M2+(aq) +2Red (e- redox)(aq)  ---------------------------- (1.3)\n\nThese reactions are charge-transfer processes that occur across the interface between the metal and the aqueous solution, hence they are dependent on the interfacial potential that essentially corresponds to what is called the electrode potential of metals in electrochemistry terms. In physics terms, the electrode potential represents the energy level of electrons, called the Fermi level, in an electrode immersed in electrolyte.\n\nFor normal metallic corrosion, in practice, the cathodic process is carried out by the reduction of hydrogen ions and/or the reduction of oxygen molecules in aqueous solution. These two cathodic reductions are electron transfer processes that occur across the metal–solution interface, whereas anodic metal dissolution is an ion transfer process across the interface (Sato, 2012).\n\n1.5 Forms of Corrosion\n\nCorrosion can be classified into different categories based on the material, environment or the morphology of the corrosion damage. According to the environment to which materials are exposed, there are various forms of corrosion: uniform or general, pitting, erosion, crevice, stress, galvanic and hydrogen embrittlement.\n\n1.5.1 Uniform or general corrosion\n\nGeneral corrosion occurs as a result of chemical or electrochemical reactions which proceeds over the entire exposed surface at about the same rate. General corrosion results in the metal becoming thinner and usually alters the appearance of the surface. General corrosion could result in failure through lowering the mechanical strength of components or by reducing wall thickness until leaking results (Gray and Luan, 2002).",

(Holmes, 1939). Viruses can be spread by direct transfer of sap by contact of a wounded plant with a healthy one, such contact may occur during agricultural practices, as by damage caused by tools or hands, or naturally as by animal feeding on the plant.     Most of the viruses infecting plants rely on insects to move from one host to another, some remain associated with the mouthparts and can be inoculated within seconds or minutes.     (Martinus, 1898). This work those not cover insect transmission but basically mechanical inoculation. \n\n1.2  Methods employed to control plant viruses\n\n       Plant viruses and virus diseases have been studied for more than 100 years and much attention has been given to their control. However, this has been difficult to achieve because of the lack of any effective means of curing virus-infected plants. Chemotherapy, thermotherapy and Meristem-tip culture can be successful but they cannot be used on a large scale. (Brook, 1964). The main approach has been to prevent or delay virus infection or to minimize its effect. Various means have been used to achieve these objectives, including phyto-sanitation. (Involving quarantine measures, crop hygiene use of virus-free plant materials and eradication) changes in crop practices, use of pesticide for control of vectors, mild strain protection and the employment of resistant or tolerant varieties. (Sarkar, 1995). Some viruses can be eliminated from infected plant by heat or meristem-tip therapy or by the use of chemicals     (Faccioli and Marami, 1998) these methods are used widely to develop virus-free plants of vegetatively-propagated crops for further propagation. It prevents plants from becoming infected, delay infection to such a life stage of crop impaired and decrease the effects of infection. (Mink et al, 1998).\n\n1.2.1 Ricinus Sp (Castor oil plant)\n\n has being classified as a member of the sponge family, Euphobiaceae. The seed from Ricinus sp plant contain in excess of 45% oil. The said oil is used widely for various purposes. It is used as a lubricant, in high speed engine and aeroplanes, in the manufacture of soap, transparent paper, printing ink, varnishings, linolilium and plasticizer. It is also used for medical and lighting purposes. It has antimicrobial activities against gram positive bacteria (Nuttall & Labuda, 2008).\n\n1.2.2 Mirabilis Jalapa. \n\n(The four 0’clock plant) has being classified as a member of the Nyctaginaleae family the species mirabilis Jalapa is a commonly grown ornamental plant and is available in a range of colours. The flower of Mirabilis Jalapa is used for food colouring, and the leaves may be eaten cooked as food. It serves as emergency food. It is used for dye production for cakes and jellies. It is also used for cosmetics production. It has antiviral protein (MAP) which was demonstrated to possess abortificiant actively in pregnant mice, inhibitory effect on call-free protein synthesis and antiproliferative effect on tumor cells. (Wong et al, 2014).\n\n1.2.3 Phyllanthus amerus: is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, it is commonly called the stone breaker, the plant extract from Phyllanthus according to (Nicole, 1998) has being used for killing bacteria, expels stones, support kidneys and treat malaria.\n\n1.2.4 Adansonia Digitata: Belongs to the family Malvaceae. This species is found in hot, dry savannahs’ of Sub-Saharan Africa. Common names, Baobab, monkey bread tree, dead-rat tree and cream of taster tree etc. The leaves are used either fresh as a cooked vegetable or dried and powered as an ingredient of soups and sauces. The shoots and roots of seedlings are eaten as well. The roots are boiled and eaten in West Africa in times of famine. It is used as functional food for the well being of the rural communities, food for livestock, shelter for the living and the dead, the bark of a digitata has been imported in the past into Europe by the packing and paper industry and for medicinal use. Under the name cortex Cael Cedra. It was used as a substitute for quinine to reduce fever (Jardin, 1968).\n\n1.2.5      Acalypha Indica: belong to the family Euphorbialeae. It is a common herb growing up to 75cm tall with ovate leaves. The leaves are cooked and eaten as vegetable. This plant is held to high esteem in traditional medicine, as it is believed to rejuvenate the body. It is useful bronchitis pneumonia, ashma and pulmonary tuberculosis. It also has significant antibacterial and antifungal activities, both against human and plant pathogen.  (Burkill, 1974).\n\n1.3  Plant as reserviour Of Antiviral substance\n\n       Plants from Northern Nigeria with a history of use in both human and veterinary traditional medicine have been investigated for their antiviral activity and their hypotoxility determined. Most of the extracts have activity against more than one virus of a dose rate of between 100 and 400 microg/100 microl. (Mehesh, 2000).\n\nLawsonia  Inermis: Popularly known as Hemma or mehindi in the oriental world, is an evergreen medium sized shrub belonging to the family hythraccere. This plant harbors a well documented folklore history for treating convulsion, jaundice and malignant ulcers. Phytochemical studies in henna plant have indicated the presence of several bioactive molecular like isophumpagin, hipeol, 30-norlupan -3-01-20-one betuhennan, betuhennamic acid and nstigmasterol in leaves and roots. Plant extract have been known to be depressing antimicrobial, antioxidant, wound healing, anti-inflammatory antipyretic, analgesis actions, (Keyvan, 2008).\n\n1.4 Morocan water melon Mosaic virus : the moroceam water melon mosaic virus (MWMV), has been determined to be a distinct members of the polyvirus group.\n\n       (Cockerhem, 1970) the relationship of the morocean water melon mosaic virus and other polyviruses and the W strain  of papaya rignspoot virus, was examined by comparing tryptic peptide profiles using high performance liquid chromatography. The profolus indicated that the low protein sequence of MWMV differed substantially from those of the other poly-viruses. (McKern, 1993).",

        "content": "DETERMINATION OF THE FERRITIN AND GLUCOSE LEVELS IN SERUM OF MICE TREATED WITH ETHANOLIC LEAF EXTRACT OF PHYLLANTUSAMARUS\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE  \n\n 1.0.         Introduction  \n\nTraditional medicine is the total combination of knowledge whether explicable or inexplicable use in diagnosing, preventing or eliminating physical, mental or social disease which may rely exclusively on past experience handed down from generation to generation (Boerio-Goates, 2001). A medicinal plant is any plant used for the extraction of pure substances either for direct medicinal use or for hemi-synthesis of medicinal compounds which can be used for the therapeutic purpose or as a precursor for the synthesis of useful drugs (Ponomarev and Migarskaya, 2000),).\n\nThe plant Phyllanthus amarus is one of the most important medicinal plants used in traditional medicine for the treatment of diabetes and excess bodyweight reduction.\n\nIts hypoglycemic properties have been reported (Bunn and Higgins, 2011). \n\nFerritin is a class of iron storage protein distributed in virtually all living kingdoms. Proteins of this class commonly form spherical protein nanocages, each of which is usually composed of 24 similar or identical subunits (Oyaizu, 2006). This cage-like 24-mer has a large inner cavity and shows the highly symmetrical architecture, i.e., the 24 subunits are related by four-, three-, and twofold symmetries (432 symmetry). A subunit of ferritin forms a four-helix bundle composed of helices A to D and a short fifth helix E, which is also a common structural feature of all ferritins. Many intersubunit interactions have been observed in the crystal structures of ferritin from various organisms, giving the ferritin superfamily its super thermal stability (Krikler and Heathcote, 2002). The ferritin superfamily can be divided into a vertebrate type, a plant type, a bacterial type, and so on. Bacterial ferritin can be further divided into heme-containing bacterioferritin (Bfr), nonheme ferritin (Ftn), and Dps (DNA binding protein from starved cells), the latter of which exceptionally forms a dodecameric protein shell with two- and threefold symmetry axes (mini-ferritin). Most of the ferritins possess a di-iron oxidoreductase site (ferroxidase site) responsible for iron oxidation in the center of the four-helix bundle of the monomeric subunit, except for mammalian L chain ferritin (Rucker et al., 2009).\n\nGlucose \n\nis a sugar with the molecular formulaC6H12O6. The name \"glucose\" (/ˈɡluːkoʊs/) comes from the Greek word γλευκος, meaning \"sweet wine, must\". Several active compounds have been identified in P. amarus were found to be potent inhibitors of rat liver cyclic AMP–dependant protein kinases (Fairclough and Houston, 2004),phyllanthin and hypo-phyllanthin present are reported to be hepatoprotective agents and protect hepatocytes against carbon tetrachloride and galactosamine induced liver toxicity in rats (Gailliot and Baumeister, 2007).\n\nPhyllanthus amarus is a plant of the family Euphorbiaceae and has about approximately 800 species which are found in tropical and subtropical countries of the world (Coresh et al., 2007). The name ‘Phyllanthus’ means “leaf and flower” and named so because of its appearance where flower, fruit and leaf appears fused. Phyllanthus amarus is a branching annual glabrous herb which is 30-60 cm high and have slender, leaf-bearing branchlets, distichous leaves which are subsessile elliptic-oblong, obtuse, rounded base (Honeycutt et al., 2013). Flowers are yellowish, whitish or greenish, auxillary, males flowers in groups of 1-3 whereas females are solitary. Fruits are depressed-globose like smooth capsules present underneath the branches and seeds are trigonous, pale brown with longitudinal parallel ribs on the back (Williams, 2010).\n\nPhyllanthus amarus is a small erect, annual monoeciousglabous herb that grows to 30-40 cm in height. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceaewith leaves that alternate distichous and crowded along lateral branchlets (Foo and Wong 2012).\n\nPhyllanthus amarus is a plant with reported medicinal properties and broad spectrum of pharmacological activities including antiviral, antimicrobial, anti-plasmodial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antidiabetics, antioxidant and diuretics properties among others. A number of active constituents of the plant are related to biologically active lignans, glycosides, flavonoids, ellagitannins and phenylpropanoids found in the leaf, stem and root of the plant along with common lipids, sterols and flavonols.[Phyllanthus amarus is a tropical shrub indigenous to the rainforest of Amazon and other tropical areas of the world (Foo, 2005).\n\nStudies on extract of Phyllanthus amarus have shown anti hepatitis B activity, hepatoprotective (Georgieva et al., 2002), anticancerous (Uriezeet al., 2010), antimicrobial (Samraj (2001) and kidney stones dissolution properties (Stipanuk, 2000). Therefore, the present investigation was undertaken to study the ferritin and glucose levels in the serum of mice treated with ethanoic leaf of exract of P. amarus induced diabetic mice.\n\n1.1.    Statement of the Problem\n\nIron is important for lots of processes in the body; too much iron over a long period of time can be dangerous and cause a lot of problems with the function of body organs. Low levels of ferritin are seen in iron deficiency. Serum insulin levels have been researched in the general population as potential predictive biomarkers for all-cause and cause-specific mortality, but initial research has found mixed results. Subsequent studies have suggested that the more stable insulin precursor molecule, proinsulin, is a better predictive marker of all-cause and cause-specific mortality, in particular, cardiovascular mortality (Blacklocket al., 2000). However, there have been few long-term prospective studies to evaluate this finding. Proinsulin and mortality from cancer has not been studied.\n\nRaised serum ferritin can be caused by five main mechanisms: damage to ferritin-containing tissues, for example, the bone marrow and liver; inflammation or infection, because ferritin is an acute-phase protein; genetic iron-loading conditions; secondary iron-loading conditions, which are mainly due to blood transfusions but are also seen in African haemosiderosis due to the ingestion of large quantities of iron; and chronic anaemias caused by ineffective haematopoesis, for example, thalassaemias elimination (Hasratet al., 2004).\n\nLow serum ferritin is a common problem in people with gluten intolerance. In celiac disease, antibodies first target the proximal small intestine (the earlier part of your small intestine), which is the part of your small intestine responsible for absorbing iron. Some forms of non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) also trigger antibodies that do damage to this part of your intestine, while other forms of NCGS trigger systemic inflammation, which may impede iron absorption. Low ferritin is most common and most severe in celiac disease patients (Koffi, 2007).\n\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) is caused by inherited and/ or acquired deficiency in production of insulin by the pancreas, or by the ineffectiveness of the insulin produced . This insulin deficiency results in increased concentration of glucose in the blood. Increase in blood glucose damages many of the body’s systems, in particular, the blood vessels and nerves. The hyperglycemia caused due to decreased insulin production is called Type-1 diabetes and hyperglycemia due insufficient insulin utilization is called Type-2 diabetes. Out of these two types, Type -2 diabetes is a major problem of today and it account for nearly 95% of total diabetic population of about 246 million. Since ancient times, plants have been an exemplary source of medicine (Konan et al., 2006).\n\nPhyllanthinis reported to be hepatoprotective agents and protect hepatocytes against carbon tetrachloride and galactosamine induced liver toxicity in rats (Syamasundaret al., 1985). In Nigeria, the plant is extensively used in traditional medicine to eliminate waste from the body, restore the activity of the liver and build up blood and innate defense system.\n\nPhyllanthus amarus is a small herb common to central and southern India. It can grow to 30-60 cm in height and bloom with yellow flowers. All parts of the plant are used in ayurvedhic medicines because of their medicinal properties. Leaves of this plant are reported to contain lignans, alkaloids, flavonoids, galloatnoids and glycosides\n\nIt is noted that evaluation of this herb and herbal products in general faces major problems. First, is the use of mixed extracts (concoctions) and variations in methods of harvesting, preparing, and extracting the herb, which can result in dramatically different levels of certain alkaloids.\n\nDespite the wide spread use of P. amarus much has not been reported about the biochemical effect in Nigeria. A recent work in Nigeria shows that the aqueous extract of P. amarus has hepatic cell function enhancement (Chen et al., 1996). This work was therefore designed to evaluate ferritin and glucose levels in the serum of mice treated with ethanoic  treated with extract of P. amarus.\n\n1.2.    Objective of the Study\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the ferritin and glucose levels in serum of mice treated with ethanolic leaf extract of Phyllantusamarus which may indicate an advantage or disadvantage\n\n1.3.    Scope of the Study\n\nThe study seeks to evaluate ferritin and glucose levels in the serum mice treated with ethanoic leaf extract of phyllantusamarus using mice model. A group of male mice induced with ferritin and glucose would be treated with leaf extract of phyllantusamarus and also would be treated with the juice extract of the plant on daily basis and another group who are otherwise healthy would serve as a positive control while an induced but not treated group would serve as a negative control for the experiment. The research will be carried out in the Animal Facility of the Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences of Delta State University Abraka.\n\n1.4     Significance of the Study\n\nThe result of this study may be used to help determine the cause of hypoglycemia (low glucose). The findings of this study will be of traditional usefulness in several health problems such as diarrhoea, dysentery, dropsy, jaundice, intermittent fevers, urinogenital disorders, scabies and wounds. This study will enlighten riverside communities of the potential danger they face and how to control it using the Phyllanthus amarus.\n\n1.5.    Limitation of the Study\n\nThis study is limited to leaf extract of phyllantusamarus  for the treatment of ferritin and glucose levels in serum of mice which may indicate an advantage or disadvantage.\n\n\n",

This has been attributed to its rich phytochemical and antioxidant properties. Therefore, this study evaluated the phytochemical as well as the antioxidant activity of aqueous extracts of Spondias mombin. The extracts of Spondias mombin were investigated for phytochemical such as tannins, saponins, alkaloids, total flavonoids, total phenol, and proanthocyanidin, while the in vitro antioxidant activity was determined using ferrous metal chelating assay, antioxidant power assay, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay, 1,1-diphenyl-2,2-picry-hydazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay. The result obtained for phytochemical studies reveal that phenolic content was highest in the aqueous extract of Spondias mombin stem bark as against aqueous extract of Spondias mombin root which has a low phenolic content. Also, proanthocyanidin was highest in aqueous extract of Spondaismombin root and low in aqueous extract of Spondias mombin stem bark. Qualitative study shows the presence of the various phytochemicals in varying amounts, however, alkaloid were absent in both aqueous extract of Spondias mombin root and stem bark, tannins were present only in aqueous extract of Spondias mombin stem bark, while cardiac glycosides were present only aqueous extract of Spondiasmombin stem bark. The aqueous extract of Spondias mombin stem bark showed the best IC50 value (2.66 ×109) for 1,1-Diphenyl-2,2-picry-hydazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity when compared with root extract, but, was significantly (p<0.05) higher than that of the standard, vitamin C (1.281). Also, an aqueous extract of Spondiasmombin stem bark showed the best IC50 for ferrous metal chelating assay when compared with the root extract, but was significantly (p<0.05) higher than that of standard, (EDTA) (4.031). Therefore, Spondiasmombin has a great potential for use as a natural source of antioxidants against free radical damage. ",

        "content": "GROWTH PERFORMANCE OF CLARIAS GARIEPINUS FED WITH COPPENS AT A FREQUENCY OF ONCE AND TWICE DAILY\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE   \n\n1.0      INTRODUCTION  \n\nAquaculture, the farming of aquatic organisms including fish, mollusks, crustacean, and the aquatic plant is necessary to meet the protein need of Nigerians. Over time, there has been an increase in fish production in Nigeria. Despite this increase in fish production, the desired result has not been attained. Quantitatively, details of fish production as of 2005 stood at 490,600 tons (FAO, 2003) from the artisan fishery, 56,300 tons from industry fishery through the use of trawlers, while fish importation stood at 61,150 tons. In meeting up with the growing need for fish production, aquaculture practice has been identified as a possible alternative, the reasons being that the activities of artisans and industrial fishery in our natural waters have led to over exploitation and degradation due to human activities in our coastal water. To fully bring aquaculture to its desired level, four production challenges have been identified. These are the challenges of feeding the fish stock in the pond, management of pond water supply, fish seeds provision and pond construction/establishment. The first two challenges: fish feeding and water quality management affect each other. The level of feeding of the stocks affects the water quality and the level of water quality affects the feeding performance of fish in the pond (George, 2001).\n\nFish like other animals need food to be able to carry out their metabolic activities. In aquaculture, fish feeding is either supplemental or complete (total supply). Supplemental feeding is when feeds are given to the animal at a minimal level to add to the natural food available for the fish in the pond water. These natural foods are in the form of phytoplankton and zooplanktons. The complete feeding is when the source of food fed to the fish is solely supplied by the farmer. In whichever case, the type of feeding practiced depends on the nature of the pond and the type of production the farmer is involved with (Michael, 1987; Michael et al., 2005).\n\nThe most popular cultured fish in Nigeria is the Catfish. It is naturally carnivorous, a bottom pond dweller, nocturnally very active and belongs to the family of Claridge (Willian, 1967; Idoho-Umeh, 2003). However, with the fish domestication, its modes of feeding and activities have been destabilized and modified. To this end, the feeding regime has become diverse but the thumb rule of feeding stock at an optimum level should be very economical so as to have savings in feed cost and the overall economic justification. Webster et al., (1992) reported that catfish can be fed once or twice daily and rainbow trout three times a day. In whichever case, the type of feeding practiced depends on the nature of the pond and the type of production; climatic conditions and economic status of the farmer dictate the feeding requirement. \n\nVarious studies have been done in fish feeding (Collins and Delmendo, 1979; Sena and Brain, 1992) but much is still to be done in the area of the best time of the day and frequency to feed catfish so as to have good growth performance that will justify the high cost of feeding provided by the farmer. Determining the best frequency of feeding the catfish is therefore expected to help to maximize performance, discourage waste, and ensure the success of the enterprise. This will help to discourage the deterioration of water quality which may arise from the decomposition of feeds fed to the fish due to feeding at inappropriate time and frequency. This, in turn, is expected to help to minimize fish mortality due to pond water quality deterioration. The Overall production of the stock will also be enhanced (Norm, 2000). Hence, the need to study the growth performance of Clarias gariepinus fed at a frequency of once and twice daily for an enhanced yield derived from better and faster growth for the production of the catfish.\n\n1.1  AIM AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe aim of this research is to feed Clarias gariepinus at different frequencies of once and twice daily with the following specific objective:\n\nto determine which of the feeding frequencies is more economical in the rearing of Clarias gariepinus.\n\n1.2  JUSTIFICATION\n\nThis study is useful to fish farmers as it is expected to create awareness on the appropriate feeding frequency that can yield better growth in Clarias gariepinus culture. It is also expected to enable aquaculturists to be aware of the best economical method that yields better growth in different feeding frequencies within a short production period. Finally, the results are expected to be useful to commercial fish farmers in making managerial decisions in the production of Clarias gariepinus.",

        "content": "BACTERIOLOGICAL QUALITY OF FROZEN CHICKEN SOLD IN GWAGWALADA MARKET\n\n\n\nABSTRACT  \n\nTwenty samples of frozen chicken from five different sellers were analyzed to determine their bacteriological load; the samples were collected from Gwagwalada market. All the frozen chicken samples from the five sellers examined were contaminated with some bacterial species namely, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphyloccus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The total bacteria counts for all the chicken examined from the different sellers was in the range of 0.7 × 102\n\ncfu/ml to 8.5 × 102 cfu/ml and the coliform counts obtained for all the chicken samples ranged from 0.1 × 102 cfu/ml to 3.2 × 102 cfu/ml. These finding suggest that most of the frozen chicken parts stored in the open market may constitute sources of bacterial food poisoning consequently public health hazard.\n\nCHAPTER ONE 1.0                                \n\nINTRODUCTION  \n\nThe first consumer right is to have a product of good quality and not constituting any health hazard. Poultry meat products are highly desirable, palatable, digestible and nutritious for all ages. Poultry meat is comprised of about 20–23% protein, other are water and fat, phosphorus, iron and vitamins. Comminuted products, such as frankfurters, bologna and sausages typically contain about 17–20% protein, 0–20% fat, and 60–80% water (Smith, 2001).Quality products are those that meet some need or expectation of consumers and are safe and wholesome as well. (Sahooet al., 1996).The microbiological safety and quality of poultry meat are equally important to producers, retailers and consumers. Two quite different groups of microorganisms are relevant: on the one hand certain foodborne pathogens, and, on the other, organisms that are generally harmless to human health, but, being psychrotrophic, are able to multiply on the product during chill storage. Spoilage results mainly from off- odour development, and product shelf-life is determined both by the number of spoilage organisms present initially and the temperature history of the product at all stages of production and subsequent storage and handling (Pooni and Mead, 1984). For chill- stored poultry, Viehweget al. (1989) demonstrated that virtually all the odorous substances found at spoilage could be attributed to microbial growth and metabolism. Contamination of poultry meat with foodborne pathogens remains an important public health issue, because it can lead to illness if there are malpractices in handling, cooking or post-cooking storage of the product.\n\nFresh (uncooked) foods such as chicken carries natural microflora that may contain organisms potentially harmful to humans. The microbial flora of table poultry is largely confined to the skin surface or visceral cavity. Isolates from poultry and poultry products could include members of the following general Enterobacter, Alcaligenes, Escherichia,Bacillus, Flavobacterium, Micrococcus, Proteus,Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Corynebacteriumand Salmonella. (Frazier and Westhoff,1988).\n\nContamination of the skin and lining of the body cavity occurs during washing, plucking and evisceration. Bacterial numbers vary considerably on the surface of chickens. This variation however is greater between birds than is between different areas of the same birds. The type of organisms isolated depends upon where the samples were taken and upon the stage of processing (Frazier and Westhoff, 1988). Fresh poultry products like meat are known to undergo deterioration due to microbial action, chemical and physical changes. In normal handling and storage of poultry meat, this deterioration changes are attributed to micro biological contamination and activity.\n\nPoultry and poultry products are frequently contaminated with several types of microorganisms. This problem is even more severe under temperature-abused conditions as well as improper or inefficient refrigeration commonly observed in retail chicken sold in open markets. Poultry can be kept in good condition for months if freezing is prompt and rapid and the storage temperature is low enough. Poultry should freeze fast enough to retain most of the natural bloom or external appearance of a freshly dressed fowl. The storage temperature should be below 17.8oC and the relative humidity above 95 percent to reduce surface drying. Most poultry is sharp-frozen at about 29oC or less in circulating air or on a moving belt in a freezing tunnel. Other spoilage micro-organisms are introduced into the poultry products by the workmen during cutting and evisceration, through water, and air in the dressing, cooling and cutting room environment (Allenet al., 2000). However, various methods are used in the preservation of these poultry products in order to reduce the incidence of these organisms. These include asepsis, use of heat, use of low temperature, chilling, freezing, preservatives such as acetic, adipic, succinic etc. at pH 2.5 and use irradiation (Frazier and Westhoff, 1988). Despite these methods of preservation, contamination of poultry products remains the order of the day before it gets to the final consumer.\n\n1.1   AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nVarious bacteria are associated with poultry products; this project is aimed at achieving the following objectives:\n\ni.       To isolate the various microbial isolates associated with frozen chicken purchased from different sellers in Gwagwalada market.\n\nii.       To characterize and identify these micro-organisms.\n\niii.      To speculate on the significance of these isolates.\n\niv.      To compare the level of contamination of the samples (frozen chicken) collected from different parts of the market.",

The standard methods used to detect the phytochemicals present in the extracts revealed the presence of tannins, flavonoids, triterpenoids and phytosterols in all the extracts while steroids and amino acids were absent. The antibacterial evaluation of the spice extracts using agar plate-well diffusion and nutrient broth dilution techniques showed thatthere was no significant difference in the activity of the spice extracts (p > 0.05) against the test organisms (Streptococcus pneumoniaeand Pseudomonas aeruginosa, clinical bacterial isolates). Ampiclox and chloramphenicol were used as control for the test organisms to provide approximate basis for the comparison of the activity of the extracts. The MIC and MBC was the same for all the extracts against S. pneumoniae, 6.25 mg/ml while 25 mg/ml for thyme extracts, and 50 mg/ml for nutmeg extracts against P. aeruginosa, showing the extracts to be bactericidal.\n\nCHAPTER ONE 1.0                               \n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\nThe spread of drug-resistant pathogens is one of the most serious threats to public health in the 21st century.Although pharmacological industries have produced a number of new antibiotics in the last three decades, resistance to these drugs by microorganisms still remains. In general, bacteria have the genetic ability to transmit and acquire resistance to drugs, which are utilized as therapeutic agents (Cohen, 1992). Such a fact is a cause for concern, because of the number of patients in hospitals who have suppressed immunity, and due to new bacterial strains that are multi-drug resistant. Consequently, new infections can occur in hospitals resulting in high mortality as observed by Montelli and Levy (1991).\n\nThe use of herbs as first medicines is a universal phenomenon. For a long period of time, plants have been a valuable source of natural products for maintaining human health, especially in the last decade, with more intensive studies for natural therapies. Most drugs of the past were substances with a particular therapeutic action extracted from plants. Thus, medicinal plants may be defined as any plant that can be put to culinary use such as onions, fox glove, garlic and ginger (Wainright, 2001). More and more researchers find that food and their individual constituents perform similar fashion to modern drugs and sometimes better without the dreaded side effects (Serrentino, 1991).\n\nPlant extracts have great potential as antimicrobial compounds against microorganisms (Gisleneet al., 2000) and studies have reported that they can be used in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by resistant microbes.Thymus vulgaris (thyme) leaves andMyristicafragrans(nutmeg) seeds are plants parts that are widely used as spices for cooking especially for flavouring meats, soups and stews. They have also been reported to have medicinal uses and possess antimicrobial abilities(Stahl-BiskupandSaez, 2002; Cho et al., 2006; Narasimhan and Dhake, 2007). \n\nExtracts of these spices were believed to have chemical components which are active against pathogenic microorganism. More people have continued to use these spices for a variety of culinary purposes in the absence of adequate toxicity data and proper understanding of their medicinal properties. Folk medicine practitioners believe that these herbs are non-toxic even though there is no scientific backing to support this claim. This study intends to investigate and provide adequate on the antibacterial properties and chemical constituents of thyme and nutmeg to determine whether they are beneficial or otherwise.\n\n1.1     SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY\n\nMany antibiotics currently in use are either too expensive or possess undesirable side effects while some are no more effective due to bacterial resistance (Alper, 1998). Despite the remarkable progress in synthetic organic chemistry of the twentieth century, over 25% of prescribed medicines in industrialized countries are derived directly or indirectly from plants (Newman et al., 2000). Human disease management in Nigerian history also provides evidence of the relationship of plants and medicine (Ayandele and Adebiyi, 2007).\n\nThyme and nutmeg are spices widely employed in cooking in Nigeria. Researches have shown that both possess antibacterial capabilities but with the manner in which they are sold in market places, especially as thyme is processed and both spices are being exposed to prolong periods of sunlight, it is important to ascertain their efficacy. In the interest of public health, what is ingested is of great concern, the amount taken in is just as crucial and that they can help strengthen the immune system to resist deadly infections is a massive advantage.\n\n1.2     AIM AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the antibacterial activities of spices (thyme and nutmeg) especially as they serve culinary purposes. The objectives of this study are to;\n\ni.        Determine the effect of the spice extracts against test organisms (Streptococcus pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa).\n\nii.       Compare the action of the aqueous and the ethanolic extracts of the spices.\n\niii.      Determine whether the spice extracts are bactericidal or bacteriostatic.\n\n1.3     SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF STUDY\n\nThis study was limited to the antibacterial effect of Thymus vulgaris leaves and Myristica fragrans seeds as well as the phytochemical screening of these spices was also conducted. The determination of the chemical constituents was qualitative for alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, steroids, glycosides, triterpenoids, phytosterols, and amino acids. Their antibacterial activity was limited to the testing of the ethanolic and aqueous extracts of the thyme leaves and nutmeg seeds against Streptococcus pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",

        "content": "THE EFFECT OF CALCIUM TAINTED WATER ON CADMIUM INDUCED LIVER DAMAGE\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT  \n\nCadmium is recognize has a toxicant to both human and it’s environment and recent investigations have shown its level of toxicity in association in liver damage.  The aim of study is to determine the effect of calcium tainted water on cadmium induced liver damage  have been examine in this studies, 20 female wistar rat were used in this study the rats divided into four groups each containing 5 rats per group . The group one was maintained on normal feed and water only, the group 2 were exposed to cadmium only while the group three were exposed to calcium only and the group four were exposed simultaneously to cadmium and calcium. Each of the animal was given treatment based on their body weight (0.9 mg per kg body weight). The treatments were administered to the animals once a day for two weeks. At the end of two weeks the animals were sacrificed and the following biochemical markers were measured; Alkaline phosphatase, total protein, alanine amino transferase, total bilirubin and direct bilirubin.  All the biochemical markers were negatively affected by cadmium with exception to Albumin and total protein. The study reveal that cadmium has the potential to induce hepatotoxicity and calcium tainted water offer little ameliorating affect to cadmium induce liver damage.\n\nCHAPTER ONE \n\n1.0     INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW  \n\nHeavy metals are toxic agent. They are toxic to humans and animals. Heavy metals which establishes toxic actions to humans include; cadmium (Stohs and Bagchi,1995), lead ( Ferner, 2001) and mercury (Hawkes, 1997). Each of these has been studied   in isolation for toxicity (Huton and Symon, 1986; Nriagu and Pacyna, 1988; Nriagu, 1989). But, in the eco-system, be it air, atmosphere, land, and water where they occur, they do not exist in isolation. They occur in close association with other metal and non-metallic elemental pollutants. Among the metallic pollutant could be calcium, copper, zinc, magnesium, manganese, iron and others.  Metals are known to interact with one another. The interaction can bring two elements together in close proximity or it could cause out right displacement of one another. When ingested together in food and water, they antagonize each other. When it comes to intestinal and pulmonary absorption, it is therefore conceivable that the presence of other elements can the toxic potential of each of the heavy metals that have been studied in isolation.\n\n          Eborge (1994) reported that warri river has an unacceptable high cadmium level, 0.3 mg cadmium per liter of water which was 60 folds above the maximum allowable level of 0.005 mg per liter. This report prompted our earlier studies on the hepato, nephro and gonadial toxicity of cadmium. In rats exposed to this high dose via water and diet, the diet was formulated with feed exposed to 0.3 mg cadmium per water. In the ambient water as protein source and the toxic effect investigated and reported (Asagba and obi 2000; Asagba and Obi 2001; Obi and Ilori 2002; Asagba and Obi 2004a; Asagba and Obi 2004b; Asagba and Obi 2005).The study focus on cadmium without taking into consideration the fact that other metals were also present in the river water, and as such were co-consumed by the communities using the river water for cooking drinking and for other domestic purposes. Hence, it is desirable to know if the presence of other metals would enhance or diminish the toxic potential of cadmium or indeed if any other heavy metals such as lead that was mentioned above. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to re-examine the toxic potential of cadmium in the presence of other metals such as calcium and magnesium. \n\n          The objectives set out to achieve were;\n\nRe-examination of toxicity of using established and those for liver toxicity namely; blood alanine amino transferase and aspartate amino transferase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, albumin and total protein. Re-examine the status parameter in the absence of cadmium but in the presence of calcium or magnesium or both. Re-examine this parameters in the presence of cadmium, calcium and magnesium.\n\n1.1     CADMIUM\n\nCadmium is a chemical element with symbol Cd and atomic number 48. This soft, bluish-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in group 12, zinc and mercury. Like zinc, it prefers oxidation state +2 in most of its compounds and like mercury it shows a low melting point compared to transition metals. Cadmium and its congeners are not always considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by Stromeyer and Hermann, both in Germany, as an impurity in zinc carbonate. Cadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and therefore is a byproduct of zinc production. It was used for a long time as a pigment and for corrosion-resistant plating on steel, whereas cadmium compounds were used to stabilize plastic. The use of cadmium is generally decreasing due to its toxicity (it is specifically listed in the European Restriction of Hazardous Substances (Morrow, 2010)) and the replacement of nickel-cadmium batteries with nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. One of its few new uses is in cadmium telluride solar panels. Although cadmium has no known biological function in higher organisms, a cadmium-dependent carbonic anhydrase has been found in marine diatoms.\n\n1.1.1  PHYSICAL PROPERTIES\n\nCadmium is a soft, malleable, ductile, bluish-white divalent metal. It is similar in many respects to zinc but forms complex compounds (Holleman et al., 1985). Unlike other metals, cadmium is resistant to corrosion and as a result it is used as a protective layer when deposited on other metals. As a bulk metal, cadmium is insoluble in water and is not flammable; however, in its powdered form it may burn and release toxic fumes (CSEM, 2011).\n\n1.1.2  CHEMICAL PROPERTIES\n\nAlthough cadmium usually has an oxidation state of +2, it also exists in the +1 state. Cadmium and its congeners are not always considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states (Cotton, 1999). Cadmium burns in air to form brown amorphous cadmium oxide (CdO); the crystalline form of this compound is a dark red which changes color when heated, similar to zinc oxide. Hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and nitric acid dissolve cadmium by forming cadmium chloride (CdCl2), cadmium sulfate (CdSO4), or cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2). The oxidation state +1 can be reached by dissolving cadmium in a mixture of cadmium chloride and aluminium chloride, forming the Cd22+ cation, which is similar to the Hg22+ cation in mercury(I) chloride (Holleman et al., 1985).\n\nCd + CdCl2 + 2 AlCl3 → Cd2(AlCl4)2\n\nThe structures of many cadmium complexes with nucleobases, amino acids and vitamins have been determined (Carballo et al., 2013).",

        "content": "ISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF FUNGI ASSOCIATED WITH “SPOILED” TOMATOES IN GWAGWALADA\n\n\n\nABSTRACT  \n\nThe study examined the various fungal pathogens associated with tomatoes spoilage as well as their preliminary taxonomic grouping up to genus level. 25 samples of the spoiled tomatoes were collected from five locations within Gwagwalada area council. Locations include: Passo Village, Gwagwalada market, Phase III, New Kutunku and Dagiri. Thesame prevalence rate(100%) was recorded for all tomato samples purchased in all locations.The level of awareness of the general public in regards to the spoilage of tomatoes by Fungi was very significant with about 62.5% of the respondents attesting to the claim of tomato spoilage caused by Fungi and 37.5% disagreeing. Morphological studies reveal the fungal members which include members of the genus Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Fusarium, MucorPenicilliumand Rhizopus species. Species of Fusarium were seen to be the most occurring in all samples. Satistical analysis also concurred to the fact that fungi are responsible for spoilage of tomatoes purchached in Gwagwalada (p< 0.05). It implies that fungi are greatly responsible for tomato spoilage. Proper handling, transportation and thorough washing with clean or chlorinated water will go a long way in reducing the risk of tomato spoilage by Fungi.\n\nCHAPTER ONE 1.0                                \n\nINTRODUCTION  \n\nVegetables constitute commercially and nutritionally important indispensable food commodity. Vegetable naturally play a vital role in human nutrition by supplying the necessary growth factors such as vitamins and essential minerals in human daily diet and that can help to keep a good and normal health. Vegetables are widely distributed in nature. One of the limiting factors that influence the fruit economic value is the relatively short shelf-life period caused by pathogen’s attack (Droby, 2006: Zhu, 2006).\n\nTomato (Lycopersiconesculentum) pronounced Toh-MAH-to is the most important vegetable worldwide. Tomato is an annual plant which belongs to the Solanaceaefamily which includes other well-known species such as Potato, Tobacco, Pepper and Egg plants (aubergine) and can reach a height of over two meters. It’s a berry fruit, tomato is grown mainly in soil (Frazier and Westhoff,2004).\n\nTomato is essential mainly for its dietary needs and can be consumed in diverse ways. It can be cooked as vegetable, as an ingredient in many dishes and sauces; in the making of stew, fruit juices and can be eaten raw in salads(Masefield et al., 2002).\n\nThe modern day tomatowhich is a very popular fruitoriginated from South-Western Hemisphere, now the Peru-Euador area(Rick,2001).From here,it was distributed to many parts of tropical America. It possibly arrived the West African Ports via Portuguese traders or the Sudan (Tindall, 2004).\n\nTomato in West Africa is grown in gardens and irrigation schemes. In Nigeria, most tomatoes are grown in the northern parts of the country(Erinle,2007) and there is no record of any systematic or organized traditional storage method for vegetables and fruits. They are usually sold immediately after harvesting. They are packed in baskets, cardboard boxes, or wooden crates ready for transportation to the markets.\n\nTomato is the most perishable vegetable during handling, transportation and storage. This is because tomato contains large amount of water which makes them susceptible to spoilage by the action of microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria and protozoans (Ross, 1975). Estimates have shown that about one third of the produce is lost before reaching the consumer (Erinle, 2007), this loss has been attributed to a number of factors which include physical (mechanical breakage, bruises), physiological and also damages caused by pathological agents (Thompson and Kelly, 2000), market value of the tomato are mainly reduced by this factors.\n\nWatt and Merrill, (2000) defined spoiled food as that which have been damaged or injured so as to render it undesirable for human consumption. Various activities may result in food spoilage: insect activities,causing physical injuries for example, bruisingand enzyme activity by microorganism causes change in colour, taste, smell, texture and quality of the food.\n\nPauland Sarisbury, (1981)  also referred to spoilage as any change in the condition of food in which the food becomes less palatable or even toxic: these changes may be accompanied by alteration in taste, smell, appearance or texture.\n\nThe spoilage of food by microorganisms should not be viewed as a sinister plot on the part of the microbes deliberately to destroy foods but as a normal function of these organisms in the total ecology of all living organisms (Watt and Merrill, 2000). It has also been estimated by Watt and Merrill (2000) that 20% of all fruits and vegetables harvested for human consumption are lost through microbial spoilage causing one or more of 250 market diseases. Spoilage of fresh tomato usually occurs during storage and transit and also while waiting to be processed.\n\nFrazier and Westhoff,(2004) reported that fruits and vegetables after picking continue to respire and as a result heat is produced, this heat is known as ‘vital heat’, the amount which varies with particular amount of fruits and vegetables.\n\nVegetables that respire more thereby generating most heat are those that perish/spoil most rapidly (Wheeler, 2005). The resulting respiration of the fruits in addition to the normal ripening process complicates an independent discussion on microbiological spoilage of fruits in general and tomato in particular.\n\nFusarium oxysporium f.sp.lycoperisici andVerticilliumalbo-atrumare two fungi that cause similar wilt disease on tomato.(Nesmith etal.,1983). Fusarium is more common in replant fields and gardens while Verticilliumhas been destructive on greenhouse tomatoes and in commercial stake tomatoes. Verticillium wilt is more of a problem at cooler temperature while Fusarium wilt is considered a warm temperature disease. Both are favoured by wet conditions. \n\nAccording to Nesmithetal., (1983), both fungi are common inhabitants of Kentucky soils. These fungi attack the plant through the roots and grow up through the water-conducting vessels. FusariumandVerticilliummay be introduced to soils in several ways: Old crop residues, transplants, wind, water,implement-borne soils or mulches. These fungi become established readily in most soils and can remain in the soil for years. When susceptible tomatoes are planted, in infected soil, their roots are also subjected to attack by these fungi. Both diseases are much more serious when accompanied by root knot nematode. These problems can be controlled by using resistant tomato varieties and fumigating or stream sterilizing greenhouse soils.\n\n1.1     JUSTIFICATION\n\nSince microorganisms have been identified with the major cause of spoilage in fruits and vegetables due to their high water content, proper isolation and characterization of these organisms in tomatoes will greatly reduce the spoilage of this perishable fruit and as such producers and consumers will be able to protect their vegetables (tomato) and also identify spoiled tomatoes that have been attacked by fungi.\n\nWorks have been done on the isolation and identification of bacteria and fungi on fruits(Okoli, 1998). Little or no work has been done on the isolation and characterization fungi on spoiled tomatoes in Gwagwalada.Therefore, the major organisms responsible for field and market diseases will be majorly identified and checked.\n\n1.2     AIM AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThis research work is aimed at identifying the various fungi organisms associated with the spoilage of fresh tomatoes in Gwagwalada with the view of mapping out strategies to curtail these fungal attacks and also to determine the effects of the isolated fungi on the spoiled tomatoes.\n\nObjectives\n\nTo isolate of fungi organism from spoilt tomatoes in Gwagwalada. To characterize and identify of the fungi in spoilt tomatoes. To determine the prevalence and pathogenicity of fungal organisms. To create public health awareness about the preponderance of fungal organisms.\n\n1.3     LIMITATION OF STUDY\n\nResearches have been conducted to ascertain the fact that various microorganisms are responsible for the spoilage of tomatoes. Organisms include Bacteria, for example, Pseudomonas and Xanthomonasspeciesas stated by Watt and Merrill (2000), Fungi, for example, Alternaria, Colletotrichum ,Fusariumand Penicillium species as stated by Barksdale (2001) and other Meioidogyne groups of nematode.\n\nThis present study places emphasis on the spoilage of tomatoes in Gwagwalada Area Council caused by pathogenic fungi species. \n\n1.4     HYPOTHESIS\n\nH0:    Fungi are not responsible in the spoilage of tomatoes.\n\nHI:     Fungi are responsible in the spoilage of tomatoes.\n\n\n",

        "content": "EVALUATION OF PROXIMATE CONSTITUENTS IN LEAFS AND ROOT OF SIMAROUBA GLAUCA D.C. (PARADISE TREE)\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE \n\n1.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nPlants undergo photosynthesis and they constitute a primary resource of carbon, vitamins, minerals, protein, essential fatty acids, and utilizable energy for food production (Young and Pelett, 1994). Plants have played a significant role in maintaining health and improving the quality of human life for thousands of years. (Mishra, 2010).  They provide a major source of food and nourishment for man and animal.\n\nNutrition is a science of food and its relationship to health. Nutrition refers to the nourishment that sustains life. The study of nutrient requirements and the diet providing these requirements is also known as ‘nutrition’ (Chutani, 2008). Pike and Brown, 1984 defined it as “the science that interprets the relationship of food to the functioning of a living organism. It includes the uptake of food, the liberation of energy, elimination of wastes and all the processes of synthesis essential for maintenance, growth, and reproduction (Chutani, 2008).  Apart from maintaining normal body functioning, nutrition is important in fighting infections and in the recuperation of an ill person. Nutrition interacts with infections in a synergistic manner, such that recurrent infections lead to a loss of body nitrogen and worsen nutritional status; the resulting malnutrition, in its turn, produces a greater susceptibility to infection (Kurpad, 2005). Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) was the first to suggest that the composition of foods in the normal diet might contribute to health. \n\nIn 1897 literature on metabolic investigations, Atwater divided food composition into five classes; protein, fat carbohydrate, energy and water. However, today, the proximate composition is the term usually used to describe six components of food namely; moisture, crude protein, crude ash, crude fibre, crude fat and carbohydrate (nitrogen-free extract) which are all expressed in percentage (%) or gram per 100 grams (g/100g). The study of proximate analysis on foods was devised over a hundred years ago by two German scientists, Henneberg and Stohmann, and even though new techniques have been introduced, their system of proximate still forms the basis for the statutory declaration of the composition of foods. (Dublecz, 2011).\n\n1.2 MOISTURE CONTENT\n\nWater is essential for every living organism. In the human body, water content ranges from 50-70% in different tissues. It is present in different fluid compartments of the human body- Intracellular (fluid inside the cells) and extracellular. Plasma, interstitial fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, ocular fluid, lymph, peritoneal, pericardial, pleural and synovial fluids are part of the extracellular fluid (Chutani, 2008).  However, the moisture content of a feed is seldom of interest nutritionally as water is usually taken on its own.\n\nThe active ingredients from the view of feed nutrition are present in the part of dry matter (solid matter); therefore the level of moisture content is an important factor in both economy and storage.  At high temperature and humidity, the risk of putrefaction is predicted due to the proliferation of molds, etc., or self-digestion by enzymes in the feed when moisture in the feed is not less than about 15%.  As the assay for moisture in the feed measures loss on drying by heating at normal pressure as moisture, the result includes most of the volatile substances other than H2O.  Therefore, it may be more appropriate to be referred to as a volatile matter rather than moisture for accuracy.  Organic acids such as acetic acid and butyric acid in silage as well as ammonia and flavor components in feed materials are also vaporized and thus measured as moisture.  Because the content of these in most feed is extremely low, there has hardly been a need to consider their influence on the measured value. (Chutani, 2008). \n\n1.3 CARBOHYDRATES\n\nPhotosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy from the sun, into chemical energy that can be later released to fuel the organisms' activities. The light energy harnessed from the sun drives the reduction of carbon from CO2 to produce O2 and fixed carbon in form of carbohydrate.\n\nEarly in the twentieth century, it was mistakenly thought that light absorbed by photosynthetic pigments directly reduced CO2 which then combined with water to form carbohydrate. In fact, photosynthesis in plants is a two-stage process in which light energy is harnessed to oxidize H2O:\n\n                                 2H2O        →          O2 + 4 [H+]\n\nThe electrons thereby obtained subsequently reduce CO2:\n\n4H+ + CO2 → (CH2O)n + H2O\n\nThe two stages of photosynthesis are traditionally referred to as the light reactions and dark reactions:\n\nIn the light reactions, specialised pigment molecules capture light energy and are thereby oxidized. A series of electron- transfer reactions which culminate with the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH, generate ATP from ADP + Pi. The oxidized pigment molecules are reduced to H2O, thereby generating O2. The dark reactions use NADPH and ATP to reduce CO2 and incorporate it into the three-carbon precursors of carbohydrate.\n\nThe light reactions take place in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts in leaves and green parts of plants.  The inside of the thylakoid is referred to as the lumen. The light reactions are catalyzed by enzymes located in the thylakoid membrane, whereas the dark reactions take place in the stroma. The principal photoreceptor of light is chlorophyll. These chlorophyll molecules do not participate directly in photochemical reactions but function to act as light-harvesting antennas. The absorbed photons are transferred from molecule to molecule until it reaches the photosynthetic reaction center.\n\nIn the respiratory chain, electrons flow from NADH + H+ to O2, with the production of water and energy. However, in photosynthesis, electrons are taken up from the water and transferred to NADP+, with an expenditure of energy. Photosynthetic electron transport is therefore energetically “uphill work.” To make this possible, the transport is stimulated at two points by the absorption of light energy. This occurs through two photosystems protein complexes that contain large numbers of chlorophyll molecules and other pigments Another component of the transport chain is the cytochrome bf complex, an aggregate of integral membrane proteins that includes two cytochromes (b563 and f). Plastoquinone, which is comparable to ubiquinone, and two soluble proteins, the copper-containing plastocyanin and ferredoxin, function as mobile electron carriers. At the end of the chain, there is an enzyme that transfers the electrons to NADP+. Because photosystem II and the cytochrome b/f complex release protons from reduced plastoquinone into the lumen, photosynthetic electron transport establishes an electrochemical gradient across the thylakoid membrane, which is used for ATP synthesis by an ATP synthase.\n\nATP and NADPH + H+, which are both needed for the dark reactions, are formed in the stroma. (Voet et al., 2013).\n\n1.3aCalvin cycle\n\nThe actual CO2 fixation i.e., the incorporation of CO2 into an organic compound is catalyzed by ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (“rubisco”). Rubisco, the most abundant enzyme on Earth, converts ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, CO2 and water into two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate. These are then converted, via 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and 3-phosphoglycerate, into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. In this way, 1,2-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates are synthesized from six CO2. Two molecules of this intermediate are used by gluconeogenesis reactions to synthesize glucose 6-phosphate. From the remaining 10 molecules, six molecules of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate are regenerated, and the cycle then starts over again. In the Calvin cycle, ATP is required for phosphorylation of 3-phosphoglycerate and ribulose-5-phosphate. NADPH + H+, the second product of the light reaction, is consumed in the reduction of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate.\n\nCarbohydrates are the most abundant biomolecules produced on earth; photosynthetic plants and algae convert over 100 billion metric tons of CO2 and water into sugars, starches, and cellulose like substance. Carbohydrates supply energy for the human body to function. They are the most abundant bulk nutrients and form the major source of biological energy through their oxidation in the tissues. They also furnish organic precursors for the biosynthesis of many cell components. Carbohydrates are not essential in the human diet, but because carbohydrate-rich foods are abundant and cheap, compared with fats and protein, they naturally form a major part of the diet in most of the world. (Voet et al., 2013).\n\n1.4PROTEINS\n\nThe requirements for total protein, at various stages during the life cycle of humans, were reviewed and evaluated by a joint panel of the Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Health Organization, and the United Nations University (FAO/ WHO/UNO).\n\nThe requirement for dietary protein consists of two components:\n\n1)     the requirement for the nutritionally indispensable amino acids (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine) under all conditions and for conditionally indispensable amino acids (cysteine, tyrosine, taurine, glycine, arginine, glutamine, proline) under specific physiological and pathological conditions and\n\n2)    the requirement for nonspecific nitrogen for the synthesis of the nutritionally dispensable amino acids (aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid, alanine, serine) and other physiologically important nitrogen-containing compounds such as nucleic acids, creatine, and porphyrins.\n\nWith respect to the first component, it is usually accepted that the nutritive values of various food protein sources are to a large extent determined by the concentration and availability of the individual indispensable amino acids. Hence, the efficiency with which a given source of food protein is utilized in support of an adequate state of nutritional health depends both on the physiological requirements for the indispensable amino acids and total nitrogen and on the concentration of specific amino acids in the source of interest (Young and Pelett, 1994).\n\nProteins are synthesized from a complex series of steps that involves the transcription of DNA already present in each cell of an organism, and its consequent transcription into a polypeptide chain. This chain is modified by other inherent mechanisms in the cell to yield protein.",

These actions on the endocrine system have resulted in developmental deficits in various invertebrate and aquatic species (Crain et al., 2007; Elango et al., 2006) and mammals (Christopher et al., 2012). Exposures in adulthood have consequences but fetal and early life exposures appear to have more severe effects that persist through life (Rubin and Soto, 2009). Among these classes of chemicals are phytoestrogens that show effects suggestive of estrogenicity, such as binding to the estrogen receptors, induction of specific estrogen-responsive gene products, stimulation of estrogen receptor(s) and positive breast cancer cell growth (James et al., 2013). Through these interactions by acting as agonists or antagonists, EDCs are able to alter the activity of response elements of genes, block natural hormones from binding to their receptors, or in some cases increase the perceived amount of endogenous hormone in the body by acting as a hormone mimic to its receptor (Ze-hua et al., 2010). \n\nHibiscus sabdariffa Linn (Roselle) is an annual shrub commonly used to make jellies, jams, and beverages (Sirag et al., 2013). The brilliant red color of its calyx makes it a valuable food product, apart from its multitude of traditional medicinal uses (Sirag et al., 2013). Infusions of the calyces are considered as diuretic, choleric, febrifugal and hypotensive, decreasing the viscosity of the blood and stimulating intestinal peristalsis (Salleh et al., 2002). Roselle calyx extract is a good source of antioxidants from its anthocyanins and associated with antitumor and inhibitory effects on the growth of several cancer cells (Ajiboye et al., 2011).\n\nExtracts of H.sabdariffa calyces have been reported to be rich in phytoestrogens (Adigun et al., 2006; Orisakwe et al., 2004; Brian et al., 2009; Omotuyi et al., 2011) and some reports indicated that H.sabdariffa calyces have estrogenic effects, although exact estrogen-like ingredient is not determined (Ali et al., 1989).\n\nThis study was undertaken to determine to which extent H.sabdariffa calyces extract alters the basal levels of selected reproductive hormones: Follicle-stimulating hormone, testosterone, prolactin, estradiol, and luteinizing hormone as well as the histological features male Wistar rat testes.\n\n1.1     Literature Review\n\nH.sabdariffa L.\n\nHibiscus sabdariffa L. also known as roselle, is an ideal crop for developing countries as it is relatively easy to grow, can be grown as part of multi-cropping systems and can be used as food and fibre (Da-costa-Rocha et al., 2014). In China the seeds are used for their oil and the plant is used for its medicinal properties, while in West Africa the leaves and powdered seeds are used in meals (Da-costa-Rocha et al., 2014). Additionally, it is used in the pharmaceutical and food industries (Da-costa-Rocha et al., 2014).\n\nA limited number of reviews on H.sabdariffa have been conducted. Only one detailed review on the phytochemical, pharmacological and toxicological properties of H.sabdariffa ( Ali et al., 2005) and two more focused, later reviews are available: One on the effectiveness of H.sabdariffa in the treatment of hypertension ( Wahabi et al., 2010) and another on the treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia ( Hopkins et al., 2013).\n\n1.1.1. Botanical description\n\nThe genus Hibiscus (Malvaceae) includes more than 300 species of annual or perennial herbs, shrubs or trees (Wang et al., 2012). H.sabdariffa (syn.: Abelmoschus cruentus (Bertol.) Walp., Furcaria sabdariffa Ulbr., Hibiscus cruentus Bertol., Hibiscus fraternus L., Hibiscus palmatilobus Baill. and Sabdariffa rubra Kostel ( The Plant list, 2010) is commonly known as roselle, hibiscus, Jamaica sorrel or red sorrel (English) and in Arabic, karkadeh ( Ali et al., 2005 ; Ross, 2003). Its native distribution is uncertain, some believe that is from India or Saudi Arabia ( Ismail, Ikram, and Nazri, 2008), while Murdock ( Murdock, 1959) showed evidence that H.sabdariffa was domesticated by the black populations of western Sudan (Africa) sometime before 4000 BC. Nowadays, it is widely cultivated in both tropical and subtropical regions (Morton, 1987 and USDA, 2007) including India, Saudi Arabia, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, The Philippines, Vietnam, Sudan, Egypt, Nigeria and México (Chewonarin et al., 1999; Dung et al., 1999; Eslaminejad and Zakaria, 2011; Ismail et al., 2008; Mahran et al., 1979; Rao, 1996; Sharaf, 1962 and Yagoub Ael et al., 2004).\n\nThere are two main varieties of H.sabdariffa, the first being H.sabdariffa var. altissima Wester, cultivated for its jute-like fibre and the second is H.sabdariffa var. sabdariffa. The second variety includes shorter bushy forms, which have been described as races: bhagalpuriensi, intermedius, albus and ruber. The first variety has green, red-streaked, inedible calyces, while the second and third race have yellow-green edible calyces (var. ruber) and also yield fibre (Morton, 1987).\n\n1.1.1.2.Morphology\n\nH.sabdariffa var. sabdariffa ruber is an annual, erect, bushy, herbaceous subshrub that can grow up to 8 ft (2.4 m) tall, with smooth or nearly smooth, cylindrical, typically red stems. The leaves are alternate, 3 to 5 in (7.5–12.5 cm) long, green with reddish veins and long or short petioles. The leaves of young seedlings and upper leaves of older plants are simple; lower leaves are deeply 3 to 5 or even 7 lobed; the margins are toothed. Flowers, borne singly in the leaf axils, are up to 5 in (12.5 cm) wide, yellow or buff with a rose or maroon eye, and turn pink as they wither at the end of the day. At this time, the typically red calyx, consisting of 5 large sepals with a collar (epicalyx) of 8 to 12 slim, pointed bracts (or bracteoles) around the base, begins to enlarge, becomes fleshy, crisp but juicy, 1 1/4 to 2 1/4 in (3.2–5.7 cm) long and fully encloses the velvety capsule, 1/2 to 3/4 in (1.25–2 cm) long, which is green when immature, 5-valved, with each valve containing 3 to 4 kidney-shaped, light-brown seeds, 1/8 to 3/16 in (3–5 mm) long and minutely downy. The capsule turns brown and splits open when mature and dry. The calyx, stems, and leaves are acid and closely resemble the cranberry (Vaccinium spp.) in flavor (Morton, 1987; Ross, 2003).",

Dennettiatripetalaalso known as pepper fruit tree is a well-known Nigerian spicy medicinal plant.  It is found in the tropical rainforest region of Nigeria and sometimes in Savanna areas (Okwu et al., 2005).  It is locally called “Nkarika” by the Efiks of Calabar.  The young leaves and fruits have distinctive spicy taste.  The mature fruits constitute the main edible portions.  Some communities in parts of Southern Nigeria also utilize the leaves and roots, in addition to the fruits for medicinal purpose. Dennettiatripetalahas been found tocontain lots of minerals, vitamins, alkaloids and trace elements which are of medicinal importance. It was also indicated that the rich presence of essential oil (oleoresins) determines the aromatic flavoring, coloring and pungent properties of pepper fruits. (Nwaoguet al., 2007) investigated phytochemical content of  Dennettiatripetala and detected the presence of saponins, flavonoids, tannins and cyanogenic  glycosides. The intake of flavonoids in any fruit and vegetable tends to decrease cancer risk (Neuhouser, 2004; Grafet al., 2005). Flavonoid contributes to the color of plants, their fruits and flowers. The use of medicinal plants in traditional medicine is not intended in any way to replace modern medical science but rather an aid in conventional therapy (Ben-Eric, 2002).\n\nCarbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is an industrial chemical that does not occur naturally. Most of the carbon tetrachloride produced is used in the production of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other chlorinated hydrocarbons. It was once used widely as a solvent, cleaner and degreaser, both for industrial and home use. Today, the scientific database on the effects of haloalkanes is so vast that it is no longer employed for such purposes although it is used as a model of experimental liver injury (Weber et al., 2003). \n\n      CCl4 is a well-known  hepato- and nephrotoxicant (Thrall et al., 2000; Ogeturket al., 2005), and proves highly useful as an experimental model for the study of certain hepatotoxic effects (Muriel et al., 2003; Moreno and Muriel, 2006). CCl4-induced toxicity, depending on dose and duration of exposure, covers a variety of effects. At low doses, transient effects prevail, such as loss of Ca2+ homeostasis, lipid peroxidation, release of noxious or beneficial cytokines (Kyung-Hyun et al., 2006; Muriel, 2007) and apoptotic events followed by regeneration. Other effects, with higher doses or longer exposure, are more serious and develop over a long period of time, such as fatty degeneration, fibrosis, cirrhosis and even cancer (Weber et al., 2003). In addition, acute intoxication with CCl4 at high doses, when the hepatocellular necrosis exceeds the regenerative capacity of the liver, fatal liver failure will ensue. Extreme doses of CCl4 result in nonspecific solvent toxicity, including central nervous system depression and respiratory failure and death.\n\nThis study aims at investigating the effect of ethanol extract of Dennettiatripetalaon liver and kidney antioxidant enzyme activity and malondialdehyde concentration of rats exposed to CCl4.\n\n1.1 LITERATURE REVIEW\n\n1.1.0 THE LIVER\n\n        The liver is the largest organ of the human body weighing approximately 1500 g, and is located in the upper right corner of the abdomen on top of the stomach, right kidney and intestines and beneath the diaphragm. The liver performs more than 500 vital metabolic functions (Naruseet al., 2007). It is involved in the synthesis of products like glucose derived from glycogenesis, plasma proteins, clotting factors and urea that are released into the bloodstream. It regulates blood levels of amino acids.\n\n            Liver parenchyma serves as a storage organ for several products like glycogen, fat and fat soluble vitamins. It is also involved in the production of a substance called bile that is excreted to the intestinal tract. Bile aids in the removal of toxic substances and serves as a filter that separates out harmful substances from the bloodstream and excretes them (Saukonenet al., 2006).  An excess of chemicals hinders the production of bile thus leading to the body’s inability to flush out the chemicals through waste.\n\n          Smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the liver is the principal ‘metabolic clearing house’ for both endogenous chemicals like cholesterol, steroid hormones, fatty acids and proteins, and exogenous substances like drugs and alcohol. The central role played by liver in the clearance and transformation of chemicals exposes it to toxic injury (Saukonenet al., 2006). \n\n1.1.0.1 FUNCTIONS OF THE LIVER\n\nThe liver has three main functions: storage, metabolism, and biosynthesis. Glucose is converted to glycogen and stored; when needed for energy, it is converted back to glucose. Cholesterol uptake also occurs in the liver. Fat, fat-soluble vitamins and other nutrients are also stored in the liver. Fatty acids are metabolized and converted to lipids, which are then conjugated with proteins synthesized in the liver and released into blood stream as lipoproteins. Numerous functional proteins such as, enzymes and blood-coagulating factors are also synthesized by the liver. In addition, the liver, which contains numerous xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, is the main site of xenobiotic metabolism (Hogson and Levi, 2004).\n\n1.1.0.2BIOTRANSFORMATION OF HEPATOTOXICANTS\n\nLiver plays a central role in biotransformation and disposal of xenobiotics.\n\nThe close association of liver with the small intestine and the systemic circulation enables it to maximize the processing of absorbed nutrients and minimize exposure of the body to toxins and foreign chemicals. The liver may be exposed to large concentrations of exogenous substances and their metabolites. Metabolism of exogenous compounds can modulate the properties of hepatotoxicant by either increasing its toxicity (toxication or metabolic activation) or decreasing its toxicity (detoxification).\n\nMost of the foreign substances are lipophilic thus enabling them to cross the membranes of intestinal cells. They are rendered more hydrophilic by biochemical processes in the hepatocyte, yielding water-soluble products that are exported into plasma or bile by transport proteins located on the hepatocyte membrane and subsequently excreted by the kidney or gastrointestinal tract (Totsmannet al., 2008).\n\nThe hepatic biotransformation involves Phase I and Phase II reactions. Phase I involves oxidative, reductive, hydroxylation and demethylation pathways, primarily by way of the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system located in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is the most important family of metabolizing enzymes in the liver. The endoplasmic reticulum also contains a NADPH-dependent mixed function oxidase system, the flavin-containing monooxygenases, which oxidizes amines and sulphur compounds.\n\nPhase I reactions often produce toxic intermediates which are rendered non-toxic by phase II reactions. Phase II reactions involve the conjugation of chemicals with hydrophilic moieties such as glucuronide, sulfate or amino acids and lead to the formation of more water-soluble metabolite which can be excreted easily. Another Phase II reaction involves glutathione which can covalently bind to toxic intermediates by glutathione-S- transferase.  As a result, these reactions are usually considered detoxification pathways. However, this phase can also lead to the formation of unstable precursors to reactive species that can cause hepatotoxicity.\n\nThe activities of enzymes are influenced by various endogenous factors and exogenous drugs or chemicals (Lee and Boyer, 2000). Many substances can influence the cytochrome P450 enzyme mechanism. Such substances can serve either as inhibitors or inducers. Enzyme inhibitors act immediately by blocking the metabolic activity of one or several cytochrome P450 enzymes. Enzyme inducers act slowly and increase cytochrome P450 activity by increasing its synthesis (Lynch and Price, 2007).\n\n1.2 KIDNEY\n\n  The kidneys are bean-shaped organs that serve several essential regulatory roles in vertebrates. They remove excess organic molecules from the blood and their best known function is the removal of waste products of metabolism. They serve homeostatic functions such as the regulation of electrolytes, maintenance of acid-base balance, and regulation of blood pressure (via maintaining the salt and water balance). In producing urine, the kidneys excrete wastes such as urea and ammonium. They are responsible for the reabsorption of water, glucose, and amino acids. They also produce hormones like calcitriol and erythropoietin.\n\n1.2.1    FUNCTIONS OF THE KIDNEY\n\nMany of the kidney’s functions are accomplished by relatively simple mechanisms of filtration, reabsorption, and secretion, which take place in the nephron. Filtration, which takes place at the renal corpuscle, is the process by which cells and large proteins are filtered from the blood to make an ultrafiltrate that eventually becomes urine. The kidney generates 180 litres of filtrate a day, while reabsorbing a large percentage allowing for the generation of only approximately 2 litres of urine. Reabsorption is the transport of molecules from this ultrafiltrate into the blood. Secretion is the reverse process, in which molecules are transported in the opposite direction, from blood to the urine.(Bard et al., 2003).\n\n1.2.1.0 Excretion of wastes\n\nThe kidneys excrete a variety of waste products produced by metabolism into the urine. These include the nitrogenous wastes urea, from protein catabolism, and uric acid, from nucleic acid metabolism. The ability of mammals and some birds to concentrate wastes into a volume of urine much smaller than the volume of blood from which the wastes were extracted is dependent on an elaborate countercurrent multiplication mechanism. This requires several independent nephron characteristics to operate: a tight hairpin configuration of the tubules, water and ion permeability in the descending limb of the loop, water impermeability in the ascending loop, and active ion transport out of most of the ascending limb. In addition, passive countercurrent exchange by the vessels carrying the blood supply to the nephron is essential for enabling this function.\n\n1.2.1.1 Reabsorption of the vital nutrients\n\nGlucose at normal plasma levels is completely reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. The mechanism for this is the Na+/glucose cotransporter. A plasma level of 350mg/dL will fully saturate the transporters and glucose will be lost in the urine. A plasma glucose level of approximately 160 is sufficient to allow glucosuria, which is an important clinical clue to diabetes mellitus.\n\nAmino acids are reabsorbed by sodium dependent transporters in the proximal tubule. Hartnup disease is a deficiency of the tryptophan amino acid transporter which results in pellagra (Le Tao, 2013)\n\n1.2.1.2 Acid-base homeostasis\n\nTwo organ systems, the kidneys and lungs, maintain acid base homeostasis, which is the maintenance of pH around a relatively stable value. The lungs contribute to acid-base homeostasis by regulating carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. The kidneys have two very important roles in maintaining the acid-base balance: to reabsorb and regenerate bicarbonate from urine, and to excrete hydrogen ions and fixed acids (anions of acids) into urine (Seldinet al., 1989).\n\n1.2.1.3 Osmolality regulation\n\n Any significant rise in plasma osmolality is detected by the hypothalamus, which communicates directly with the posterior pituitary gland. An increase in osmolality causes the gland to secrete antidiuretic hormone (ADH), resulting in water reabsorption by the kidney and an increase in urine concentration. The two factors work together to return the plasma osmolality to its normal levels.\n\nADH binds to principal cells in the collecting duct that translocate aquaporins to the membrane, allowing water to leave the normally impermeable membrane and be reabsorbed into the body by the vasa recta, thus increasing the plasma volume of the body.\n\nThere are two systems that create a hyperosmotic medulla and thus increase the body plasma volume: urea recycling and the ‘single effect’.\n\nUrea is usually excreted as a waste product from the kidneys. However, when plasma blood volume is low and ADH is released the aquaporinsthat are opened are also permeable to urea. This allows urea to leave the collecting duct into the medulla creating a hyperosmotic solution that attracts water. Urea can then re-enter the nephron and be excreted or recycled again depending on whether ADH is still present or not. The ‘single effect’ describes the fact that the ascending thick limb of the loop of henle is not permeable to water but is permeable to NaCl. This allows for a countercurrent exchange system whereby the medulla becomes increasingly concentrated, but at the same time setting up an osmotic gradient for water to follow should the aquaporins of the collecting duct be opened by ADH (Vander, 1985).\n\n1.2.1.4 Blood pressure regulation\n\nAlthough the kidney cannot directly sense blood, long term regulation of blood pressure predominantly depends upon the kidney. This primarily occurs through maintenance of the extracellular fluid compartment, the size of which depends on the plasma sodium concentration. Renin is the first in the series of important chemical messengers that make up the renin-angiotensin system. Changes in rennin ultimately alter the output of this system, principally the hormones angotensin II and aldostrone. Each hormone acts via multiple mechanisms, but both increase the kidney’s absorption of sodium chloride, thereby expanding the extracellular fluid compartment, and an increase in blood pressure. Conversely, when rennin levels are low, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels decrease, contracting the extracellular fluid compartment, and an increase in blood pressure. Conversely, when rennin levels are low, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels decrease, contracting the extracellular fluid compartment, and decreasing blood pressure.\n\n1.2.1.5 Hormone secretion\n\nThe kidneys secrete a variety of hormones, including erythropoietin, and the enzyme rennin. Erythropoietin is released in response to hypoxia (low levels of oxygen at tissue level) in the renal circulation. It stimulates erythropoiesis (production of red blood cells) in the bone marrow. Calcitriol, the activated form of vitamin D, promotes intestinal absorption of calcium and the renal reabsorption of phosphate. Part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, renin is an enzyme involved in the regulation of aldosterone levels (Valtin, 1983).\n\n1.3 HEPATOTOXICITY\n\n         Hepatotoxicity refers to liver dysfunction or liver damage that is associated with an overload of drugs or xenobiotics(Navaroet al., 2006). The chemicals that cause liver injury are called hepatotoxins or hepatotoxicants. Hepatotoxicants are exogenous compounds of clinical relevance and may include overdoses of certain medicinal drugs, industrial chemicals, natural chemicals like microcystins, herbal remedies and dietary supplements (Willett et al., 2004).\n\n         Certain drugs may cause liver injury when introduced even within the therapeutic ranges. Hepatotoxicity may result not only from direct toxicity of the primary compound but also from a reactive metabolite or from an immunologically-mediated response affecting hepatocytes, biliary epithelial cells and/or liver vasculature (Saukkonenet al., 2006).\n\n           The hepatotoxic response elicited by a chemical agent depends on the concentration of the toxicant which may be either parent compound or toxic metabolite, differential expression of enzymes and concentration gradient of cofactors in blood across the acinus.  Hepatotoxic response is expressed in the form of characteristic patterns of cytolethality in specific zones of the acinus.\n\n\n",

        "content": "A CRITICAL STUDY ON ENZYMES\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW\n\n1.1 Enzyme\n\nEnzymes are large biological molecules responsible for thousands of chemical inter-conversions that sustain life (Smith, 1997). All known enzymes are proteins. They are high molecular weight compounds made up principally of chains of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds, they are denatured at high temperature and precipitated with salts, solvents and other reagents. They have molecular weights ranging from 10,000 to 2,000,000 units. Enzymes do not cause reactions to take place, but rather they enhance the rate of reactions that would have been slower without their presence and still remains unused and unchanged.\n\nMany enzymes require the presence of other compounds - cofactors - before their catalytic activity can be exerted. This entire active complex is referred to as the holoenzyme; i.e. apoenzyme (protein portion) plus the cofactor (coenzyme, prosthetic group or metal-inactivator) is called the holoenzyme (Alexopoulos et al., 1996)\n\nThe living cell is the site of tremendous biochemical activity called metabolism. It is the process of chemical and physical change which goes on continually in the living organism involving the build-up of new tissues, replacement of old tissue, conversion of food to energy, disposal of waste materials, reproduction - all the activities that we characterize as \"life.\"The phenomenon of enzyme catalysis makes possible biochemical reactions necessary for all life processes. Catalysis is defined as the acceleration of a chemical reaction by some substance which itself undergoes no permanent chemical change. Synthetic molecules called artificial enzymes also display enzyme like catalysis (Grovesm, 1997).\n\nThe catalysts of biochemical reactions are enzymes and are responsible for bringing about almost all of the chemical reactions in living organisms. Without enzymes, these reactions take place at a rate far too slow for the pace of metabolism(Bairoch, 2000).\n\nEnzymes actually work by lowering the activation energy of a reaction. This is achieved when it creates an alternative pathway which is faster for the reaction hence speeding it up such that products are formed faster. Enzyme catalysed reactions are million times faster than uncatalysed reactions, they alter the rates but not the equilibrium constant of the reaction being catalysed (Ashokkumar et al., 2001). A few RNA molecules called ribozymes also catalyse reactions, with an important example being some parts of ribosome (Lilley, 2005).\n\n1.1.1 Types of enzymes\n\nMetabolic enzymes: These have been called the spark of life, the energy of life and the vitality of life. These descriptions are not without merit. Metabolic enzymes catalyse and regulate every biochemical reaction that occurs within the human body, making them essential to cellular function and health (Sangeethaet al.,2005). Digestive enzymes turn the food we eat into energy and unlock this energy for use in the body. Our bodies naturally produce both digestive and metabolic enzymes as they are needed. They either speed up or slow down the chemical reactions within the cells for detoxification and energy production. The enable us to see, hear, and move and think. Every organ, every tissue and all 100 trillion cells in our body depend upon the reaction of metabolic enzymes and enjoy their energy factor. Without these metabolic enzymes, cellular life would be impossible.\n\nFood enzymes:These are introduced to the body through the raw foods we eat and through consumption of supplemental enzyme products. Raw foods naturally contain enzymes providing a source of digestive enzymes when ingested(Hossainet al., 1984). However, raw food manifests only enough enzymes to digest that particular food, not enough to be stored in the body for later use (the exceptions being pineapple and papaya, the sources of the enzymes bromelain and papain). The cooking and processing of food destroys all of its enzymes. Since most of the foods we eat are cooked or processed in some way and since the raw foods we do eat contain only enough enzymes to process that particular food (Persike et al., 2002) our bodies must produce the majority of the digestive enzymes were quire unless we use supplemental enzymes to aid in the digestive process. A variety of supplemental enzymes are available through different sources. It is important to understand the differences between the enzyme types and ensure that one is using an enzyme product which will meet one’s particular needs.\n\nPlant based enzymes:These are the most popular choice of enzymes. They are grown in a laboratory setting and extracted from Aspergillus species. The enzymes harvested from Aspergillusspecies are called plant based, microbial and fungal. Of all the choices, plant-based enzymes are the most active. This means they can break down more fat, protein and carbohydrates in the broadest pH range than any other sources (Ashokkumar et al., 2001).\n\n1.1.2    Characteristics of enzymes\n\nProtein nature:Enzyme is a protein. The main components of an enzyme is protein.\n\nTemperature:Enzymes are sensitive to temperature. Many work best at temperatures close to body temperatures and most lose their ability to catalyse if they are heated above 60 or 70o C. (Ashokkumar et al., 2001).\n\nAcidity and alkalinity:Many enzymes work best at a particular pH and stop working if the pH becomes too acidic or alkaline. \n\nCatalytic effect:It acts as catalyst, enzyme functions in accelerating chemical reaction, but the enzyme itself does not change after the reaction ends. \n\nSpecificity:It functions specifically. The enzyme only catalyzes one kind of substrate and cannot function for many substrates. The term is called one enzyme one substrate. \n\nReversibility: It means the enzyme does not determine the direction of reaction, but it only functions in accelerating reaction rate until it reaches equilibrium. The enzyme also functions in substance synthesis and substance breaking down reaction. \n\nSmall quantity:It is required, in small amount. A small amount of enzyme is able to catalyze a chemical reaction (Nason, 1968).\n\n\n",

It accounts for 60% of all cancer world wide (Melissa 2004). The most significance cause is the presence of cirrhosis. HCC has unique geographic sex, age distribution that are likely determined by specific actiology factor. It’s distribution also varies  among ethnic group within the same country (Munoz 1989). A high incidence of hepatitis B and C may have been an important factor contributing to the development of liver disease (HCC and Cirrhosis) in south eastern Nigeria. However, a recent trend that reveals an increase in cases of liver cirrhosis and hepatitis in our environment suggests that there could be other contributory factors peculiar to our environment besides hepatitis B and C which could be a possible explanation to the recent trend. In so doing, it would be necessary to look into the various predisposing/causative factors of chronic hepatitis which could lead to increased cases of liver cirrhosis and HCC in our environment. The risk of developing HCC differs depending on the cause of cirrhosis. For example, cirrhosis due to hepatitis B has a high risk of leading to HCC while the risk of HCC in people with primary biliary cirrhosis, although present is very low. All these human hepatitis viruses are RNA viruses except for hepatitis B virus, which is a DNA virus. Although these viruses can be distinguished by their molecular and antigenic properties, all types of viral hepatitis produce clinically similar illnesses. These range from asymptomatic and unapparent to fulminant and fatal acute infections common to all types, on one hand, and from subclinical persistent infections to rapidly progressive liver disease with cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), common to the blood-borne types (HBV and HCV). Without specific virological test, it is not possible to determine which hepatitis virus is responsible for a case of hepatitis. (Kathleen park et al., 2004). \n\n\n",

There are two major forms of diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes   develops when the pancreas does not produce insulin. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body cell resist insulin’s effect (Microsoft Encarta, 2009). This condition leads to elevated levels of blood glucose. The normal range of blood glucose level for blood glucose level is between 70-110mg/dl. Insulin is a hormone that helps to maintain normal blood glucose level by making the body’s cell absorbs glucose (sugar) so that it can be as a source of energy. In people with diabetes glucose levels build up in the blood and urine causing excessive urination, thirst, hunger and problems with fats and protein metabolism because the body cannot convert glucose into energy, it begins to  break down stored fats for fuel. This produces increasing amounts of acidic compounds in the blood called ketone bodies which interfere with cellular respiration energy producing process in cells. Alloxan induces diabetes mellitus in rats. Alloxan, a beta cytotoxin, induces diabetes in a wide variety of animal species through damage of insulin secreting cell. In these animals, with characteristic similar to type 1 diabetes in humans. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia are common complications of diabetes mellitus.     (Rerup, C. C. 1999). Senna tora (originally described by Linne as cassia tora) is a legume in the subfamily caesalpiniodeae. It grows wild in most of the tropics and is considered a weed in many places. Its native range is not well known but probably South Asia. It is often confused with Chinese senna or sickle pods obtusifolia. If it is given a distinct common name at all, it is called sickle wild sensitive plant (nature serve, 200). It has a widely ranging tropical and the agro climatic conditions, which are conducive for introducing and domesticating new and exotic plant varieties. The use of the plants, plant extracts and pure compounds isolated from natural sources provided the foundation to modern pharmaceutical compounds. An ethno botanical search on fine species senna within and around Ogbomoso, Oyo state, Nigeria showed their relevance in the local herbal medicine. In the recent study, screening for hypoglycemic activity of the extract of senna tora was conducted to provide support for the use of this plant as traditional medicine. Phytochemical screening provides knowledge of the chemical constituents of this not only for the discovery of new therapeutic agents, but also for information in discovering new sources of other materials. The uses of senna tora include the following, used as liver stimulant, mild laxative, heart tonic, used in treatment of fever, used to treat eczema and dermatomycosis, etc.  \n\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE RESEARCH\n\nTherefore the goal of the study is to:\n\n To determining the blood glucose levels of normal and Alloxan induced diabetic rats.   \n\nTo determine the effects of senna tora leaves extract on the blood glucose levels of the diabetic albino rats.\n\nTo compare values before and after induction with Alloxan and senna tora leaves.",

UTILIS SEED OIL\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE   \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn our world today, the geometric increase of the population has raised alarming concerns on the food security to sustain the teeming population (Sridhar, 2007). The worse hit is developing countries in Africa, especially Nigeria that still lacks the capacity to manage food production tasks arising from the current global warming and other environmental changes. The few food products usually lack adequate proteins, essential fatty acids and vitamins leading to the common form of malnutrition in individuals. Interestingly, unconventional legumes are promising in terms of nutrition, provisions of food security, agricultural development and in crop rotation in developing countries (Sridhar, 2007). The wild legume varieties have different quantities of protein, carbohydrates, fiber, lipid/fatty acids and minerals. Mucuna pruriens var.utilis is a tropical legume of the family Fabaceae and genus Mucuna. Some of its common names are Agbara (Igbo), Yerepe (Yoruba), Mauritius bean, cow itch, cow hage, Jackbohne (German). Velvet bean is an annual perennial, herbaceous, vigorous climbing vine that growso 3-18cm in height. It is indigenous of the tropical regions especially Africa, India and the West Indies. Its pods are sigmoid, turgid, longitudinally ribbed and always clustered on the stem and the pods are covered with reddish-orange hairs that dislodge readily causing intense irritation on the skin. The pods contain seeds that are black or white (Siddhuraju, 2000; Leslie, 2005; Sridhar, 2007). The oil contents of Mucuna seed may be edible and consist of different fatty acid which is a characteristic identify of most oil seeds. The chemical composition of an oil extract gives a qualitative identification of such oil in selection of areas while it can be applied or utilized despite differences in processing and extraction of the oil (Ofoegbu, - 2006).\n\n          The aim of this work thus is to extract the oil from the white seeds of Mucuna pruriens var. utilis, characterize it and determine the applicability, based on the quantities, in industries such beverage, pharmaceutical and/or soap manufacturing.\n\nOBJECTIVE OF STUDY\n\nThis work was inspired by the need to find alternative sources of good oils for human utilization in industries.\n\nSCOPE OF WORK\n\nThis work is intended:\n\n(1)     To determine the percentage of oil content of white seeds of Mucuna pruriens var.utilis\n\n(2)     To determine the moisture contents of the seeds used\n\n(3)     To characterize, by obtaining the physio-chemical properties of the oil\n\n(4)     To suggest possible industry the oil can be utilized based on the results and the information provided in literature on oils.

        "content": "ANTIBACTERIAL EVALUATION OF AFANG LEAF EXTRACT AND ITS SYNTHESIZED SILVER NANOPARTICLES\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE \n\nINTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW\n\n1.0     INTRODUCTION  \n\nNanoscience has been the subject of substantial research in recent years. It has been explored by researchers in various fields of science and technology (Kholoud et al. 2010). The novel properties of NPs have been exploited in a wide range of potential applications such as in medicine, cosmetics, renewable energies, environmental remediation, biomedical devices (Quang Huy, 2013), electronics, optics, organic catalysis, vector control, sensor, etc., have drawn extensive attention to this field of study (Mousavand et al. 2007). Among the metals, silver nanoparticles have shown potential applications in various fields such as the environment, bio-medicine, catalysis, optics and electronics (Rao et al., 2000). Silver nanoparticles are mostly smaller than 100 nm and consist of about 20–15,000 silver atoms. In its nanoscale form, silver exhibits unique physicochemical and biological activities. This has made them useful as a sensor, vector control, antimicrobial, anticancer, and antiplasmodial agents, catalysts, among others (Elemike et al. 2014; Vinod et al. 2014; Kathiravan et al. 2014; Saraschandra and Sivakumar 2014; Namita and Soam 2014).\n\nConcerted effort has been made to synthesize diverse range of silver nanoparticles varying in size, geometry, and morphology because of their potential applications, particularly in electronics (P. V. Kamat, 2002), electrochemical sensing (L. M. Liz-Marzán, 2006), catalysis (F. Zhang, Y. Pi et al., 2007), and antimicrobial properties (T. Sakai et al., 2006). The size, geometry, dispersion, and stability often determine the suitability of the nanoparticles for certain applications. Synthesis may involve physical means such as ultraviolet light, microwaves, photo-reduction, or chemical reduction using hydrazine, ascorbic acid, sodium borohydride, glucose, and organic stabilizers or biological means using plant extract, microorganism or plant sap. Several physical and chemical methods have been used to synthesize and stabilize silver nanoparticles (Senapati et al., 2005, Klaus-Joerger et al., 2001). The most popular chemical approaches, including chemical reduction using a variety of organic and inorganic reducing agents, electrochemical techniques, physicochemical reduction, and radiolysis are widely used for the synthesis of nanoparticles.\n\nAlthough these means are fast and easy, they are either expensive or toxic particularly the chemical method and may lead to non-eco-friendly byproducts thus the need for environmental, nontoxic synthetic protocols for nanoparticle synthesis. In the global efforts to reduce generated hazardous waste, “green” chemistry and chemical processes are progressively integrating with modern development in science and industry (Sharma et al., 2009) leading to the developing interest in biological approaches which are free from the use of toxic chemicals as by products.  Biological methods can be used to synthesize nanoparticles without the use of any harsh, toxic and expensive chemical substances. The bioreduction of metal ions by combinations of biomolecules found in the extracts of certain organisms (e.g., enzymes/proteins, yeast, fungi, bacteria, and plants) is environmentally benign, yet chemically complex (Ankamwar et al., 2005). It has been elucidated that biomolecules with carbonyl, hydroxyl, and amine functional groups have the potential for metal ion reduction and capping of the newly formed particles during their growth processes (Harekrishna et al., 2009, He et al., 2007). Biomolecules in plants and spices extract are essential oils (terpenes, eugenols, e.t.c.), polyphenols, carbohydrates, e.t.c. and can reduce and stabilize Ag+ to Ag0. It provides advancement over chemical and physical methods as it is cost-effective and environment-friendly.\n\n1.1     LITERATURE REVIEW\n\nDisease-causing microbes are becoming resistant to drug therapy and therefore poses great public health problem. Many researchers are now engaged in developing new effective antimicrobial reagents with the emergence and increase of microbial organisms resistant to multiple antibiotics, which will increase the cost of health care. Colloidal silver has been known for a long time to possess antimicrobial properties and also to be non-toxic and environmentally friendly. It has been used for years in the medical field for antimicrobial applications such as burn treatment (Parikh et al. 2005; Ulkur et al 2005), elimination of microorganisms on textile fabrics (Jeong et al. 2005; Lee et al. 2007; Yuranova et al. 2003), disinfection in water treatment (Russell and Hugo 1994; Chou et al. 2005), prevention of bacteria colonization on catheters (Samuel and Guggenbichler 2004; Alt et al. 2004; Rupp et al. 2004), etc. It has also been found to prevent HIV from binding to host cells (Sun et al. 2005). The mechanism of the bacterial effect of AgNP as proposed is due to the attachment of AgNPs to the surface of the cell membrane, thus disrupting permeability and respiration functions of the cell (Kevitec et al. 2008). It is also proposed that AgNPs not only interact with the surface of a membrane but can also penetrate inside the bacteria (Morones et al. 2005), but the effects of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) on microorganisms have not been developed fully. Researchers believe that the potential of colloidal silver is just beginning to be discovered (Dorjnamjin et al., 2008).\n\n1.2     Nanotechnology\n\nNanoparticles are viewed as the fundamental building blocks of nanotechnology (Mansoori et al., 2005). They are the starting points for preparing many nanostructured materials and devices and their synthesis is an important component of the rapidly growing research efforts in nanoscience and nanoengineering (Mansoori et al., 2007).\n\nIn nanotechnology, a nanoparticle is defined as a small object that behaves as a whole unit in terms of its transport and properties. Nanoparticles can equally be called ultrafine particles since their sizes range from 1 to 100 nm. Fine particles range from 100 to 2,500 nm, while coarse particles are sized between 2,500 and 10,000 nm (Williams, 2008). A nanometer is one billionth of a meter (10-9 m), roughly the width of three or four atoms, smaller than the wavelength of visible light and a hundred-thousand the width of human hair.\n\nNanoparticles can be made of materials of diverse chemical nature, the most common being metals, metal oxides,  silicates, non-oxide ceramics,  polymers,  organics, carbon, and biomolecules.  Nanoparticles exist in several different morphologies such as spheres, cylinders, platelets, tubes, flowers, cubes, etc. They possess unique physicochemical, optical and biological properties that can be manipulated to suit the desired application. Nanoparticles are of great interest due to their externally small size, and large surface to volume ratio. They exihibit utterly novel characteristics compared to the large particles of the bulk material and have been included in fields of science as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry molecular biology, semi conductor physics, microfabrication, material science, inorganic chemistry and so on.\n\nThe concepts that seeded nanotechnology were first discussed in 1959 by renowned physicist Richard Feynman in his talk “There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom”, in which he described the possibility of synthesis via direct manipulation of atoms. In 1974, “Norio Taniguchi now used the word nanotechnology to describe precision manufacturing materials at the nanometer level which refers to the synthesis, manipulation, and control of matter at nano dimensions that will make most products lighter, stronger, cleaner, less expensive and more precise.\n\n1.3     Physiochemical Properties of Nanoparticles\n\nNanoparticles also often possess unexpected optical properties as they are small enough to confine their electrons and produce quantum effects e.g. gold nanoparticles appear deep red in dark solutions.\n\nA unique property among nanoparticles is quantum confinement in semiconductor particles, surface plasmon resonance in some metal particles and super paramagnetism in magnetic materials. For example, ferroelectric materials smaller than 10 nm can switch their magnetization direction using room temperature thermal energy. Thus this property is not always desired in nanoparticles thus making them unsuitable for memory storage.\n\nSuspensions of nanoparticles are possible since the interaction of the particle surface with the solvent is strong enough to overcome density differences, which otherwise usually result in a material either sinking or floating in a liquid.\n\nThe high surface area to volume ratio of nanoparticles provides a tremendous driving force for diffusion, especially at elevated temperatures. Sintering can take place at lower temperatures, over shorter time scales than for larger particles.\n\n1.4     Methods of Nanoparticles Synthesis\n\nCurrently, many methods have been reported for the synthesis of nanoparticles which include chemical, physical, biological and photo-induced approaches.\n\n1.4.1    Chemical Approach:\n\nThe chemical approach is the most used method since it for provides an easy way to synthesize nanoparticles in solution. This consists of the chemical reduction of metal salt in solution followed by the crystallization of zero-valence metal particles. The particle synthesis is usually conducted in the presence of a stabilizing agent that prevents excessive molecular growth and/or aggregation of the metal nanoparticles. Hence when nanoparticles are produced by chemical synthesis, three main components are needed: a salt (e.g. AgNO3), a reducing agent (e.g. ethylene glycol) and a stabilizer agent (e.g. PVP) to control the growth of the nanoparticles and prevent them from aggregating.\n\nIn one study, Oliveira and coworkers (2005) prepared dodecanethiol-capped silver NPs, according to Brust procedure (Brust et al., 2002) based on a phase transfer of an Au3+ complex from aqueous to organic phase in a two-phase liquid-liquid system, which was followed by a reduction with sodium borohydride in the presence of dodecanethiol as stabilizing agent, binding onto the NPs surfaces, avoiding their aggregation and making them soluble in certain solvents. They reported that small changes in synthetic factors lead to dramatic modifications in nanoparticle structure, average size, size distribution width, stability, and self-assembly patterns.\n\n1.4.2    Physical Approach:\n\nIn physical processes, nanoparticles are synthesized by evaporation-condensation, exploding wire technique, chemical vapor deposition, microwave irradiation, pulsed laser ablation, supercritical fluids, sonochemical reduction, and gamma radiation with evaporation-condensation and laser ablation is the most important physical approaches. The absence of solvent contamination in the prepared thin films and the uniformity of NPs distribution are the advantages of physical synthesis methods in comparison with chemical processes.\n\nSiegel and colleagues (2012) demonstrated the synthesis of AgNPs by direct metal sputtering into the liquid medium. The method, combining physical deposition of metal into propane-1, 2, 3-triol (glycerol), provides an interesting alternative to time-consuming, wet-based chemical synthesis techniques. Silver NPs possess round shape with an average diameter of about 3.5 nm with a standard deviation of 2.4 nm. It was observed that the NPs size distribution and uniform particle dispersion remains unchanged for diluted aqueous solutions up to glycerol-to-water ratio 1: 20.\n\n1.4.3    Biological Approach:\n\nAs stated earlier in the chemical method of synthesis, three main components are needed: a salt (e.g. AgNO3), a reducing agent (e.g. ethylene glycol) and a stabilizer agent (e.g. PVP) to control the growth of the nanoparticles and prevent them from aggregating. In the biological synthesis of nanoparticles, the reducing agent and the stabilizer are replaced by molecules produced by living organisms. These reducing and/or stabilizing compounds can be utilized from bacteria, fungi, yeasts, algae or plants.\n\nThe development of efficient green chemistry methods for the synthesis of nanoparticles has become a major focus of researchers. In the global effort to reduce generated waste and toxic materials, “green” chemistry and chemical processes are progressively integrating with modern developments in science and industry. They have investigated in order to find an eco-friendly technique for the production of well-characterized nanoparticles. Various approaches using plant extracts have been used for the synthesis of nanoparticles. These approaches have many advantages over chemical, physical, and microbial synthesis because there is no need for the elaborate process of culturing and maintaining the cell, using hazardous chemicals, high-energy and wasteful purifications.\n\nThe first successfully reported the synthesis of nanoparticles assisted by living plants appeared in 2002 when it was shown that gold nanoparticles, ranging in size from 2-20 nm, could form inside alfalfa seedlings. Subsequently, it was shown that alfalfa could form silver nanoparticles when exposed to a silver-rich medium. Other works on plants and plant parts that have been used for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles are Thevetia peruviana latex (Rupiasih et al. 2013), Wrightia tinctoria (Bharani et al. 2011), Solanum xanthocarpum (Muhammad et al. 2012), Opuntia ficus (Silva-de-Hoyos et al. 2012), Sphaeranthus amaranthoides (Swarnalatha et al. 2012), Punica granatum (Naheed et al. 2012) Citrullus colocynthis (Satyavani et al. 2011), Eucalyptus chapmaniana (Ghassan et al. 2013), Acacia auriculiformis (Nalawade et al. 2014), Ficus benghalensis, Azadirachta indica (Debasis et al. 2015), e.t.c.\n\nThe biomolecules present in these plants are responsible for the formation and stabilization of silver nanoparticles (Iravani et al. 2014). Nanoparticles produced by plants are more stable and the rate of synthesis is faster than in the case of microorganisms. Moreover, this method is simple, cost effective, energy-saving and reproducible. The nanoparticles are more variable in shape and size in comparison with those produced by other organisms. The advantages of using plant and plant-derived materials for biosynthesis of metal nanoparticles have interested researchers to investigate mechanisms of metal ions uptake and bioreduction by plants, and to understand the possible mechanism of metal nanoparticle formation in plants.\n\n\n",

        "content": "ANALYSIS OF 3-MERCAPTOPYRUVATE SULFURTRANSFERASE (3-MST)\n\n\nCHAPTERONE \n\n1.0. INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW\n\n   1.1.         INTRODUCTION\n\nOne of the major metabolic enzymes that have gained so much interest in scientists is 3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST). This enzyme occurs widely in nature (Bordo, 2002 and Jarabak, 1981).\n\nIt has been reported in several organisms ranging from humans to rats, fishes, and insects. It is a mitochondrial enzyme that has been concerned with the detoxification of cyanide, a potent toxin of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Nelson et al., 2000). Among the several metabolic enzymes that carry out xenobiotic detoxification, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase is of utmost importance.\n\n3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase functions in the detoxifications of cyanide; mediation of sulfur ion transfer to cyanide or to other thiol compounds. (Vandenet al., 1967).It is also required for the biosynthesis of thiosulfate. In combination with cysteine aminotransferase, it contributes to the catabolism of cysteine and it is important in generating hydrogen sulfide in the brain, retina and vascular endothelial cells (Shibuya et al., 2009). It also acquired different functions such as a redox regulation (maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis) and defense against oxidative stress, in the atmosphere under oxidizing conditionsNagaharaet al (2005).\n\nHydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important synaptic modulator, signaling molecule, smooth muscle contractor and neuroprotectant (Hosokiet al., 1997). Its production by the 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase and cysteine aminotransferase pathways is regulated by calcium ions (Hosokiet al., 1997).\n\nOrganisms that are exposed to cyanide poisoning usually have this enzyme in them. This could be in food as in the cyanogenicglucosides being consumed. It has been studied from a variety of sources, which include bacteria, yeasts, plants, and animals (Marcus Wischik, 1998).\n\nCyanide could be released into the bark of trees as a defense mechanism. There are an array of defensive compounds that make their parts (leaves, flowers, stems, roots, and fruits) distasteful or poisonous to predators. In response, however, the animals that feed on them have evolved over successive generations a range of measures to overcome these compounds and can eat the plant safely. The tree trunk offers a clear example of the variety of defenses available to plants (Marcus Wischik, 1998).\n\nOryctes rhinoceros larva is one of the organisms that are also exposed to cyanide toxicity because of the environment they are found.\n\n1.2.         3-MERCAPTOPYRUVATE SULFURTRANSFERASE\n\n3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (EC. 2.8.1.2), is a member of the group, Sulfurtransferases (EC 2.8.1.1 – 5), which are widely distributed enzymes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Bordoand Bork, 2002).\n\n3-Mercaptopyruvate Sulfurtransferase is an enzyme that is part of the cysteine catabolic pathway. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of 3-mercaptopyruvate to pyruvate and H2S (Shibuya et al., 2009). The deficiency of this enzyme will result in elevated urine concentrations of 3-mercaptopyruvate as well as 3-mercaptolactate, both in the form of disulfides with cysteine(Crawhallet al., 1969). It catalyzes the chemical reaction:\n\n3-mercaptopyruvate + cyanide à  pyruvate + thiocyanate\n\n3-mercaptopyruvate + thiolà   pyruvate + hydrogen sulphide (Sorbo 1957).\n\nIt transfers sulfur-containing groups and participates in cysteine metabolism (Shibuya et al., 2013). This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of sulfane sulfur from a donor molecule, such as thiosulfate or 3- mercaptopyruvate, to a nucleophile acceptor, such as cyanide or mercptoethanol.3-mercaptopyruvate is the known sulfur-donor substrate for 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (Porter & Baskin, 1995).\n\n3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase is believed to function in the endogenous cyanide (CN) detoxification system because it is capable of transferring sulfur from 3-mercaptopyruvate (3-MP) to cyanide (CN), forming the less toxic thiocyanate (SCN) (Hylin and Wood, 1959). It is an important enzyme for the synthesis of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the brain (Shibuya et al., 2009).\n\nThe systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-mercaptopyruvate: cyanide sulfurtransferase. It is also called beta-mercaptopyruvatesulfurtransferase(Vachek and Wood, 1972). It is one of three known H2S producing enzymes in the body (Hylin and Wood, 1959). It is primarily localised in the mitochondria (Cipolloneet al., 2008).\n\nThe expression levels of 3-MST in the brain during the fetal and postnatal periods are higher than those in the adult brain (unpublished data) although the promoter region shows characteristics of a typical housekeeping gene (Nagaharaet al., 2004). The observation is supported by the finding that3-MST expression in the cerebellum is decreased during the adult period (Shibuya et al., 2013). On the other hand, its expression level in the lung decreases from the perinatal period. These facts suggest that 3-MST could function in the fetal and postnatal brain. It was reported that serotonin signaling via the 5-HT1A receptor in the brain during the early developmental stage plays a critical role in the establishment of innate anxiety during the early developmental stage (Richardson-Jones et al., 2011).\n\nIn the rat, 3-MST possesses 2 redox-sensing molecular switches (Nagahara and Katayama, 2005). A catalytic-site cysteine and an intersubunitdisulfide bond serve as a thioredoxin-specific molecular switch (Nagaharaet al., 2007). The intermolecular switch is not observed in prokaryotes and plants, which emerged into the atmosphere under reducing conditions (Nagahara, 2013). As a result, it acquired different functions such as a redox regulation (maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis) and defense against oxidative stress, in the atmosphere under oxidizing conditions (Nagaharaet al., 2005).\n\nMoreover, 3-MST can produce H2S (or HS−) as a biofactor (Shibuya et al., 2009), which cystathionine β-synthase and cystathionine γ-lyase also can generate (Abe and Kimura, 1996). Interestingly 3-MST can uniquely produce SOx in the redox cycle of persulfide formed at the low-redox catalytic-site cysteine (Nagaharaet al., 2012). As an alternative hypothesis on the pathogenesis of the symptoms, H2S (or HS−) and/or SOxcould suppress anxiety-like behavior, and therefore, defects in these molecules could increase anxiety-like behavior. However, no microanalysis method has been established to quantify H2S (or HS−) and SOxat the physiological level (Ampolaet al., 1969).\n\nMCDU was first recognized and reported in 1968 as an inherited metabolic disorder caused by congenital 3-MST insufficiency or deficiency. Most cases were associated with mental retardation (Ampolaet al, 1969) while the pathogenesis remains unknown.\n\nHuman MCDU was reported to be associated with behavioral abnormalities, mental retardation (Crawhall, 1985), hypokinetic behavior, and grand mal seizures and anomalies (flattened nasal bridge and excessively arched palate) (Ampolaet al, 1969); however, the pathogenesis has not been clarified since MCDU was recognized more than 40 years ago. Macroscopic anomalies were associated in 1 case (Ampolaet al, 1969); however, this could be an accidental combination. 3-MST deficiency also induced higher brain dysfunction in mice without macroscopic and microscopic abnormalities in the brain. 3-MST seems to play a critical role in the central nervous system, i.e., to establish normal anxiety (Richardson et al., 2011)\n\n1.2.1.  DISTRIBUTION OF 3-MST\n\n3-MST is widely distributed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Jarabak, 1981).  It is localized in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, but not all cells contain 3-MST (Nagaharaet al., 1998).\n\n1.2.2.  OCCURRENCE\n\nHuman mercaptopyruvatesulfurtransferase (MPST; EC. 2.8.1.2) belongs to the family of sulfurtransferases (Vandenet al., 1967). These enzymes catalyze the transfer of sulfur to a thiophilic acceptor (Sorbo 1957), where MPST has a preference for 3-mercapto sulfurtransferase as the sulfur-donor. MPST plays a central role in both cysteine degradation and cyanide detoxification. In addition, deficiency in MPST activity has been proposed to be responsible for a rare inheritable disease known as mercaptolactate-cysteine disulfiduria (MCDU) (Hannestadet al, 2006).\n\n1.2.3.  MECHANISMS OF ACTION\n\n3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferasecatalyzes the reaction from mercaptopyruvate (SHCH2C (= O)COOH)) to pyruvate (CH3C(= O)COOH) in cysteine catabolism (Vackek and Wood, 1972). The enzyme is widely distributed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Jarabak, 1981).\n\nThis disulfide bond serves as a thioredoxin-specific molecular switch. On the other hand, a catalytic-site cysteine is easily oxidized to form a low-redox potential sulfenate which results in loss of activity (Nahagaraet al., 2005). Then, thioredoxin can uniquely restore the activity (Nagahara, 2013).\n\nThus, a catalytic site cysteine contributes to redox-dependent regulation of 3-MST activity serving as a redox-sensing molecular switch (Nahagara, 2013). These findings suggest that 3-MST serves as an antioxidant protein and partly maintain cellular redox homeostasis. Further, it was proposed that 3-MST can produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) by using a persulfurated acceptor substrate (Shibuya et al, 2009).\n\nAs an alternative functional diversity of 3-MST, it has been recently demonstrated in-vitro that 3-MST can produce sulfur oxides (SOx) in the redox cycle of persulfide (S-S-) formed at the catalytic site of the reaction intermediate (Nagaharaet al, 2012).\n\n1.2.4.  MOLECULAR FORMULA AND MOLECULAR WEIGHT\n\nThe molecular formula of 3-MST is C3H4O3S (Vachek and Wood, 1972).\n\n3-MST has a molecular weight of 120.127g/mol or 23800 Daltons (as summarized by PubChem compound).",

Accessibility and availability of fresh clean water do not only play a crucial role in economic development and social welfare (Odonkorand Ampofo,2013) but also, it is an indispensable liquid. Many do not have access to safe and clean water and many dies of waterborne bacterial infections. Hence, having it available in sufficient quantity and quality contributes to the maintenance of health (Nougang et al., 2011). According to WHO (2004), about 80% of all diseases and over one-third of deaths in developing countries are caused by drinking contaminated water.\n\nWater is essential to human life, for basic health and survival, as well as food production and economic activities. Presently, the world is facing a global emergency in which over one billion people lack access to a basic supply of clean water and over 2billion do not have access to adequate sanitation which is the primary cause of the waterborne disease (WHO, 2003). Water aids in digestion and is essential in almost all other body processes. It makes up more than two-thirds of human body weight, and without water, there is no life. The human brain is made up of 95% water, blood is 82%, and lungs 90%. Water helps in maintaining the moisture of internal organs of the body, the normal volume and consistency of fluids such as blood and lymph as well as in the regulation of body temperature, removal of poisons or toxins from the body through urine, sweat and breathing; and the regulation of the normal structure and functions of the skin. The body loses about four litres of water every day. It is, therefore, necessary to replenish this volume daily by drinking at least the equivalent amount of quality water. In developing countries with deteriorating environments, the demand for clean drinking water supply is growing rapidly in recent times(Odonkor and Ampofo,2013).\n\nMost of the infections (like cholera, typhoid, hepatitis, poliomyelitis etc.) in developing countries can be attributed to lack of safe drinking water. This owing to the fact that water is obtained from various untreated sources, among which are streams, lakes, rivers, ponds, rain, springs and wells (Okonko et al., 2008). Large percentage of the population in developing countries are not adequately supplied with potable water and is thus compelled to use water from sources like shallow wells, boreholes, springs and streams that render the water unsafe for domestic and drinking purposes due to high possibilities of contamination (Welch et al., 2000; Jamielson et al., 2004; WHO, 2006). Faecal contamination of water is established by the presence of faecal organisms because they do not occur freely in nature. The presence of Escherichia Coli, Clostridiumperfringes and Streptococcusfaecalis in water is sufficient evidence that the water is not safe since enteric pathogens are confirmed present (Ohanu et al., 2012). \n\nAims and Objectives\n\nThe aim of the study is to isolate and identify Escherichia coli as an indicator of faecal pollution in streams on Obafemi Awolowo University (O.A.U) campus, Ile-Ife, Osun state.\n\nObjectives of the study\n\nTo isolate and identify Escherichia coli in O.A.U streams, Osun state, Nigeria.\n\nTo determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the strains in the samples analysed.\n\n1.1       Literature Review\n\n1.1.1    Water\n\nPotable water is defined as water that is free from disease-producing microorganisms and chemical substances deleterious to health (Ihekoronye and Ngoddy, 1985). Before water can be described as being potable, it has to comply with certain physical, chemical and microbiological standards designed to ensure that the water is potable and safe for drinking (Tebutt, 1983).\n\nEnsuring standard quality of environmental water used as a source of recreational or drinking water is an important worldwide problem. Meanwhile, the presence of these organisms may cause gastroenteritis in humans (Ratajczak et al., 2010). According to the World Health Organization and European guidelines, Escherichiacoli indicates faecal contamination of water (Ratajczak et al., 2010).\n\n1.1.2    Pollution of Water\n\nSurface water such as rivers, streams can be choked with sediments, hazardous substances or poorly treated effluents accruing from industrial activities, which in turn renders the water bodies unsuitable for use. Polluted surface water can contain a wide variety of pathogenic microorganisms including bacteria and viruses. Unfortunately, clean, pure and safe water can exist only briefly in nature and immediately polluted by prevailing environmental factors aided by human activities. Water from most sources is therefore unfit for immediate consumption without some sort of treatment (Okonko et al., 2008).\n\nDuring the early history of various countries, epidemics of diseases such as typhoid, shigellosis, cholera and amoebiasis were common threats (Tyagi et al., 2006). It was subsequently discovered that sewage was the primary source. Human faecal pollution enters water bodies in a number of ways- from point sources (discharges from municipal sewage treatment plant and leaking sewage pipes) and non-point sources (such as runoff, landfills, failing septic systems and improper sewage disposal). Wastewater effluents are a major source of faecal contamination of aquatic ecosystems (George et al., 2002).\n\nThe presence of poisonous chemical substances, pathogenic organisms (infective and parasitic agents), industrial or other wastes or sewage in water makes it contaminated or polluted. To ensure safe consumption and use, water has to be examined microbiologically to determine its sanitary and its suitability for general use (Ohanu et al., 2012).\n\n1.1.3    Quality of Water\n\nThe quality of water influences the health status of any populace, hence, analysis of water for physical, biological and chemical properties including trace element contents are very important for public health studies. Shortage of infrastructure for effective treatment and distribution of water accounts for the incidence of high morbidity and mortality rate associated with water-borne diseases in developing countries. One of the targets of the millennium development goals (MDG) in terms of healthy living for the masses can be achieved through the supply of safe and available water (Orewole et al., 2007). The availability of good quality water sources is, therefore, getting more and more limited, and the effect of water-borne pathogens on human health is expected to be of great concern. It is, therefore, important to understand the significance of natural and drinking water contribution to the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms (Suresh and Smith, 2004).\n\nThe quality of water may be described according to its physicochemical and microbiological characteristics (Muniyan and Ambedkar, 2011).\n\n1.1.3.1 Physicochemical parameters\n\nThe pH is the measurement of the acid/base activity in solution. In natural waters, the pH scale runs from 0 to 14 and it is the most important parameter in determining the corrosive nature of water. The lower the pH value, the higher the corrosive nature of water (Gupta, 2009). The water temperature plays an important role in the solubility of salts and gases. It is one of the most significant parameters which control inherent physical qualities of water (Hamaidi-Chergui et al., 2013). The TDS are the total concentration of dissolved solids in water, and sometimes also influences the salinity behaviour of river water. It is composed of inorganic salts and some inorganic materials as well as dissolved organic matter. The presence of these minerals in the water would come from a number of natural sources as well as from the result of human activities.\n\n1.1.3.2 Microbiological Quality\n\nThe microbiological quality of treated wastewater is a concern to customers, water suppliers, regulators and public health authority alike (Odonkor and Ampofo 2013). The increasing industrialization and the growing water demand has led to a global deterioration of surface water quality (Tyagi et al., 2006). Thus, the need to assess the microbiological safety of these waters by analysing them for the presence of specific pathogens and, directing efforts to the removal of indicator microbes of faecal origin (George et al., 2002; Tyagi et al., 2006).\n\nMaintenance of the microbiological quality and safety of water systems used for drinking, recreation, and in the harvesting of seafood is imperative, as contamination of these systems can exert high risks to human health as well as result in significant economic losses due to closures of beaches and shellfish harvesting areas. Water contaminated with human faeces is generally considered as a greater risk to human health, as they are more likely to contain human-specific enteric pathogens, including Salmonellaenterica serovar Typhi, Shigella spp., hepatitis A virus, and Norwalk-group viruses. Animals can also serve as reservoirs for a variety of enteric pathogens (various serotypes of Salmonella, Escherichia Coli, and Cryptosporidium spp.). Understanding the origin of faecal pollution is paramount in assessing associated health risks as well as the actions necessary to remedy the problem while it still exists (Griffin et al., 2000; Scott et al., 2002).\n\nMonitoring the microbiological quality of drinking water relies largely on the examination of indicator bacteria such as coliforms, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Odonkor and Ampofo, 2013). The presence of Escherichia coli in water is a strong indication of recent sewage contamination. It is important to note that Escherichia coli and wastes can get into the water in many different ways. For example, during rainfall and snowmelt, Escherichia coli may be washed into creeks, rivers, streams, lakes or groundwater (Griffith et al., 2003; Roslev and Bukh, 2011) from a land surface (Rock and Rivera, 2014).\n\n\n",

        "content": "THE ROLE OF PLANT IN THE TREATMENT OF DISEASES CAUSED BY MICROORGANISMS BASED IN THE NATURAL PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 BACKGROUND\n\nTraditional medicine is defined as the sum total of knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures that are used to maintain health, as well as to prevent, diagnose, improve or treat physical and mental illnesses (Elujoba et al, 2005, WHO, 2003). Traditional medicine that has been adopted by other populations (outside its indigenous culture) is often termed alternative or complementary medicine (Wong, 2005).\n\nAccording to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCAM) of United States of America (wai Fan, 2005), complementary and alternative medicine therapies can be classified into five broad categories: the first one is Alternative\n\nMedical Systems. These systems are built upon complete systems of theory and practice. Often, these systems have evolved apart from and earlier than the conventional medical approach used in the United States. Examples of alternative medical systems include: Acupuncture, Ayurveda, Homeopathy (Native American healing practices), Naturopathic medicine (Tibetan medicine), and Traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nThe second one is Mind-Body Interventions. Mind-body medicine uses a variety of techniques designed to enhance the mind’s capacity to affect bodily function and symptoms. Some techniques that were considered alternative in the past have become mainstream (for example, patient support groups and cognitive-behavioral therapy).\n\nOther mind-body techniques are still considered alternative, including: Art therapy, Biofeedback, Dance therapy, Guided imagery, Humor therapy, Hypnotherapy,\n\nMeditation, Music therapy, Prayer therapy, Yoga.\n\nThe third one is Biologically-Based Therapies. Biologically based therapies in complementary and alternative medicine use substances found in nature, such as herbs, foods, and vitamins. Some examples include: Diet, Dietary supplements, Herbal products, and Megavitamins. It also includes the use of other so-called natural but as yet scientifically unproven therapies (for example, using shark cartilage to treat cancer). Herbal medicines include herbs, herbal materials, herbal preparations and finished herbal products that contain parts of plants or other plant materials as active ingredients (WHO, 2000).\n\nThe fourth is Manipulative and Body-Based Methods. Manipulative and body-based methods in complementary and alternative medicine are based on manipulation and/or movement of one or more parts of the body. Some examples include: Acupressure,\n\nAlexander Technique, Chiropractic, Feldenkrais method, Massage therapy, osteopathy,\n\nReflexology, Rolfing, Therapeutic Touch, and trager Approach.\n\nThe last method is Energy Therapies. Energy therapies involve the use of energy fields. They are of two types: Biofield therapies are intended to affect energy fields that purportedly surround and penetrate the human body. The existence of such fields has not yet been scientifically proven. Some forms of energy therapy manipulate biofields by applying pressure and/or manipulating the body by placing the hands in, or through, these fields. Examples include: Qi gong, Reiki, Therapeutic touch. Bioelectromagnetic-based therapies involve the unconventional use of electromagnetic fields such as Pulsed fields, Magnetic fields and alternating-current or direct-current fields.\n\nThe use of complementary and alternative medicines is increasing globally, especially in developing countries (WHO, 2002). Indeed, over 80% of the population in developing countries depend on traditional healing modalities, including herbal remedies for health maintenance and therapeutic management of diseases (WHO, 2002).\n\nIn Nigeria and elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa, traditional herbal medicines are commonly used to treat a range of diseases. Such practices are wide-spread in rural areas where access to modern health care facilities is limited and cost of modern pharmaceuticals is beyond the means of most people (Ochora, 2006). With the wide spread use of various herbal products which are often concomitantly used with pharmaceutical drugs, herbal – drug interactions have become an important issue in drug safety and clinical practice. Hence prevalence of the concomitant use in the population needs to be determined.\n\nTraditional medicine is widely used in Nigeria with majority of the population (70%) depending on it for primary health care (NCAPD, 2007). However, there is no legal policy framework that regulates their use. It is nevertheless evident that the government attaches great importance to proper use of herbal medicine and has responded to its growing popularity by developing a national policy framework that will provide a sound base for both promoting and regulating its use (NCAPD, 2007). This policy framework is awaiting parliamentary approval.\n\nRegulating traditional medicine products, practices and practitioners is difficult due to variations in definitions and categorisations of traditional medicines therapies. A single herbal product could be defined as a food, a dietary supplement or an herbal medicine depending on the country (WHO, 2003). This disparity in regulations at the National level has implications on international access and distribution of the products. Though a lot of medicinal plants have been documented, further research is needed in the interaction effects of herbs and conventional medicine. In recognition to these gaps vision 2030 in its second Medium Term Plan 2013-2017 will be addressing a number of issues under Natural Products Programme; (Flagship project). The flagship project to be implemented includes documentation, profiling and securing of indigenous knowledge, technologies and associated biological resources; scientific testing and validation\n\n(MoSCA, 2013).\n\nLike in the rest of the country, the use of herbal remedies is on the increase in Nigeria. However, there is lack of proper documentation regarding the utilization and concomitant use of herbal products with conventional medicine. This study sought to investigate the prevalence of concomitant use of herbal products with conventional medicine. The study also determined whether there are reported adverse effects associated with the growing use of herbal medicine and herbs – drugs interaction.\n\n1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe use of herbal remedies continues to grow globally at an alarming rate without proper regulation (WHO, 2002). This has forced international health organizations to advise governments to formulate national guidelines for regulation of herbal remedies. The lack of regulation means there are just as many fake remedies and false practitioners as there are genuine treatments, a situation which has fatal consequences. The Nigerian Government in response to this has developed a sessional paper on traditional medicine of 2009 though it has not been debated by parliament (Hansard, 2009). While this sessional paper awaits adoption and enactment of requisite laws to regulate use of herbal medicine, the country has witnessed an unprecedented growth of herbal clinics whose professionalism is very much wanting. Use of herbal products concomitantly with conventional medicines is an issue of public health concern. Studies have documented adverse effects associated with concomitant use (Piscitelli et al 2002, Nyasha et al 2011). However, the extent to which concomitant use is happening locally has not been adequately documented. This is the case even in Nigeria, hence this study.\n\n1.3 RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\nThis study sought to address the following research questions;\n\ni.What are demographic characteristics of herbal product users in Nigeria?\n\nii.Which herbs are frequently used in Nigeria?\n\niii.Which are the health conditions that elicit use of herbs in Nigeria?\n\niv.To what extent are herbal medicines used concomitantly with conventional medicines in Nigeria?\n\n1.4 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES\n\n1. \n\nThere is no difference in demographic characteristics among the herbal users in Nigeria.\n\n1.  Herbal products are not concomitantly utilised with conventional medicine for treatment of various health conditions, in Nigeria.\n\n1.5 GENERAL OBJECTIVE\n\nThe general objective of the study was to investigate the extent of concomitant use of herbal products together with conventional medicine for various health conditions in\n\nNigeria.\n\n1.6 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES\n\nThe specific objectives of this study were;\n\n1. \n\nTo determine the demographic characteristics of persons using herbal products in Nigeria.\n\n2.  To establish which herbs are commonly used in Nigeria.\n\n§  To establish the common diseases and conditions for which herbal medicine is used in Nigeria.\n\n1.  To determine the prevalence of concomitant use of herbal medicines with conventional medicines for similar conditions by herbal products users in Nigeria.\n\n1.7 JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY\n\nTo maximize the potential of herbal treatment as a source of health care, a number of issues must first be tackled. They relate to policy, safety, efficacy, quality, access and rational use. These cannot be tackled without adequate data on growing utilization of herbal medicine; hence this study. The study was expected to reveal the level of concomitant use of herbal products with conventional medicine, whether the concomitant use of herbal products with conventional medicine use has any demographic inclination. The widespread use of various herbal products which are often concomitantly used with conventional medicine, have become an important issue in drug safety and clinical practice (Fugh-Berman, 2002, Izzo et al, 2009). The findings of this study are expected to aid in predicting the risk of adverse herbal products – conventional medicine interactions. These will also provide awareness among policy makers responsible for the design of appropriate conventional medicine vigilance system in the country.  Awareness within the medical community and those monitoring adversities would serve well to mitigate risks from potential conventional medicine – herbal products interactions. The results of this study would form the basis for future research since most indigenous herbs are not well investigated and this could point to the needs for biomedical investigation to assess safety and efficacy of popular medical herbs.\n\n1.8 CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK\n\nThe conceptual framework for this study was based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) which postulates that ―health-seeking behavior is influenced by a person‘s perception of a threat posed by a health problem and the value associated with actions aimed at reducing the threat‖(Becker, 1978). In this model, the ultimate outcomes—―health-seeking behaviour‖ and ―the likelihood of taking recommended preventive health action‖— include the following components:\n\n1. \n\n―Individual perceptions‖, which, in turn, are composed of perceived susceptibility to threat; that is, illness or disease and perceived seriousness or severity of the threat.\n\n2.  ―Likelihood of action‖ composed of perceived benefits of preventative action minus perceived barriers to preventive action.\n\n3.  ―Cues to action‖, which include motivations to avoid threat, and\n\n4.  ―Modifying factors‖, composed of demographic, psychosocial, and structural variables.",

        "content": "ENUMERATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF BACTERIA ON USED HANDKERCHIEFS IN MALES\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION  \n\nMicro-organisms are ubiquitous and are found in almost every area around human bodies.  Some are specifically found in certain regions of the body as a normal flora where they live as commensals with a man.  This association is important in protecting the body against other infectious diseases. Each area of the body surface acquires a characteristic flora of organisms well adapted to growth in that particular environment.  These residents (normal flora) tend to suppress the intruders either by competition for space and food supply or by the production of metabolites that are antagonistic to the survival of the intruder. These residents could be dislodged from their environment when sneezing, coughing, belching, yawning or could be destroyed by regular use of antiseptic soaps or creams on the body surfaces. Handkerchiefs often used in males for wiping face, closing of the mouth and nose when expressing these reflex activities, therefore constitute an abode for bacteria.  Furthermore, bacteria found in handkerchiefs could differ from one individual to another as the bacteria found could be reflective of the environment and pathological conditions of the individual using the handkerchief.  For instance, an individual with upper respiratory tract infection is likely to dislodge strains of pathogenic microbes along sides with the normal flora in these regions. Enumeration of bacteria on a used handkerchief in males can be done using microscopic cell count and viable cell counting.  Microscopic counts can be done on either sample dried on slides or samples in liquid.  A viable cell counting is the one that is able to divide and form offspring. Viable cell counting is also called plate count and there are at least two ways of performing plate count: the spread plate and pour plate method. In the spread plate method, a volume of appropriately diluted culture is spread over the surface of an agar plate using a sterile glass spreader.  The plate is then incubated until colonies appear, and the number of colonies formed is counted. In the pour plate method, a known volume of culture is pipetted in a sterile Petri dish plate.  Molten agar medium is then added and mix well by gentle swirling of the plate on the benchtop.  Because the sample is mixed with a molten agar medium, the bacteria to be counted must be able to withstand brief temperature exposure to the temperature of the molten agar (45 – 50oC).  Here, the colonies formed are counted throughout the plate and not just on the agar surface as in the spread plate method. In identifying bacteria, the morphological and biochemical characteristics of the bacteria, are evaluated.  The appearance and the microscopic description of the bacteria are examined with the aid of a light compound microscope. From the growth of the bacteria (pure culture), the specimen to be viewed under the microscope can be prepared as a smear or as a wet mount.  A stain is used to contrast the specimen from the background.  This strain could be basic or acid stain.  Basic stain, for example, methylene blue and crystal violet, are cationic and have a positive charge.  They are ideal for staining chromosomes and the cell membrane of the bacteria.  The acid stains are anionic and have a negative charge, and are used to stain cytoplasmic material and organelles or inclusions.  Common examples are eosin and picric acid. There are two types of stains – simple and differential.  A simple stain has a single basic dye that is used to show shapes of cells and structures within a cell while a differential stain consists of two or more dyes and is used in the procedures to identify bacterially.  One of the most commonly used differentials stains the gram stain.  Gram-positive bacteria stain purple while Gram-negative bacteria stain pink.  Other biochemical tests like the Indole test, Urease test, Catalase reaction, Oxidase reaction etc will help in further characterization of the bacteria identified from the handkerchief.\n\nIdentification of Gram-Positive Cocci \n\nGram-positive cocci can be identified by the growth on blood and chocolate agar and the catalase test.  The catalase test is used to differentiate those bacteria that produce the enzymes catalase, such as staphylococcus from non-catalase producing bacteria such as streptococci.  For catalase-positive, gram-positive cocci, a coagulase test could be used to further differentiate them.  Staphylococcus aureus is coagulase-positive whereas Staphylococcus epidermidis is negative to the coagulase test.  Streptococci are catalase-negative gram-positive cocci and are further classified on the basis of their type of hemolysis, A (partial) and B (complete) hemolysis on blood agar, Alpha-haemolytic streptococci, streptococcal viridian's and Streptococcal pneumonia can be differentiated by the optochin disc susceptibility test.  The B-haemolytic streptococci are group according to the Lancefield classification.\n\nIdentification of Gram-Negative Cocci \n\nMembers of this group can be identified using fermentation patterns.  In addition, catalase and oxidase tests can also be performed.  It can further be identified by growing them on Thayer-Martin medium and nutrient agar.  \n\n\n",

The plant was authenticated in the Department of Botany, Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma, Edo State, Nigeria. The leaves were picked, washed in distilled water air dried and weighed. The weight of the leaf was 0.1kg. The dried leaves were pounded to powdered form using a motar and pestle. The leaf powder was suspended in methanol for 24hours before filtering with a white filter cloth and boiled for 30minutes. The resulting methanol extract was allowed to attain room temperature and was evaporated to dryness using a water bath as a source of heat. The percentage yield of the extract was 6.41% (w/v). The pasty residue was used to prepare a standardized solution of the leaf extract in calculated amount of distilled water with standardized concentration of 0.46 g/ml. The standardized solution (the stock solution) was stored air tight in plastic bottles and kept frozen.\n\n2.1.2 LABORATORY ANIMALS \n\nExactly twenty four male albino rats weighing 148 ± 30g obtained from the Animal Holding Unit of the Institute of Agricultural Research and Training (IART) Apata-Ibadan, Nigeria were used for the study. The rats were fed with Guinea grower mash (product of bendel feeds and flour mills Ltd, Ewu, Edo state, Nigeria). The rats were grouped into four (4) groups, each groups consisting of six (6) rats.\n\n2.2   INSTRUMENTS USED \n\nThe instruments used for this analysis include;\n\nBeam weigh balance Electronic weigh balance                                                           \n\n2.3 METHODS\n\n2.3.1 EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS AND PROCEDURE \n\nThe Twenty Four Male albino rats were randomly grouped into four  consisting of six rats per group. The rats were kept in cages made of wooden frames and metal iron and were fed ad libitum (access to food and water for 24hours each day). The rats were fed with guinea grower mash and tap water with 12hours light and dark cycle. The cages were cleaned every morning and disinfected every day. The rats were allowed to acclimatize for seven days before extract administration was commenced. Calculated amount of methanolic leaf extract of Acalypha wilkesiana were constituted in distilled water from the stock solution to give doses of 500,500 and 1000 mg/kg body weight of paracetamol, vitamin C and leaf extract respectively and administered to the various groups as illustrated below; GROUP A: Control received 1ml of distilled water GROUP B: Received 500mg/kg body weight of paracetamol GROUP C: Received 500mg/kg paracetamol and vitamin C GROUP D: Received 500mg/kg paracetamol and 1000mg/kg leaf extract. Prior to the administration of methanolic leaf extract of Acalypha wilkesiana at every interval of seven days, the body weights of the animals were recorded. Administration of methanolic leaf extract of Acalypha wilkesiana was performed orally once daily between 8:30am ± 30 minutes, using metal cannula attached to a 2ml syringe prior to the administration of methanolic leaf extract of Acalypha Wilkesiana at every interval of seven days, the body weights of the animals were recorded. \n\n\n",

They are used in cooking, as medicines, and for spiritual purposes. Herbs have a variety of uses including culinary and medicinal usage. General usage differs between culinary herbs and medicinal herbs (John, 2000).  Herbs are “generally recognized as safe” by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA), at least at concentrations commonly found in foods (Kaefer et al, 2008). Medicinal plants continue to provide valuable therapeutic agents, both in modern medicine and in traditional system (Reaven, 1983). The leaves, roots, flowers, seeds, root bark, inner bark (cambium), berries and sometimes the pericarp or other portions of the plant might be considered in medicinal or spiritual use (John, 2000). In the medicinal uses, herbs (plants) contain phytochemicals that have effects on the body (John, 2000). Until the 20th century, (Sanusi et al, 2008) most medicinal remedies all over the world were obtained from plants. For example, purple forglove was found to be helpful in dropsy, the opium poppy for pain, cough, and diarrhea, and the cinchona bark for fever. With the emergence of chemical and pharmacological methods in the 20th century, it became possible to identify the active ingredients in the plants and study them. Furthermore, once the chemistry was understood, it was possible to synthesize related molecules with more desirable properties. According to (Sodimu et al, 2008), today, the two most effective and widely accepted drugs for the treatment of malaria today emerged through herbal traditional medicine viz: Quinine from the bark of the Peruvian cinchona tree and artemisinin from the Chinese antipyretic Artemisia annua L. Hence, throughout history, the medicinal benefits of herbs are quoted (John, 2000). There may be some effects when consumed in the small levels that typify culinary \"spicing\", and some herbs are toxic in larger quantities. For instance, some types of herbal extract, such as the extract of St. John's-wort (Hypericum perforatum) or of awa (Piper methysticum) can be used for medical purposes to relieve depression and stress (John, 2000). However, (Milner et al, 2008), large amounts of these herbs may lead to toxic overload that may involve complications, some of a serious nature, and should be used with caution. One herb-like substance, called Shilajit, may actually help a lower blood glucose level which is especially important for those suffering from diabetes. In comparative terms, (Metuh, 1987) the western idea of medicine and the traditional African conception differ in scope. In the traditional sense, it refers to a wholistic view of well being, while in the western sense, it is strictly limited to bodily therapeutic purposes. Nze in his own comparative analysis of medicine underscores the peculiarity difference, which defines the traditional wholistic perception of medicine (Metuh, 1987). According to (John, 2000), modern pharmaceuticals had their origins in crude herbal medicines, and to this day, many drugs are still extracted as fractionate/isolate compounds from raw herbs and then purified to meet pharmaceutical standards. Some herbs are used not only for culinary and medicinal purposes, but also for psychoactive and/or recreational purposes; one such herb is cannabis (John, 2000). However, many herbs and their bioactive components are being investigated for potential disease prevention and treatment at concentrations which may exceed those commonly used in food preparation herbs (Milner et al, 2008). It is therefore imperative to identify any potential safety concerns associated with the use of various dosages which range from doses commonly used for culinary purposes to those used for medicinal purposes since there are often unclear boundaries between the various uses of herbs (Milner et al, 2008). Other uses of herbs other than medicinal uses are: Sacred uses: According to “Chinese herbal medicine” Herbs are used in many religions for example, myrrh (Commiphora myrrha) and   frankincense (Boswellia spp) in Christianity, the Nine Herbs Charm in Anglo-Saxon paganism, the Neem tree (Azadirachta indica) by the Tamils, holy basil or tulsi (Ocimum tenuiflorum) in Hinduism, and many Rastafarians consider cannabis (Cannabis sp) to be a holy plant (John, 2000). Siberian Shamans also used herbs for spiritual purposes. Plants may be used to induce spiritual experiences, such as vision quests in some Native American cultures (John, 2000). The Cherokee Native Americans use sage and cedar for spiritual cleansing and smudging. Uses as pest control: Herbs are also known amongst gardeners to be useful for pest control. Mint, spearmint, peppermint, and pennyroyal are a few such herbs. These herbs when planted around a house's foundation can help keep unwanted critters away such as flies, mice, ants, fleas, moth and tick amongst others. They are not known to be harmful or dangerous to children or pets, or any of the house's fixtures (John, 2000).\n\n1.2       Objectives of study\n\nPiper methysticum being a plant used for its medical and social purposes (Johnston et al, 2008), may have been of great benefits in human health due to its biochemical, pharmacological, and medical properties. This study, therefore, was undertaken to evaluate the trace – element composition of the leaf extract.\n\n\n",

        "content": "STUDY ON THE DESTABILIZATION OF LYSOZYME AND THE CHAPERONE-LIKE ACTIVITY OF ALPHA CRYSTALLIN\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0  INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW\n\n1.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nProteins\nare the workhorses of the living cell. Although proteins may differ in sequence, shape and function, but have in common, the same stereo configuration (i.e. they all have to fold into specific three-dimensional structures) which are mandatory for proper function (Bruce et al., 2002). Protein structures however are not rigid, but have a dynamic life style, which may involve unfolding and refolding, complex association and dissociation (Anfisen, 1972). Stress and also many physiological events require proteins to surrender their structure or to regain it at a later stage. A very large number of distinct conformations exist for the polypeptide chain of which a protein spends most of its time in the native conformation, which spans only an extremely small fraction of the entire configuration space. Thus, the amino acid sequence of proteins must satisfy two requirements: one, thermodynamics and the other kinetic. The thermodynamics requirement is that the sequence must have a unique folded conformation, which is stable under physiological conditions.\n\n Most proteins can be denatured by heat, which has complex effect on the weak interactions in proteins (Vandenberg et al., 2000). If the existing temperature is increased slowly, a protein conformation generally remains intact until an abrupt loss of structure and function occurs over a narrow temperature range (Nelson and Cox, 2008). The spatial arrangement of atoms in a protein is called its conformation (Deechongkit et al., 2004).\n\nThe possible conformations of a protein include any structural state it can achieve without breaking covalent bonds (Nelson and Cox, 2008). A change in conformation could occur, by rotation about single bonds. The conformations existing under a given set of conditions are usually the ones that are thermodynamically the most stable that is, having the lowest Gibbs free energy (G). Proteins in any of their functional, folded conformations are called native protein (Ellis, 2006). The term stability refers to the tendency to maintain a native conformation. Native proteins are only marginally stable; the ∆G separating the folded and unfolded states in typical proteins under physiological conditions is in the range of only 20-65 kJ/mol. The chemical interactions that stabilize native conformation include disulfide (covalent) bonds and weak non-covalent\n\ninteractions (Bruce et al., 2002).\n\nFor the intracellular proteins of most organisms, weak interactions are especially important in folding of polypeptide chains into their secondary and tertiary structures (Berg et al., 2002). The association of multiple polypeptides to form quaternary structure also relies on these weak interactions.\n\nSecondary structure of proteins refers to any chosen segment of polypeptide chain and   describes the local spatial arrangement of its main-chain atoms (Shakhnovich, 1997), A regular secondary structure   occurs when each dihedral angle remains the same or nearly the same throughout the segment, The most prominent structures are alpha helix and beta conformations (Finkelstein et al., 1995). The overall three-dimensional arrangement of all atoms in a protein is referred to as the proteins tertiary structure (Sewasga & Sugihara (1984). Tertiary structure includes longer-range aspects of amino acid sequence. Amino acids that are far apart in the polypeptide sequence and are in different types of secondary structure may interact within the completely folded structure of a protein.\n\n Some proteins contain two or more separate polypeptide chains, or subunits, which may be identical or different (Vandenberg, 2000). The arrangement of these protein subunits in three-dimensional complexes constitutes quaternary structure. Proteins are classified into fibrous and globular in this structure with polypeptide chains arranged in long strands or sheets and folded into a spherical or largely of a single type of secondary structure, and their tertiary structure (Johnson et al.,  2005).\n\nProtein quaternary structure results from interactions between the subunits of multisubunits (multimeric) proteins or large protein assemblies. Some multimeric proteins have a repeated unit consisting of a single subunit or a group of subunits, or promoter (Nelson and Cox, 2008).\n\n1.1.1  PROTEIN FOLDING\n\nAll proteins begin their existence on a ribosome as a linear sequence of amino acid residues (Lee & Tsai, 2005). This polypeptide must fold during and following synthesis to take up its native conformation (Deechongkit et al., 2004). Although native protein is slightly stable, modest changes in the proteins environment can bring about structural changes that can affect their function. Protein folding is the physical process by which a polypeptide folds into its characteristics and functional three-dimensional structure from random coil (Alexander et. al., 2007). Each protein exists as an unfolded polypeptide or random coil when translated from a sequence of mRNA to a linear chain of amino acids (Anfinsen, 1973). This nascent polypeptide lacks a developed three-dimensional structure. Amino acids interact with each other to produce a well-defined 3-dimensional structure, the folded protein, known as the native state. The resulting 3-dimensional structure is thus determined by the amino acid sequence (Berg et al., 2002).\n\nThe correct 3-dimensional structure is essential to the function of the protein although some parts may remain unfolded (Berg et al., 2002). Failure to fold into native structure produces inactive proteins. (Dennis, 2003).\n\nThe cell controls many of these protein folding processes itself, others are forced onto the cell from the environment. Essential processes are events such as de novo synthesis of proteins, protein translocation into different compartments, or control of the activity of regulatory proteins. A major force from outside that damages protein structures is heat stress due to increase in temperature. Similar problems can be caused by chemical compounds such as solvents or heavy metals. (Ellis, 2006). DNA damage may lead indirectly to protein folding problems because the mutated proteins are often less stable than the wild type. Protein folding defects have important medical implications. (Dennis et al., 2003). They are associated e. g. with amyloid diseases such as Alzheimer and prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Disease, (Anfinsen, 1973). But they are also a major cause of cancer due to destabilising mutations in the tumour suppressor protein p53 (Bruce, et al., 2002). Likewise, several genetic disorders relate to protein folding defects: mutations in the CFTR protein that lead to its misfolding cause cystic fibrosis (Johnson, 2005).\n\nEvery cell in every organism owns an arsenal of molecular chaperones to control folding and unfolding of proteins, or to react on protein unfolding during stress conditions. Most molecular chaperones are members of evolutionary conserved families: Hsp100, Hsp90, Hsp70 and their DnaJ (Hsp40) co-chaperones, the chaperonins Hsp60, and the small heat shock proteins (sHsp). Nearly all organisms have at least one homologue of each of these classes. Severely destabilised proteins are usually degraded. Interesting is what happens to proteins that are damaged in a way that they can be kept in solution by molecular chaperons. Chaperones act as the cellular thermometer: the binding specificity of a chaperone provides the cellular definition of what is an unfolded protein. Studying the structural properties of chaperone substrates should give a direct insight about the structural properties of unfolded proteins inside the cell under physiological condition. \n\n(Shakhnovich et al., 1997).\n\n1.1.2  PROTEIN DENATURATION\n\nDenaturation is a conformational alteration of a biological function. This is the process by which the three-dimensional structure is lost resulting in loss of function. Most proteins can be denatured by heat, as a result of complex effects on the weak interactions in a protein (primarily hydrogen bonds). If the temperature is increased slowly, a protein’s conformation generally remains intact until an abrupt loss of structure occurs over a narrow temperature range. The abruptness of the change suggests that unfolding is a cooperative process; loss of structure in one part of the protein destabilizes other parts. A fully denatured protein lacks both tertiary and secondary structure, and exists as a so called random coil. Under certain conditions some proteins can refold; however many cases denaturation is irreversible.   Cells sometimes protect their proteins against the denaturing influence of heat with enzymes known as chaperones (Bryngelson et al.,\n\n1995).     \n\nIn quaternary structure denaturation, protein sub–units are dissociated and or the spatial arrangement of protein sub-units is disrupted. In secondary structure denaturation, proteins lose all regular repeating patterns such as alpha helices and beta pleated sheets, and adopt a random coil configuration. The amino acids sequence of primary structure held together by covalent peptide bonds is not disrupted by denaturation (Dennis, 2003). Most   proteins lose their biological function when denatured. For example, enzymes lose their activity because the substrates can no longer bind to active site and because amino acids residues involved in stabilising substrate transition states are no longer positioned to be able to do so (Dennis, 2003).\n\nProteins can also be denatured by extreme pH, by certain   miscible organic solvents such as alcohol or acetone, by certain solutes such as urea and guanidine hydrochloride, or by detergents. Under certain conditions some proteins can refold, however, in many cases, denaturation is irreversible (Shortle, 1996). Globular proteins denatured by heat, extremes of pH, or denaturing reagents will regain their native structure and their biological activity if returned to conditions in which the native conformation is stable. This process is called renaturation. (Dennis, 2003).  \n\nThermally-induced transitions such as denaturation are detected by excess heat absorbed during the transition from the native to denatured state. Thus, the relative amounts of native and denatured protein can be determined by the magnitude of heat absorption, as demonstrated by Senisterra et al., (1997). Senisterra et al., (1997) found that the minimum temperature for thermal induction of Hsp synthesis was quantitatively the same as the minimum temperature for denaturation of thermo labile, cellular proteins. Essentially, who found that the minimum temperature that induced Hsp 70 transcription, approximately 40°C, represented the onset temperature (T1) or the temperature of the first endothermic transition where a specific set of thermo labile proteins unfolded due to low conformational stability, these thermo labile cellular proteins maintained conformational stability as long as the temperature was approximately 37°C (Lepock et al., 1997). Thermal stresses, i.e., rising the temperature to 40°C, caused these proteins to denature. The relationship between conformational stability of a protein and the temperature of its environment are integrally related. At physiological temperatures, a protein in its native folded state is only slightly more stable than in an unfolded conformation (Creighton, 1993). As temperature is increased, random thermal fluctuations away from the most compact conformation (Buttler and Falke, 1996) increase the probability of transition to an unfolded state or states. The conclusions of Lepock et al. (1997) was that in whole cells thermal stress caused proteins of low conformational stability to unfold, thus inducing the heat shock response (Lepock et al., 1997 and Senisterra et al., 1997).\n\nFolding of proteins require molecular chaperones, protein at interacts with partially, folded or improperly folded polypeptides, facilitating correct folding pathways  providing microenvironments in which folding can occur. The process of folding, particularly for large proteins, appears to occur via a limited number of pathways that involve distinct intermediate states [e.g. molten globule state] (Ptitsyn, 1991). These compact, partially folded intermediates transiently display hydrophobic regions on their surfaces that can interact to form insoluble aggregates (Ellis, 2006). Conditions favouring the accumulation of proteins exposing such hydrophobic residues will result in increased protein aggregation and consequently precipitation (Martin and Hartl, 1996). The unfolding path way is reversible i.e. it is possible for protein in an unfolded state to refold into the native state, provided the protein does not enter the off-folding pathway towards aggregation and precipitation (Linder et al., 1997). Molecular chaperones are family of proteins that assist in formation of the correct [native] protein structure by preventing improper or incorrect reactions that would result in protein misfolding and aggregation (Ehrnsperger et al., 1997), without becoming a part of the native structure, chaperones ensure high fidelity in protein folding and assembly in the cell, proteins from many unrelated families have recently been shown to have chaperone function (Ellis, 2006). Chaperones are classified into two; the alpha A-crystallin and alpha B-crystallin. The alpha-crystallin account for approximately one third of the total soluble protein in the lens contributing to its refractive power (Horwitz, 1992). Alpha B-crystallin also found outside the lens having a characteristic tissue distribution.  It has been shown in humans that naturally occurring point mutation in the alpha-crystallin result in deficit in chaperone-like function and can cause cataract as well as desmin related myopathy (Horwitz, 1992).\n\nThe common characteristics of alpha crystalline/small heat shock protein family are the presence of conserved homologous sequence of 90-100 residues (de Jong et al., 1989).\n\nApart from the vertebrate lens proteins alpha A and crystallin and the ubiquitous group of 15-30KDa heat shock protein. This family also includes two myobacterial surface antigens. The alphas crystalline have been found in many tissues outside the lens (de Jong et. al., 1989). Alpha B is over expressed in several neurological disorders and in cell lines under stress conditions (de Jong et al., 1998).\n\n1.1.3  CRYSTALLINS\n\nCrystallin constitute structural proteins of the eye and are present at high concentration in this organ, which has very little resynthesis capacity. Apparently, nature has acquired these proteins by repeated recruitment of globular protein structures for incorporation as crystalline in the lens (Wistow and Piatigorsky 1987). Some crystallins, such as alpha, beta and gamma are present in the lenses of all vertebrates (Hanson et al., 2000). Alpha crystalline shows a distant relationship to small heat shock proteins, while beta and gamma crystalline belong to another family (Horwitz, 1992). A different group of crystallins appear to be taxon specific and frequently involve common enzymes of wellknown metabolic pathways; (Wistow and Piatigorsky, 1987). Presumably, the ancient origin and wide spread occurrence of these enzymes or their derivatives resulted in stable conformations which also made them suitable for function in the lens (Wistow and Piatigorsky, 1987).\n\nThe crystallin is homologous with the alcohol dehydrogenases over extensive parts of the protein chain (60-80 residue are identical). Furthermore the large gap segment in the crystallin overlap a gap segment in two of the alcohol dehydrogenase lines and coincides at one end.   \n\n1.1.4  JUSTIFICATION\n\nMost studies have been on the hydrolysing action of lysozyme (Raman et al.,1996). Studies on the destabilisation of lysozyme have not been widely reported, and there is dearth of information on the characteristics of lysozymes from the lens of Sokoto red goat. The study will assist in understanding the structural change (from folded to unfolded state) of protein. The study will also enable the understanding of the structural changes (folded to unfolded state) undergone by such protein from Sokoto Red goat. Also, the chaperone-like activity of alpha crystallin, a heat shock protein, from the same source will be studied.\n\nThe information gathered from the work will add to our wealth of information on the characteristics of these proteins from various sources. Furthermore, the work affords gaining hands-on experience in protein isolation and purification.\n\n1.1.5 AIM AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe aim of this work was to study the oxidative destabilization of lysozyme and the chaperone-like activity of alpha crystallin from the eye lens of Sokoto red goat.\n\nThe objectives are to:\n\n1-  Partially purify alpha crystallin from Sokoto red goat.\n\n2-  Study the destabilization of lysozyme using dithiothreitol and heat and monitor     same by UV   spectroscopy.\n\n3-  Study the modulating effect of alpha crystallin on the destabilisation of lysozyme monitored using ultraviolet (uv) spectroscopy.\n\n\n",

Many natural and man-made materials have been used to make perfume to apply to the skin and clothing, to put in cleaners and cosmetics, or to scent the air. Because of differences in body chemistry, temperature, and body odors, no perfume will smell exactly the same on any two people.\n\nPerfume comes from the Latin \"per\" meaning \"through\" and \"fume,\" or \"smoke.\" Many ancient perfumes were made by extracting natural oils from plants through pressing and steaming. The oil was then burned to scent the air. Today, most perfume is used to scent bar soaps. Some products are even perfumed with industrial odorants to mask unpleasant smells or to appear \"unscented.\"\n\nWhile fragrant liquids used for the body are often considered perfume, true perfumes are defined as extracts or essences and contain a percentage of oil distilled in alcohol.\n\nA perfume is composed of three notes. The base note is what a fragrance will smell like after it has dried. The smell that develops after the perfume has mixed with unique body chemistry is referred to as the middle note. And the top note is\n\n13\n\nthe first smell experienced in an aroma. Each perfumery has a preferred perfume manufacturing process, but there are some basic steps. The notes unfold over time, with the immediate impression of the top note leading to the deeper middle notes, and the base notes gradually appearing as the final stage. These notes are created carefully with knowledge of the evaporation process of the perfume. The top note consists of small light molecules that evaporate quickly. The middle note forms the heart of main body of a perfume and act to mask the often unpleasant initial impression of base notes.\n\nTraditionally perfumes were made from plant and animal substances and prepared in the form of waters, oils, unguents, powders, and incense. This last method of fragrance gives us our word ‘perfume’ which means ‘to smoke through’. Most modern perfumes are alcohol-based and contain synthetic scents. While the term ‘perfume’ usually refers to fragrances in general, in the more technical language of the perfumer, a perfume must contain over 15% of fragrance oils in alcohol. The preferred fragrances for perfumes are by no means universal, but differ according to cultural dictates and fashions. In the sixteenth century, for example, pungent animal scents such as musk and civet were very popular. In the nineteenth century, by contrast, such animal scents were generally considered too crude, and light floral fragrances were favored. Perfumes were held in high esteem and widely employed in the ancient world. The wealthy would perfume not only the body, but their furnishings and their favorite horses and dogs. On ancient altars perfumes were offered to the gods, while in the\n\n14\n\nkitchens of antiquity the same scents — Saffron, Cinnamon, Rose, Myrrh — might be used to flavor food and wine.\n\nTechniques involved in perfume extraction from plants include; solvent extraction, distillation and effleurage method. These methods to a certain extent, distort the odor of the aromatic compounds that are obtained from the raw materials.\n\nImportant thing in relation to perfume making is that there are three key ingredients you will need to produce perfume:\n\n1. Essential Oils (these have been extracted from various plants (organic or nonorganic) and when combined give the smell of the perfume you are trying to produce.\n\n2. Pure Grain Oil\n\n3. Water\n\n\n",

Low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterols have been identified as independent coronary risk factors (Rodrigue et al., 2010). High level of blood cholesterol is responsible for circulatory system disorder. Increase level of low density lipoprotein (LDL) is alarming for cardiovascular diseases and their risk is increased many times (Harman et al., 2011). \n\nIn developing countries, the occurrence of heart diseases increases rapidly (Nordestgard et al., 2010). Medical studies show that about 70% of adults over 50 years old suffer atherosclerosis. (Sherien and Azza, 2009). A large number of synthetic hypolipidemic drugs are available in market. Long term use of these drugs cause serious side effects, and are costly.\n\nA medicinal plant is any plant which in one or more of its organ, contains substance that can be used for therapeutic purpose or which is a precursor for synthesis of useful drugs (Sivakumar et al., 2007). Plant contains a large number of bioactive phytochemicals that are responsible for pharmacological action of plants and used for development of drugs. Many medicinal plants have shown their antilipidemic effect and proved their efficacy in cardiovascular diseases (Nordestgard et al., 2010; Wang, 1999).\n\nOne of such plants used very often in the management of the disease by the traditional medicine practitioners of Eastern Nigeria is Desmodium velutium, a perennial plant erect or semi-erect shrub or sub-shrub up to 3m light. It is widely distributed in subtropical Asia and tropical Africa. (Amowi and Azode, 2012). \n\nExtracts of Desmodium velutium are used traditionally in some disease conditions particularly aphrodisiac and headache. Hence, Desomdium velutium may be a source of a pharmacological active agent useful in the treatment of aches, pains and diarrhoea. In Ghana, native doctors mix the root of Desmodium lasincarpum with some hot peppers and use it as enema to cure blood in urine. In Eastern States of Nigeria, the plant locally known as “Ikeagwuani”. (Onyegbule et al., 2012). In these present studies, I investigated the antilipidemic activity of the water (H2O) extract of\n\nDesmodium velutinum Leaves on albino wistar rats. \n\n\n",

        "content": "ABUNDANCE OF MOSQUITO SPECIES WITHIN SOKOTO METROPOLIS\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0     INTRODUCTION\n\nMosquitoes are slender and relatively small insects, usually measuring about 3– 6 mm in length. Some species, however, can be as small as 2mm while others may be as long as 19 mm (Service, 2008). The long antennae have numerous whorls of hair, short in the female and long and bushy in the male. In most species of mosquitoes, the mouthparts of the female are long, adapted for piercing and for sucking blood. The male, which feeds on nectar and water, has rudimentary mouthparts. Females of this group prefer the blood of warm-blooded animals. When they bite, they inject some of their salivary fluid into the wound, causing swelling and irritation. Many inject infectious\nmicro-organisms\nand thus transmit such diseases as malaria, yellow fever, dengue, and filariasis (Patel et al, 2012).\n\nThere are some 3300 species of mosquitoes belonging to 41 genera, all contained in the family Culicidae (Service, 2008). This family is divided into three subfamilies: Toxorhynchitinae, Anophelinae (anophelines) and Culicinae (culicines). Mosquitoes have a worldwide distribution; they occur throughout the tropical and temperate regions and extend their range northwards into the Arctic Circle. The only areas from which they are absent are Antarctica, and a few islands. They are found at elevations of 5500mand down mines at depths of 1250m below sea level (Service, 2008).\n\nThe most important pest and vector species belong to the genera Anopheles,\n\nCulex, Aedes, Ochlerotatus, Psorophora, Haemagogus and\n\nSabethes.Anophelesspecies, as well as transmitting malaria, are vectors of Filariasis (Wuchereriabancrofti, Brugiamalayi and Brugiatimori) and a few arboviruses. Certain Culexspecies transmit Wuchereriabancrofti and a variety of arboviruses. Aedes species are important vectors of yellow fever, dengue, encephalitis viruses and many other arboviruses, and in a few restricted areas they are also vectors of Wuchereriabancrofti and Brugiamalayi. Species in the very closely related genus Ochlerotatus also transmitfilariasis and encephalitis viruses. \n\nMansonia species transmit Brugiamalayi and sometimes Wuchereriabancrofti and a few arboviruses. Haemagogus and Sabethes\n\nmosquitoes are vectors of yellow fever and a few other arboviruses in Central and South America, while the genus Psorophora contains some troublesome pest species in North and South America, as well as a few transmitting arboviruses (Service, 2008).\n\nMany species, although not carriers of any disease, can nevertheless be troublesome because of the serious biting nuisances they cause.\n\nThe mosquito is one of the insects that have come to be known by man especially in homes for their bites which elicits the formation of antibodies. This is due to the venom that contains toxic protein, which may be inoculated as a result of these bites. It can also cause sharp-pains with some allergic tendencies. Although it does not only bite, but can also serve as nuisance by causing discomfort to their hosts (especially higher vertebrates) as a result of their sounds(Richard, 1993).\n\nMosquitoes are also widely spread due to their high adaptability, higher reproductive rate, wings, which makes them long distance travellers. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in places where stagnant waters are found. For example pools, ditches, gutters, rivers, streams and other places (Patel et al., 2012)\n\nAlthough some species of mosquitoes do not bite people, rather they prefer birds or amphibians hosts. Certain mosquito species prefers to feed during the daytime, while others feed at night (Ilahi,2013). Various mosquito species have evolved to seek out and lay their eggs in specific locations (Patriciaet al., 2014).\n\nFemale mosquitoes lay their eggs only in water; some species lay their eggs in running water, others in woodland pools, marshes, swamps, estuaries, or in containers such as rain barrels (Service, 2008).\n\n1.1      STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM \n\nMosquitoes are vicious biters and their bites constitute biting nuisance, allergic reactions, skin irritations, scratching, restlessness and sleepless nights (Onyidoet al., 2009). Some biteduring the day while others bite during the night or at both night and day periods. Through their blood sucking habits, they act as vectors of a variety of\nhuman pathogens\nincluding viruses, bacteria, protozoa and helminthic diseases. They transmit to man such deadly diseases as malaria, yellow fever, filariasis,dengue and various forms of viral encephalitis (Ukpaiand Ajoku, 2003). \n\nThe anopheles mosquitoes especially, Anophelesgambiae, transmit malaria and filariasis. The Aedesmosquitoes particularly  Aedesaegypti, A. albopictus, A. africanus, A. luteocephalusand  A. simpsoni, transmit yellow fever, dengue, haemorrhagic fevers and various forms of viral encephalitis. The Culexmosquitoes particularly Culex quinquefasciatus are very important transmitters of filarial worms especially Wuchereriabancrofti which causes elephantiasis. They also transmit various forms of viral encephalitis (Onyidoet al., 2009).\n\nMosquitoes also bite livestock and transmit some animal diseases like fowl pox disease of poultry, myxomatosis of rabbits, rift valley fever of sheep, encephalitis of horses and heartworm disease of dogs (Service, 1980).\n\nAll these diseases cause high death toll on both human and animal populations and lead to poor socio-economic development of many countries.\n\n1.2     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RESEARCH  \n\n The mosquitoes remain a major vector of killer diseases in every part of the world, and Nigeria is not an exception. They also cause nuisance by the sound they make. But they serve as a vital ecological function in that their larvae, pupae, and adults are important food source for fishes, birds, bats, frogs and insects (Patricia et al., 2014).\n\nAlthough the occurrence of various species of mosquitoes may be seen to vary from one location to another, the result obtained in this study would high-light some important information on the diversity and distribution of mosquitoes as well as help in designing an effective control   measure.   \n\n1.3     AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE RESEARCH\n\n The aim of the research is to determine the relative abundance and\n\ndistribution of mosquito species within Sokoto Metropolis.\n\n          The objectives of this research are to:\n\n•      Identify the species within the areas under study.\n\n•      Determine the most abundant species within the area.\n\n•      Determine the distribution of mosquito species within the study areas based on area of collection, sex and feeding state.\n\n\n",

Overt hypothyroidism is associated with significant increase in circulating concentration of total and low density lipoproteins cholesterol (LDL-C) (Elder et al.,1990; Staubet al.,1992; O’Brien et al.,1993).\n\nSeveral cross-sectional studies have examined the association between thyroid dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities, however, few studies have looked at this in Type 2diabetes mellitus (Tasminet al., 2011).Two of such studies on thyroid dysfunction in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were reported in Portugal and Jordan (Perroset al, 1995;Radaideh and Ajlouni, 2004).The study by Ghazali and Abbeyesuku, (2010) on prevalence of thyroid dysfunction on Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was in Ibadan, Nigeria.Cordosoet al., (1995) reported on Type 1 diabetic Nigerians in Lagos while Udionget al, (2007) studied a mixed population of diabetic Nigerians in Calabar.Therefore, there is need to evaluate, the pattern of thyroid dysfunction in Type 2 diabetic population in Sokoto metropolis.\n\n1.1             Justification\n\nTherelationship between Thyroid dysfunction (TD) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by a complex interaction of inter-dependence of physiologic and biochemistry of insulin and its influence on the metabolism of\ncarbohydrates\n,proteins and lipid.Screening of thyroid dysfunction especially at subclinical dysfunction,in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is justifiable because most patients can be asymptomatic.  \n\n1.2             Aim\n\nThe aim of the work is to evaluate thyroid dysfunction in Type 2 diabetic patients attending Endocrinology Clinic (Diabetic Clinic) of UsmanuDanfodiyo\n\nUniversity Teaching Hospital,Sokoto, Sokoto State.    \n\n1.3Specific Objectives\n\n1.

        "content": "DEVELOPING THREE RECIPE USING MORINGA OLEIFERA LEAVE POWDER FOR CHILDREN\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE 1.1       INTRODUCTION             BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\n“Life on these planets has been likened to a pyramid: a pyramid with an unbelievably wide base and a small apex…… Humans are some where near the top but not at the top because they are omnivores. They are one of those lucky animals that can subsist on a wide range of food, vegetable and animal” (Seymour, 2003). Although Seymour rightly says human can survive on a wide range of food, it is also known that it’s not every food when eaten that provides the body with the nutrients that it needs, and not having the right nutrients one needs can lead to malnutrition.\n\nRecently the concept of bioversity in the form of food based supplementation as a mechanism to possibly provide diversity to the diets of people is prominent in nutrition research on food sources available in Africa and Asia (John’s 2003). It is a concern that the original or cultural knowledge of people concerning foods and nutritional value thereof are being lost to diet transition with migration and urbanization (Kuhnlein, 2002). The food compositions of a diverse range of foods have been analyzed and more still have to be analyzed as initiated in FAO projects lately (FAO, 2008).\n\nJohns (2003) and Kuhnlein (2008) suggests that with the knowledge of nutritional analysis a range of foods could be introduced to supplement the diet of a house hold to improve food and nutritional security. Both authors view more research on traditional food, such as traditional leafy vegetables, and its contribution in micro nutrient contents as a positive step toward health promotion or intervention strategies\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\n-                      MORINGA OLEIFERA PLANT, AS A NUTRITIUOUS FOOD SOURCE\n\nMoringa oleifera plant belongs to the moringaceae family, which is a single genus family with 14 known species of the 14 known species, moringa oleifera plant is the most widely known and utilised species.\n\nMoringa is nature to the sub-Himalayan region of India and it is now naturalized in many countries in Africa, Saudi Arabia, South East Asia, the Caribbean and South America (muno, muhilcambele, and Sarwatt, 2003) it is a feat growing tree, which can reach 12m in height at maturity. The plant is also know as drumstick tree, deemed from the shape of the pods resembling a drumstick.\n\nMoringa has received attention in many countries in the tropic and sub-tropics and its leaves, pods and seeds from part of the traditional cuisine in these countries. Although moringa is used in West, Central and East Africa and although it growns in some parts of South Africa, the plant itself, as well as its uses, are mostly unknown to South Africans in general (National research Council, 2006) literature  study and a few informal discussions held in Tshwome and Mokopane in the Ganiteng and Lumpopo provinces of South Africa respectively indicate that although some people use moringa in their diets (mostly Indians) its usage is not documented in South Africa. However, the listing of moringa as a herb in South Africa is on the increase. There is therefore an opportunity to introduce moringa as a food source, which could lead to an increase in diversity of the dietary intake, especially among rural populations of South Africa.\n\nFahey (2005) in a scientific publication, refer to popular publications promoting moringa as a nutrient dense food source and give the following information. The importance of moringa lies in the high nutritional value of its leaves, pod and seeds. “100g of moringa leaves contain four times more vitamin A than the same quality of carrots; four times the calcium in a cup of milk; more iron than 100g of spinachi; seven times the vitamin C in 100g of bananas. The protein quality of moringa leaves also rivals that of milk and eggs” (Dahey, 2005). The scientific determined nutritional values reported in the literature of moringa leaves and pods are documented and discussed in detail.\n\nTherefore, moringa is a relatively good source of vitamins, minerals and essential amino acids and could be considered as a good alternative to be used to help alleviate micronutrient malnutrition of household as well as national level.\n\n 1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nMoringa leaf is not so common to people in Nigeria and so many people are not familiar with it.\n\nThe leaf is not common in our environment for people to make use of properly.\n\n1.3     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe purpose of these research study is to highlight the use of moringa and traditional green leafy and include the planning of intervention strategies and it we able use to know the important roles moringa places as a good source of food.\n\n1.4     THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nThe research aim to investigate the usage of moringa leaves in the diets of existing users and to investigate the possibility of introducing the plant to households in need of diversifying their dietary intake.\n\nThe research objectives areas follows\n\n(1)               To established the usage patterns of moringa in diets, reason for usage and associated indigenous knowledge. \n\n(2)               To assess variations in peri-urban and traditional Bapedi households in terms of diet diversification.\n\n\n",

Found in the northern parts of the country. Lipoproteins are the principal steroid or fat that is synthesized in the liver or intestines of animals. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the consistent or recurrent inability of a man to attain or maintain penile erection, sufficient for sexual activity (2nd international consultation on sexual dysfunction Paris, June 28th –July 1st 2003). Following the discovery and introduction of burantashi research on the mechanism underlying penile erection, had an enormous boost and many preclinical and clinical papers have been published in the last five years on the peripheral regulation of, and the mediators involved in human penile erection. The most widely accepted risk factors for e.g. are discussed. The research is focused on human data and the safety and effectiveness of burantashi stem as a phosphodiesterase – 5- inhibitors (PDEs) used to treat erectile dysfunction.\n\n1\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nErectile dysfunction, ED, is a sexual dysfunction that affects the reproductive systems of both men and women. By definition according to National Institute of Health consensus Development Panel on impotence (1993), in Males, it is a sexual dysfunction characterized with the inability to develop or maintain an erection of the penis sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. It is also known as Male impotence or Baby D syndrome, while in women, according to American Psychiatric Association (1994), it is characterized with the persistent or recurrent inability to attain, or maintain until completion of the sexual activity, an adequate Lubrication- Swelling response that otherwise is present during female sexual arousal and sexual activity is thus prevented. Hence, it is called Women impotence or female erectile dysfunction.\n\nThe word impotence may also be used to describe other problems that may interfere with sexual intercourse and reproduction, such as lack of Sexual Desire and problems with ejaculation or orgasm. Using the term\n\n“erectile dysfunction,” however makes it clear that those other problems are not involved (NIH, 2005).\n\nAn erection occurs as a hydraulic effect due to blood entering and being retained in sponge-like bodies within the penis and clitoris. The process is most often than not initiated as a result of sexual arousal, when signals are transmitted from the brain to nerves in the pelvis.\n\n2\n\nErectile dysfunction is, therefore indicated when an erection is consistently difficult or impossible to produce, despite arousal (Laumann et al., 1999).\n\n1.1 PREVALENCE OF ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION IN WOMEN\n\nErectile dysfunction which is known as Female erection dysfunction in women occurs in about 43% of American Women (NIH Consensus Conference, 1993). And this medical Condition is a persistent or recurrent inability to attain or maintain clitoral erection until completion of the sexual activity, an adequate Lubrication –Swelling response that is normally present during Female sexual arousal and sexual activity is therefore, absent. The individual having the condition is said to experience frigidity (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Again,\n\nAccording to Otubu et al. (1998) about 8.7% of Women suffer from this very condition in the United States while between 35.3 - 40%, according to Adequnloye (2002) and Eze (1994) of Women in Nigeria suffer from this condition. Spector and Carey (1994) reported 5-10% in the United States.\n\nIn addition, Female erectile dysfunction occurs at any age but majorly in old age. Hence, the most significant age related change is menopause (Karen, 2000) and (Rod et al., 2005). However, erectile dysfunction may be caused by diabetes, atherosclerosis, hormonal imbalances, neurological problems etc. (Organic causes) or stress, depression etc.\n\nBecause treating the underlying causes (Organic or Psychological), the first line treatment of ED consists of a trial of PDES inhibitor (the first of which was Sildenafil or Viagra). In some cases, treatment can involve prostag-Landin tablets in the Urethra, intravenous injection with a fine needle into the penis or clitoris that causes swelling of Penis or Clitoris Pump or Vascular surgery, estrogen replacement therapy for the women etc.\n\nAlthough there are various methods and techniques that are used to treat this very condition, however, for the purpose of this project, the treatment is restricted to Yohimbe, an extract from Pausinystalia yohimbe.\n\n1.2 PREVALENCE OF ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION IN MEN\n\nErectile dysfunction, ED, varies in severity; some men have a total inability to achieve an erection, others have inconsistent ability to achieve an erection, and still others can sustain only brief erection. The variation in severity of erectile dysfunction makes estimating its frequency difficult.\n\nMany men also are reluctant to discuss erectile dysfunction with their doctors, and thus, the condition is under-diagnosed. Nevertheless, experts have estimated that ED affects 30 million men in the United States. Again, according to the statistical research carried out by Adegunloye (2002) and Eze (1994) respectively in Nigeria, results shows that about 23-26.4% of men suffer from this condition while according to Spector and Carey (1999) discovered that about 4-9% of men suffer from the condition in the United States.\n\nWhile erectile dysfunction can occur at any age, it is uncommon among young men and more common in the elderly. By the age of 45, most men have experienced erectile dysfunction at least some of the time. According to the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, complete impotence increases from 5% among Men 40 years of age to 15% among Men 70 years and older. Population studies conducted in the Netherlands found out that some degree of ED occurred in 20% of Men between 50 - 54 and in 50% of men between ages 70 - 78. In 1998, the National Ambulatory Medical care Survey counted 1,520,000 Doctor Offices visited for ED.\n\n1.3 OBJECTIVE STUDY AND AIMS\n\nThis project focuses to give a clear picture of the effect on erectile tissues of the Penis, Clitoris of both Men and Women.\n\n1.4 NITRIC OXIDE-CYCLIC GMP PATHWAY WITH SOME\n\nEMPHASIS ON CAVERNOSAL CONTRACTILITY\n\nNitric Oxide (NO) is formed from the conversion of L- arginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS), endothelial (eNOS), and inducible (iNOS). nNOS is expressed in penile neurons innervating the corpus Cavernosum, and eNOS protein expression has been identified primarily in both Cavernosal Smooth Muscle and endothelium. NO is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells and stimulates the activity of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), leading to an increase in cyclic guanosine- 3‟,5‟,-Monophosphate (cGMP) and, finally, to Calcuim depletion from the cytosolic space and Cavernous Smooth muscle relaxation. The effect of cGMP are mediated by cGMP dependent Protein Kinase, cGMP-gated ion channels, and cGMP-regulated Phosphodiesterases (PDE). Thus, cGMP effect depends on the expression of a Cell-Specific cGMP-receptor protein in a given cell type. Numerous systemic vasculature diseases that cause erectile dysfunction (ED) are highly associated with endothelial dysfunction, which has been shown to contribute to decrease erectile function in men and a number of animal models of penile erection. Based on the increasing knowledge of intracellular signal propagation in cavernous smooth muscle tone regulation, selective PDE inhibitors have recently been introduced in the treatment of ED. Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inactivates cGMP, which terminates NO-cGMP-mediated SMooth Muscle relaxation. Inhibition of PDE5 is expected to enhance penile erection by preventing cGMP\n\ndegradation. Development of pharmacologic agents with this effect has closely paralleled the emerging science.\n\n﴾International Journal of impotence Research (2004)﴿. Nitric oxide (NO) was first described by Stuehr and Marletta (1985) as a product of activated murine machrophages. Also, the substance known as endothelium- derived relaxing factor (EDRF), described by Furchgott and Zawadzki (1980), has been identified as NO.\n\nSoluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), responsible for the enzymatic conversion of guanosine -5- triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine -3‟5‟-monophosphate (cGMP), was first identified as a constituent of mammalian cells almost three decades ago. No and cGMP together comprise an especially wide-ranging signals transduction system when one considers the many roles of cGMP in physiological regulation, including smooth muscle relaxation, visual transduction, intestinal ion transport, and platelet function.\n\nErectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the constituent inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance and is considered to be a natural process of ageing. Studies have shown that ED is caused by inadequate relaxing of the corpus cavernosum with defeat in NO production.\n\nIt is clear that NO is the predominant neurotransmitter responsible for cavernasal Smooth muscle relaxation and hence penile erection. Its action is medicated through the generation of the second messenger cGMP. Neutrally, derived NO has been established as a mediator of smooth muscle relaxation in the penis and it is thought that constitutive forms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) work to mediate the convesion of GTP to the intracellular second messenger cGMP in smooth muscle cells. An increase in cGMP modulates cellular events, such as relaxation of smooth muscle cells.\n\nThis review will describe current knowledge of cellular events involved in cavernosal relaxation and the range of putative factors involved in NO-mediated relaxation.\n\n\n",

        "content": "NUTRITIONAL POTENTIAL OF SYNSEPALUM DULCIFICUM PULP AND THE EFFECTOF THE METHANOLIC EXTRACT ON SOME BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS IN ALBINO RATS\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe worsening food crisis and the consequent widespread prevalence of malnutrition in developing and under-developed countries have resulted in high mortality and morbidity rates, especially among infants and children in low-income groups (Enujiugba and Akanbi, 2005). Food has been defined as any substance containing primarily carbohydrates, fats, water, protein, vitamins and minerals that can be taken by an animal or human to meet its nutritional needs and sometimes for pleasure. Items considered as food may be sourced from plants, animals or fungus as well as fermented products like alcohol. Food is also anything solid or liquid that has a chemical composition which enables it provide the body with the material from which it can produce heat or any form of energy, provide material to allow for growth, maintenance, repair or reproduction to proceed and supply substances, which normally regulate the production of energy or the process of growth, repair or reproduction. Food is therefore, the most basic necessity of life (Turner, 2006).\n\nNutrition is the science that deals with all the various factors of which food is composed and the way in which proper nourishment is brought about. The average nutritional requirements of groups of people are fixed and depend on such measurable characteristics as age, sex, height, weight, degree of activity and rate of growth. Good nutrition requires a satisfactory diet which is capable of supporting the individual consuming it, in a state of good health by providing the desired nutrients in required amounts. It must provide the right amount of nutrients and fuel to execute normal physical activity. If the total amount of nutrients provided in the diet is insufficient, a state of under- nutrition develops.\n\nPlants are primary sources of medicines, food, shelters and other items used by humans everyday. Their roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds provide for humans (Amaechi, 2009; Hemingsway, 2004). Fruits are sources of minerals, fibre and vitamins which also provide essential nutrients for the human health (Anaka et al., 2009). Some fruits are also known to have antinutritional factors such as phytate and tannins,that can diminish the nutrient bioavailability if they are present at high concentrations (Baum, 2007). It has been reported that these anti-nutritional factors could also help in the treatment and prevention of certain\n\nxxii\n\nimportant diseases like the anti-carcinogenic activities reported for phytic acid which has been demonstrated both invivo and invitro (Anaka et al., 2009).\n\nThe reliance on starchy roots and tubers and certain cereals as main staples result in consumption of non-nutritious foods. The insufficient availability of nutrient rich diets and the high cost of available ones have prompted an intense research into harnessing the potentials of the lesser known and underutilized crops, which are potentially valuable for human and animal foods to maintain a balance between population and agricultural productivity, particularly in the tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world. The challenge of improper nutrition especially in developing countries which include Nigeria, is indeed alarming. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2007) reported that poor nutrition contributes to one out of two deaths associated with infectious diseases among children within five yearsand the aged. Poor diet can have an injurious impact on health, causing deficiency diseases such as scurvy, beriberi and kwashiokor, health-threatening conditions such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and such common other diseases as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and osteoporosis. Under-nutrition among pregnant women in developing countries leads to one out of six infants being born with low birth weight, which is a risk factor for neonatal deaths, learning disabilities, mental retardation, poor health and premature death. One out of three people in developing countries is affected by vitamin and mineral deficiencies making them prone to infectious diseases and impaired psycho intellectual development. Under and chronic nutrition problems and diet related chronic diseases account for more than half of the world’s diseases (WHO, 2007). In most of these side effects or diseases, the biochemical and haematological parameters are usually altered. For a food to be considered safe for human and animal consumption, its effect on these parameters need to be investigated to understand the nutritional potentials and safety of such foods with a view to determining their acceptability.\n\n1.1              Sweeteners\n\nSweeteners are food additives that are used to improve the taste of everyday foods. Natural sweeteners are sweet-tasting compounds with some nutritional value; the major ingredient of natural sweeteners is either mono- or disaccharides. Artificial sweeteners, on the other hand, are compounds that have very little or no nutritional value. This is possible because artificial sweeteners are synthesized compounds that have high-intensities of sweetness, meaning less of\n\nxxiii\n\nthe compound is necessary to achieve the same amount of sweetness. Artificial sweeteners are used in products intended to limit caloric intake or prevent dental cavities. Sugar alcohols are natural compounds with varying degrees of sweetness which are often added to boost or fine tune flavours of products while increasing their sweetness. They are often used in conjuncture with natural or artificial sweeteners in order to achieve a desired degree of sweetness, taste or texture. Sugar alcohols typically provide some amount of nutrition but have other benefits such as not affecting insulin response or promoting tooth decay which makes them a popular sweetening choice.\n\n1.1.1          Common Sweeteners and Their Production\n\nA sugar substitute is a food additive that replicates the effect of sugar in taste, but usually has less food energy. Some sugar substitutes are natural while others are synthetic, those that are not natural are referred to as artificial sweeteners (Mattes and Popkin, 2009). An important class of sugar substitutes is known as high-intensity sweeteners. These are compounds with sweetness that is many times that of sucrose, a common table sugar. As a result, much less sweetener is required, and energy contribution often negligible. The sensation of sweetness caused by these compounds is sometimes notably different from sucrose, so they are often used in complex mixtures that achieve the most natural sweet sensation. This may be seen in soft drinks labelled as \"diet\" or \"light\"; they contain artificial sweeteners and often have notably different mouth feel. In the United States, six intensely-sweet sugar substitutes have been approved for use (Mattes and Popkin, 2009). They are saccharin, aspartame, sucralose, neotame, acesulfame potassium, and stevia. The US Food and Drug Administration regulates artificial sweeteners as food additives. The majority of sugar substitutes approved for food use are artificially-synthesized compounds. However, some bulk natural sugar substitutes are known, including sorbitol and xylitol, which are found in berries, fruit, vegetables and mushrooms (Mattes and Popkin, 2009). Some non-sugar sweeteners are polyols, also known as \"sugar alcohols.\" These are, in general, less sweet than sucrose, but have similar bulk properties and can be used in a wide range of food products. Sometimes the sweetness profile is 'fine-tuned' by mixing high-intensity sweeteners. As with all food products, the development of a formulation to replace sucrose is a complex proprietary process.\n\nxxiv\n\n1.1.1.2 Natural Sweeteners\n\nNatural sweeteners are extracted from natural products without any chemical modifications during the production or extraction process. Some of these sweeteners have been in use for decades while other for centuries. Natural sweeteners are well known and their production processes have been perfected over time making their cost low and leaving their demand high.\n\n1.1.1.2.1 Honey\n\nHoney is a sweet food made by certain insects using nectar from flowers. The variety produced by honey bees is the one most commonly referred to and is the type of honey collected by beekeepers and consumed by humans. Honey produced by other bees and insects has distinctly different properties. Honey bees transform nectar into honey by a process of regurgitation and evaporation. They store it as a food source in wax honeycombs inside the beehive (National Honey Board, 2012). Beekeeping practices encourage overproduction of honey so that the excess can be taken without endangering the bee colony. Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose and has approximately the same relative sweetness as that of granulated sugar (74% of the sweetness of sucrose, a disaccharide) (NHB, 2012). It has attractive chemical properties for baking, and a distinctive flavour which leads some people to prefer it over sugar and other sweeteners. Most micro-organisms do not grow in honey because of its low water activity (Arcot and Brand-Miller, 2005). The main uses of honey are in cooking, baking, as a spread on breads, and as an addition to various beverages such as tea and as a sweetener in some commercial beverages. Honey is also used as an adjunct in beer. Its glycaemic index ranges from 31 to 78, depending on the variety (Arcot and Brand-Miller, 2005).\n\nHoney is a mixture of sugars and other compounds. With respect to carbohydrates, honey is mainly fructose (about 38.2%) and glucose (about 31.0%).The remaining carbohydrates in honey include maltose, sucrose, and other complex carbohydrates (Martos et al., 2000). Honey contains trace amounts of several vitamins and minerals (Gheldof et al., 2002). As with all nutritive sweeteners, honey is mostly sugars and is not a significant source of vitamins or minerals. Honey also contains tiny amounts of several compounds thought to function as antioxidants, including chrysin, pinobanksin, vitamin C, catalase, and pinocembrin (Gheldof et\n\nxxv\n\nal., 2002). The specific composition of any batch of honey depends on the flowers available to the bees that produce the honey. A typical honey analysis shows the following: fructose: 38.2%, glucose: 31.0%, sucrose: 1.5%, maltose: 7.2%, water: 17.1%, higher sugars: 1.5%, ash: 0.2%. Honey has a density of about 1.36 kg/L (36% denser than water) (NHB, 2012). The pH of honey is between 3.2 and 4.5. This relatively acidic pH level prevents the growth of many bacteria (Arcot and Brand-Miller, 2005).\n\n1.1.1.2.2                    Maple Syrup\n\nMaple syrup is a sweetener made from the sap of some maple trees. In cold climate areas, these trees store sugar in their roots before the winter and the sap which rises in the spring can be tapped and concentrated (Ball, 2007). The sap has only 3 to 5% total solids, consisting mainly of sucrose. Other components of the maple syrup include organic acids (primarily malic acid) and minerals (potassium and calcium), amino compounds (trace) and vitamins (trace). Maple Syrup has about the same 50 cal/tbsp as white cane sugar. However, it also contains significant amounts of potassium (35 mg/tbsp), calcium (21 mg/tbsp), small amounts of iron and phosphorus, and trace amounts of β- complex vitamins. Its sodium content is as low as 2 mg/tbsp. The sugar content of sap averages 2.5% and the sugar content of syrup averages 66.5% (Ball, 2007).\n\n1.1.1.2.3                      Molasses\n\nMolasses is a viscous byproduct of sugar cane or sugar beets processing into sugar. The quality of molasses depends on the maturity of the sugar cane or sugar beet, the amount of sugar extracted, and the method of extraction exployed (Taubes, 2011). Molasses has the molecular formula C6H12NNaO3S, molecular weight of 201.22 g/mol, and a density of 1.41 g/cm3 (Taubes, 2011). A typical composition of molasses shows the following substances: sucrose 35.9 %, fructose 5.6 %, nitrogen 1.01 %, reducing substances 11.5 %, glucose 2.6 %, and sulfur 0.78 % (Taubes, 2011).\n\n1.1.1.2.4                      Stevia\n\nStevia is one of the newest sweeteners available in the market. It has been known since 1899 for its sweet taste and has been cultivated in Japan since 1970. It was not until recently that\n\nxxvi\n\na safe and successful extraction of glycosides (the chemical in the Stevia plant which gives it a sweet taste) allowed for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve Stevia as a general sweetener (Raji and Mohamed, 2012). Stevia is also known under different trade names as\n\nTruViaand PureVia patents by Coca Cola and Pepsi(Raji and Mohamed, 2012). Many different forms of Stevia as sweeteners exist such as: Reb A, B, C, D, Rebiana, Stevioside,\n\nSunCrystalsand Enliten. Each has a small variation in the manufacturing process or how it is used.\n\nStevia is an all natural sweetener because it is extracted from the Stevia plant and undergoes no chemical changes in the manufacturing process. This makes it very desirable to many consumers looking for healthy alternatives to sucrose sugar. Stevia is a general term referring to a plant, Steviarebaudiana (Bertoni), native to Paraguay. The plant contains a number of diterpene glycosides that taste sweet; the main ones are stevioside and rebaudioside A. These glycosides are 200 and 300 times sweeter than sucrose respectively (Mattes and Popkin, 2009).\n\n1.1.1.2.5                      Sucrose\n\nSucrose is a disaccharide, formed from the monosaccharides glucose and fructose. It is the organic compound commonly known as table sugar and sometimes called saccharose.It has the molecular formula C12H22O11 and a molecular weight of 342.30 g/mol. In sucrose, the component sugars glucose and fructose are linked via an α (alpha) 1 on the glucose, to a β (beta) 2 on the fructose glycosidic linkage.\n\nSucrose forms a major element in confectionery and desserts. Cooks use it for sweetening, its fructose component which has almost double the sweetness of glucose makes sucrose distinctively sweet in comparison to other carbohydrate foods (Taubes, 2011). It can also act as a food preservative when used in sufficient concentrations. It is a common ingredient in many processed and junk foods.\n\nxxvii\n\nFig 1: Structure of sucrose (Stryer, 1995)\n\n1.1.1.3 Artificial Sweeteners\n\nTable 1: Uses for common artificial sweeteners\n\nChemical\n\nTrade Names\n\nSweetness\n\nUses\n\nName\n\nAcesulfame\n\nSweet One®\n\n200 times\n\nFound in more than 4,000 productsincluding\n\nSunett®\n\nsweeter than\n\ncandies, tabletop sweeteners, chewing gums,\n\nsugar\n\nbeverages, dessert and dairyproduct mixes,\n\nbaked goods,alcoholic beverages, syrups,\n\nrefrigerated and frozen desserts,and sweet\n\nsauces and toppings.\n\nAspartame\n\nEqual®\n\n180 times\n\nFound in more than 6,000 productsincluding\n\nNutraSweet®\n\nsweeter than\n\ncarbonated powderedsoft drinks, chewing gum,\n\nNatraTaste®\n\nsugar\n\nconfections, gelatins, dessertmixes, puddings\n\nand fillings, frozendesserts, yoghurt, tabletop\n\nsweeteners, and somepharmaceuticals.\n\nNeotame\n\nNone yet\n\n8,000-13,000\n\nApproved for use in beveragesdairy products,\n\ntimes sweeter\n\nfrozen desserts,baked goods, and gums.\n\nthan sugar\n\n\n",

The immune system is a system of biological structure and processes within an organism that protect against disease. It is designed to protect the host from invading pathogens and to eliminate disease (Sharmaet al., 2004; Naga and Rajeshwari, 2014).Immune system is core to maintenance of health and general well-being and is intricately associated with the four major causes of death which include injury, infection, degenerative disorders and cancer. Immunity is concerned with the recognition and disposal of foreign materials that enter the body while immunology is the study of how immune components respond and interact, of the consequences (desirable and otherwise), of their activity and of the ways in which they can be advantageously increased or reduced. There are two aspects of immune protection, the innate response and the adaptive response (Atal et al., 1986; Guyton and Hall, 2006). Innate immunity is present at birth, and provides the first barrier against infectious micro-organisms. Adaptive immunity is the second barrier against infections. It is acquired later in life and retains a memory of the invaders it has encountered (Nworu, 2007). Innate and adaptive mechanisms can be modified by substances to either enhance or suppress the ability to resist invasion by pathogens (Williams and Barclay1988).\n\nThe immune system is known to be involved in the etiology as well as the pathophysiologic mechanism of many diseases (Kalpeshet al., 2009). Immunology is thus probably one of the most rapidly developing areas of biomedical research holding great promise with regard to prevention and treatment of a wide range of disorders (Patilet al., 2012). Key elements of the immune response include recognition of self and non-self (Karlsen and Dryberg, 1998), regulation of immune response (Jerne, 1984); termination of immune response after effective control of offending agent (Parjis and Abbas, 1998) and establishment of a repertoire of memory cells for the future. The rise in immunological disorders confronting mankind today is alarming. This rise is due to different etiologies including environmental and nutritional habits. Disorders of the immune system include multiple sclerosis, arthritis, congestive heart failure, autoimmune disorders, several inflammatory disorders and infectious diseases such as AIDS, malaria, typhoid fever and the most dreaded Ebola virus disease. Immune function disorder is responsible for these and other diseases (Patwardhan et al., 1990). The immune system can be influenced by nutritional/metabolic status (Procaccini et al., 2013). Agents that alter the immune system either by stimulating or suppressing it are of great significance in managing\n\nxxi\n\nimmunological disorders and are known as immune-modulators (Srivathsa, 2006). Modulation of immune responses to alleviate various diseases has been of interest for many years (Sharma et al., 2004). In HIV and other infectious diseases, stimulation/up-regulation of the immune system is a highly desired goal. Immuno-stimulatory therapy is now recognized as an alternative to conventional chemotherapy for a variety of disease conditions involving impaired immune response of the host (Upadhaya, 2007; Ganjuet al., 2003). Immuno-stimulators are known to support T-cell function, activate macrophages and granulocytes and complement natural killer cells apart from the production of various effector molecules generated by activated cells (Wagner et al., 2003). The function and the efficacy of the immune system may be influenced by many exogenous factors like food and pharmaceuticals, physical and psychological stress and hormones. An immune-modulator essentially helps to optimize immune function by normalizing the process and thereby maintaining balance. Immune regulation is a complex balance between regulatory and effector cells and any imbalance in immunological mechanism can lead to a disease condition (Sehraet al., 2008). In healthy individuals immune-stimulants are expected to serve as prophylactic or promotive agents by enhancing basal levels of immune response and in individuals with impaired immunity they act as immunotherapeutic agent (Agrawal and Singh, 1999).\n\nThe immune system of humans is intricately interwoven with oxidative processes in the body. High oxidative stress usually breaks down the immune system, precipitates radicals as well as severe diseases and this must be prevented (Halliwell, 1992). Studies have emphasized the therapeutic importance of plant-derived immune-modulants with antioxidant activities (Allam, 2009; Guo et al., 2009). Modulation of the immune system as well as optimizing oxidative processes of the body with aid of natural products represents a field of drug development-based research witnessing unprecedented upsurge in recent times (Nworu, 2007). A newer approach to therapeutics is to search for potent immune-modulating substances preferably with synergistic antioxidant activity. Indeed there has been growing interest in isolating and characterizing compounds with immune-modulatory and antioxidant activities (Wang et al., 2004). It has been established that most pharmacologic activities are related to the immune-modulatory and antioxidant activities of plant secondary metabolites (Okonji et al., 1999).\n\nMore than a quarter of medicines in use today come from plants and these medicinal plants serve as therapeutic alternatives, safer choices or in some cases as the only effective treatment (Sharififaret al., 2009). The unmatched availability and chemical diversity characterizing natural products provide unlimited opportunities for development of new drug leads (Cos et al., 2006). Natural products are still major sources of innovative therapeutic agents for various conditions\n\nxxii\n\nincluding infectious diseases (Clardy and Walsh 2004). Increased interest in herbs has prompted scientific scrutiny of their therapeutic potential and safety (Atal et al., 1986). The use of products of plants and animal origin as medicinal agents is predicated upon the belief that they promote positive health and maintain organic resistance against infections by re-establishing the bodys̓equilibrium and conditioning of body tissues(Fulzele et al., 2003). Use of plant remedies again is perceived as a natural approach to disease treatment. Equally medicinal plants are rich sources of substances which are claimed to induce para-immunity (Koreet al., 2010) and relieve oxidative stress (Njoku and Adikwu, 1997). Phytochemical constituents such as terpenoids, steroids, proteins, tannins and flavonoids are considered responsible for immune-modulatory properties exhibited by plants (Kuo et al., 2004).Telfairia occidentalis Hook F and Tectona grandis Linn are well known for haematinic and other medicinal properties. However there is no documented evidence of any seriousinvestigation of their immune-modulatory effects (Kayode and Kayode, 2010). The search for safe and potent immune-modulating substances preferably with synergistic antioxidant activities continues to attract great research interest (Wang et al.,\n\n2004). Thereis no doubt that immune-modulators hold great promise for control and prevention of infections but is yet to be fully exploited (Nworu, 2007).\n\n1.1.1 Immuno-modulation\n\nImmuno-modulation is a process which alters the immune system of an organism by interfering with its functions (Agrawal, 2010). An immuno-modulator therefore is a substance, biological or synthetic which can stimulate, suppress or modulate any of the components of the immune system. This could result in immuno-stimulation/enhancement or immuno-suppression (Dhasarathan et al., 2010; Vinothapooshan and Sundar, 2011). Immuno-modulatorsalter the immune system by interacting with it to up-regulate or down-regulate specific aspect of the host response (Stanilove et al., 2005; Utoh-Nedosa et al., 2009) they are of great importance in treating immunological disorders (Srivathsa, 2006). They are also known as biologic response modifiers or immunoregulators which function as drugs, leading predominantly to a non-specific stimulation of immunological defense mechanisms (Tzianabos, 2010). Regulation of the immune response by an immunoregulator is a normalization process that helps to optimize the immune response (Sehra et al., 2008; Agrawal, 2010). Immunomodulators may include some bacterial products, lymphokines and plant derived substances. The effects of immunomodulators can be classified into three which are stimulation, suppression and restoration of the immune system. Unlike vaccines, most immunomodulatory agents are not real antigens but antigenomimetics or so-called mitogens. They do not stimulate the development of memory lymphocytes, thus the effect of immunomodulatory agents towards specific immune system will\n\nxxiii\n\nbe reduced after a short of period of time (Wagner and Fintelman, 1999). The ability of immunomodulators to enhance or suppress immune responses can depend on a number of factors such as dosage, route of administration, timing and frequency of administration (Tzianabos, 2010). Immunomodulation generally entails the adjustment of the immune system to the desired level and could be achieved by the use of natural as well as synthetic agents from plants and chemicals respectively. The immunomodulatory effect of plants can be explained most preferably using two scenario:immuno-stimulation and immuno-suppression.\n\n1.1.1.2 Immuno-stimulation\n\nImmuno-stimulation is a process that involves the activation of the immune system activity and that of its components. Immuno-stimulatory agents are used often to achieve this purpose and are grouped into specific and non-specific immune stimulants. Biologic response modifiers (BRM) are substances that stimulate the body’s response to infection and disease. The body is known to produce these substances in inappreciable quantity hence the need for exogenous supplementation from diets and pharmaceuticals. Immunostimulators are known to support T-cell function, activate macrophages, granulocytes and complement natural killer cells apart from affecting the production of various effector molecules generated by activated cells (Wagner et al., 2003). Immunostimulatory therapy has been long recognized as alternative to conventional chemotherapy for a variety of disease conditions involving the impaired immune response of the host (Ganju et al., 2003).\n\n1.1.1.3 Immuno-suppression\n\nImmunosuppression is a component of immune modulation and involves the reduction of the activation or efficacy of the immune system. It also involves altering the sensitivity of the immune system and this can be achieved by the use of immuno-suppressive agents. Some portions of the immune system itself have immuno-suppressive effects on other parts and immunosuppression may occur as an adverse reaction to treatment of other conditions. Cytokines have been found to preferentially suppress or stimulate the production of immune cells depending on the prevailing conditions (Liu et al., 2013).The immune system can be manipulated to suppress unwanted responses resulting from autoimmunity and allergy. It therefore functions by reducing the effectiveness of the immune systems response to foreign substances. Other substances that induce immune suppression include rapamycin, pyrogallol and cyclophosphamide (Diken et al., 2013).\n\nxxiv\n\nIn general, immuno-suppression can be induced in some special cases such asin organ transplantto prevent graft rejection and in treating auto-immune diseases.\n\n1.2 Innate Immune System\n\nThe innate immunity is present at birth and does not require specific recognition of an antigen by the immune system (Vollmar, 2005). It is the first line of defense and is primarily mediated by various kinds of natural barriers including physical, chemical and enzymatic barriers. Innate immunity is involved in both humoral and cellular arms of immune response, to protect the host against a vast and diversified range of microbes and their products. The humoral effectors of innate immunity consist of families of soluble proteins such as complement and acute-phase response proteins. These are not only important for the initial neutralization or elimination of microbes, but also alert the host's immunity through the recruitment of a variety of cells at the site of infection of tissue injury. The cellular arm consists of “nonprofessional” somatic cells such as epithelial cells and “professional” immune cells such as various types of tissue phagocytic cells and dendritic cells (Himanshu and Adrian, 2013).The cells of the innate immune system such as dendritic cells (DCs), detect and respond to pathogens through the expression of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), Nod-like receptors, and Dectin-1(Manicassamy and Pulendra, 2009; Takeuchi and Akira, 2010). PRRs bind to β-1,3-glucans, such as curdlan, on the cell wall of the fungi and some bacteria (Brown et al., 2002), thereby activating DCs (Kennedy et al., 2007). This activation results in the production of cytokines which eventually modulate the type of T-cell response.\n\nThrough interaction with DCs, CD4+T-cells can differentiate into a variety of effectorand regulatory subsets, including classical T-helper1 and 2 cells, regulatory T-cells (Treg)and T-helper17 cells. It has been shown that the nature of the cytokines produced by DCs inresponse to various ligands determine the type of T-helper cell response.\n\n1.2.1 Humoral Barriers to Infection\n\nThe anatomical barriers are very effective in preventing colonization of tissues by micro-organisms. However, when there is damage to tissues, the anatomical barriers are breached and infections may occur. Once infectious agents have penetrated tissues, another innate defence mechanism comes into play, namely: acute inflammation. Humoral factors play important roles in inflammation, which is characterized by oedema and the recruitment of phagocytic cells. These humoral factors are found in serum or they are formed at the site of infection.\n\nxxv\n\n1.2.1.1 Inflammatory Response\n\nThe inflammatory process is the reaction of blood vessels which brings about an accumulation of fluid and white blood cells in the extra vascular tissues (Cotran, 1998).Infection with a pathogen triggers an acute inflammatoryresponse in which cellsand molecules ofthe immune system move into the affected site. Theactivation ofcomplement generates C3b, which coatsthe surface of the pathogen. Substancesreleased from the pathogen and from damaged tissuesup-regulate the expression of adhesion moleculeson vascular endothelium,alerting passing cells tothe presence of infection. The cell-surface moleculeL-selectin on neutrophils recognizes carbohydratestructures such as sialyl-LewisXon the vascular adhesionmolecules.The neutrophil rolling along thevesselwall is arrested in its course by these interactions.As the neutrophil becomes activated, it rapidlysheds L-selectin from its surface and replaces it withother cell-surface adhesion molecules, such as the integrins.These integrins bind the molecule E-selectin,which appears on the blood-vessel wall under the influenceof inflammatory mediators such as bacteriallipopolysaccharide and the cytokines;interleukin-1and tumor necrosis factor-α. Complement components,prostaglandins, leukotrienes and other inflammatorymediators all contribute to the recruitmentof inflammatory cells as does an important group ofchemoattractant cytokines; the chemokines (Ogawa and Calhoun, 2006).\n\nInflammation is an important non-specific defense reaction of tissue injury, such as that caused by a pathogen or wound (Prescott et al., 2005). It is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection (Kawai and Akira, 2006). The symptoms are redness, swelling, heat and pain, which are caused by increased blood flow into tissue. Inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines, which are released by injured or infected cells. Eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells (Miller, 2006). Common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells; chemokines that promote chemotaxis and interferons that have anti-viral effects, such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell (Leet al., 2004). Growth factors and cytotoxic factors may also be released. These cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection and promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens (Martins and Leibovich, 2005).Inflammation is part of the complex biological response of vascular tissues to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants. When tissues receive injurious stimuli, they inflame to remove them and to initiate the healing process (Ferrero-Millianiet al., 2007). It is a stereotyped response and therefore considered a mechanism of innate immunity (Abbas et al., 2007).\n\nxxvi\n\nInflammation can be classified as either acute or chronic. Acute inflammation is the initial response of the body to harmful stimuli and is achieved by the increased movement of plasma and leukocytes (especially granulocytes) from the blood into the injured tissues. The intravascular cells important to inflammation are neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes and monocytes. The process of acute inflammation is initiated by cells already present in all tissue mainly resident macrophages, dendritic cells, mastocytes, among others. These cells contain ‘pattern recognition receptors’ (PRRs) which recognize molecules that are broadly shared by pathogens but distinguishable from host molecule and collectively referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). At the onset of aninfection, burn or other injuries; these cells undergo activation and release inflammatory mediators responsible for the clinical signs of inflammation (Cotran, 1998). Vasodilation and its resulting increased blood flow cause the redness and increased heat. Prolonged inflammation known as chronic inflammation leads to progressive shift in the type of cells present at the site of inflammation and is characterized by simultaneous destruction and healing of the tissue from the inflammatory process (Liszewski et al., 1996). Chronic inflammation can however lead to a host of diseases such as hay fever, periodontitis, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and even cancer.Inflammatory mediators have short half-lives and are quickly degraded in the tissue. Hence acute inflammation ceases once the stimulus has been removed.Chronic inflammation on the other hand is a more severe type of inflammation as it is prolonged.\n\nThe chemical factors produced during inflammation include histamine, bradykinin, serotonin, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. These factors sensitize pain receptors, causing vasodilation of the blood vessels at the scene and then attract phagocytes especially neutrophils(Stvitnovaet al., 1995) which then trigger other parts of the immune system by releasing factors that summon other leukocytes and lymphocytes.\n\n1.2.3 Components of the Innate Immune System\n\n1.2.3.1 Complement System\n\nThe complement system is a biochemical cascade that attacks the surfaces of foreign cells. It comprises an assembly of over 20 liver-manufactured, soluble and cell-bound proteins and is named for its ability to \"complement\" the killing of pathogens by antibodies. Complement is the major humoral components of the innate immune response (Rus et al., 2005; Mayer, 2006). Many species have complement systems, including non-mammals like fish and some invertebrates. The complement cascade helps the ability of the antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear pathogens from an organism (Janeway, 2005). It can be recruited and brought into action by the adaptive immune system. Activationof the complement cascade by protease",

Insulin deficiency in turn leads to chronic hyperglycemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism (Kumar et al., 2011).\n\nDuring diabetes, failure of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by fat and muscle cause glucose concentration in the blood to remain high, consequently glucose uptake by insulin-independent tissue increases. Increased glucose flux both enhances oxidant production and impairs antioxidant defenses by multiple interacting non-enzymatic, enzymatic and mitochondrial pathways (Klotz 2002; Mehta et al., 2006). These include activation of protein kinase C isoforms (Inoguchi et al., 2000), increased hexosamine pathway (Kaneto et al., 2001), glucose autoxidation (Brownlee, 2001), increased methylglyoxal and advanced glycation end-product (AGEs) formation (Thornalley, 1998) as well as increased polyol pathway flux ( Lee and Chung, 1999). These seemingly different mechanisms are the results of a single process-that is, overproduction of superoxide by the mitochondrial electron transport system (Tushuizen et al., 2005). This hyperglycaemia-induced oxidative stress ultimately results in modification of intracellular proteins resulting in an altered function and DNA damage, activation of the cellular transcription (NFK B), causing abnormal changes in gene expression, decreased production of nitric oxide, and increased expression of cytokines, growth factors and pro-coagulant and pro-inflammatory molecules (Palmer et al., 1988; Evans et al., 2002; Klotz, 2002; Taniyama and Griendling, 2003). Oxidative stress is responsible for molecular and cellular tissue damage in a wide spectrum of human diseases (Halliwell, 1994), amongst which is diabetes mellitus. Diabetes produces disturbances of lipid profiles, especially an increased susceptibility to lipid peroxidation (Lyons, 1991), which is responsible for increased incidence of atherosclerosis (Guigliano et al., 1996), a major complication of diabetes mellitus . An enhanced oxidative stress has been observed in these patients as indicated by increased free radical production, lipid peroxidation and diminished antioxidant status (Baynes, 1991).\n\nGlobally, the estimated incidence of diabetes and projection for year 2030, as given by International Diabetes Federation is 350 million (Ananda et al., 2012). Currently available pharmacotherapies for the treatment of diabetes mellitus include oral hypoglycemic agents\n\n92\n\nand insulin. However these drugs do not restore normal glucose homeostasis and they are not free from side effects (Bandawane et al., 2011). In view of the adverse effects associated with the synthetic drugs and as plants are safer, affordable and effective, conventional antidiabetic plants can be explored (Kumar et al., 2010). Over 400 traditional plants have been reported for the treatment of diabetes (Ramachandran et al., 2011). Furthermore, following World Health Organization recommendations, investigation of hypoglycemic agents from medicinal plants has become more important (Kumar et al., 2010). Also diabetes has been treated orally with several medicinal plants based on folklore medicine since ancient times.\n\nKigelia africana (Lam.) Benth (Family: Bignoniaceae) plant has many medicinal properties due to the presence of numerous secondary metabolites. These compounds include iridiods, flavonoids, naphthoquinones and volatile constituents (Houghton, 2002; Gorman, 2004; Asekun et al., 2006). Experimentally, the plant has shown antibacterial, antifungal, antineoplastic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties (Saini et al., 2009). Crude extracts of herbs and spices and other materials rich in phenolics are of increasing interest in the food industry because they retard oxidative degradation of lipids and thereby improving the quality and nutritional value of food. Flavonoids, are groups of polyphenolic compounds with known properties, which include free radical-scavenging and anti-inflammatory activities (Frankel, 1995).\n\nAn enhanced oxidative stress has been observed in diabetic patients as indicated by increased free radical production, lipid peroxidation and diminished antioxidant status (Baynes, 1991). In diabetes mellitus, alterations in the endogenous free radical scavenging defense mechanisms may lead to ineffective scavenging of reactive oxygen species, resulting in oxidative damage and tissue injury. Oxidative stress is currently suggested as mechanism underlying diabetes and diabetic complications. Oxidative stress may cause oxidative damage of cellular membranes and changes in the structural and functional integrity of sub- cellular organelles and many produce effects that result in the various complications in diabetic disease (West, 2000). Recently, there has been an upsurge of interest in the therapeutic potentials of plants, as antioxidants in reducing free radical induced tissue injury. Although several synthetic antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene are commercially available, they are quite unsafe and toxic (Viny, et al.,2010). A survey of literature revealed that there is no experimental evidence of the antidiabetic effect of Kigelia africana. Therefore, the present work explores this and will in\n\n93\n\naddition study its potential effect on the oxidative and biochemical parameters of alloxan-induced diabetic rats.\n\n1.1              Kigelia africana\n\n1.1.1        Description of Kigelia africana\n\nNature has been a source of medicinal agents including modern drugs for the thousands of years (Cordell, 2000). Plant based traditional medicine system continues to play an essential role in health care with about 80% of the world’s inhabitants relying mainly on traditional medicines for their primary health care .\n\nKigelia africana (Lam) Benth of Bignoniaceae family is widely distributed in South central and West Africa. It is known as the cucumber or sausage tree because of its huge fruits (average 0.6m in length and 4kg in weight) which hang from long fibrous stalks. It is also known as Balm Khene in Hindi and is distributed all over India but found in abundance in West Bengal. It is found mostly in wetter areas and spread abundantly across wet Savannah and riverine areas (Sofowora et al., 1980). The plant grows approximately 10m high, with odd pinnate, composite opposite leaves; leaflets are ovate- to- oblong in shape and 4-18 cm long. The flowers are found in the spring or summer season, hanging ancillary panicles up to 2 m long. It has a corolla with fused petals, irregularly bell shaped 9-13 cm long, yellowish outside and purple on inside . Fruits are oblong, 30-50 cm long, hanging on stalk for several months.\n\n\n",

The phytochemical constituents and toxicity of the stem bark of both plants were determined by the standard method and the LD50respectively. The methanolic extracts and fractions of the plants was administered to the Wistar rats intraperitoneally daily and the parasitaemia count was determined using the rapid matching method. PCV, WBC and differential counts were determined before and after the administration to ascertain any significant differences. The phytochemical constituents of the stem barks of Acacia nilotica and Khaya senegalensis crude extracts and fractions revealed the following secondary metabolites; Alkaloids, tannins, glycosides, cardiac glycosides, saponins, triterpene, carbohydrates and flavonoids. The LD50 for the crude extract of the stem bark of Acacia nilotica was 707.1mg/kg body weight while the LD50 for the fractions (N-hexane, ethyl acetate and N-butane) was 547.7 mg/kg, 387.3 mg/kg and 707.1 mg/kg body weight respectively. The LD50 for the crude extract of the stem bark of Khaya senegalensis was 547.7mg/kg body weight while the LD50 for the fractions (N-hexane, ethyl acetate and N-butane) was 387.3 mg/kg, 547.7 mg/kg and 223.6 mg/kg body weight respectively. The stem barks of Acacia nilotica and Khaya senegalensis crude extracts (100, 200, 300 and 400mg/kg body weight) and fractions (50, 100, 150 and 200mg/kg body weight) had\n\n\n",

        "content": "THE EFFECT OF COCONUT WATER ON DRUG ACETAMINOPHEN (PARACETAMOL) OVERDOSAGE INDUCED HEPATOTOXICITY IN RABBITS\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nCoconut water was investigated for its possible effect on the acetaminophen (paracetamol) overdosage-induced hepatotoxicity in three groups of albino Wistar rats. Administration of the minimum toxic dose of paracetamol (150mg/kg body weight) to animals (group II) produced significantly (P<0.05) higher levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities when compared to the control group (group I). There was however no significant (P<0.05) aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity. Significantly (p<0.05) higher ALP and ALT activities were also observed in group III (the group administered with paracetamol and treated with coconut water) when compared with the control (group I) and the paracetamol-overdosed group (group II) indicating that the coconut water may have rather enhanced the toxicity of acetaminophen overdosage on the liver. The common use of coconut water as a palliative for drug overdosage is therefore contraindicated.",
