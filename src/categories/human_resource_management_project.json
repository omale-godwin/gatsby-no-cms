The core research questions and hypothesis for this study\r\n were: what are the factors responsible for gender discrimination in \r\nNigeria?  why is there low employment opportunity for women?; \r\norganizational culture has no significant impact on gender \r\ndiscrimination; society has no significant impact on gender \r\ndiscrimination. 200 respondents were randomly selected within Benin. A \r\n5-point Likert scale was developed and validated to collect information \r\nfrom respondents. Secondary data on gender discrimination were obtained \r\nfrom articles and journals. The data collected was analyzed with basic \r\ndescriptive statistics such as frequency and percentage. Regression and \r\ncorrelation coefficient analyses were also made. The core findings from \r\nthe results obtained showed that gender discrimination exist in the \r\nworkplace in Nigeria, it also showed that society and organizational \r\nculture has a major impact in gender discrimination. It was recommended \r\nthat strict laws should be put in place to protect women and also give \r\nthem access to equal economic and political opportunity in Nigeria. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1     Background of the study    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>1.2     Statement of the Research problem    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>1.3     Research Question    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>1.4     Objectives of the Study    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>1.5     Research Hypothesis    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>1.6     Significance of the Study    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>1.7     Scope of the Study    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>2.1     Review of Relevant concepts -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>2.2    Empirical Review    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>2.3     Theoretical Framework    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY<br/>3.1    Introduction    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>3.2     Research Design    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>3.3    Population of the Study    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>3.4     Sample and Sampling Technique    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>3.5     Research Instrument    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>3.6     Method of Data Collection    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>3.7     Method of Data Analysis    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER FOUR: PRESENTATION OF DATA ANALYSIS/DISCUSSION<br/>4.1    Analysis of Respondents Characteristic    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>4.2     Analysis of Research Questions and Discussion of Findings    -    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY, CONCLUSION, AND RECOMMENDATIONS<br/>5.1     Introduction    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>5.2     Summary of findings    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>5.3     Conclusion    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>5.4     Recommendations    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>5.4.1    Policy Recommendation    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>5.4.2    Further Study    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>References    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>Questionnaire    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 Background to the Study<br/>Gender discrimination refers to the practice of granting or denying rights or privileges to a person based on their gender, this kind of discrimination leads to unfair treatment directed to individual or a group on the basis of their gender which denies them their rights, opportunity or resources (Chauraya&amp;Mugodzwa,2012)<br/> Many women do not enjoy the same freedom as men, they are always treated as second class citizens. Gender discrimination in Nigeria is influenced by culture and belief. Ideology is the center of almost all efforts to explain gender discrimination in Nigeria, it is further coupled with the female socio-cultural ascribed roles as being restricted to motherhood deepen their exclusion. Nigeria society has been patriarchal in nature which is a major feature of a traditional society. (Aina 1998) patriarchal is a structure of a set of social relations with material base which enables men to dominate women. Patriarchy is a very strong determinant of male dominance over female, men are trained for leadership activities while women are confined to domestic activities. <br/>According to Olufemi (2010) even though women constitute about sixty percent of the Nigeria population, there are still disproportionate low number of them in senior leadership position in all areas. This patriarchal nature of relationship between men and women in the society was substantiated and justified by men quoting some verses from the holy Bible that Eve was extracted from Adam's rib as proof of men superiority over women. This has been used and it is still use in most occasion with some sort of links with other cultural factors to make the women in the society to accept their position as divine Providence (Otite,2005). <br/> Organization needs competent employees to help achieve his goals and objectives, to get these competent staffs recruitment, selection and promotion take place. Employing or promoting an employee should be based on skills, experience and capacity to perform effectively, gender bias against women should not be allowed to come to play when promoting, recruiting or selecting employee. Women are used for sexual exploitation, sent soliciting for money or contracts, women has more to offer than being a sex object but should be seen as a woman with a powerful mind which is capable of doing well on a job. Employers should look beyond that but look for a capable, skillful employee irrespective of the gender. Research has shown that a recruitment policy devoid of gender discrimination enhances performance of female performance in the organization.<br/>1.2  Statement of the Research Problem<br/>Gender biasness in the face of socio- economic strata of the world seems to be no respecter of any economy. As a result, Nigeria has its own share of the incidence. Right from the pre- colonial traditional Nigeria society to its modern state, women have often been discriminated upon in affairs that led to deplete their contribution to economic growth. Such discrimination is often perceived in grounds that they are the weaker sex.<br/>(UNDP 2009) observes that between 1985 and 2008, inequality in Nigeria worsened from 0.43 to 0.49. in the past decades, women in Nigeria have made notable gain in the workplace however, notwithstanding these gains there is still a wide gap between male and female across almost all occupations in favor of men.it is against the background that the researcher is examining gender discrimination in Nigeria, its causes and how it affects the parties involved. <br/>1.3 Research Questions<br/>1)  What is the implication of discrimination on job performance<br/>2) What are the factors responsible for gender discrimination in Nigeria<br/>3) What are the strategies for promoting gender equality in Nigeria<br/>4) What is the effect of gender discrimination on organization performance<br/>5) Why is there a low employment opportunity for women<br/>1.4 Objectives of the Study<br/> The main objective of this study is to examine gender discrimination on women employment opportunity in Nigeria and the specific objective are:<br/>1) To examine the effect on organization performance<br/>2) To find out why there is low employment opportunities for women<br/>3) To determine how discrimination affect women's performance<br/>4) To determine how human resource personnel can stop discrimination<br/>5) To determine how organization culture contributes to gender discrimination against women<br/>1.5 Research Hypothesis<br/>Hypothesis one: organization culture has no significant impact on gender discrimination<br/>Hypothesis two: society has no significant impact on gender discrimination<br/>Hypothesis three: gender discrimination has no significant impact on employee performance<br/>Hypothesis four: genderdiscrimination has no significant impact on organization performance<br/>1.6 Significance of the Study<br/> The study will give information, data and statistical figures to economic planners, National Bureau of statistics labor force, ministry of women affairs, researchers and employers. It will reveal the contribution of female gender in Nigeria's economic growth, the findings of the research will expose us to understand the causes, the extent of discrimination against female gender. It will also assist the government to further formulate appropriate policies or make laws that will reduce gap that exist between the genders. <br/>1.7 Scope of the Study<br/>This study is designed to have a general view of gender discrimination in Nigeria and its impact. The research intends to focus on the extent of gender discrimination on the three  major ethnic groups(igbos,hausas and yorubas) , two major religion(Christianity and Islam) and also organizational levels in Nigeria. The study is limited to staff of University Of Benin. <br/>1.8 Limitation<br/> In the process of carrying out this study, many challenges where encounter including the following;<br/>°The questionnaire was distributed to small sample of the population of study, the data is not expected to reflect a wide range of perceptive. <br/>°Some respondent shows non-serious behaviour in filling the questionnaire.<br/>° Financial constraint; in the course of carrying out the study, the money spent was more than the money budgeted, and because of that i was not so financial stable which affect the time duration of the study. <br/><br/>\n\nGENDER DISCRIMINATION ON WOMEN EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " GENDER DISCRIMINATION ON WOMEN EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY IN NIGERIA", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>  </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Central to the growth of any organization be it private or public, manufacturing or non-manufacturing firms, it is the effective acquisition, utilization and maintenance of the organization’s human resources. Human resources management therefore is a very critical path to the survival of any organization.<br/>Human resources management (HRM) is the strategic management of the employees who individually and collectively contribute to the achievement of the strategic objectives of the organization.<br/>It is that part of the process of management that is concerned with the management of human relationship and ensuring the physical well being of the employees so that in turn, the employees will be more dedicated to their work which will in turn increased productivity, hence leading to increased corporate performance. Aiming to enable the organization to achieve its strategic goals by attracting, retaining and developing employees, human resource management functions as the link between the organization and the employees. Consequently, the need to develop and implement human resource management and programs that are workable, motivating and result oriented has become more imperative in order to arrest worker’s apathy, declining motivation and poor work attitude that are presently the order of the day in most of our business organizations.<br/>No matter how efficient and sophisticated your tools, equipments and machines are and no matter how vast your financial resources maybe, somebody who is the human element will have to put them to use. It is a well known fact that an adequate supply of physical and financial resources does not alone ensure the economic development of any organization.<br/>Rather it is the entrepreneurial spirit and executive initiative which can utilize these resources profitably for the organization. This is true because human beings are the center and yardstick of everything.<br/>In this work, the researcher will explain the various techniques of developing and sustaining human resources in an organization.</p> <p><strong>1.1     BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong><br/>Modern human resources management as we know it today is of recent origin. It has emerged from a relatively obscure and insignificant position in the early decades of this century to a position of relevance and significance within the purview or scope of management not only in Nigeria but in the world over.<br/>In the pre-independent Nigeria for example, activities like production and marketing were the primary concern of management. The management of human resources was generally treated as part of general management of personnel or human resources was generally treated as part of general management or administration and was usually fully entrusted to more important and pressing issues.<br/>For many years, the concern of management was for technical values not human values nor the welfare of the employees. Workers were considered little more than machines and were considered less worthy of attention because the machines were more expensive to replace. No slight thought was given to the welfare or the development of a human organization. <br/>The development and practice of personnel management as a  profession in Nigeria has been substantially influenced by host of factors that were world wide in nature. These include the advent of Europeans, scientific management movement, development within universities and the rise of organized labour unions and professional bodies. Human resource management covers a wide variety of activities. The basic ones include:</p> <ol><li>Staffing recruitment, selection and placement</li> <li>Training and development: Determining training needs, selection of people for training course</li> <li>Wages and salaries administration.</li> <li>Employee welfare</li> <li>Performance appraisal</li> <li>Labour relations</li> </ol> <p>If the human resource which is a very vital factor of production in any organization is not well taken care of, all the functions above will be ineffectively carried out.<br/>The most effective human resource management that leads to profit in an organization’s efficiency requires senior management support, not only with fund but also with psychological support. Once this is done, it will lead to co-operation between staff and management which will in turn lead to better service and high productivity in the organization.</p>\n\nTHE RELEVANCE OF HUMAN RESOURCE IN TODAY'S BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE RELEVANCE OF HUMAN RESOURCE IN TODAY'S BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT", "id": 2}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><b>HUMAN RESOURCE PLANNING AND</b><b> ORGANIZATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY: </b></p> <p><b>A STUDY OF NATIONAL WATER RESOURCES INSTITUTE KADUNA, NIGERIA</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/></p> <p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.0</b>       <b>Background  to the Study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The concept of Human Resource Planning in any organization is an issue which deserves attention because it constitutes a major focus on the objective of an organization which is meant to foster effectiveness in the collective use of human talents for the overall benefit and interest of the employee and the organization . Consequently, for any organization to survive the changing needs in manpower utilization acquisition from excessive labor turnover low productivity, it has become paramount to imbibe a vibrant Human Resource Planning strategy by closely forecasting the present and future levels of employees required for its sustainability in the rapid changing society.</p> <p></p> <p>Human resource planning is defined as the process of assessing an organizational human resources needs in the light of organizational goals and changing conditions and making plans to ensure that a competent stable work force is employed and retained. However the actual planning process will vary a great deal from one organization to another. Even though various definitions of human resource planning have been given by some schools of thought such as James Walker, Pattern, and Fayana ( 2002 ) , however, it is a broad process addressing multiple levels of increasing organization effectiveness on the management of Human Resources and people management.               </p> <p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The term people management embraces the two related concepts of human resource management (HRM) and human capital management (HCM).  HRM aims to ensure that the organization obtains and retains the skilled, committed and well- motivated work force it needs. This means taking steps to access and satisfy future people needs and to develop their inherent capacities, potentials and employability.                                             </p> <p>The process of HCM is closely associated with human resource management. However the focus is more on the use of metrics (measurements of HR and people performance) as a means of providing guidance on people management, strategy and practice.</p> <p></p> <p>Consequently against this background, this project is determined to further expose you to those aspects of human resource planning especially as it relates to a Research and Academic Institution such as the National Water Resources Institute in Kaduna, Nigeria. This  project seek to deal specially with the meaning, need, importance and process of human resource planning.</p> <p></p> <p>1.1       <b>Statement of the Research Problem</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study is concerned with the human resource planning and productivity issue in an institution and to further identify how human resource planning effectively contributes to the attainment of its objectives in the National Water Resources Institute, Kaduna. It is worthy of note that   research activities,  periodic scientific journals  or publications of the National Water Resources Institute, Kaduna have not rendered much impact over the years on the overall abundant water resources of the nation Nigeria which could be attributed to  constrains in the aspect of a vibrant personnel management policy or deficiency of a sound human resource planning programme which might have been contributory to the resultant consequential effects on the overall targeted performance of the organization. Hopefully, it is the desire of this study to investigate the immediate and long time problems which could have militated on the low output in the institute and to further make a positive impact on the attainment of higher productivity in consolidating its human resource planning.<b> </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p></p> <p>1.2<b>       Purpose / Objective of the Study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The purpose of this study is to examine human resource planning and its impact on the organizational productivity, using the National Water Resources Institute, Kaduna as a case study with focus on the following objectives;  </p> <p>a.         To identify the methods and stages of human resource planning being adopted by the institute.</p> <p>b.         To determine the impact of human resource planning on the organizational productivity.</p> <p></p> <p>1.3       <b>Research  Questions</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This research study is aimed at asking why the organizational impact in productivity of the National Water Research Institute is not very much felt in water delivery and control across the country Nigeria despite the large potential of water resources and huge financial investment by governments over the years.</p> <p></p> <p>1.         What are the methods and stages of human resource planning being adopted by the National Water Research Institute, Kaduna?.</p> <p>2.         What are the impacts of human resource planning on the organizational productivity?</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4       Hypotheses</b></p> <p>The research intends to seek explanation for the phenomenon required for test as shown below.<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>H0</b>:  Human resource planning has no impact on workers productivity.<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>HA</b>:  Human resource planning has impact on workers productivity.                                                                                                                                                             1.5      <b>Significance of the Study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The study will potentially serve as a reference point to the human resource strategies of the National Water Resource Institute in its drive  towards achieving excellence in service delivery and effective, productive personnel management structure. It is also expected to be a rallying point for other human resource managers who may wish to carry out a study of the institute and its productivity concept.</p> <p></p> <p>Another significance of this study would be as a guide to students of human resource management who may wish to undertake a project study of the institute or any other organization of interest, and to other researchers in the field of human resource management.</p> <p></p> <p>Also it is a prerequisite for the award of Post Graduate Diploma (PGD) in Human Resource Management. Organizations both private and public sectors will also benefit from findings of this study. This study undertaken by the researcher on the human resource planning and productivity of the National Water Resources Institute, Mando, in Kaduna will be of outmost importance not only to the researcher but to the organization under study which is expected to generate future strategies from the findings.</p> <p></p> <p>1.6    <b> Scope and Delimitation of the Study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The scope covers the National Water Resources Institute, Kaduna.

One of the peculiarities of the human race is communication among the members of the society. Communication is an essential attribute of human behaviour . In deed, communication is perhaps man’s most important singular activity because every other human activity  revolves around communication.</p> <p></p> <p>Animals and trees also communicate, but it is man’s ability to create symbol, ascribe meanings and interpret messages that elevate him above the status of the lower animals and gives form and character to his existence. All organizations encourage effective communication by having established channels (formal and informal) of transmitting information to people. In all enterprises, effective organization channel is required to transmit company policies, programmes, rules and regulations. It is also required in dealing with customers, regulatory agencies and the generals public. It is through good communication with business owners, board of directors, management, peers and subordinates that an organization maintains goodwill, grows and waxes.</p> <p></p> <p>Communication also serves as an instrument of social interrelation. It help us understand ourselves, to keep in touch with other people, to understand them and to  predict their response to situation, its means by which power is acquired, exercised and sustained. It is the medium through which relationship are established, extended and maintained, it provides a means by which people in business policies make decision and management and materials.

Since, the survival of any ideal organization is a function of the nature and quality composition of such venture. This crucial fact influenced the recruitment and selection practices with special emphasis to first Banks Plc. </p> <p>        </p> <p>In many organizations, the reasonability for the choice of new employee is shared between line management and human resource department. The human resource department should be competent to advice on the most modern and best techniques and practices as well as provide a professional support and monitoring service, while line management is involved in the final decision as to who does or does not work in their department. It is therefore very glaring that line managements must be trained, and advised in selection matters especially interviewing. </p> <p>    </p> <p>The need for recruitment and selection in any organization depends upon the number of existing vacancies to be filled or new post to be created. Generally speaking, the conducts of recruitment and selection processes are cost involved and such could be advertising cost, testing cost, interviewing, placement and event employment cost. In view of these, there is much need for any ideal organization to exhibit the concept of seriousness, commitment, merit selection and organizational diplomacy in the conduct of recruitment and selection exercises. Once organizational yield to these facts, it would go along way to influence the velocity of the attainment of corporate objectives and also reduce the rate of labour turnover drastically, First Bank Plc would be not be exemption. </p> <p>Recruitment according to “Thomas H. Stone” is a systematic and organized procedure where potential employees are obtained for selection and placement in the organization through a variety of sources.</p> <p><b><i>The sources can be from the following</i></b>:</p> <p>1.    Institutions e.g. universities, polytechnics, colleges of education</p> <p>2.    Recruitment agencies, such as Author Andrew, Omoloye and Associate etc. </p> <p>3.    relative and friends</p> <p>4.    labor exchange e.g. labour minisry i.e. ministry of labour and productivity.</p> <p>5.    Internal labour market</p> <p></p> <p>After recruitment, selecton is the next step in the employment process. The main purpose of selection is to choose individuals that are most likely to succeed on the job from these that are available or responded to the advertisement or limitation to apply for the  job vacancies. </p> <p></p> <p>The human element has been considered the most crucial in the attainment of any organizations objectives. Therefore, selection procedure involve the screening of candidates according to the progressive series of steps designed to eliminate those who in some says are unsuitable. It involves submitting a comprehensive information or data on the applicant and conducting physical or medical examination, aptitude test, interview and reference checks on the applicant. </p> <p></p> <p>Once an individual has been deemed fit to be employed, the person is offered an appointment letter and given the conditions of his/her appointment and responsibilities. The individuals acceptance of the appointment is implicitly a contract to seal and accept the obligation of his/her appointment and perform his/her duties that assigned to him/her for a certain remuneration.</p> <p></p> <p>1.2    <b>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The recruitment and selection policies of first Bank Plc have been claimed to be inefficient and inefficient, hence the research intends to seek remedies to  this occurrence.</p> <p>        </p> <p>Crime such as fraud, human errors and time spend by customers in the bank before being attended to have become a major problem to the management.

Equally, the preparation and administering questionnaires all attracts cost which constituted to limit its spray.                              </p> <p></p> <p>1.7    <b>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF FIRST BANK PLC</b></p> <p>For over a century now, first Bank Nigeria Plc has remain a distinctive banking institution and a major contributor to the economic advancement and development in Nigeria. A shipping Mogule sir Alfred Jones from Liverpool founded the bank. At infancy the bank commence as a small operation in the office of Elder Demster and company in Lagos. In March 31st 1894, it was incorporated as a limited liability company with head office in Liverpool.  Under the corporate name of the Bank of British west Africa (BBWA) to started business with a paid up capital of 12,000 pounds sterlin after absorbing its predecessors the African banking corporation which was established earlier in 1892. this giant step signaled the pre-eminent position which the bank was to occupy in the banking  industry in west Africa.</p> <p></p> <p>In its early years of operation, the bank recorded an impressive  growth and work abreast with the colonial government in performing the traditional function of a central bank. These functions includes among others. Issuance of spaces in the west Africa sub region to justify its west Africa coverage. A branch was opened in Accra (Gold coast) Ghana in1896, and in Freetown, sierra Lenone in 1898. </p> <p></p> <p>These heralded the genesis of the bank’s international operations. Progressively in Nigeria a branch was opened  in the old Calabar in 1900 and two years  later, service were extended to the northern Nigeria. With 336 branches spread throughout the federation, the bank maintains the largest network in the industry in Nigeria. To satisfy the needs of its customers, First Bank has diversified into a wide range of banking service and activities which include among others: corporate and retail banking registrar ship, trusteeship and insurance brokerage. In addition, as part of its strategy to progressive internalization in November 2002, the bank became the fist financial institution in Nigeria to establish a subsidiary bank in the UK. Over the year the bank has experience a blossoming growth. With a share capital of N55.6 million in 1980, the banks share capital grew to N813 million as at March 2001. The bank’s total assets – base was N212 billion while its deposit base stood at N148.3 billion as at March N41.55 billion i.e. N22.5K/share as at March 2001. </p> <p></p> <p>To reposition and take advantage of opposition in the changing environments, the bank embarked on several restructuring initiative in 1957, it changed name from bank of British West Africa to bank of West Africa. In 1969, the bank was incorporated locally as standard bank of Nigeria limited in line with the company’s decree of 1968. Changes in the names of the bank also occurred in 1979 and 1991, to first bank of Nigeria limited to first bank of Nigeria Plc respectively. In 1985, the introduced a decentralized structure with five regional administrations. This was reconfigured in 1992 to enhance the bank’s operational efficiency in 1996, the bank introduced the FBN Century II project to revolutionize its operations in line with the dynamics of the environment. FBN got listed on the Nigerian stock exchange NSE in March 1971 and has won the NSE president merit award nine times for the best financial report in the banking sector. </p> <p></p> <p>The bank has continued to be a leader in financing long-term development of the economy, which was demonstrated in 1947 when the long term loan was advanced to the then colonel government.</p> <p>1.8    <b>DEFINITION OF KEY TERMS</b>                                          </p> <p>To make a research  work such as this comprehensive to even an average reader, it became every  important to define some salient features involved in the theme.

It can, therefore be concluded that a developing country like Nigeria, with its rich natural resources and the necessary financial support can also experience such economic success if the appropriate attention is given to the development and training of her human resource. It is thus seen that in Nigeria the government is taking adequate steps to ensure that people acquire the necessary knowledge and skills. The provision of secondary and technical schools, vocational training institutes and colleges, professional and tertiary institutions, as well as the educational reforms currently taking place in the country, are all geared towards the acquisition of skills and knowledge to ensure effectiveness and efficiency in our workplaces. </p> <p>For instance, a manager in an organization will not be successful until he has subordinates beneath him who are well equipped with skills, talent and knowledge. To manage an organization both large and small requires staffing them with competent personnel. The formal educational system does not adequately teach specific job skills for a position in a particular organization. Few employees have the requisite skills, Knowledge, Abilities and Competencies (SKAC) needed to work. As a result, many require extensive training to acquire the necessary skills, knowledge, abilities and competencies (SKAC) to be able to make substantive contribution to wards the organization’s growth, (Barron and Hagerty 2001). If employees are to experience flexibility and effectiveness on the job, they need to acquire and develop knowledge and skills, and if they are to believe that they are valued by the organization they work for, then they need to see visible signs of  management’s commitment to the their training and career needs. Training and development are the processes of investing in people so that they are equipped to perform. These processes are part of an overall human resource management approach that hopefully will result in people being motivated to perform. (Barron and Hagerty 2001). It goes without saying therefore that the training and development of employees is an issue that has to be faced by every organization. However, the amount, quality and quantity of training carried out vary enormously from organization to organization. </p> <p>According to Cole (2002:329), factors influencing the quantity and quality of training and development activities include; the degree of change in the external environment, the degree of internal change, the availability of suitable skills within the existing work-force and the extent to which management see training as a motivating factor in work.</p> <p><strong>1.2 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF GUINNESS NIGERIA PLC </strong></p> <p>The firm Guinness Nigeria Plc came into existence in year 1950 with the sole aim of importing and distributing Guinness stout from Dublin for eventual sales in Nigeria. Due to the success of the product in the country it gave rise to a decision to establish a small brewery in the year 1962. The foundation stone of Guinness was laid at Ikeja on the 31st January 1962, by Arthur Benjamin Francis Guinness now the Earl of Irish to which titles he succeeded on his grandfather’s death until 1967 in active services during the 2nd world war. </p> <p>Guinness Nigeria is a subsidiary of the prestigious Diageo Plc of the United Kingdom. The brewery was the first outside of Ireland and Great Britain. Other breweries have been opened over time – Benin City brewery in 1974 and Ogba brewery in 1982.</p> <p>Guinness Nigeria produces the following brands – Foreign Extra Stout (1962), Guinness Extra Smooth (2005) Malta Guinness (1990), Harp Lager Beer (1974), Gordon’s Spark (2001), Smirnoff Ice (2006), Satzenbrau (1995).</p> <p>Guinness Nigeria Plc is a company that believes in enriching its communities. This it has achieved by embarking on laudable Corporate Social Responsibility projects in several communities in Nigeria. These projects are Water of Life initiative, which currently provides potable water to over 500,000 Nigerians spread across several rural communities, from Northern to Southern Nigeria; scholarship and Guinness Eye Hospitals in three cities in Nigeria.</p> <p>Nigerian Guinness is said to be twice as strong as Irish Guinness. In the 1800s, the Irish brewed the Guinness twice as strong, due to a fear of evaporation on the long voyage to Nigeria. However, the alcohol did not evaporate, and to this day Nigerians brew their Guinness twice as strong.</p> <p>Guinness Nigeria limited became a public company In 1965 and was one of the first companies to be quoted in Nigeria stock exchange with shares being offered to Nigerian shareholders, 1200 Nigerian held 20% of the equity. </p> <p>In 1971, a decision was taken to build a new Brewery at Benin at a cost 12 million to brewery larger beer, this was the biggest brewery ever built in Nigeria. </p> <p>The company believes that investment in the training and development of its staff are wise investments. This has resulted in the establishment of training centers in Benin and Lagos (Ikeja). </p> <p>Following the ban on importation of methods barely the company has conducted research into the use of maize and sorghum in place of malt in production of the different brands of beverages. </p> <p>In the Nigerian market, Harp lager beer gained a remarkable success alongside Guinness  stout, due to its good quality too hence received a wide patronage and now known as Guinness Nigeria PLC. </p> <p>It was merely up to a decade of the brewery and marketing of harp that its brand loyalists started shifting their interest to the other hand. The complaint raised by Harp patronizes for gradually changing preference was as a result of the carelessness on the part of the brewers to eradicate particles discovered in the final product and these were major set-backs suffered by Guinness Harp. </p> <p>In the year 1995 a new product line “satzenbrau” was in the market and it received attention in Lagos and west Ibadan to be precise for now. </p> <p>In 1990 another product line “Malta Guinness”, was also in the market and it has received attention all over the country and outside the country. </p> <p>It indeed received acceptance and as such requires effective management system, to guide against the future of all lines of product carried out by Guinness Nigeria Plc. (www.Guinnessnigeria.com).</p> <p><strong>1.3 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>It is a well known fact that training enhances SKAC and ultimately worker performance and productivity in organizations.</p> <p>Many organizations in Nigeria and indeed the public sector engage in training and development of staff and have departments, units and sectors in charge of training and development. Guinness Nigeria Plc is one such organization that has been practicing training and development since its beginning and particularly for the past ten (10) years. However, for some years now it appears training in Guinness Nigeria Plc is disorganized, unplanned and unsystematic, and several of its employees such as machine operators, junior and middle level engineers, accounts clerks, computer operators, secretaries, drivers and many other category of workers, have not qualified for any form of training nor is there any systematic process of staff development in place. </p> <p><strong>1.4 STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS </strong></p> <p><strong>Null Hypothesis: </strong>adequate training does not create high performance in an organization. </p> <p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis: </strong>adequate training creates high performance in an organization.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTION </strong></p> <p>the following are the statement of research question for this project research:</p> <p>1.     Will training and development of manpower in the organization lead to the attainment of the overall desired goals and objectives?  </p> <p>2.     Is manpower training and development at Guinness Nigeria Plc planned and systematic?</p> <p>3.     Will motivation of workers lead to greater performance that will lead to the increased in productivity of the organization?</p> <p>4.     Has training offered you the opportunity to identify any potential you have for further development?  </p> <p>5.     Does training and development improve skills and knowledge of manpower in organizations?  </p> <p><strong>1.6 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objectives of this study are to:-</p> <p>1. Identify the major purposes of training and development, as well as the Key internal and external influences on training.</p> <p> 2. Ascertain the training and development policy in operation at Guinness Nigeria Plc.</p> <p> 3. Outline and explain the training and development practices and processes including the assessment of training needs, an outline of training methods, and the processes of monitoring and evaluating the plan.</p> <p> 4. Find out whether training and development schemes have positive effect on the performance of workers and productivity.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is expected that the study will inform the Management of Guinness Nigeria Plc and other organizations that to increase productivity, there is the need to have and retain well trained and motivated employees. It is also to help develop and maintain a quality work life, which will provide an opportunity for employees’ job satisfaction and self-actualization.

The efficient and effective performance of the workforce in turn, rest on the richness of the knowledge, skills and abilities possessed by the workforce. Manpower training and development in most organizations is a continuous act/exercise. The inexorable march of time and the ceaseless glamour for social change combine to make adaptability and continuing preparation of the workforce as inevitable as the initial acquisition of knowledge and skills. This cannot happen if employees training and development do not occur in an enterprise. In other to maximize the productivity and efficiency of the organization, every executive, manager or supervisor in a public or private organization has the responsibility and indeed the bounding duty to ensure the development of their employees who have requisite knowledge and expertise.</p> <p>    Manpower training and development should be based on a need analysis derived from a comparison of “actual performance’’ and behavior with “required performance’’ and behavior. Manpower training and development is one of the major ways organization invests in the workforce for greater return today and even in the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Training is like sharpening an existing skill in order to reflect the trends in technology and other social –cultural environmental changes of an organization. Productivity is the goal of today’s competitive business world and training can be a spring board to enhance productivity. The aim is to enable them contribute their full measure to the welfare, health and development of the organization (Onah 1993). The main objective of training and development in service organization is to increase efficiency of employees with the resulting increase in corporate productivity. This accounts for why a large number of fund and time is expected by organization at one period or the order in the improvement of the skills of their employees at various levels.</p> <p>       The principal intention of training according to Akpan (1982), is to equip people with the knowledge required to qualify them for a particular position of employment, or to improve their skills and efficiency in the position they already hold.</p> <p>       Manpower development on the other hand, implies growth and the acquisition of wide experience for future strategic advantages of the organization.</p> <p>       Manpower training and development therefore, improves the effectiveness and efficiency of the employee. Therefore, the aim of this research is to know the current state, nature, procedure and method of training and development used by the Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) for their employees and let’s not forget that any organization that has no plan for the training and development of its staff is less than dynamic for learning is a continuous process and acquired skills get obsolete when the environment changes. Also, a popular caption in the field of personnel management says, “If you think training and development are expensive try ignorance’’. While training and development prosper organization, ignorance destroys it. Therefore, workers like machines must be updated on constant basis or else, they end up becoming obsolete or misfit.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Despite the strategic dimension of manpower investment, most organization in Nigeria remains inert. Life in such organization is a sheer drudgery. Initiative is most often discouraged due to an environment that neither empowers nor enables the individuals to accomplish anything. </p> <p>It is generally observed that whenever there is a resources crunch in Nigerian organizations, the first axe falls on human resources in terms of retrenchments and cuts in manpower development and training budgets. Employee are said to be a “soul” of the organization, but there are treated as the “sole” of the organization to tramp with. Organizations are hostile to their people, why are they so? Why are organizations more concerned with profits than with the well being of their people? Why are human resources regarded as part of organizational problems instead of being regarded as part of the solution to its problem? Why do organizations continue to seek solutions to their competitive challenges by downsizing, rightsizing, outsourcing and weakening their organizational culture, rather than putting their people first and drawing from extensive research, which confirms that organizations do gain enduring competitive advantage through investment in their people?</p> <p>Even when there appears to be a general consensus that manpower investment is a strategy for organizational competitive advantage. Nigeria organizations think and perform differently. Indeed neglect of human resources is the order of the day in most Nigerian organizations. Can it be that the claim that manpower investment is a potent strategy for organizational competitive advantage is in the Nigerian environment, an invalid one?     </p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose for this research is to probe into the evaluation of the effect of manpower training and development in service organization using Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) Benin City as a case study with a view to find out how the organization is performing in terms of its employees training and development. </p> <p>The following are the specific objectives of the study:</p> <p>1)    To examine if training and development enhances employees’ skill and knowledge</p> <p>2)    To examine the effect of employees training and development on employees’ performance and productivity  </p> <p>3)     To examine adequate training facilities that could help to improve the manpower training and development.</p> <p><strong>1.4            </strong><strong> RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1.       Does training and development enhance employees’ skill and knowledge?</p> <p>2.     What effect will training and development have on workers productivity and performance?   </p> <p>3.     Will adequate training facilities enhance manpower training and development programme. </p> <p><strong>1.5            </strong><strong> STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>HYPOTHESIS I</p> <p>Ho: Training and development does not improve productivity and performance.</p> <p>Hi: Training and development improves productivity and performance.</p> <p>HYPOTHESIS II</p> <p>Ho: Training and development do not improve skills and knowledge of manpower in service organization.</p> <p>Hi: Training and development improves skills and knowledge of manpower in service organization.</p> <p>HYPOTHESIS III</p> <p>Ho: Adequate training facilities do not increase training and development</p> <p>Hi: Adequate training facilities does not enhance training and development programme.</p> <p><strong>1.6            </strong><strong> SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The research will be beneficial to all service organization especially Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) Benin City and their staff as it emphasized the need and encourage the establishment of policy guidelines on the efficient and effective training and development porgramme.</p> <p>It will help managers of various organizations to generate ideas and solution to problems based on the best way to run training in their organization in order to achieve desired goals and objectives.</p> <p>It will equally be useful to small scale business, large corporations, and universities, college of education and to the government.</p> <p>It will also help researchers to know more about training programme as a tool for improving employees’ performance.</p> <p>Finally, it will be of great value to students as a point of reference and will equally form the basis for further research study.</p> <p><strong>1.7            </strong><strong> SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of the study in which the study was carried out comprises of service organization particularly Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC). For this reason, it was necessary to have a concentrated area of study which was restricted to the evaluation of the effect of manpower training and development in service organization using Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) Benin City as the case study.</p> <p>Its major limitation was the problem of getting information from the institution under study. As parastatals, there is always the fear of giving out information to the public as such, vital information needed was not readily available.</p> <p><strong>1.8</strong><strong> LIMITATION OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>There is no gain saying that there are no limitations in research work generally. Any shortcoming that arises in this study is as a result of factors which are beyond the researcher’s control.</p> <p>Therefore, it will be of more importance to highlight certain militating factors that tend to narrow or limit my scope of study. This project research would have been easier if not for these limitating factors:</p> <p>1.     <strong>Time factor:</strong> time was not on the researchers to consult various sectors of the economy to review employees or given out questionnaire to various institutions on the effect of government revenue policies.<br/> As we all know, time is never our friend. The time scheduled for the completion of this research thesis was too short. As a result, generating information/data was strenuous as it coincides with final year examination period, which needed attention.</p> <p>2.     <strong>Finance:</strong> this is another barrier that limited the researcher’s work.</p> <p>3.     <strong>Available resources:</strong> was unavailable for the research work.</p> <p><strong>1.9 DEFINITION OF TERMS   </strong></p> <p>       i.            MANPOWER: this is the power in terms of the workers available to a particular group or required for a particular task.</p> <p>     ii.            SELECTION: Is the process of identifying the most suitable applicant and persuades him/her for employment.</p> <p>  iii.            TRAINING<strong>: </strong>Training is the acquisition of knowledge, skills, and  competencies as a result of the teaching of vocational or practical skills and knowledge that relate to specific useful competencies. Training has specific goals of improving one's capability, capacity, productivity and performance.</p> <p><strong>1.10 HISTORICAL PROFILE OF THE COMPANY UNDER STUDY </strong></p> <p>Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) is one of the 11 distribution companies unbundled from the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) and sold to private investors, under the Federal Government’s privatization programme.</p> <p>BEDC, with an area of wide geographical spread, spanning four states – Edo, Delta, Ondo and Ekiti, has 16 business districts in all.</p> <p>Vigeo Power is the new owner of Benin Electricity Distribution Company, which has Mrs. Funke Osibodu, a former Managing Director of Union bank Plc, as the Chief Executive Officer.</p> <p>Before it acquired BEDC, the company was the management operator for the National Pre-Payment Metering Program (NPPMP) in the Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) covering Edo, Delta, Ondo and Ekiti States from 2007 to 2010. The programme primarily targeted at reducing non-technical losses and improving customer satisfaction via improved customer service delivery.</p> <p>This entails the procurement, installation and management of prepaid meters in BEDC. The contract provides for the installation of 161,000 Pre-Paid Meters (PPMs) within 2 years and management of the vending operations until the operator’s investment in metering and vending infrastructure is fully repaid.</p> <p>Established in 1999, Vigeo Power has extensive experience in the Nigerian electric distribution and downstream sector. The company is managed by a team of indigenous and expatriate professionals with over 60 years cumulative experience in power and utilities project management.</p> <p>The company’s Nigerian experience includes over eight years of public private partnership experience in both Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) and prepaid metering service with the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN), formerly National Electric Power Authority (NEPA).</p> <p>Vigeo Power ’s experience in RCM, spanning over four years  - 2002 – 2007, which was an outsourced management contract in the commercial management of maximum demand, commercial and residential customers in the old Ikorodu, Ojodu and Somolu Business Units of Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company (IEDC) in Lagos State.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF MANPOWER TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT ON EMPLOYEES PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF MANPOWER TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT ON EMPLOYEES PERFORMANCE", "id": 7}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>                  HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AS A TOOL FOR ATTAINING HIGH PRODUCTIVITY IN PEUGEOT AUTOMOBILE NIGERIAN LIMITED (PAN) KADUNA</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Available of resources is a vital need for the survival of human ventures. These include human, materials and financial resources which are very useful in the production chain. Out of all these resources the human component appears to be the most vital. This is because human beings articulate and activate other resources. E.g computers could only be operated by man just as car, machine and allied functional equipment would have to be controlled by man. In the economy of the nations human being constitute a very vital aspect of growth and development </p> <p>Human resources management is based on belief that people are organizations most important strategic resources. It is generally concerned with machines resources business needs in the larger terms, although it will some times address shorter term requirement. It addresses human resources needs both in quantitative and qualitative terms which means answering two basic questions, first ho many people and second, what sort of people? Human resources management also looked at broader issues relating to the way in which people are employed and developed in order to improve organizational effectiveness. It can therefore play an important part in strategic human resources management.</p> <p>Human resources management entails the process of getting the right numbers of qualified people into the right job at the right time or it is the system of matching the supply of people internally (existing employee) and externally (these to be hired or searched for) with the opening the organization expects to have over a given period of time.</p> <p>Human resources management is the process of analyzing and identified the needs for and availability of human resources so the organization can meet its objective. In most organization, that do human resources management, the top executive and subordinates staff specialist have most of their responsibilities for management, however, other managers most provide data for the human resources specialist to analyze. In turn these managers needs to receive data from the human resources unit because top managers are responsible for the over all strategic management, they usually ask the human resources unit project. </p> <p>The human resource needed to implement over all organization goals. Human resources management will help the organization to be able to forecast for future human resources. Human resources management help in the area of making goods organizational policies terms of recruitment, selection, placement, training and development i.e helping the organization to get skilled and competence people needed in the organization and placing them at the right place and at the right time in the organization which can help to give rise to increase in the organizational productivity.</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>This research is carried out to evaluate the impact of human resources management on productivity in business organizations as it affects of Peugeot Automobile Nigeria Limited Kaduna (PAN).

In any research undertaken it is usually associated with some constraints.</p> <p>Some of the constraint of this research work include the following:</p> <p><strong>a.   </strong><strong>Financial constraint: </strong>This is considered to be the first constraint faced by the research. This really did not help matters working at the very fact that at a student there is always limited fund at ones disposal which formed part of these factors that discourage the research to go further than this. This extend in getting all needed data from this research work. a typical example is the fund for going to different places to get information buying of  related literature text books that are not available in the school library.</p> <p><strong>b.  </strong><strong>Available data:</strong> In no small measure, incomplete and accurate data also provide a lot of difficulty in carrying out this research work. as a matter of fact, it is because most of the senior staff were either too busy running their official responsibility that made them hardly to give the researcher the needed time to gather information or they were not just willing to do that, though some did co-operate just like most senior staff.</p> <p><strong>c.   </strong><strong>Time constraint:</strong> This was the biggest constraint faced by the researcher because combining rigorous drilling of the institution i.e lecturers, assignment (both individual and group), test etc. on carrying out the research work made it virtually impossible to dedicate all the time needed to carry out this research work mostly easily.  </p>\n\nHUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AS A TOOL FOR ATTAINING HIGH PRODUCTIVITY IN PEUGEOT AUTOMOBILE NIGERIAN LIMITED (PAN) KADUNA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AS A TOOL FOR ATTAINING HIGH PRODUCTIVITY IN PEUGEOT AUTOMOBILE NIGERIAN LIMITED (PAN) KADUNA", "id": 8}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN THE HOTEL AND CATERING INDUSTRY</p> <div> CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION <p><strong>1.1            </strong><strong>THE BACKGROUND OF THESTUDY</strong></p> <p>Since the beginning of recorded time, people have travelled, and during their travels, have needed shelter. This consequently encouraged the springing up of some accommodation in form of inns and small hotels and subsequent larger hospitality suites, to meet such needs. This thus hospitality is said to be the worlds‟ second oldest profession.</p> <p>Just after the civil war in 1970, there was a virtual absence of hotels and especially, the well known names in the international hotel industry in Nigeria. Not until the late 70‟s, during the oil boom era, did Nigeria start experiencing some growth in her hotel industry. In recent years however, Nigeriahosting of several major international events like the common wealth heads of government meeting (CHOGM), All African games, carnivals, meeting including the visits of two American presidents an other presidents with their entourage, has led to the building of several more hotels in Nigeria, especially in the majorcities.</p> <p>This growth is not restricted to Nigeria alone, example, the American food service industry in 1979 had 110 billion dollars of busing for meals away from home and was infactthethirdlargestindustryinthecountryintermsofgrossretailsales,itemploys</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>about 6 million people and had average of 125. 42 employees in 1995 and yet still needs many additional employees everyyear.</p> <p>Nigeria has since seen many important developments and changes in the relative improvement in the standard of living of a vast majority of working people. These improvements have come about as a result of many different factors including greater national productivity, stronger growth of economy, having more enlightened management and pressures from tradeunions.</p> <p>The contributions made by the hotel and catering industry to this general rise in standard of living are considerable, providing essential and leisure services, employment and wealthcreation.</p> <p>Hotel development in any country is a detailed process, requiring a high level of pre- planning prior to, during and after construction. There is still evidence in many places in Nigeria that this pre-planning has not adequately been carried out, resulting in some hotels that are unable to meet today‟s and tomorrows ever-changing and increasing customer needs, including the fact that demand far outstrips supply, with major cities like Lagos having now shortages. Nevertheless, Tourism, of which the hotel and catering industry is a principal element is said to be a potential growth sector inNigeria.</p> <p>The conditions of employment of a large number of the industry‟s staff have not kept peace  with  those  enjoyed  by  working  people  elsewhere,  in  spite  of  the   technical</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>improvements within the catering industry itself. The reasons for the slow rate of improvement in the industry‟s condition of employment are considerable including an understandable reluctance on the part of many proprietors and managers to adjust labor earnings according to improvements in the industry. Another reason could be that trade union movements exert little influence in most sectors of the industry, since moreover most people that make up the industry‟s workforce are people who are not prepared to make a career out of thejob.</p> <p>The working conditions of the industry‟s staff are for most cases unattractive. There are intrinsic problems which are unavoidable such as having to work long evenings and weekends. Other problems however can certainly be removed or reduced by determined management action. Such problems are staff reliance on tips, ignorance of workers on methods of calculating pay and the distribution of service charges, and management‟s reluctance to involve staff in matters that affect their working lives. Management should therefore evolve a way of bringing out the best in these groups of ignored members of ourworkforce.</p> <p>In Nigeria, there are many organizations that provide catering services and which by their nature can be termed hotels. It is estimated that there exists about 550 hotels, inns and commercial guest houses in Nigeria by the year 2008 that employs between 10 and 250 people in line with their sizes. It is said that about 418 – 900 people were employed in 2003worldwide.</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div>  1.2            STATEMENT OF THEPROBLEM  <p>In an industry in Africa where there seems to have been a continued growth over the years, expertise is therefore expected to be limited and this constitutes aproblem.</p> <p>There and other problems are what the study wishes to consider and make recommendation where necessary. The problem reduction in experienced hands in this industry in the third world, seem to be the case due to managers reluctance to train its workers and employ ablehands.</p> <p>Another problem lies in the fact that most workers in the industry have no clear cut channels to register their protests and grievances since management usually stifles unionizationagitation.</p> <p>The third problem concerns the issue of how the basic payment and benefits of workers is commensurate with their dedication to work and efforts. As employers are less responsive to changes in the economy with respect to adjustments of pay and benefit packages in line with economic growth as being experienced in most developing countries today, including Nigeria, they are left with employees whose dedication to work decreases; with huge reduction in their morals and motivation towork.</p> <p>We are also confronted with an environment where employees are usually kept in the dark without being enlightened on things they have the right to know. Example,payment</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>determination method, criteria for promotion (etc), but rather such issues are based on the whims of management. This constitutes aproblem.</p> <p>The last problem is the general belief by most people that jobs in the industry is one of last resort which they can take up when they do not find a “better” job to do. This thus discourages young people who may wish to have a career in the hotel and catering industry.</p> <p>Having identified some of the problems, this study intends to find possible solutions to some ofthem.</p> 1.3            THE OBJECTIVE OF THESTUDY  <p>To this end, this study aims at assessing the reasonability of all the entitlements due or payable to that part of the labor force that works fully or partly in the hotel and catering industry. The objectives of this study arethus.</p> <p>v To examine the reasonability of other entitlements and benefits that is not part of the basicpayment.</p> <p>v To assess the degree to which payment is commensurate with the efforts of employees in thisindustry.</p> <p>v To evaluate the extent to which payment and benefits in this industry are similar to those oflike-industries.</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>v To examine the industrial relations existing in the hotel under study and its impact on worker‟swelfare.</p> <p>v To identify the impact of inappropriate payment and employee benefit schemes or their absence altogether, on employeeperformance.</p> 1.4            RESEARCHQUESTIONS  <p>The following research questions will beraised:</p> <p>1.     To what extent do the workers in the hotel and catering industry satisfied and motivated by theirpayment?</p> <p>2.     To what extent do the working condition obtainable in this industry quite satisfactory relative to workerseffort?</p> <p>3.     To what degree is management involved in the training and development of its workers?</p> <p>4.     To what extent does management agree to the formation ofunions?</p> <p>5.     To what extent is management responsive to changes in the economy with reference to the adjustment of payment and benefit packages in line with economicindicators?</p> 1.5           RESEARCHHYPOTHESIS  <p>The hypothesis of this research workincludes:</p> <p>HO:   Employeepaymentpacketandbenefitare not equalto the efforts theyputin, HA:          Employeepaymentpacketandbenefitareequal to theeffortsthey puton.</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>HO:   ManagementdoesnotencourageworkerstounionizeHA:          Managementencouragestheirworkerstounionize</p> <p>HO:   Workersmoraleandmotivation to workisnegativelyinfluenced by  paymentand benefits theyreceive.</p> <p>HA:   Workersmoraleandmotivation  to  works  is  notnegativelyinfluencedbythe payment and benefits theyreceive.</p> 1.6           THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESTUDY  <p>The study is significant for the followingreasons:</p> <p>v To change the belief by some hotel management in the country that the formation of unions by employees may mean more trouble forthem.</p> <p>v To bring to the fore, the importance of having pay being commensurate with efforts and productivity since the bulk of workers in this industry are after psychological needs but work in environments supposedly the exclusive reserve of self actualized members of thesociety.</p> <p>v Ability to help reinstate the industry belle to its supposed place as a major part of the economy and as a potential growthsector.</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div>  1.7            SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF THESTUDY  <p>An attempt of evaluating the management of the human resource in the hotel  and catering industry will be too vast and all encompassing. It is therefore the opinion of the researcher that the scope of this study be restricted to the administration of employee benefits and welfare schemes, that is all other entitlements due to employee other than payment, which by their nature may act as motivation for the staff of the organizations in theindustry.</p> <p>The study is confined to the entire staff of Royal Palace Hotel, Enugu. However, the findings of this study will apply to the hotel and catering industry in Nigeria.

Planning is a basic function of management thus therefore means that planning pervades all the functional area of management which include personnel, production, research and development, marketing and finance. Through planning organization goals and objective are determined; the resources available must be strategies to achieve the goals and objectives. Planning provide answers to what? How? When? And their relationship to organization activities. In personnel management function, human resources panel is a basic function. Human resources planning is sometime referred to as workforce planning, which is defined as the process of the right number of qualified people into the right job at the right time. To ensure adequate workforce in the organization, management must plan properly, proper planning in this respect involves accurate projection of the future, taking inventory of existing workforce, comparing the force with the existing one and take corrective measure. Productivity means rate of output, degree of result and success which is directly related to profitability and turnover. This research study concentrates on the possible impact of human resources planning on workers productivity. The human resources means the human that are in the organization. Without them there cannot be production. So there is need for the organization to plan well for its human resource. Proper planning enhances the productivity of an organization. How? Planning helps to resolve problem of shortage of staff in organization It also helps in determining and planning whatever capital, material, equipment and personnel required in an organization in order to achieve organization objectives Human resource planning defining the duties and responsibilities of the personnel employed and determining the manner in which their activities are to be interrelated Human resource use planning to assess external forces to help the firm deal with environmental uncertainty by mobilizing scare or limited resources to neutralize potential threats. Planning make control possible, which is, comparing actual outcome with performance standards and taking corrective action if variance exists Human resource planning management development by helping managers to take proactive role in moving the organization toward a future desired state.   Lastly, human resource planning function include staffing, that is acquiring qualified and appropriate number of workers for an organization, to determining and acquiring other resources and proper allocation of these resources. In addition, co-ordination of activities of all members and parts of an organization is another major purpose of human resource planning in order to boost production.   1.2   Statement of the Problem One of the most serious problems facing SSABML is the acute shortage of qualified resources. The problem of inadequate skilled manpower in Nigeria Limited sector could be traced to a number of factors which include the colonial administrative policies which gave the local population more opportunity to develop. Some of the problem faced by the human resources planners is as follows:  Management of fund, funds kept for the proper planning management of the organization is always converted to their private pocket by the top management. As a result of lack of motivation money of our expertise in Nigeria have gone to a board where they will be paid and live in a comfortable house with all kinds of fringe benefits The rate of labour turnover is increasing because of lack of facilities in our higher institutions, irrelevance of the educational curriculum to the need of the economic   1.3   Objective of the Study This study is of the view that human resources is very important factor in the production, management and government as a whole. Human resources will not be of any value if it is not productive. Therefore, to identify factor which hamper the effective and efficient operation of SSABML, the management of SSABML must strategize using the all resources available in their care to make sure that their objective is achieved at the long run. In order to guide the study, the following objectives are put forward: To determine how employees are being compensated as well as the fringe benefit received To ascertain whether the service rendering to customer are of optimum quality To find out the actual problem affecting the management of Sonal System Association Business Management Limited. To find out the level of the labour turnover and how it affect on the productivity in the organization To see how human resources planning has change the level of production capacity in the SSABML 1.4   Significance of the Study This study is necessitated by the urge and the need for the research, reader and organizations in general to understand the advantages of implementation of human resources on productivity stem that will serve as tool for achieving higher organization productivity. The following are the significance of study to the researcher: To serve as guide to corporate individuals, organization and student alike in furtherance to their research on the subject matter To help government in the determination of how productive is both public and private sector of the economy To serve as a reference materials for students who will wish to conduct similar studies on this topic.   1.5   Research Questions What is the nature of human resources in organization? Is human resource planning relevant to organizational productivity? Is there any relationship between productivity and organization human resource in SSABML? What are the criteria and conditions for impact of human resources organization? In what ways does the problem observed can be tackled?   1.6.Statement of  Hypothesis H0: There is no impact of human resource planning on organizational performance. H1: There is an impact of human resource planning on organizational performance.   1.7   Scope of the Study The study is restricted to the impact of human resource in productivity in SSABML Kaduna as source of data and it will cover period from 2005 to 2010. The study was with constrained, some of these constraints are: Finance: It was no doubt a g7reat limited of factors for this project considering the world wide economic recession and the particular financial squeeze within the country. All these combined together or bear on me. Time Limit: There is also limited amount of time in the course of investigation. This based in the fact that the researcher will have other task to perform, these include often assignment in the school going for lecturer, preparation for test, examination and other to maintained but few. The school authority imposed a time limit in the submission of the complete work. Base on the submission of the completed work. Base on these the project will cover those areas that are very crucial to the problems under investigation.     </p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF HUMAN RESOURCE PLANNING ON ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF HUMAN RESOURCE PLANNING ON ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE", "id": 10}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>EFFECT OF FINANCIAL AND NON FINANCIAL INCENTIVES ON STAFF PRODUCTIVITY</p> <p>1.0 Background of the study All organizations are concerned with what should be done to achieve high level of productivity through staff motivation using the right kind of incentive. Consequently the effect of financial and non financial incentive becomes a burning issue in human resource management. As such a lot of theoretical concept, principles and techniques of management have evolved in response to these challenges/ but most scholars suggest that more conceptual and empirical work is required to show the link between financial and non financial incentive and staff productivity is still vague but some studies have documented in their work that financial incentive is readily perceived as having a high instrumental value that makes putting forth extra effort worthwhile and its has a long term effect in terms of labour turnover rate because of comparative value for alternative employment while non financial incentive has less initial impact as the pragmatics of financial gain, they seem to have a steady, sustainable impact. Despite the growing body of literature and empirical study on the effect of financial and non financial incentive on workers productivity, the subject matter still remains complex. Hence, the need to undertake a survey on the effect of financial and non financial incentives on staff productivity in Nigeria Postal Services Kaduna. 1.2     Statement of problem  Nigeria Postal Services (NIPOST) like other public enterprise is constraint with the problem of using non performance based element like salaries to compensate it staff as against performance-related pay structure which has hamper productivity because it does not make worker put in extra effort in their work. This is so because their compensation is not based on incentive schemes that elicit additional effort of workers sequel to unfriendly government legislation on wages clause and bureaucratic inefficiency. Hence the need to examine the effect of financial and non financial incentive on staff productivity in Nigeria Postal Services Kaduna. 1.3     Objectives of the Study  The central objectives of this study are to examine the effect of financial and non financial incentive on staff productivity in NIPOST Kaduna.  Specifically the study is set out to: Identify whether NIPOST remuneration is based on incentive schemes that motivate staff to perform. Examine all financial incentives NIPOST give to it staff and their effect on worker productivity. Identify non financial incentives used in boosting staff productivity in NIPOST Kaduna. Find out the constraints militating against NIPOST incentive scheme and make recommendations to the identified problems. H0: there is no effect of NIPOST incentive scheme on the productivity of staff H1: there is effect of NIPOST incentive scheme on the productivity of staff 1.4     Significance of the Study  This study brings to light the effect of financial and non financial incentives on staff performance in organization. The study will therefore be beneficial to the organization understudy (NIPOST) in area of policy formulations as regard staff incentive schemes and remuneration.  To education, the study will contribute to already existing knowledge on the effect of financial and non financial incentives on workers’ performance.  Finally, to those in academics and human resource researches, the study will serve as a springboard for further investigations. 1.5     Research Questions  This study  provide answers to the following research questions: Is NIPOST remuneration based on incentive scheme that motivate staff performance? What kind of financial incentive do NIPOST give to its workers and what are their effect on workers productivity? What kind of non financial incentive do NIPOST use to boost workers productivity? What are the constraints militating against NIPOST incentive scheme and how can these constraints be overcome? 1.6     Scope of the study  The study covers an empirical investigation of the effect of financial and non financial incentives on staff productivity in NIPOST Kaduna. The time frame for this investigation covers NIPOST incentive schemes from 2006-2011. 1.7     Limitation of the Study  The study is limited to bias in respondent opinion about the subject matter as well as the use of one study area and the uncertainly about the generalization of finding sequel to the use of a single research design as well as instrument.  For the fact that only NIPOST was used as the sole area of study it is no certain if the same result would be obtained in other organization. Respondent bias and non  challant attitude also constitute a greater limitation to this research.  For the fact that questionnaire constitute the only instrument use to collect data and survey research design the sole  design used for the study. It is not certain if the same result will be used if other type of design as well as instrument  were used. All these factor constitute a greater limitation to the research. 1.8     Definition of Term Financial Incentives: Monetary reward or compensation use to motivate workers.     Non Financial Incentives: Other incentives apart from monetary rewards. Performance Incentive: Rewards that motivates worker to put in more efforts. Productivity: The rate at which employee work and their yield in their organization.</p>\n\nEFFECT OF FINANCIAL AND NON FINANCIAL INCENTIVES ON STAFF PRODUCTIVITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF FINANCIAL AND NON FINANCIAL INCENTIVES ON STAFF PRODUCTIVITY", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>This research is designed to cover Human Resources Planning in relation to P</em><em>erformance</em><em> in Private Sector.

An important theme of corporate governance is the nature and extent of accountability of people in the business and mechanisms that try to decrease the principal agent problem (Wikipedia, 2011).</p> <p> Corporate Governance also includes the relationships among the many stakeholders involved and the goals for which the corporation is governed. In contemporary business corporations, the main external stakeholder groups are shareholders, debt holders, trade creditors, suppliers, customer and communities affected by the corporation’s activities. Informal stakeholders are the board of directors, executives and other employees. It guarantees that an enterprise is directed and controlled in a responsible, professional, and transparent manner with the purpose of safeguarding its long-tem success it is intended to increase the confidence of shareholders and capital market investors.</p> <p> The World Bank (2009) states that corporate governance comprises two mechanisms, internal and external corporate governance. Internal corporate governance, giving priority to shareholder’s interest, operated on the board of directors to monitor top management. On the other hand, external corporate governance monitors and controls manager’s behaviors by means of external regulations and force, in which many parties, such as suppliers, debtors (stakeholders), accountants, lawyers, and providers of credit and investment bank.</p> <p> In the past, so many corporate organizations have been caught of getting involved in unethical practices, for example the discovery of financial scam by the Central Bank of Nigeria after the consolidation exercise, involving seven top bank executives in Nigeria, which puts the credibility of their corporate image under suspicion, which further shocking investors confidence. Consequently, corporate governance mechanism has been a crucial issue discussed again.</p> <p> It is against this background that the researcher see the subject matter; corporate governance and its impact on the management of Forte Oil Nigeria Plc, Kaduna as an issue worthy of being investigated.</p> <p>Statement of Problem</p> <p>In the past, so many organizations in Nigeria have been involved in unethical practices, which puts the credibility of their corporate image doubt. As such Forte Oil Nigerria Limited just like other oil company have been constraint with issues arising form customer’s complaint of exploitations of workers by using contract staff as against direct engagement of workers that would be remunerated according to their condition of service. Previous researches into the subject has brought to light the poor governance of so many companies with indebted accounts in Nigeria economy. Their accounting systems did not reflect the companies financial status. A typical example is the financial scam of Oceanic and Intercontinental Bank after the consolidation. Most management of such outfits were not accountable to stakeholders of the companies. Besides, the counts and the regulatory agencies were short of authority, corruption and kickbacks were part of the system in the companies. The poor governance practices led to the collapse of so many companies in Nigeria. Hence the need to study corporate governance and its impact on the management of Forte Oil Nigeria Plc  Kaduna.</p> <p>Objective of the Study</p> <p>The main objective of the study is to examine the corporate governance and its impact on the management of Forte Oil Nigeria Plc. The specific objectives are:</p> <p>To examine the effect of corporate governance on the performance of Forte Oil Nigeria Plc.</p> <p>To examine the internal and external corporate governance control mechanism in Forte Oil Nigeria Plc.</p> <p>To identify the systemic problems of corporate governance in Forte Oil Nigeria Plc.</p> <p>To proffer workable solutions to the identified problem of corporate governance in Forte Oil Nigeria Plc.</p> <p>Significance of the Study</p> <p>The study will be significant to Forte Oil Nigeria Plc especially as they utilize the findings of this research in enhancing policy governance in their organization. The study will also add to the existing knowledge on the subject matter and will also be a reference material for further research on corporate governance.</p> <p>Research Questions</p> <p>The central research question is: What is the impact of corporate governance on the management of Forte Oil Nigeria Plc? The specific questions are:</p> <p>How does corporate governance affect the performance of Forte Oil Nigeria Plc?</p> <p>What are the internal and external corporate governance control mechanism in place in Forte Oil Nigeria Plc?</p> <p>What are the systemic problems militating against corporate governance in Forte Oil Nigeria Plc?</p> <p>What are the solutions to such problems?</p> <p>RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</p> <p>H0: There is no effect of corporate governance on the performance of an organization</p> <p>H1:  There is an  effect of corporate governance on the performance of an organization</p> <p>Scope of the Study</p> <p>The study covers the examination of the impact of corporate governance on Forte Oil Nigeria Plc. The collection of empirical data is limited to Forte Oil Nigeria Plc Kaduna main office. The study covers a time from 2006 – 2011.</p> <p> 1.7    Limitation of the Study</p> <p> The limitation of this study arise from the shortcoming of the research design, the instrument of data collection and the non-challant attitude of respondents. For the fact that the survey study is used it is not certain whether other research design such as the descriptive design, historical design or ex-post design will yield the same result. It is not also certain if the same result would be obtained if other kind of instrument of data collection other than the questionnaire is used to obtain data. Besides, the non-challant attitude of the respondents and the over exaggeration or understatement of their responses when scoring the items in the questionnaire could affect the validity of their responses.

Background of the study</strong></p> <p>All organizationsare concerned with what should be done to achieve high level of productivity through staff motivation using the right kind of incentive. Consequently the effect of financial and non financial incentive becomes a burning issue in human resource management.</p> <p>As such a lot of theoretical concept, principles and techniques of management have evolved in response to these challenges/ but most scholars suggest that more conceptual and empirical work is required to show the link between financial and non financial incentive and staff productivity is still vague but some studies have documented in their work that financial incentive is readily perceived as having a high instrumental value that makes putting forth extra effort worthwhile and its has a long term effect in terms of labour turnover rate because of comparative value for alternative employment while non financial incentive has less initial impact as the pragmatics of financial gain, they seem to have a steady, sustainable impact.</p> <p>Despite the growing body of literature and empirical study on the effect of financial and non financial incentive on workers productivity, the subject matter still remains complex. Hence, the need to undertake a survey on the effect of financial and non financial incentives on staff productivity in Nigeria Postal Services Kaduna.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of problem</strong></p> <p>Nigeria Postal Services (NIPOST) like other public enterprise is constraint with the problem of using non performance based element like salaries to compensate it staff as against performance-related pay structure which has hamper productivity because it does not make worker put in extra effort in their work. This is so because their compensation is not based on incentive schemes that elicit additional effort of workers sequel to unfriendly government legislation on wages clause and bureaucratic inefficiency.

A great deal of attention has been given to a variety of Performance improvement strategies, including public-private partnership, and Balanced Score Card (BSC), in the hope that such strategies are a starting point for Performance improvement. It should be noted, however, that no Performance improvement strategy alone is perfect. As such, various strategies should be used at the same time. Since Performance improvement is a function of too many factors, ranging from top management support to feedback on budget based decisions, it is essential to be aware that all factors are equally important (Holzer &amp; Callhan, 1998; Lee, 2000a).</p> <p>Among others, the backdrop of Performance improvement is an employee’s desire to be maximally productive. As Guy (2002) points out, “it is the people who, in the long term, control the Performance of any organization” (p.307). Even if there might be a number of reinvention efforts and top management support, unless employees at all levels are willing to improve Performance, all efforts toward Performance enhancement will come to nothing.</p> <p>Modern day Organization is  concerned  with the  analysis  and  diagnosis  of  the  factor  that determine  organizational  effectiveness,  and  the planning and delivery of programmes to increase that effectiveness. Organizations want to obtain the commitment of their employees. Management  would  like  its employees  to  identify  with  the  values,  norms and artefacts of  the organization, hence  the need for organizational culture. Management needs  to explain  and  imbibe  its  culture  in  its  employees; this will enable the employee to get familiar with the  organizational  system.  During  this  process of  explanation,  the  employee  learns  about  the organizational  culture  and  decides  whether  he can  cope  with  it  or  not. This means that each organization is a learning environment. It is the proper understanding of the organizational culture that the performance of theemployee in the organization. Performance is the extent to which an individual is carrying out assignment or task. It refers to the degree of accomplishment of the task that makes up an employee’s job (Cascio, 2006).</p> <p>Commitment has a rational element: Most people consciously decide to make commitments, then they thoughtfully plan and carry out the actions required to fulfill them (Meyer, et al, 2004).Because commitments require an investment of time as well as mental and emotional energy, most people make them with the expectation of reciprocation. That is, people assume that in exchange for their commitment, they will get something of value in return—such as favors, affection, gifts, attention, goods, money and property. From this perspective, this paper sheds light on the importance of a multidimensional view of employee commitment. This paper starts with an assumption that the previous concept of organizational commitment may not tell the whole story about individual performance and Performance. Identifying multiple foci of employee commitment beyond the organization helps explain various motivational bases among employees toward Performance improvement efforts.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>The problem of this study bore from the fact that there is a wide discrepancy between employees’ efforts towards work and what he or she receives or get in return for that effort. In the world of work, as particularly in an organizational setting, employees and employers have traditionally made a tacit agreement: In exchange for workers’ commitment, coca cola’sgoverning bodies would provide forms of value for employees, such as secure jobs and fair compensation. But rather unfortunate, the employees irrespective of their level or ranking in Coca-cola. As a result, workers in the organization have embarked on series of protest in order protect their work conditions and improve welfare package. Reciprocity affects the intensity of a commitment. When an entity or individual to whom someone has made a commitment fails to come through with the expected exchange, the commitment erodes.This study therefore, looked into the effect of employee’s commitment on organizational Performance,a case study of staffsof the Coca-cola, Edo state.</p> <p><strong>1.3       RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>It is in view of the above problems that the following questions arise:</p> <ol><li>What is the level of employee commitment in relation to job satisfaction in Coca-cola?</li> <li>Does motivation improve employees’ commitment to work?</li> <li>Does the level of employee’s commitment determine organizational Performance?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is to examine the effect of employee’s commitment on organizational Performance. The study also aims at:</p> <ol><li>Determining the effect of employee commitment in relation to job satisfaction.</li> <li>Ascertaining whether motivation improve employees’ commitment to work, and</li> <li>Ascertaining whether employee’s commitment determines organizational Performance.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5       STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>The following null hypotheses will be tested in this study:</p> <p>H0: There is no significant relationship between job satisfaction and employees’ commitment</p> <p>H0:   There is no significant relationship between motivation of employees and employees’ commitment to work</p> <p>H0:There is no significant relationship between employee’s commitment and increased performance/Performance</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY    </strong></p> <p>The findings from this study will help to highlight those areas where there are problems among staff and thus will be of great benefit to the authorities of higher institutions and the policy makers. The results of this study would hopefully be significant in the sense that it would enable both the Management of universities to better understand how the various motivational factors could be harnessed to inspire staff to increase and sustain Performance.</p> <p>The findings from this study would help to further highlight the likely problems of frustrations and how motivation can be used to either reduce or eliminate these problems amongst staff of the organization (Coca-cola).</p> <p><strong>1.7       SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is on effect of employee’s commitment on organizational Performance. The study will also covers the various techniques of employees commitment and theories of motivation as they impact on employees Performance in an  organization.  The study covers between 2010 and 2011.</p> <p><strong>1.8       LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p> The study is limited to the employees’ commitment, and its effect of organizational Performance. The study does not consider other variables and as such is limited to only those areas specified above. Also, the study only covers the academic environment which is further confined to the Coca-cola, Ekpoma. It does not cover all sectors of the Nigerian educational system; and as such the study does not look into how commitment strategies work or influence Performance across other sectors of the Nigerian economy.</p> <p><strong>1.9       ORGANIZATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>For an orderly presentation of this study, this research essay has been divided into four chapter.The first gives an introduction of the study, chapter two focuses on literature review, chapter three is the presentation and analysis of data generated for this study, and chapter fourthe summarizes the study and gives useful recommendations.</p> <p><strong>1.10    DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>Employees’ commitment can be defined as both a willingness to persist in a course of action and reluctance to change plans, often owing to a sense of obligation to stay the course.</p> <p><strong>Morale:</strong> Moral refers to staff emotional and mental level of zeal.</p> <p><strong>Employees</strong>: Are theworkers in an organization, working for the accomplishment of the organizational goals. In this study, the employees are those staffs of the organization, the Coca-cola, Edo state .</p> <p><strong>Performance</strong>: It is the relationship between the amount of one or more inputs and the amount of outputs from a clearly identified process. That is the outcome performance of an organization or individual. </p> <p><strong>Motivation:</strong>These are factors (familiarity, concern and driving force), which exist or are provided in a work situation either physically or psychologically which determine the input and Performance level of the worker.</p> <p><strong>REFERENCES</strong></p> <p>Cascio, J.S.

As information users we expect reliable information at our fingertips, continual connection to people wherever they are, and equipment that fits into a top pocket. Whether we are consumers, clients, students, professors, employees or managers, we expect the digital world to work for us. The concept of information overload is not new, but with the continued growth of digital technology and the plethora of tools and channels for digital communication, the challenge of managing all that information is not getting smaller, and it is increasingly everyone’s responsibility to deal with it.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Todays office business, professional or Government is in a state of change. This change is reflected in the office structure and office positions from entry level to Executive Office Manager Level. Hence attention is now given to what the office does and the way in which office activities can be accomplished in an efficient and an effective way an office manager is responsible for the smooth operation of the day-to-day business of the company, a good office manager makes it possible for other people to function efficiently. Office managers work closely with the company partners, owner, or president to meet their company's staffing, equipment, and organizational needs. Duties may include pricing products from vendors, interviewing job applicants, managing payroll, and reimbursing members of the firm for out-of-pocket business expenses, and so the need for information technology had to come into play as information technology has replaced the traditional equipment used by an office manager to perform his tasks.<br/> Montgomerie (2004), defines information technology as the handling of vocal, pictorial, textual and numerical Information by means of micro-electronic based equipment in computing and telecommunication. This clearly brings about the advantages of information delivery through technological means, since almost all aspects of office work can adequately be taken care of. Aronu (2000) defines Information Technology as the combination of two technologies, computing and the main purpose of which is to transmit representation of information signals between remote locations. The concept of “core competence” has been defined and studied at the organizational level in the management literature as well as in information systems, as exemplified Sambamurthy and Zmud’s work on managerial IT competence. These latter authors state that such competency enables an organization “to effectively acquire, deploy and leverage its IT investments in pursuit of business strategies and in support of business activities” and helps fulfill the objective of aligning IT strategies and business strategies. However, competence at the individual level is required for the creation of core competence at the organizational level. Research on this individual component is incomplete. This paper explores the concept of the IT competence of individual business managers. Based on an examination of the literature in several disciplines and consultations with business and IT managers, we define the IT competence of business managers and identify its sub-dimensions. We also present a theoretical model of the link between IT competence and business-led technology leadership. The model is designed to be empirically tested and used to explore differences in the managers’ leadership in IT projects and partnerships with IT departments.</p> <p>Overtime in the business world, information technology has grown to be one of the cardinal pillars. The importance of information technology cannot be overemphasized in the 21stcentury. Information technology was known to be indispensable in stretching from the early 19th century. Information technology simply put can be regarded or defined as the application of computers to store, retrieve, transmit and manipulate data, often in the context of a business or other enterprise.</p> <p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has been identified as a vehicle with the potential to improve the competency of managers and every staff as well as the efficiency and service delivery of organizations both in the developed and developing countries. Information and communication technologies have changed the face of the world we live in (Benson, 1998).</p> <p>ICT enables people to communicate with family, friends and colleagues around the world instantaneously, gain access to global libraries, information resources and numerous other opportunities. Nelson, 2010 opined that information systems strategy is still not properly understood while ethics and behavioural issues are of concern. There are still staggering losses involved in information technology investment.</p> <p>Competence is defined as the knowledge and skills required for performing and supporting business processes. They represent the basis for creating value in an organization. The following competencies are needed to achieving organizational and managerial success in the field of information technology; Technical Knowledge, Work Coordination, Problem Solving and Prevention, Communication and Service encompass and Accountability which eclipses those skills and abilities required to make decisions and take responsibility for work.</p> <p>Since the year 2001, there has been a revolutionary growth in the telephony industry which is a major branch of information technology in Nigeria. Two years after the introduction of GSM in Nigeria, some researchers conducted an interview among medical practitioners in some organisations to find out the current level of utilization of telephones for customer care service delivery. They noted that managers of the organizations used their personal mobile phones to facilitate customer care at their own detriment. Currently, the number of GSM service providers in the country has increased significantly and all of them keep rolling out several service options or packages including internet services with varying benefits to attract customers (Agboola, 2003).</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The poor performances of businesses in organizations have grossly affected the overall gross domestic product of economic productivity of Nigeria; this has led to the present harsh economic condition, this May be as a result of the poor knowledge and application of information technology in businesses and organizations There is a problem of complexity of managing information technology and systems especially in the corporate environment where a lot is required in the effective application of information technology which has a lot to do with the competency of managers in the adoption of information technology.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Aims and Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to research on information technology competence on business managers.

Unfortunately the growth and expansion in the sector are not the manifestation of a sound or vibrant banking system known anywhere in the world. Most banks in Nigeria are characterized by inadequate capital base, poor services, huge rate of bankruptcy, and lack of management expertise, bad debt syndrome and greater exposure to fraud.</p> <p>The central Bank of Nigeria on July 6th 2004, announced the recapitalization of banking sector from N2 billion to N25 billion with effect from 1st January 2006. This was with a view to make the sector internationally competitive, sound and improves its ability to provide credit to all the productive sectors of the economy. In order to meet this obligation, banks embarked on strategies of merger and acquisition, floating of new shares and so on. At the end of the exercise, 25 new banks emerged (Olaitan 2006).</p> <p>Managing and maintaining employee morale is one of the most important functions of effective HR. The cliché that a happy worker is a productive worker is a cliché for a reason. While it may be more accurate to say that an unhappy worker is an unproductive worker, every HR professional knows the value in good staff morale. </p> <p>As a result of the bank recapitalization process that commenced from 2005, commercial banks over a hundred had to close shops or merge with another bank to still be in business. The effects of mergers and acquisitions in the banking industry of Nigeria on employee morale can be significant if the reorganization of the business is not handled effectively. During any merger or acquisition effort, there are at least two groups of employees involved, often coming from organizations with distinctly different cultures and styles. Learning a new culture can be challenging, but is especially so when employees are faced with uncertainty about what the future may hold and whose job is on the chopping block.</p> <p>Bank recapitalization which was effective from 2006 is aimed at making Nigerian banks stronger and better in-order to finance all sectors of the economy including the major drivers of the economy-Small and Medium Scale Enterprises. This effort to stabilize the banking industry of Nigeria and make it financially strong and healthy will definitely affect employee morale and productivity-either positively or negatively.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Change is often difficult for employees, especially if they were not directly involved in decisions that impact their jobs. During mergers and acquisitions, change can be especially difficult and can lead to stress which can have a negative impact on morale if not handled effectively (Iloh, 2012). Communication is critical during these times. To the extent possible organizations should strive to share as much information about what is happening and, most importantly, how the changes will affect individual employees, as they possibly can.</p> <p>When two or more organizations come together, culture clash is inevitable. Rarely do two organizations have the same culture. As these groups get to know each other there will inevitably be conflict and perceived or real losses on both sides, says Pophal. Employees may fear losing their jobs or losing opportunities that they formerly had. This fear can negatively impact productivity and may even result in employees leaving the company to seek jobs elsewhere. It is important for organizations and their managers and HR staff to recognize this and to provide opportunities for employees to get to know each other, to openly address concerns, and to work together toward the creation of a new culture that will merge the best of both worlds (Leigh, 2008).</p> <p>When employees are concerned about their own job security they are more likely to become competitive with others and this competitiveness can result in conflict--sometimes even violence. During mergers and acquisitions it is important for managers and HR professionals to be alert to signs of negative competition and to ensure that employees are being kept informed about impacts on their jobs and their futures with the company. While some competition is good, competition is not good when it creates tension and negative conflict in the organization (Liegh, 2008)</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is to examine the effects of mergers and acquisitions on employee morale in First City Monument Bank (FCMB), Calabar Main branch. Specific objectives of the study are:</p> <ol><li>To examine the effect of merger and acquisition on employees’ confidence on a given task in FCMB.</li> <li>To appraise the effect of merger and acquisition on employees’ will to remain with current employer.</li> <li>To examine the effect of merger and acquisition on employees’ zeal to take on newer task.</li> <li>To examine the effect of merger and acquisition on employee job satisfaction with respect to new company policies, reviewed employees’ benefits and working condition.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In-order to guide the study and achieve the research objectives stated above, the following research questions apply to the study:</p> <ol><li>What effect do merger and acquisition have on employees’ confidence on a given task in FCMB?</li> <li>What effect do merger and acquisition have on employees’ will to remain with current employer?</li> <li>What effect do merger and acquisition have on employees’ zeal to take on newer task?</li> <li>What effect do merger and acquisition have on employee job satisfaction with respect to new company policies, reviewed employees’ benefits and working condition?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <ol><li><strong>Ho</strong>: There is no significant relationship between merger and acquisition and employee confidence on a given task.</li> <li>: There is a significant relationship between merger and acquisition and employee confidence on a given task.</li> <li><strong>Ho</strong>: There is no significant relationship between merger and acquisition and employee retention.</li> <li>: There is a significant relationship between merger and acquisition and employee retention.</li> <li><strong>Ho</strong>: There is no significant relationship between merger and acquisition and employee Zeal to take up newer tasks.</li> <li>: There is a significant relationship between merger and acquisition and employee to take up newer tasks.</li> <li><strong>Ho</strong>: There is no significant relationship between merger and acquisition and employee job satisfaction.</li> <li><strong>Hi</strong>: There is a significant relationship between merger and acquisition and employee job satisfaction.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study will aid organizations currently undertaking strategic changes through mergers and acquisitions to design and implement corporate governance policies that will benefit both employees in the acquired firm and that of the parent company. Various insights into how confidence, zeal, commitment and overall productivity of employees can be affected by mergers and acquisitions will be clearly highlighted in the study to further enlighten managers of various organizations on proper ways to go about merging and acquiring other firms without risking productivity of employees.</p> <p>Furthermore, the study will serve as guide to student researchers who may wish to explore more into the effects of mergers and acquisitions on overall performance of an organization.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is delimited to First City Monument Bank Plc, Calabar main branch. All findings and recommendations from the study are based on issued questionnaires to employees of the bank. A wider scope could not be covered by the researcher due to time and financial constraints.</p> <p><strong>1.9 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Funds were in very short supply to the researcher and the researcher could not purchase some valuable print materials needed for this project at the time they were most needed. The expenses on transportation to FCMB are so enormous because of many occasions the researcher was not attended to and would have to leave without the information required.</p> <p>Another constraint faced by the researcher was limited time for the completion of the project and engagement in other academic activities which occupied most of the researcher’s time.</p> <p>The research was faced with some restrictions in the area of the case study; this is due to bureaucratic reasons in the administrative procedures in the Organization. It was not possible to get all the necessary information that would have helped in finishing the work on stipulated time. The process of going through some records to get data was very tedious and formidable task as some materials needed are tagged “TOP SECRET”.</p> <p><strong>1.10 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Merger and Acquisition (M&amp;A): </strong>Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) are both aspects of strategic management, corporate finance and management dealing with the buying, selling, dividing and combining of different companies and similar entities that can help an enterprise grow rapidly in its sector or location of origin, or a new field or new location, without creating a subsidiary, other child entity or using a joint venture.</p> <p><strong>Employee: </strong>An employee is anyone who has agreed to be employed, under a contract of service, to work for some form of payment.

An important theme of corporate governance is the nature and extent of accountability of people in the business and mechanisms that try to decrease the principal agent problem (Wikipedia, 2011).</p> <p> Corporate Governance also includes the relationships among the many stakeholders involved and the goals for which the corporation is governed. In contemporary business corporations, the main external stakeholder groups are shareholders, debt holders, trade creditors, suppliers, customer and communities affected by the corporation’s activities. Informal stakeholders are the board of directors, executives and other employees. It guarantees that an enterprise is directed and controlled in a responsible, professional, and transparent manner with the purpose of safeguarding its long-tem success it is intended to increase the confidence of shareholders and capital market investors.</p> <p> The World Bank (2009) states that corporate governance comprises two mechanisms, internal and external corporate governance. Internal corporate governance, giving priority to shareholder’s interest, operated on the board of directors to monitor top management. On the other hand, external corporate governance monitors and controls manager’s behaviors by means of external regulations and force, in which many parties, such as suppliers, debtors (stakeholders), accountants, lawyers, and providers of credit and investment bank.</p> <p> In the past, so many corporate organizations have been caught of getting involved in unethical practices, for example the discovery of financial scam by the Central Bank of Nigeria after the consolidation exercise, involving seven top bank executives in Nigeria, which puts the credibility of their corporate image under suspicion, which further shocking investors confidence. Consequently, corporate governance mechanism has been a crucial issue discussed again.</p> <p> It is against this background that the researcher see the subject matter; corporate governance and its impact on the management of Forte Oil Nigeria Plc, Kaduna as an issue worthy of being investigated.</p> <p>Statement of Problem</p> <p>In the past, so many organizations in Nigeria have been involved in unethical practices, which puts the credibility of their corporate image doubt. As such Forte Oil Nigerria Limited just like other oil company have been constraint with issues arising form customer’s complaint of exploitations of workers by using contract staff as against direct engagement of workers that would be remunerated according to their condition of service. Previous researches into the subject has brought to light the poor governance of so many companies with indebted accounts in Nigeria economy. Their accounting systems did not reflect the companies financial status. A typical example is the financial scam of Oceanic and Intercontinental Bank after the consolidation. Most management of such outfits were not accountable to stakeholders of the companies. Besides, the counts and the regulatory agencies were short of authority, corruption and kickbacks were part of the system in the companies. The poor governance practices led to the collapse of so many companies in Nigeria. Hence the need to study corporate governance and its impact on the management of Forte Oil Nigeria Plc  Kaduna.</p> <p>Objective of the Study</p> <p>The main objective of the study is to examine the corporate governance and its impact on the management of Forte Oil Nigeria Plc. The specific objectives are:</p> <p>To examine the effect of corporate governance on the performance of Forte Oil Nigeria Plc.</p> <p>To examine the internal and external corporate governance control mechanism in Forte Oil Nigeria Plc.</p> <p>To identify the systemic problems of corporate governance in Forte Oil Nigeria Plc.</p> <p>To proffer workable solutions to the identified problem of corporate governance in Forte Oil Nigeria Plc.</p> <p>Significance of the Study</p> <p>The study will be significant to Forte Oil Nigeria Plc especially as they utilize the findings of this research in enhancing policy governance in their organization. The study will also add to the existing knowledge on the subject matter and will also be a reference material for further research on corporate governance.</p> <p>Research Questions</p> <p>The central research question is: What is the impact of corporate governance on the management of Forte Oil Nigeria Plc? The specific questions are:</p> <p>How does corporate governance affect the performance of Forte Oil Nigeria Plc?</p> <p>What are the internal and external corporate governance control mechanism in place in Forte Oil Nigeria Plc?</p> <p>What are the systemic problems militating against corporate governance in Forte Oil Nigeria Plc?</p> <p>What are the solutions to such problems?</p> <p>RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</p> <p>H0: There is no effect of corporate governance on the performance of an organization</p> <p>H1:  There is an  effect of corporate governance on the performance of an organization</p> <p>Scope of the Study</p> <p>The study covers the examination of the impact of corporate governance on Forte Oil Nigeria Plc. The collection of empirical data is limited to Forte Oil Nigeria Plc Kaduna main office. The study covers a time from 2006 – 2011.</p> <p> 1.7    Limitation of the Study</p> <p> The limitation of this study arise from the shortcoming of the research design, the instrument of data collection and the non-challant attitude of respondents. For the fact that the survey study is used it is not certain whether other research design such as the descriptive design, historical design or ex-post design will yield the same result. It is not also certain if the same result would be obtained if other kind of instrument of data collection other than the questionnaire is used to obtain data. Besides, the non-challant attitude of the respondents and the over exaggeration or understatement of their responses when scoring the items in the questionnaire could affect the validity of their responses. These limitations should be taken cognizance of by other researchers conducting similar studies.</p> <p>Definition of Terms</p> <p>Corporate Governance: This is relationship that exists between the different participants, and defining the direction of the firm.</p> <p>Corporation: This refers to corporate entity or a body by means of which capital is acquired, used for investing in assets producing goods and services.</p> <p>Shareholders: People who have invested in a company through subscribing to the company’s stock.</p> <p>Board Structure: Management at the top comprising of board of directors.</p> <p>Ownership Structure: Shareholders and directors.</p> <p>CEO: Acronym for Chief Executive Officer.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ON THE PERFORMANCE OF AN ORGANIZATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ON THE PERFORMANCE OF AN ORGANIZATION", "id": 19}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1    <strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Leadershipis a very important management function that involves harnessing of human and material resources for the attainment of organizational goals. Leadership has been viewed by many authors as a process whereby an individual exerts influence upon others in an organizational context.</p> <p>Bowler and Seashore (1996) enumerated the basic functions of leadership to include:</p> <ul><li>Enhancing others feeling of self-esteem and support.</li> <li>Facilitating an interaction such that group members develop a close and mutually satisfying relationship.</li> <li>Goal emphasis for high performance and achievements.</li> <li>Work facilitation such that targets are achieved through such activities as scheduling, coordinating, planning and the effective application of knowledge.</li> </ul> <p>It is expected therefore that in every organization, there should be a leader who will in addition to planning, organize and coordinate work, mobilize, inspire and utilize available human and material resources optimally for effective organizational growth and development. Leadership often emerges in a social context, in that it does not exist in a vacuum, but a phenomenon for people and by the people. The objectives of leadership are products of clear vision and its actions are dictated by great focus and a sense of mission. The way and manner leadership is conducted in any given situation, depends on the interplay of such factors as individual personality, work demand and the exigencies of the environment.</p> <p>The extent to which any of these factors dominates one’s behavior determines to a large extent the person’s accumulation of natural or situational leadership traits.</p> <p>Several arguments have been raised over time about the relationship between leadership and employee’s attitude. However, most scholars caution against tendencies to propose a cause-effective relationship because of the confounding effects of the interviewing variables.</p> <p>For instance, a leadership characteristic determines leadership behavior, and consequently, the attitude of subordinates towards him and the work situation, Katz (1994).</p> <p>And the view of Meornick (1991), democratic leader tend to affect employees more positively than authoritative leaders, while authoritative leaders tend to achieve production targets better than the former.</p> <p>However, Petz (1952) theorized that what matters in the leader-subordinate relationship is not just the imposing attitudes of the leader, but also the enduring characteristics of the subordinates. He also advocated the principle of reciprocal influence and integration, according to him, subordinates expect their supervisors to exercise upward influence when dealing with problems which affects workers themselves, but when this is perceived asbeing limited, they develop unfavourable reactions.</p> <p>Consequently, this will thwart the attainment of organizational objectives and effectiveness. However, organizational effectiveness depends to a great extent on the ways the various group in the organizational hierarchy are structured and integrated. Effective management should therefore develop effective group membership to which they owe loyalty. That is why effective leadership is necessary in any organization, as all activities that will promote organizational effectiveness are to a large extent measured by their productivity.</p> <p>1.2    <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Leadership is considered as the bane of development in Nigeria organization. In political circle for instance, the problem of leadership is described with despicable terms as corruption, ineptitude, red-tapism and nepotism etc.</p> <p>There is no gain saying the fact that most of the socio-economic maladies which the nation faced currently are product of poor management and bad or ineffective leadership.</p> <p>For over a decade now, the world bank has reported consistently in her annual bulletin and publications that Nigeria ranks amongst the sixth poorest nations of the world despite her abundant human and natural resources.</p> <p>In addition, capacity utilization of Nigeria industrial organizations has been very low level since 1983, and many industries have since folded up. This is an apparent failure on the part of those leadership positions which the organizations operate and design practical and effective response strategies to cope with the prevailing situations, the obvious conclusion is that they have serious leadership problems.</p> <p>Many organizations which could have been economically viable are folding up even now, and some which are surviving could hardly meet their targeted maximum production level even when such organization have financial backing, enough raw material and human resources. Therefore, leadership remains the problem militating against the growth and development of such organization. To curb this menace, there is need for an effective leader to effectively put these resources to proper use for maximum result.</p> <p>Government organizations never really get extinct by virtue of their ownership structure. This is not the case with private organizations which may be devastated to the point of folding up due to numerous problems amongst which is leadership. Their survival capacity is much easier than the former.</p> <p>It should be noted that when leadership creates a turbulent work environment, moral drops, production decreases and the prospects for survival as well diminish. Most of the studies conducted in Nigeria have focused on the relationship between motivation and productivity (e.g. Egwu, 992) but have rarely contemplates on the relations between leadership and organizational effectiveness.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in most organizations, the quality of management is often measured by the quality of work output and the margin of profit. However, different leadership styles are required for different work situations and sometimes they vary in the nature of ownership. Leadership entails harnessing the potentials of available manpower and material resources in such a way that organizational objectives are achieved and sustained.</p> <p>Mouka Limited is a service and profit oriented organization, owned by some individuals. Such similar study has not been carried out as to determine how leadership influences it.</p> <p>The current study therefore intends to examine the impact of leadership on the performance of this private sector organization.</p> <p><strong>1.3. Research Questions</strong></p> <ol><li>What is the perception of staff in Mouka Limited about effective leadership and its impact on organizational effectiveness?</li> <li>Are there gender and educational differences in perception of effectiveness of leadership in Mouka Limited?</li> </ol> <p>1.4    <strong>Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study is intended to satisfy the task of those seeking knowledge and the importance of leadership towards the achievement of organizational goals and objectives.</p> <p>The overall objective of this project is to:</p> <ol><li>Identify the environment in which the organization operates, the outcome of the work environment and how leadership activities contribute to the achievement of those outcomes.</li> <li>To appraise the different leadership theories in relation to employees and organizational objectives as well as determine perception of the supervisory management cadre in private sector organizations about effective leadership.</li> </ol> <p>It is obvious that the primary objective of every organization, is to provide consumers with goods and services at the right time, place and price so as to satisfy them. Hence, effectiveness and efficiency are the watch words.</p> <p>In the final analysis, the write up will reveal that democratic leaders tend to affect the employees more positively than authoritative leaders, while authoritative leaders tend to achieve production target better than democratic leaders. However, organizations should ensure that an effective leader with well equipped and trained staffs, should manned the affairs of the firms so as to attain organizational effectiveness.</p> <p>1.5    <strong>Statement of Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>        <em>Hypothesis I</em></p> <p>H0:    Effective leadership does not contribute to effectiveness and productivity of workers in Mouka Limited, Kaduna.</p> <p>H1:    Effective leadership contributes to effectiveness and productivity in Mouka Limited, Kaduna.</p> <p>1.6. <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The significance of the study is that, that, it will serve as an instrument for harnessing the impact of leadership in the achievement of organizational effectiveness and objectives in the private sector i.e. Mouka Limited, Kaduna.</p> <p>The outcome of this research would:</p> <ul><li>Identify aspects of the Nigeria work life that need to be influenced by planned and exceptive management.</li> <li>Highlights qualities that show effective leadership and are critical to growth and development of private sector enterprise in Nigeria.</li> </ul> <p>1.7    <strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study was designed to cover Mouka Limited Kaduna, a caring and service organization among other private sectors. The study is to cover the impact of leadership on organizational effectiveness in Mouka Limited, and also operation, procurement and finance unit.</p> <p>1.8    <strong>Limitations of the Study</strong></p> <p>Constraints encountered in the course of this study includes finance and time, as the staffs of Mouka Limited had little time to squeeze out of their schedule of duty to attend to the researcher, and besides, not all the staffs can be seen at the same time as some were on shifting duty and that necessitated the researcher constantly coming around and that posed a serious financial implication.</p> <p>1.9    <strong>Historical Background of the Case Study</strong></p> <p>Mouka Limited was established in 1972 by Moukarine from Lebanon. He was the sole owner and later went into Mouka pipe, which is a subsidiary of Mouka. Mouka limited is a company that specialize in manufacturing different sizes of mattresses. In the year 2006, 65% of Mouka Limited shares were sold to Artistes a group of foreign investors, while 35% was retained by Moukarine. The diversification and sold of 65% shares to group of foreign inventors, was to provide the best product at affordable cost to the general public or populace. Despite the changes in administrative set up of the organization, it has continued to witness higher patronage. The reason for this, is that the leadership has been efficient in its operation.</p> <p>1.10    <strong>Definition of Terms</strong></p> <ul><li><strong><em>Leadership: </em></strong>The act or process of influencing people to strive willingly and enthusiastically towards the accomplishment of group goals.</li> <li><strong><em>Management:</em></strong> The process of designing and maintaining an environment in which individuals work together in group to accomplish effectively selected aims and objectives.</li> <li><strong><em>Efficiency:</em></strong> Ability to work well without wasting time and resources.</li> <li><strong><em>Impact:</em></strong> Strong impression or effect of leadership on organizational effectiveness.</li> <li><strong><em>Organization:</em></strong> A structure or process in which persons interact for objectives or an enterprise itself.</li> <li><strong><em>Productivity:</em></strong> Efficiency in the accomplishment of objectives.</li> <li><strong><em>Performance:</em></strong> An action or achievement considered in relation to how successful it is.</li> <li><strong><em>Satisfaction:</em></strong> Pleasure derived from doing one’s job.</li> <li><strong><em>Behaviour:</em></strong> Individual unique way of exhibiting his or her action.</li> <li><strong><em>Democratic:</em></strong> Consultative or participative type of group behvaviours.</li> <li><strong><em>Junior Staff:</em></strong> Workers on grade level 1 – 6 comprising of uneducated and those educated to secondary school level.</li> <li><strong><em>Senior Staff:</em></strong> Workers on grade levels 7 and above.</li> <li><strong><em>Manager:</em></strong> A person who is in charge of a business, a shop/store or a similar organization e.g. bank manager, hotel manager etc.</li> </ul>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF LEADERSHIP STYLE IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ORGANIZATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY GOAL IN MOUKA LIMITED<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF LEADERSHIP STYLE IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ORGANIZATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY GOAL IN MOUKA LIMITED", "id": 20}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Abstract </strong></p> <p>We live in a digital world in which the amount of information available for human consumption doubles every three years. As information users we expect reliable information at our fingertips, continual connection to people wherever they are, and equipment that fits into a top pocket. Whether we are consumers, clients, students, professors, employees or managers, we expect the digital world to work for us. The concept of information overload is not new, but with the continued growth of digital technology and the plethora of tools and channels for digital communication, the challenge of managing all that information is not getting smaller, and it is increasingly everyone’s responsibility to deal with it.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Todays office business, professional or Government is in a state of change. This change is reflected in the office structure and office positions from entry level to Executive Office Manager Level. Hence attention is now given to what the office does and the way in which office activities can be accomplished in an efficient and an effective way an office manager is responsible for the smooth operation of the day-to-day business of the company, a good office manager makes it possible for other people to function efficiently. Office managers work closely with the company partners, owner, or president to meet their company's staffing, equipment, and organizational needs. Duties may include pricing products from vendors, interviewing job applicants, managing payroll, and reimbursing members of the firm for out-of-pocket business expenses, and so the need for information technology had to come into play as information technology has replaced the traditional equipment used by an office manager to perform his tasks.<br/> Montgomerie (2004), defines information technology as the handling of vocal, pictorial, textual and numerical Information by means of micro-electronic based equipment in computing and telecommunication. This clearly brings about the advantages of information delivery through technological means, since almost all aspects of office work can adequately be taken care of. Aronu (2000) defines Information Technology as the combination of two technologies, computing and the main purpose of which is to transmit representation of information signals between remote locations. The concept of “core competence” has been defined and studied at the organizational level in the management literature as well as in information systems, as exemplified Sambamurthy and Zmud’s work on managerial IT competence. These latter authors state that such competency enables an organization “to effectively acquire, deploy and leverage its IT investments in pursuit of business strategies and in support of business activities” and helps fulfill the objective of aligning IT strategies and business strategies. However, competence at the individual level is required for the creation of core competence at the organizational level. Research on this individual component is incomplete. This paper explores the concept of the IT competence of individual business managers. Based on an examination of the literature in several disciplines and consultations with business and IT managers, we define the IT competence of business managers and identify its sub-dimensions. We also present a theoretical model of the link between IT competence and business-led technology leadership. The model is designed to be empirically tested and used to explore differences in the managers’ leadership in IT projects and partnerships with IT departments.</p> <p>Overtime in the business world, information technology has grown to be one of the cardinal pillars. The importance of information technology cannot be overemphasized in the 21stcentury. Information technology was known to be indispensable in stretching from the early 19th century. Information technology simply put can be regarded or defined as the application of computers to store, retrieve, transmit and manipulate data, often in the context of a business or other enterprise.</p> <p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has been identified as a vehicle with the potential to improve the competency of managers and every staff as well as the efficiency and service delivery of organizations both in the developed and developing countries. Information and communication technologies have changed the face of the world we live in (Benson, 1998).</p> <p>ICT enables people to communicate with family, friends and colleagues around the world instantaneously, gain access to global libraries, information resources and numerous other opportunities. Nelson, 2010 opined that information systems strategy is still not properly understood while ethics and behavioural issues are of concern. There are still staggering losses involved in information technology investment.</p> <p>Competence is defined as the knowledge and skills required for performing and supporting business processes. They represent the basis for creating value in an organization. The following competencies are needed to achieving organizational and managerial success in the field of information technology; Technical Knowledge, Work Coordination, Problem Solving and Prevention, Communication and Service encompass and Accountability which eclipses those skills and abilities required to make decisions and take responsibility for work.</p> <p>Since the year 2001, there has been a revolutionary growth in the telephony industry which is a major branch of information technology in Nigeria. Two years after the introduction of GSM in Nigeria, some researchers conducted an interview among medical practitioners in some organisations to find out the current level of utilization of telephones for customer care service delivery. They noted that managers of the organizations used their personal mobile phones to facilitate customer care at their own detriment. Currently, the number of GSM service providers in the country has increased significantly and all of them keep rolling out several service options or packages including internet services with varying benefits to attract customers (Agboola, 2003).</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The poor performances of businesses in organizations have grossly affected the overall gross domestic product of economic productivity of Nigeria; this has led to the present harsh economic condition, this May be as a result of the poor knowledge and application of information technology in businesses and organizations There is a problem of complexity of managing information technology and systems especially in the corporate environment where a lot is required in the effective application of information technology which has a lot to do with the competency of managers in the adoption of information technology.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Aims and Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to research on information technology competence on business managers. Meanwhile, the main objective of this study is to know the effect of Information technology competency on business managers.

No organization survive without the effort of manpower, that why management of any organization must recognize human element as the most vital ingredient that sustain the growth and long survival of the organization. For a sustainable development and continuous increase in productivity, the management must actively be up and doing in manpower training and development programme because training bridge the gap between the actual performance and expected performance.</p> <p>Training is the planned and conscious effort towards improving skill and attitude to increase organizational productivity. Apart from  increasing productivity, it prepares employee for higher position and when faced with complex task, it keep employees at rest. As organization expand so the management become complex which call for the need for manpower training for effective and efficient running of the organization. Employee needs a constant training to withstand technological changes. Training deals with factual and relatively navour or structured learning material having immediate job reference to programme for fewer ranking employee while development is strictly meant for manager.</p> <p>Management development therefore implies, attempt to improve managerial performance effectiveness through impacting knowledge for the purpose of organizational performance. Some managers are develop organization wide to identify managerial potentials or superior candidate with the view of widen the breath of experience (knowledge and attitude). Some are develop to enable them ripe for promotion and withstand complex task. Manpower training and development as a policy in an organization involved given the required training and impacting the needed knowledge to improve the employee performance which is gear towards increasing productivity. Other objective of training programme is avoidance of personnel obsolesce, a constant damage  in highly competitive and changing business environment above all, training and development is the life wire of any organization that wishers to grow because no one knows except is been taught so for that organization must embrace training.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>“Manpower training and development on organization goals attainment” as a chosen to topic which set out to research how manpower development can affect organization set goals competent manpower must be recruited, trained, developed and maintained in order that the desire goals and objectives of any organization can be realized. Some organization wouldn’t like to train their employee because after training they become attractive and marketable to other competitor. Some are due to wrong perception that money spent on training is a lost instead of investment. Whilst others are wrong implementation of policy.</p> <p>Base on the above reason its’ pertinent to ask the following question:</p> <ol><li>To what extent is training and development of manpower recognized as a very important tool for attainment of organization goals.</li> <li>How does manpower training and development affect organizational productivity</li> <li>Does Nigeria breweries policy encourage training and development.</li> </ol> <p><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The following are the objective of this study</p> <ol><li>To investigate the effect of manpower training and development on the organizational productivity</li> <li>To study the management policy towards training and development</li> <li>To know the attitude of the employee towards training and development in the organization.</li> <li>To investigate how effective is the implementation of training and development policy with out human error.</li> </ol> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>In order for reliability and accuracy of this work the researcher would like to put forth the following</p> <p><strong>H0:</strong> That man power training and development does not improve organizational productivity.</p> <p><strong>H1:</strong> That manpower training and development enhance the increase in organizational productivity.</p> <p><strong>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>From the various studies as well as discussion mention earlier, it is apparent that there is enough ground to warrant a study that will examine the effect of manpower training and development. The importance of the study cannot be over emphasis for the fact that the success and growth of organization and training and development are laid together they are inseperateable. If organization must succeed in the must embrace training.</p> <p>However, the following are significance to the study.</p> <ol><li>Determine how training and development will prepare the employee for higher and complex task</li> <li>Training increase organization productivity and boost the staff moral</li> <li>It reduce supervision cost</li> <li>It reduce the rate of accident human factor i.e. machine accident</li> <li>It enhances employee performance</li> <li>It brings about long term survival and attainment of organizational goals</li> </ol> <p><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Manpower training and development is a very broad topic, its one that has new concept introduced from time to time. This is because employees now appreciate the value of training and developing the skills and improving their performance.</p> <p>However, for the purpose of clarity and accuracy this research work is confirmed to Nigeria breweries Kaduna plant. Also the study will be limited to how training and programe is carried out and effect it on organizational productivity.</p> <p><strong>LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Training and development programe is a very wide which require enough time to research, but because f time constraint the researcher could not go into detail as the case may be. The programme suppose to be organized in line with organization policy so it capital intensive. Also some supervision attitude does not encourage the researcher, which poses a challenge to the researcher</p> <p><strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Nigeria Breweries Plc was incorporated in 1946, is the pioneer and largest brewing company in Nigeria, its first bottling of beer STAR large –rolled off the bottling lines of its Lagos Brewery in June 1945, other breweries were subsequently commissioned by the company inducing Aba breweries 1957, Kaduna 1963 and Ibadan in September 1993 and lastly Enugu breweries October 2003.</p> <p>The company started as a Joint Venture between the United African Company (WAC) International, UK and Heineken of Holland, thus at inception, its was 100 percent foreign owned. by early 1950, when it began operating fully, some indigenous trades already involved with its product, were muited to become shareholders. Under indigenization policy of the early 1970s the foreign shareholders were forced to see a significant position of their holding today. The company is 60 percent Nigerian owned and 40 percent foreign owned, the 60 percent Nigerian stakes is held by company employees and members of the public while the 40 percent foreign ownership is spilt almost equally between (WA Holding Limited (for unilever) and Heineken brewerizen Bv</p> <p>The foreign partners now perform the role of technical adviser. With Unilever advisory on commercial aspect such as accounting, purchasing, marketing and personal, while Heineken does the same for technology. Organizationally, the company has four division, technical, finance, marketing and personnel, each of which is headed by an executive director.</p> <p>The brewing industry is one of the latest growing branches of Nigerian manufacturing. It provide for direct employment for over 30,000 persons the indirect employment associated with the industry is close to 300,000 including the firms producing ancillary services. Critical skills are generally acquired through paper qualification or on-the-job training. At the management level, a minimum tertiary qualification of first degree is required. After employment the individual undergoes structured training for about 18 months before being formally recognized as qualified to work in the system. Non technical graduate undergo a management training programme of 18 months to acquire specific management skills relevant to their vocation. The only exception to this programme is for mid-career recruitment where unexpected gaps in the management structure are bridged with suitably qualified expert from outside the system. This does not apply in technical division because of its peculiarities assistance to bridge gaps in the management cadre is always available from the technical partners.</p> <p>Specific skills training is organized on an in-house basis with suitably qualified trainers in all divisions. Out side resources, both local and international, are other use to supplement the in-house capability. Under the staff development programme, personnel are given opportunity to realized their potentials, their strength and weakness are assessed early in their careers and a career path is suggested which would offer challenging opportunities and rewarding work. Thus, employee goes on training, locally and internationally yet a specific assignment and is pointed to jobs to grow into the future. All these factors are articulated into well-laid career and successor plans so that staff members are adequately motivated and identify closely with the business.</p> <p>Remuneration policy is built on a merit-based appraisal system unrelated to age or experience working condition compare with other manufacturing concerns, locally and globally. Element of the working condition include.</p> <p>a.    A good softy record</p> <p>b.    Fairly generous housing allowances</p> <p>c.    Almost free lunch for all levels of management</p> <p>d.    Free Company medical care</p> <p>e.    Free cartons of company products to all categories of workers monthly</p> <p>All these help to build up career path. The average turn over is about 6-7 percent which is not regarded as a problem</p> <p><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Training:</strong> It is any procedure initiated by an organization or its employees which is intended to fasten and enhance learning among organizational members</p> <p><strong>Development:</strong> It is the conscious attempt to improve managerial performance effectiveness through impacting knowledge for the purpose of organizational goal attainment.</p> <p><strong>Manpower:</strong> It is the total workforce of an organization</p> <p><strong>Performance appraisal:</strong> Is the assessment of an organization employee after the have been trained in order to se if they put into practice the knowledge the have acquired through training.</p> <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Is the setting of objectives to achieve corporate goal i.e. the strategies set in advance to achieve goal.</p> <p><strong>Organization:</strong> Is the grouping of activities so that the enterprises objective can be attained.

While business leaders see the need for appraisal systems, they are frequently disappointed in them. One of the responsibilities of management is to ensure that an organization functions effectively and efficiently. In order to achieve these goals, managers must be able to determine and assess performance levels of both an organization and its individual employees (Kurt 2004).</p> <p>Modern businesses depend upon measurement and analysis of performance. Measurements must derive from the company’s strategy and provide critical data and information about key processes, outputs and results. Data and analysis support a variety of company purposes, such as planning, reviewing company performance, improving operations, and comparing company performance with competitors’ or with ‘best practices’ benchmarks (Averson, 1998).</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>Performance appraisal provides a good opportunity to formally recognize employees’ achievements and contributions to the organization, and to ensure that a clear link is established and maintained between performance and reward. Employees of First Bank Plc in recent times have been accused of high level of inefficiencies in the discharge of their duties by the general public. However, it was recently that research had revealed the deplorable working conditions under which financial professionals’ work. Poor infrastructure, inadequate logistics and equipment, poor remuneration and inadequate reward system have always led to the low level of public confidence and respect in the financial institutions.</p> <p>The situation had further resulted in ripple effects of poor performance, low morale and lack of discipline in the service vis-a-vis the theories on performance appraisal. Given the challenges earlier enumerated to be facing employees in First Bank Plc, particularly employees of Uyo Branch in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>An effective performance appraisal programme would assist an organization to achieve its goals and goals. It would lead to enhanced communication, employees professional development, improved employee morale and help identify training needs of the employees. A well-developed staff are more likely to be proactive, productive and resourceful, all of which help give the organization a competitive edge from improved customer relations to increased profits.</p> <ol><li>The <strong>main objective</strong> of the study was to assess the effectiveness of the Performance Appraisal (SPA) system in First Bank Plc at Uyo Branch.</li> </ol> <p>​<strong>Specific goals </strong>for the study were to find out:</p> <ol><li>To measure employees’ understanding of the goals of the appraisal system, its processes and procedures at First bank.</li> <li>To find out whether the appraisal system at First bank is achieving the goals.</li> <li>To measure employees perception of the appraisal system at First bank.</li> <li>To find out how the performance appraisal system has been able to identify employees’ strengths and weaknesses and programmes put in place to address weaknesses and reward performance.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5 Research questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions formed the basis upon which the study was conducted:</p> <ol><li>What is the level of employees’ understanding of the goals of the appraisal system, its processes and procedures at First bank?</li> <li>How is the appraisal system at First bank achieving the goals?</li> <li>What is the perception of employees of the appraisal system at First bank?</li> <li>Is the performance appraisal system able to identify employees’ strengths and weaknesses?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.6 Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>This study would bring to light employees understanding and appreciation of the performance appraisal system and the relevance of an goal, systematic and effective performance appraisal. Also, it would contribute to knowledge and literature because it would focus on how performance appraisal can be more effective which would enable management to develop a broader understanding of human resource management process. Further, it would provide information for human resource practitioners on how rules and regulations regarding performance appraisal work in banks and develop the necessary programmes to address weaknesses and reward performance.</p> <p><strong>1.9 Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>The researcher finds that the time span within which to complete this work may not be enough to allow for a comprehensive study of the research area. Again the study was constrained because of the researcher’s inability to access some information he considers important for the study.</p> <p><strong>1.10 Organization of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study is divided into five (5) chapters. Chapter one embodies the general introduction to the study, the goal of the study, specific goals, statement of the problem, research questions, scope, organization of the study and the significance of the study. In chapter two, the works of some authors pertaining to the concept of appraisal are reviewed, bearing in mind the goal of the study. Chapter three provides information on the methodology for the study. It looks at the study design, the study population, and the sampling techniques used. It also provides information on the data collection methodology and analysis procedures.</p> <p>The fourth chapter reports on the findings obtained from the field study. It describes the background of the respondents, the issues relating to effectiveness of performance appraisal, the identifiable constraints that affected the appraisal system in the service and how to solve them. The concluding fifth chapter summarizes the salient trends and ends with suggestions and recommendations necessary for the attainment of an effective</p>\n\nIMPACT OF EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL ON

class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The effectiveness in realization of an organization’s set goals and objectives is within the framework in which it was set up.  Human and material resources in every organization should not be over-emphasized, and therefore, must be harnessed and oriented for the achievement of the set goals and objectives.  It is true that material resources form an integral part of the desired goal but human resource is more important in the sense that they help in achieving organizational goals and objectives in an effective and efficient manner, this need arises as a results of the need for the improvement in job performance.  And this method depends on the type in which the organization adopts to achieve her goals.</p> <p>The success of an organization is determined by the quality of its labour force, since the labour determines the output of the organization by the labour-inputs.  Human resources can be improved through a graded and systematic process of development that includes education, training and the appropriate motivation.</p> <p><strong>Training:</strong>  This can be described as a short-term systematic process through which an employee acquires technical knowledge, skill and attitude required to perform a specific task or job adequately.  Worker must be trained and developed in order to get the best from them and this also, has to be a continuous bases and in various fields.</p> <p>Ubeku emphasized the importance of training in the organization in the following words: “money spent on training and development of employee in an organization is money well invested.  Employees who have received adequate training before being assigned with responsibilities have the necessary confidence with which to carry out the job”.</p> <p>At the 14th Annual General Meeting of the Nigeria Employers Consultative Association in December, 1970, Chief Anthony Enahoro the then Federal Commissioner for Labour, commenting on the role of employers in training their employees asserted that: “the development of human resources cannot be entirely the concern of our nation’s educational institutions, it is also the responsibility of other institutions capable of performing training functions.</p> <p>Every enterprise, whether public or private, necessarily does considerable on-the-job, some of which is organized and some haphazard and incidental.  If employers display greater readiness than many of them do to invest in training, we can hope more rapidly to supplement the work of educational and other training institutions”.</p> <p>An employee should be helped to grow into more responsibilities by systematic training and development.  It is only through this process that an employee feels confidence to carry out the responsibilities of the job because he knows already what is expected of him.  Training of employees can help to improve the performance of the organization thereby improving the overall performance of the organization.  It is in view of this, that the study wants to look at the impart of training on the performance of workers in the organization by using some selected federal establishment in Benin City as a case study.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>One of the problems of the most modern organizations is that favourable fluctuation in the performance of workers and this can be attributed to the dynamics of organization due to new knowledge and technology.</p> <p>In any organization, training needs shows itself in various ways, new employees must be instructed in their duties, poor selection may necessitate specialized training efforts; individual employees who cannot perform certain aspects of their task must be made equal to those tasks; completed change of work methods as a result of change in technology, all these can necessitate the need for training.</p> <p>Employers cannot avoid cost, without proper training errors and misunderstanding arise.  And stealing trained employees from competitors is a costly practice, which can work both ways.</p> <p>Training can affect the performance of the workers; this is because training entails the acquisition of new skills, with the new skill acquire in the course of training, workers will be able to adapt themselves to the dynamics of the organization.</p> <p>In view of this, the study wants to look at the impact of training on workers’ performance by using some selected federal establishments in Benin City as a case study.</p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study hopes to achieve the following objectives:</p> <ul><li>To look at the impact of training on workers’ performance in organization.</li> <li>To look at the various strategies of training in organizations.</li> <li>To identify the various ways of evaluating programmes in organizations.</li> <li>To find out the problems associated with the training of workers in organizations and suggest solutions to such problems by way of recommendations.</li> <li>To enhance people’s knowledge on training as an important phenomenon in the management of human resource in organizations.</li> </ul> <p><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is limited to the Federal establishments in Benin City.  Among the federal establishments include in this study are the Nigeria Telecommunications, Nigeria Prison Service, Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) and the Federal Road Safety Corps.  In the course of this study, questionnaires shall be distributed to various categories of workers in all the organizations included in the study.  Also to be dealt with in this study are issues like the impact of training on workers’ performance, workers’ satisfaction with the training programme of the organization; the problem associated with training programmes and the ways of evaluating the success of organizational training programme.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is significant because it emphasizes the impact of training on workers’ programme.  Management and workers achievers alike can appreciate the need for training and development in the organization.  Thus, the findings and recommendations of this study can be exploited in the organization under study in improving the quality of training programmes in their organizations.  Improvement in the quality of training programmes can enhance the impact of training on workers’ performance.</p> <p>The postulation and generalization of this study can lead other researcher’s interest on the impact of training workers’ performance.  The interest generated by the postulation and generalization of this study, can lead to more researchers on training which can help them to improve the quality of literature on training as an important area of human resources management in modern day organization.</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>The following hypotheses shall direct the thrust of this study:</p> <ul><li>A satisfactory training programme will improve the performance of the workers.</li> <li>Training geared towards workers’ job, will improve their performance.</li> <li>Workers perceptions of the criteria of selecting people for training will affect their performance.</li> <li>Management’s attitude towards workers’ training will affect success of training in the organization.</li> </ul> <p><strong>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In the course of the study, the researcher encountered a lot of problems.  The problem encountered in the course of this study was time.  This resulted from the nature of the semester, being short and full of academic and social activities, it was not an easy task combining classroom activities with going to field to collect materials for the research.</p> <p>Secondly, the attitude of the respondents towards the researcher was also a problem.  Many of the respondents were unwilling to cooperate with the researcher.  This can be seen from the fact that 18% of the respondents did not return the questionnaires distributed to them and this further reduced the sample of workers included in the study.</p> <p>Finally, getting the material for the research was also a problem because it was not an easy task getting materials for the research.  Thus, the researcher spent a lot of money going from one library to another collecting materials for the research, and this further worsen the limited financial state of the research as a student.</p> <p><strong>OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>This is done for clearer understanding of this project, some of the key terms used are

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>            The management of information technology plays a crucial role, especially in the communication and information sectors such as government establishments, where they build their competitive advantage on credibility and information.</p> <p>            Every aspect of management in the modern age relies heavily on information to thrive. Nothing moves without information and it is generally believed that information is power and that he who has it has power. It has even been described as a singular resource needed to develop other resources, including workers in an organization. That is why <strong>Odger and Keeling (2000)</strong> deduced that one way businesses meet information needs is to use Management Information System (MIS).            One approach by which organization can utilize company’s capability is through the development of Management Information System (MIS). There is no universally accepted definition of Management Information System (MIS) and those that exist reflect the emphasis and perhaps prejudice of their authors.</p> <p>            However, the term “Management Information System” (MIS) can be seen as a database management system tailored to the needs of managers or decision makers in an organization. MIS is a system using formalized procedures to provide management at all levels in all functions with appropriate information based on data from both internal and external sources, to enable them to make timely and effective decisions for planning, directing and controlling the activities for which they are responsible <strong>Argyris (1991).</strong> It should be noted from the above definition that the emphasis is on the uses to which the information is put. Planning, directing and controlling are the essential ingredients for “Management”. In essence, the processing of data, information, and communicating the resulting information directly to the user, is the key function of MIS. It should, therefore, be noted that MIS exists in organizations in order to help them achieve objective to plan and control their processes and operations, to help deal with the uncertainties, and to help in adopting changing or indeed initiating change.</p> <p>            Essentially, therefore, information has become a critical resource, just like energy, both of which are vital to the wellbeing of individuals and organizations in the modern world. Like energy and politics, technology is changing the ways in which information is captured, processed, stored, disseminated and used augured by <strong>Charles</strong> (2002).</p> <p>            Management Information System (MIS) is generally thought of as an integrated, user-machine system providing information to support operations, management and decision-making function in an organization <strong>Abdullahi (2004).</strong> As a matter of fact, MIS is a special purpose system useful for management in an organization. MIS is an accessible and rapid conveyor belt for appropriate high quality information from the generation to its users.</p> <p>            The heart of an effective MIS, therefore, is a carefully conceived, designed and executed database. Its level corresponds to adaptive decisions. As a result, Management Information System (MIS) enhances the administrative process and the operations and decision-making powers of an organization. This explains why standard and digitalized information processing devices such as the computer, word processing and inter-net are highly welcome by organizations across the world.</p> <p><strong>            Kotler (2006</strong>) in a simpler manner defines Management Information System (MIS) “as a planned system of the collecting, processing, storing and dissemination of data in the form of information needed to carry out the functions of management. In a way it is a documented report of the activities that were planned and executed”. In other words, Management Information System (MIS) is an integrated user machine system for providing information to support the operation of management analysis and decision making function, which utilizes computer hardware’s and software’s as well as manual application for its procedures.</p> <p>            Despite the utilization of Management Information System (MIS) in its various forms there still seems to be some problems that infringe on the effectiveness of decision-making by managers and the productivity of employees in an organization. This includes issues bordering on monitoring the system perhaps as a result of limited numbers of departmental managers and supervisors or their exit and also non-qualitative factors like morale of workers, attitudes of workers to work as well as the lack of flexibility of Management Information System (MIS) to update itself, thus calling for an investigation to provide needed balance <strong>Akinola (2003). </strong>Management Information System (MIS) seeks to know the motive for work and to find ways by which their realization can be helped and encouraged. This service has a dynamic aspect of management <strong>Saogy (1989).</strong></p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>            Management Information System (MIS) helps management in effective planning, organizing and controlling its workforce to achieve desired results. It therefore, means that the ineffective utilization of Management Information System (MIS) can result in low and poor quality production by workers. Also implies that Management Information System (MIS) is a necessity for successful management which could adversely affect the productivity of workers if not properly managed.</p> <p>            Designing and implementing an effective information system for human resource management becomes a challenge to most government organizations and ministries.

The operational approach deals with what personnel officers naturally do. The major functions of personnel management deal with the general administration perform by personnel officers such as staffing, training programs, salary, administration, motivation of workers, integration of the worker force and separation matters.</p> <p>          Personnel management is also responsible for handling staff matters such as recruitment, selection and placement of employees in their various places of work in organisation, compensation, fringe benefit, integration of workers or brings together the interest of the worker with that of the organisation objectives, so that worker don’t pursue their personal goals, motivation or understanding the needs of the workers which brings better integration and separation of workers through retirement, termination, dismissal of appointment and death.</p> <p>          It is much easier to describe what personnel officer do than it is to define difference between an effective and an ineffective one.  The personnel officers often conduct his operating function without yardstick of excellence and merely rate himself/herself against certain checklists of activities which are carried on my many personnel officers have been excessively concerned in recent years with activity and some what less about input. The system of management by (MBO) proposes that the first step in managing would be a clear definition of output expected. This would then followed by taking count of limited resource available to achieve the objective and then the conduct and control of activities.  Because of the importance to personnel management in an organisation especially the teachers have choose this topic with a case study of Akwa ibom State Civil Service Commission and also that their various instruments of data collection will be explored and these includes, the questionnaire, interview and documentary method.</p> <p><strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE AKWA IBOM STATE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION</strong></p> <p>          The present Akwa ibom State Civil Service Commission came into being since the creation of Akwa ibom State in 1976 after the abolition of North Central State by the Murtala Regime.</p> <p>          The Civil Service Commission has a constitutional right of existence as provided for in section 197 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria of 1999, and the appointment of the chairman and members, except in the case of ex-officio members or where other provisions are made in this constitution, the chairman of this constitution, be appointed by the Governor of the State, and the appointment shall be subjected to confirmation by resolution of the House of Assembly of the State.</p> <p>          The membership of the civil service commission are appointed from suitable qualified citizens, whose wealth of management, and proven integrity are not in doubt, particularly from the retired senior public servants.</p> <p>          They (members) shall hold office for a tenure of 5 years and shall not be dissolved until found wanting by 2/3 of the members of the State House of Assembly or until the tenure expires.</p> <p><strong>POWERS, FUNCTIONS AND RESPONSIBIITIES OF THE COMMISSION</strong></p> <p>          The Akwa ibom State Civil Service Commission is vested with among others, the powers of appointment of all persons into the State Civil Service, confirmation of appointment, discipline, promotion, retirement, withdrawal of service, advancement, transfer of service, acceptance or otherwise of resignation of appointment as established by the provision of the Federal Republic of Nigeria constitution 1999.  In exercising these powers, the commission is guided by the provision of the scheme of service, civil service rules, civil service regulations, establishment circulars and any other rules and regulations that might be enforced from time to time.</p><p> <strong>Delegation Of Powers</strong> </p> <p>          In pursuance of these duties, the civil service commission delegates the power of control and discipline, regarding and upgrading, confirmation of appointment of officers either on temporary, permanent or acting basis on GL 01 to 06 permanent Secretary and heads of departments. The exercise of these powers is subject to the approval of civil service commission. The delegation could be withdrawn if the commission observes that the powers have been abused.</p> <p><strong>Department of the Civil Service Commission</strong></p> <p>          The commission has three (3) departments, these are, administrative and finance department, planning research and statistic department and recruitment and training department.</p> <p>          The commission is consisting of a chairman, commissioner, in which they have commissioner I, II, III and commissioner IV. The commission also have the permanent secretary and all the department have directors and some others schedule officers in the commission. We have executive officers, accountants etc, civil service commission is a purely advisory body and it has no authority to enforce its recommendation which considering the work of the commission, it is important to appreciate the distinction between the commission and the staff of the commission which consist of a number of public servants who prepare papers for the consideration of the commission and subsequently take executive action on those matters.  The staff the commission prepares briefs on the numerous subjects, which are referred to the commission. These are submitted to the commission by the Secretary.   The commission then considers the briefs at one of its meetings and makes its recommendations to the governor.   His decisions on the recommendation are conveyed to the commission and the Secretary arranges executive action on these.</p> <p>          The commission is requested to advice on the confirmation of the appointment of all officers in the executive and technical grades and in the professional and administrative grades who are on the permanent establishment.  In the case of officers in the clerical and manipulative grades, it advice is sought only if confirmation is not recommended</p> <p>          Discipline:  The advice of the commission is sought in the case of all except minor discipline matters. These case range from loss of stores and money to absence without leave and conviction for a variety of offences.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>           It is the responsibility of the personnel department to recruit, select and place staff in the various sections in line with the general personnel policy of the organization.</p> <p>          It is apparent that recruitment officers in Akwa ibom State Civil Service were not able to recruit employees due to embargo placed on employment into government organisation with that circular, they do not seem to determine and locate its personnel requirement and are not given first hand to effectively recruit, select and place employee from identifiable sources for efficient performance in order to attain the set objectives.</p> <p>          The research desire is to find the methods and processes that recruitment, selection and placement could be personnel policy.  This study is addressing the following problem question</p> <p>(1)     Does civil service commission occasionally have vacancies to be filled?</p> <p>(2)     What are the methods of filling these vacancies?</p> <p>(3)     What are the sources of personnel for filling these vacancies?</p> <p>(4)     Does civil service commission fill the vacancies available quotably within the local government in the state?</p> <p>(5)     Does civil service recruit, select and place employees to fill these vacancies?</p> <p>(6)     Has it clearly defined recruitment policy?</p> <p>(7)     Does it conduct the preliminary interview?</p> <p>(8)     Does it shortlist applicants for interview?</p> <p>(9)     Doe sit conduct employment interview?</p> <p>(10)   Is recruitment, selection, and placement in civil service mostly by internal advertisement?</p> <p>(11)   Does the staff responsible for recruitment, selection and placement have enough knowledge of selection process?</p> <p>(12)   Is there enough trained personnel in the CSC engaged in the recruitment, selection and placement process?</p> <p>(13)   Does proper recruitment, selection and placement enhance productivity?</p> <p><strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The research work is aimed at examining critically the procedure or policies that might exist during the course of exercising the recruitment, selection and placement exercise in Akwa ibom State Civil Service Commission and also to enable know the system they are operating on:</p> <p>(1)     To identify the problems concerning recruitment, selection and placement in Akwa ibom State.</p> <p>(2)     To explain recruitment, selection and placement according to finding from civil service commission, Akwa ibom.</p> <p>(3)     To distinguish between recruitment, selection and placement.</p> <p>(4)     To discover whether civil service commission Akwa ibom is making use of quota system or fair representation among their local government in state civil service.</p> <p><strong>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The major significance of this research is that it will serve as an addition to advance the research on recruitment, selection and placement in various states, civil service, parastatals etc.  It will also serve as a foundation for further research by students and other researchers.</p> <p><strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          This study is limited to Akwa ibom State Civil Service Commission and especially the personnel management and its responsibility in recruitment, selection and placement of employees and to see its effectiveness and efficiencies.</p> <p>          It is the scope of the research to find out how recruitment, selection and placement standard are, and between 1997 to 1999.</p> <p><strong>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The research while collecting the data for this research work, the researcher encountered so many problems some of them are:</p> <p>(1)     The management of Akwa ibom State Civil Service was not willing to give us data on some of their activities and especially of their annual reports.</p> <p>(2)     The researcher also faced a problem compiling the data on the historical background of the case study (Akwa ibom State Civil Service).</p> <p>(3)     The researcher has to use his case study office at Akwa ibom because some of the information needed could not be found.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>          To achieve the purpose of this study, the researcher have to

Study</strong></p> <p>In all economic activities human effort is the key. It is the human knowledge transferred into activity that give utilizes or value to all commodities. And that means who cultivates and whether he uses a hoe or tractor. It is the same who saws, weeds, processes, store and sells. It is also man who extracts iron ore, processes it into steel.</p> <p>It postulates that who invents, designs, makes and operates machines is man who creates, transmits and seeks knowledge etc. thus, every human endeavour here one earth has man’s finger print. Thus without human effort which is considered vital for production so many managerial effort would been proved abortive. This effort also is usually called labour.</p> <p>Labour is the most important resources in organization. This is why labour is define as human effort both mental and physical assertion legitimately applied in production of goods and services so as to satisfy human needs for a reward known as wages and salaries.</p> <p>In this sense, labour include all labour, semi skilled labour and unskilled which all gear towards the production of goods and services to earn a living through their wages and salaries.</p> <p><strong>1.2. Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The problem of labour turnover attract a reasonable percentage of attention in an organization because labour represent the life wire of any organization. The rate at which employee have organization is alarming, the types and number of works who are terminated or resigning their various jobs show how effective and efficient is the management in its operation which also determined the level of stability, growth and development of the organization. Although, in some organizations, there, is extent to which mobility of workers is considered acceptable.</p> <p><strong>1.3. Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>Purposively, this project is to be educate whoever is concerned in its significance of the study on the following objectives:</p> <ol><li>To examine the effects of labour turnover on the performance of Kaduna State Water Board.</li> <li>To enumerate the problems of labour turnover and how it can be minimized in Kaduna State Water Board.</li> <li>To examine the major causes of labour turnover in an organization using Kaduna State Water Board as a case study.</li> </ol> <p>1.4. <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study would be of significance to the Kaduna State Water Board in identifying the problems and causes of labour turnover. This study is expected to provide solution the research work is of benefit to the body of knowledge students and other researchers. Other organizations that have similar problems can also benefit from the research work.</p> <p><strong>1.5. Research Questions</strong></p> <p>What are the effects of labour turnover on the performance of Kaduna State Water Board?</p> <p>What are the problems of labour turnover and how can it be minimized in Kaduna State Water Board?</p> <p>What are the major causes of labour turnover in Kaduna State Water Board?</p> <p><strong>1.6. Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The extent of this research covers all concept, the causes, problems, effects and the measures to be taken to tackle the problem of labour turnover that deserves to be minimized. This study will be restricted to the effects of labour turnover on organizational performance in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>This research is not lastly due to some proposition for any organization. He classified cost of turnover into direct and indirect cost.</p> <p><strong><em>Direct Cost</em></strong></p> <p>This is the cost that associated with the costs of replacing the employees and training the newly hired such as costs of communicating the vacant position cost of administering the recruitment function, cost of screening the applicant interviewing the candidates, administering selection tools tests, meeting hr candidate, concluding background investigation, cost of preparing new employee training materials, conducting training session, giving on the job training and the costs of separating former employee from the firm such as administering paper work/meeting, conducting exit interview paying several pay/packaged, vacation time etc.</p> <p><strong><em>Indirect Cost</em></strong></p> <p>Turnover also brings with indirect cost especially when the employees who are leaving were liked by the organizations client, customer loyally may be affected. Again, as the new employees learn their jobs, the quality of the product and service may suffer.</p> <p>Michael Armstrong, human resources practice page 381 enumerated the following as cost of labour turnover, leaving cost, direct cost of replacement opportunity cost of time spent, direct cost of introducing replacement, loss of input.</p>\n\nEFFECT OF LABOUR TURNOVER ON ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF LABOUR TURNOVER ON ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE", "id": 27}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>   </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Teamwork is as old as mankind, and as such many organizations use the term ‘team’ in either one sense or the other i.e such as in the production, marketing processes, etc. Examples are management team, production team or an entire organization can be referred as a team.</p> <p>Cook (1998) claimed that there is a growing consensus among scholars in the world that organizations may be getting works done through individuals, but his super achievement lies in the attainment of set goals through teams (teamwork). It is a well known fact that teamwork is not only the foundation of all successful managements, but the means of improving overall results in organizational productivity.</p> <p>Wage (1997) described Teamwork as an idea of working together in a group to achieve the same goals and objectives for the good of the service users and organizations in order to deliver a good quality of service (productivity). Ruth (2007) claimed that employees teamwork is seen as constituting a larger group of people than what job position describes, the essence of teamwork is that workload is reduced and broken into pieces of work for everyone to take part. Alan (2003) defined teamwork as a grouping of professionals whose members work intensely on a specific, common goal using their positive synergy, individual and mutual accountability, and complementary skills. Employees take baby steps toward accomplishing key action items and nothing important is finished. Team work is the ability to work together towards a common vision. It is a fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results. Collective action is widely recognized as a positive force for teamwork in any organization or institution to succeed. Teams enable individuals to empower themselves and to increase benefits from cooperative work engaged on as a group. Getting together with others also can allow individuals to better understand the importance of teamwork and how the organizations operate as well as promote the culture of teamwork success.</p> <p>Davis (2007) claimed that employers always stress the need for employing those (Employees) that can be able to work with a team. And they (Employers) generally talk of teamwork when they want to emphasize the need to various talents possessed by different employees. The organizations however, coordinate the employees into different teams, such as management team, production team, etc. This is purposely to tap from the abilities of respective human resources employed by an organization.</p> <p>Organization according Caroline (2008) is a social entity that is goal directed, deliberately structured activity systems with a preamble boundary.</p> <p>Alan (2008) claimed that productivity is the rate at which an employer, company or country produces goods, and the amount, produced, compared with how much time, work and money is needed to produce them.</p> <p>This therefore, shows that, this study will concentrate specifically on the use of the term ‘teamwork’ which involves reshaping the way work is carried out. This includes organizing employees into teams based on a distinct product, each team performing a particular task. These teams are given a high degree of responsibility and are expected to work with flexibility.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Every organization, either large or small, struggles to acquire productivity so as to achieve success and maintain a valuable image in this present world of organizational competitions. And it is the wish of organizations to see the input they use (resources) and the output (goods and services produced) they have at the end.</p> <p>The population of workers in an organization may be very large and yet that organization achieving a very low productivity and with no improvement in their products. Could this occur as a result of absence of teamwork in such organizations. And if it is, then, there are other organizations that have teams and yet achieve little or no productivity at all. It may be as a result of the following problems:</p> <ol><li><em>Lack of Teamwork in the Organization: </em>That is the failure of an organization to coordinate works into work groups in order to tap from the respective human resources the organization possesses.</li> <li><em>Poor Leadership Styles in the Organization:</em> It may be as a result of the leadership style of the organization possibly not favorable to teamwork.</li> <li><em>Poor Leadership of the Work Teams:</em> Different work teams may exist, but lacking the persons with the team leading acumen to lead them.</li> <li><em>Lack of Motivation of the Workforce:</em> The way in which organizations reward their workforce may also lead to low organizational productivity even when their staff work in teams.</li> <li><em>Prevailing Conditions that hinder growth in an Organization: </em>The conditions permanently occurring in an organization (lack of picking-up of innovative ideas) like the absence of designing motivational programs, educational growth, bonuses, job rotation and the use of old technologies, etc,  may be the cause of low organizational productivity.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The general objective of this study is to investigate the contributions of teamwork on organizational productivity. The specific objectives of this study are as listed below:</p> <ol><li>To find out the effect of teamwork on  organizational productivity.</li> <li>To investigate the ways leadership styles used by the organizations affect organizational productivity.</li> <li>To find out the effect of poor leadership on work teams leadership.</li> <li>To investigate the benefits of motivation to the workforce.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>For the purpose of this research, the following research questions were formulated to guide this study:</p> <ol><li>In what ways does teamwork affect on organizational productivity?</li> <li>In what ways does leadership style of an organization affect teamwork?</li> <li>In what ways does team’s poor leadership style affect their output?</li> <li>What are the benefits of motivation on organizational productivity?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is very much important to maintain the healthy advantages of productivity as a result of its importance to organizations.

There is a widespread belief that productivity improvements can only be achieved through a fundamental reform in the area of employee relations. Changes are thought to be necessary both in the organization and structure of work and in the way in which employees are trained, remunerated and motivated. Moreover, it is argued that these changes cannot be separated from the need to overhaul our system of interest representation and dispute resolution. The activities of trade unions and the operations of arbitration tribunals are often viewed as impediments to management efforts to lift the competitive performance of their organizations. The purpose of this study is to evaluate these arguments, identify ways employee relations affect productivity, and how to improve productivity in organizations. Findings from this study revealed that employee relations practices affect productivity through employee morale, quality and quantity of output/product. Other findings include various challenges that employees face at workplace and various ways to enhance healthy relationship between employees and their employers in an organization. The most valuable recommendation given is to treat employees with great care.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER</strong> <strong>ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Maintaining healthy employee relations in an organization is a pre-requisite for organizational success. Strong employee relations are required for high productivity and human satisfaction. Employee relations generally deal with avoiding and resolving issues concerning individuals which might arise out of or influence the work scenario. Strong employee relation depends upon healthy and safe work environment, cent percent involvement and commitment of all employees, incentives for employee motivation, and effective e communication system in the organization. Healthy employee relations lead to more efficient, motivated and productive employees which further lead to increase in production level. Over 40 percent of the companies listed in the top 100 of Fortune magazine’s “America’s Best Companies to Work For” also appear on the Fortune 500. While it is possible that employees enjoy working at these organizations because they are successful, the Watson Wyatt WorldwideHuman Capital Index study suggests that effective human resources practices lead to positive financial outcomes more often than positive financial outcomes lead to good practices.</p> <p>In recent times, while most workers are on job, they do not produce more simply because of the un-healthy relationship they have with their fellow colleagues and employers. A recent study conducted by Blyton (2008) revealed that employees do not put up their best performances at workplaces when they are un-happy with management, government, or even their fellow colleagues. Bad employee-employer relationship results in strike actions and lockouts. All these actions taken by employees to display their grievances only do the organization harm than good as productivity will be reduced drastically.</p> <p>By many accounts, employee relations today are in crisis. In academia, its traditional positions are threatened on one side by the dominance of mainstream economics and organizational behaviour, and on the other by postmodernism. In policy-making circles, the industrial relations emphasis on institutional intervention is trumped by a neo-liberal emphasis on the laissez faire promotion of free markets.</p> <p><strong>1.2 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study is to examine employee relations and its effect on employee productivity. Specific objectives of the study are:</p> <ol><li>To identify various employee relations practices, and its effect on the productivity of an organization.</li> <li>To identify the challenges faced by employees at work places.</li> <li>To identify ways of enhancing healthy relationship between employees and employers in an organization.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.3 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study seeks to bring out the various employee relations practices in an organization and the various practices needed to increase its productivity and contribute its quota in the economic development of the communities which it operates, and the country at large. This study will therefore help enlighten management of various organizations of the various effects of relationship practices between employers and employees in an organization. The study will also bring out specifically, the employee relations practices which various organizations use.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SCOPE AND ORGANISATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of the research will be limited to the employee relations practices and effects on employee productivity.

There is the need for managers to understand and accommodate various people that work in one organization for the purpose of increasing productivity and for them to induce personnel to do their job, the manager’s needs to understand different behaviours that workers exhibit in an organization.</p> <p>The motivation of administration personnel of local education Authority, Dutsin – ma is not an exception as their performance behaviour is akin ti that up others organization in Nigeria.</p> <p>It is this premises that we intend to take a look at the situation with a view if finding solution to them, or at least reduce the incidence of low productivity. It is also my hope that at the end of this exercise, the picture would be clearer in the area of motivation and increased productivity in the organization.</p> <p>An organization is composed of people who interact at different levels toward achieving a certain goal. Management therefore creates and maintain an environment which individual work together in-group towards the accomplishment of the set objectives Fadeyi (1976).</p> <p>The success of an organization is contingent on the performance or effective ness of workers in that organization. The management in that organization. The management has the responsibility to study how best to induce or motivate the employees to put in their best. This could be done through the management study, the organization adopts to increase productivity.</p> <p>The management also ensures that the rate of staff turnover is highly reduced to the best barest minimum. This study revolves around the techniques of motivation employed by the management of Local Education Authority Dustin – ma and whether the techniques when properly planned and applied could increase productivity of such organization. Any organization that does not recognize the importance of motivation could hardly increase productivity and retain staff for quite long.</p> <p>It is determination of this work of researcher to examine the various component of motivation, which are essential to establishing and sustaining productivity through effective performance, as workers are most valuable assets in an organization that is service oriented. The local government is the third tier of government after the federal government and the 36 state governments. The local government was actually very active during the democratic dispensation but was actually conceived and marginally practiced during the military era. The main concern before the establishment of local governments was the inability of the federal and state governments to carry development to the rural areas. Local governments are the government that is closest to rural dwellers and the majority of Nigeria as the populace can see and be able to interact with their leaders. The local government administration is constitutionally headed by the local government chairman who is constitutionally mandated to stay 2 years in office and then either seek re-election or leave office. The local government is majorly financed by the state governments. The primary aim of the creation of local councils was for interaction with the local masses.</p> <p> Local government constitutes the most essential level of government at which the momentum to sustain national development can be created. To some countries in the third world, it is the only semblance of authority known beyond the tradition. (Bello 2007:1)</p> <p>1.2. <strong>Statement of the general problem</strong></p> <p>The concept of staff motivation at all levels in Nigeria has overtime been misconstrued. Companies, organizations and establishments pay little or no attention to the motivation of their staff in relation to their productivity level and still these organizations expect nothing short of top performance in terms of productivity</p> <p><strong>1.3. Objectives of the study</strong></p> <p>The following are the aims and objectives of the study</p> <ul><li>To examine the effect of lack of staff motivation in local governments in Nigeria.</li> <li>To know if there is a relationship between staff motivation and productivity of staff in organizations. </li> <li>To investigate the extent to which the local government authorities has neglected staff motivation.<br/> </li> <li>To find out the motivational differences that exists among the various levels of management.</li> <li>The research will offer useful suggestions on how to improve the work situation in an organization.</li> </ul> <ul><li>To Make conclusions and provide adequate recommendations</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.4. Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>This study is essentially significant in that it is directed towards evaluating the effect of lack of motivation on the productivity levels of staff or employees. It also significant in that if focuses on the actual reason for lack of staff motivation in the local governmentlevel and it effect on the nation’s economic landscape.</p> <p><strong>1.5. Scope of the study</strong></p> <p>This study is centered on staff motivation and productivity at the local government level using ovia-south west local government area delta state as a case study.</p> <p><strong>1.6. Limitations of the study</strong></p> <p>It is important to define the scope and limitation of this research work with respect to coverage and time dimension.</p> <p>The reactions of such boundaries are usually necessary due to the problems posed by the organization of large data.  </p> <p>This study is therefore confirmed to impact of motivation on staff performance as it relates to staff of ovia south-west Local government council. Time and money has been the constraint in the exercise.</p> <p>The time given for this research was too short to warrant intensive research work and financing of the work also contributes. The amount of money required will not be easily sourced.</p> <p>Any attempt to estimate time and money make the exercise unattainable. It is hope that the study will serve as a representative sample to other local government councils in delta state whose inductive finding will be generally applicable.</p> <p>Finally other scholar will undertake similar researcher in the future to put the organization in its true perspective for the entire state</p> <p><strong>1.7. Research hypothesis</strong></p> <p>H0: staff or employee motivation does not influence productivity in an organization.</p> <p>H1: staff or employee motivation influences productivity in an organization.</p> <p><strong>1.8. Definition of terms</strong></p> <ul><li>Local government: defined as the people who have the authority to make decisions or pass laws in a small geographic area near to them. An example of local government is the town council.</li> </ul> <ul><li>Economic development: this can be defined as efforts that seek to improve the economic well-being and quality of life for a community by creating and/or retaining jobs and supporting or growing incomes and the tax base.</li> <li><strong>Motivation: </strong>This can be defined as an internal zeal, which activates ones behaviour towards achieving a goal others see motivation as a process of inducing an individual to perform a given task in order to achieve his as well as the organization objectives.</li> <li><strong>Job Satisfaction:</strong> It is the attitude feeling, sentiment which employees has towards his/her work. It is determined by the job content. Such as responsibility and advancement as well as job conditions</li> <li><strong>Morale:</strong> This simply means an individual state of mind, which in the event of any given activity affects performance of any given task. Good or high morale produce confidence optimum, enthusiasm and inner drive to succeed. Lower morale produces negative attitude towards job performance.</li> </ul>\n\nSTAFF MOTIVATION AND PRODUCTIVITY AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STAFF MOTIVATION AND PRODUCTIVITY AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong><em>ABSTRACT</em></strong><br/>The important of this work is to investigate motivation as a management tool for increasing the productivity of worker in an organization.<br/>This research is divided into five chapters.

Other might have aims of showing appearance ion the office or place of work and would not like to be usefully engaged but like to collect their salary as is when due s still some would prefer working for short periods hence their aim would be to reduce the time they spend in the workplace to a minimum Level since they were not interested with what they are doing.<br/>Therefore, the determination roles of manage goals in an organization and their actives are not always taken for granted. However .due to the co-ordination of human an material resources in an organization in both sectors of their economy are able to establish a company. Management going to increase the productivity of worker are not just a process by which people (manger) crests direct, maintains and operated an organization rather it is through systematic co-operative human effort and control measure it also involves making suggestion for improved performance and prevention of future short coming if any <br/>We now want to asses how effectiveness manager are and relation to productive and constructive services that offer to management therefore the question we want to ask is how the manager maintains the high performances to increase the management tools answer to the above question will go along way in clarifying and explaining what the manager does or is all about and how effective the management decision policy .the overall purpose Is to assist management in achieving the most effective administration of the operations of the operation of organization that will attract the incentive of increasing the productivity of worker in public sector</p> <p><strong>1.1 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>The main aim ‘of this research is to specialize and discuss some factors which determine the effectiveness of Enugu state. Housing Development Corporation and its general impact to both government and management decision policy in an organization.

Motivation is crucial to human being and survival of any enterprise. Management by virtual of their position as decision makers in the corporation view a massive influence in the operation of the organization and this determine what direction the firm should go.<br/>Therefore the researcher does not limits itself to only investigation into the motivational tools the management uses to motivate its human reseach but how management achieve their motivation by following the required method of a good motivation.<br/>Some requirements are:<br/>(a) Security is vital element <br/>(b) A good system must be comprehensive in providing for<br/>The satisfaction of all need. <br/>(c) Subordinate must Included to work and produce more <br/>(d) Provision must be made for financial opportunities <br/>Particularly those given more person freedom<br/>Another important finding of the study is that when employees are highly motivated they have a high tolerance for dissatisfaction arising from the maintains factors.</p> <p><strong>1.2 SIGNIFICANT OF THE SIUDY </strong><br/>Certainly the importance of this project is for the benefit of the Enugu states housing development corporations toward motivating as a management tool for increasing the productivity of worker to the staff of the establishments. It is also to expose the knowledge to the student who will be engage in the study of this course in times to come. The writers research will be of aid to write in solving the problem and highlight the prospect of motivational factor are job centered research will be.<br/>,that is they relate directly to the job itself, the individuals performance ,the job responsibilities and growth and recognition obtained from it. Finally the benefits are all corporate bodies, institutions of high leaning and public servant.</p> <p><strong>1.3 STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS </strong><br/>• Internal audit unit Enugu state development corporation is effective in the performance its function in helping the organization to increase the productivity of worker <br/>• Internal audit unit in Enugu state housing development corporation is not effective in performance its function. <br/>• Improper utility of the housing project by management has helped the organization in achieving its goals<br/>• Proper utilization of the housing project by management has helped the organization in achieving its goals <br/>• Staff show and maintain a prefect performance of their duty as management increase motivation tool <br/>• Staff have not show and maintain a perfect performance of their duty as the management increase their motivation tool .</p> <p><strong>1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>This study is invited to the of now the motivation is well increase production of Enugu state development corporation (ESHD) and effect and efficient it the company.

It is a well known fact that it is the combination of information, capital material and human resource that make up an organization but it should be noted that material resource can not operate without the help of human resources which directs and manage the activities in an organization.</p> <p>human resource development is not new, many scholars; present and past have written a lot about it, some in form of coments, statement, opinion etc as contained in journals, magazines, book and newspaper. The researcher will be devoted to viewing some of the these works various author and scholars.</p> <p><strong>CONCEPT O HUMAN RESOURCE</strong><br/>Man over time has become an indispensable tool in accomplishing organizational goals. The absence of man when other factors of production are available will be the end of the organization. Therefore,  the importance of man in an organization can not be replaced, man must work before goals are attained and to make man work, he must be understood; as such it has became very important to have a department that will be responsible for developing a better man for better organizations the name of such department varies from one organization to the other, some call it human resource department others call it personnel welfare department, personnel development unit, personnel department etc the departments play a major role that is centered on the human resource of an organization.</p> <p>Management is a generic term and subject to many interpretations, different ideas are attributed to the meaning of management, everyone can be regarded as a manager to some extend but we are concerned of management as involving people  working beyond themselves and exercising formal authority over the activities and performance of other people.</p> <p>We can therefore regard management as defined by Mullins (1999) in his book “management and organization behaviour” as:</p> <ol><li>Taking place within a structural organizational self and with prescribe roles.</li> <li>Directed towards the attainment of aims and objectives</li> <li>Achieved through the effort of other people using systems and procedure.</li> </ol> <p>Human resource management according to Michael Armstrong (2006) is defined as a strategic and coherent approach to the management of an organization’s most valued asset – the people working there who individually and collectively contribute to the achievement of its objectives.</p> <p>Storey (1989) believes that human resource management can be regarded as “a set of inter-related policies with an ideological and philosophical under pinion. He suggest for aspects that constitute the meaningful version of human resource development.</p> <ol><li>A particular constellation of beliefs and assumptions</li> <li>A strategic thrust informing decisions about people management.</li> <li>The central involvement of line manager; and</li> <li>Reliance upon a set of ‘levers’ to shape the employment relationship.</li> </ol> <p>(Longh 1990) also defined management as the act of guiding the activities of a group of people towards the achievement of a common goal.</p> <p>Donnelly (1995) in his view defined management as “the process undertaken by one or more individuals to coordinate the activities of others to achieve the result not achievable by the individual acting alone.</p> <p>Human resource development can be said to be that part of management concerned with people at work and their relationship within an organization or enterprise. It stresses the role of individuals in an organization and covers the set of activities which indicates an increased awareness of the implication of the phrase “human resource” human resource development requires that employee to be treated as importance resources to be invested in prudently, to be used productively and from whom a return can be expected, a return that should be monitored there wisely. Human resource development fund anywhere there are people in employment and whose activities call for coordination’s where there is high degree of division of labour. Human resource aims at bringing together and developing the men and women who make up an enterprise and ensures that individuals and working groups are well coordinated to achieve success. It is also aimed at expressing the nature of the employment relationship in changing circumstance.</p> <p>Human resource management therefore can be defined as the process of accomplishing organizational objectives by acquiring, retaining, terminating, developing and properly using the human resource is an organization. “Accomplishing objectives are regularly accomplished the organization ceases to exist” Donnelly (1995) fundamental of management. Human resource management according to Graham (1991) is to ensure that employees of an organization (human resource) are used in such a way that the employer obtains the greatest possible benefit from their abilities and the employees obtain both material and psychological rewards from their work.</p> <p>Human resource management is a more comprehensive approach to the organization of people at work with a base in the behavioural science, which is concerned about the motivation and development of individual employee and the performance and productivity of the organization. It has a holistic view and strategic dimension with all activities designed in a unified and interlocking manner. Human resource are much more difficult to manage than material resources, partly because of conflict often occurs between the employee and employees due to the fact that employees to an increasing extent try to share in decision making.</p> <p>Human resource management is seen as that aspect management that is concerned with people at work and their relationship within the organization or enterprises. It stresses the role of individuals in an organization and is about the effective management of people in the organization.</p> <p><strong>EMERGENCE AND ORIGIN OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT </strong><br/>Human resource management appears to have its origin in the united state of America (USA), IN 1950S although it did not again recognition until the early 1980s and the United Kingdom (UK) LATE1980s.  there are numbers of reasons for the emergence of human resource management over the least decade, among which are the most important is the pressure experienced in product market during the recession  of 1980 – 1982, combined with a growing recognition in the USA, that trade union influence in collective employment was reaching fewer employees. By the 1980s, the USA economy was being challenged to the Japanese workers was not good enough and the declining rate of American innovation was alarming from the above, an idea sprang up for the desire to  create a work situation which is free from conflict where both the employees and employers will work in unity towards achieving same goal.</p> <p>          In United Kingdom (UK) in the 1980s, the business sector also became conducive to changes in the employment relationship, as it is in the USA. This was partly driven by the economic pressure in the form of increased product market competition.</p> <p>However, in the form of increased product market competition. However, unlike USA, the significant factor in the UK was the desire of the government to reform and reshape the conventional model of industrial relations especially the development of more employee oriented employment policies on the part of the management. The old industrial practice in UK was restructured. Another factor is that the economy in UK was very weak especially when places like Japan, Germany and America were not experiencing the same problems. This resulted to employers being accused of poor training and management development by critics in the UK.<br/>At the long run, the concept of employee commitment and employment became very crucial in management practice and human resource management.</p> <p>What makes some people call human resource management, personnel management? Personnel management is seen as that part of management that is concerned with people at work and their relationship within an enterprise. This applies not only to industries and commerce but also to all field of management personnel management aim at achieving both efficiency and justice, neither of which can be pursued successfully without the other. However, human resource management is seen as set of activities that are designed to influence the effectiveness of employees in the organization. The organization must always at all time through appropriate authority provided effective working condition and a satisfactory  environment both within and outside the organization, for the workman, and also provide a means of developing the worker through training and development.</p> <p>While personnel management respond to changes in employment law, labour market conditions and trade union actions; human resource management is prescriptive and concerned with strategies, the initiation of new activities and development of the ideas. Thus, human resource management has long-term perspective that seek to integrate all the human aspects of the organization into a coherent while and at the end establishing high level of employee goals.</p> <p><strong>HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE </strong><br/>Human resource management is aimed at reducing the level of inefficiency in the allocation and utilization of both labour and capital in the organization. It’s also expresses the nature of employment relationship is changing circumstance. Human resource management aims at boosting the effectiveness of the organization by bringing together and developing the men and women who make up the enterprise.</p> <p>The main objective of human resource development is matching the size and skills of the workforce to the productive requirement of the organization, achieved by raising the quantity of individual employees; contribution to production. Human resource objective are determined by the organization objective a whole. The organization cannot on its side afford to have programmes set aside for human resource planning, management and development wrong. The objective reflect on the increased social responsibility of firms, which include the traditional responsibilities to customers, employees and shareholder not only to these but also to the community at large, thereby creating employment opportunities for the disadvantage and provide greater financial security and a favourable worm environment.</p> <p><strong>POLICIES OF HUMAN RESOURCE MAANGEMENT </strong><br/>Human resource policies are the continuing guideline on the approach the organization intends to adopt in managing its people. They define the philosophies and values of the organization on how people should be treated and from these are derived the principles upon which manager are expected to act when decisions are made about people. They help to define the way things are done around the organization.</p> <p>Human resource policies help to ensure that when dealing with matters. Concerning people, an approach in line with corporate values is adopted through out the organization. They serve as the basis for enacting value (converting supportive value into values in use), they provide framework within which consistent decisions are made and promote equity in the way in which people are treated. The policies also provide guidance in what managers should do in particular circumstance and facilitate improvement, devotion and delegation.</p> <p>Policies not only fit who corporate culture but helps in shaping it. For organizations to achieve their goals, there is need to continually access the  quality and quantity of human resource policies because the policy is a clear-cut statement of the  aims and objectives of an organization setting out what is to be achieved. human resource policies have an important role to play in facilitating effective implementation and management process such as total quality management.</p> <p><strong>IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN RESOURCES</strong><br/>People often asked “is human resource management really needed”? in the past, many organization pay little or no attention to their human resource but in the present time, organization have  seen the need to take cognizance their human resource.</p> <p>Human resource development holds the key not only to the survival of individual organizations but the Nigeria economy as a whole. Human resource management designed to analyse employment relationship, human resource greatly affects the profitability of  organizations. Without the right people in place resource management by definition will fail (Druker, 1982) the only difference between one organization and the other is the performance level of the employees.   </p> <p>Harper (1987) viewed human resource management as that aspect of management which seeks to maximize resources efficiently for the productivity of people. He was of  the opinion that it will be of great advantage to organizations to invest on employees to strengthen than thereby resulting in their full commitment and at the end, contributing to the overall success of the organization.</p> <p>The smooth running man or woman is an essential future of any organization and for some; people are just not important but are seen as the key factors for successful performance.</p> <p><strong>DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCE IN NIGERIA </strong><br/>Development began with the history of colonial administration. Management was then moulded to meet requirements of the colonial regime, not until the mid 19th century; there was no standard of payment and appointment. The colonial administration’s main task then was to pacify this area of conquest. There was then the protectorate of northern Nigeria and southern Nigeria. The two were amalgamated on January 12, 1914 under Fredrick Lugard. By 1920s, some educated Nigerians led by Herbert Macaulay agitated for participation in the country’s affairs and thus, the emergence of an indigenous Nigerian. Management in response to this, Lord Lugard set up an advisory body called the Nigerian council, thirty (30)  being colonial masters with only six (6) Nigerian’s. </p> <p>During the Clifford’s constitution of 1943, Nigerians were allowed to participate in policy formulation for the first time. The Richard’s constitution of 1946 paved way for greater participation of Nigerian by dividing the country into three (3) regions; northern,   southern and eastern regions. Between 1946 and 1953 Nigeria management witnesses the delegation of their regional administration. After the independence of Nigeria, by February 1961 Nigerian expatriate managers came together with the hope of setting up a Nigerian branch of British institute of management but the Nigerians were so anxious and went ahead to established the Nigerian institute of management in April 1916.</p> <p>Having seen the efforts of the Nigeria institution Management (NIM) as stimulate in both in the public and private sectors, other institutions were established like the industry training fund (ITF), centre for management and development (CMO), administrative staff college of Nigeria (ASCON).</p> <p><strong>FUNCTIONS OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT</strong><br/>The function of human resource management should be focused on the need to facilitate changes as key objectives of the organization. Such changes as seen include changes of values, changes in the method of work, introduction of new technology, changes in career pattern and adoption of external social value and expectations.</p> <p>It is necessary to have an effective personnel function whether it is the responsibility of the owner or of a manager. Even in smaller organizations or other organizations where a specialist department is not established, there will be need to recruit, train motivate and reward staff also to comply with the law reacting to employment.</p> <p>Over the years management scholars, starting with Henri Fayol have identified many function to include planning, organizing, staffing, directing and controlling as the key function. The 1970s framework use planning, organizing, directing, and controlling (PODC) a planning is seen as the process of defining goals, establishing strategy for the achievement of the goals, mapping actions to integrate and coordinate activities organizing determines the tasks to be performed, establishing a framework of authority and responsibility relationships among and between people meant to accomplish the task. Directing has to do with motivating, educating guiding and communicating with subordinate either individually or in groups and resolving conflicts. Controlling helps to prevent, identify and correct deficiencies in all phases of the operations to ensure that objective are attained as planned.</p>\n\nTHE ASSESSMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT IN ENHANCING ORGANIZATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ASSESSMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT IN ENHANCING ORGANIZATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY", "id": 32}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE IMPACT OF TIME MANAGEMENT IN EMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY IN ORGANIZATION</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Organization comprises of individuals performing various activities which enable them to achieve objectives for which they are established. Cole (2002) says that these various tasks varies in time span that is the time required to perform a specific task in organization varies from job to job hence the need for effective management of time by the organization is discharged of various organizational responsibilities. It is against this backdrop that Tailor (1977) developed “the time and motion study” time and motion study which reveals exactly how long it takes to perform a task and the best way to perform it. This enables organization to know how much output they can expect in a given time in support to this principles. Taylor (1977) demonstrates the benefit of increase employees productivity and earnings which he had obtained at the Bethlehem steel works. He described to his critics an experiment with two shoulders “first class shoulders” in his word whose effort were timed and studies each man had his own personal shovel which he used regardless of the type of coal being shifted. At first the average shovel load was about 38 pounds and with this loan each man handled about 25 tons of materials a day. Daily tonnage up to 30 eventually it was found out that with smaller shovels averaging about 21 pounds per load the daily output rose even higher. George and James (1996) says that management is prioritizing and estimating techniques that allow workers to identify the most importance task and fit them with their daily work schedule. This enables workers to make better use of their time whenever we went to perform some task. We are not presently doing this, so we have to displace other activities to make room for it. There it lies the secret of what it referred to as effective time managements to be effective we displace less importance task with more important ones that have stress. If we tend to be objective about time. We will discover that for every reward that we receive either in a given labour it is not for the effort of the job rendered but for the time involved or time taken to do such a job. Cordiner (1990) says that effective impact of time management is everything in every viable organization. There exists variety of techniques that organization can employ to ensure effective and efficient impact management of time by employees to enhance its productivity. This study is an attempt to identity these techniques and how the impact of time management enhances an employee productivity in organization.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>This study is concerned with the impact of time management on employee’s productivity at the Kaduna State Universal Basic Education Board.

Generally, this study was made on the management, staffs and the customers of Airtel Telecommunication, Asaba metropolis in Oshimili South local government area of Delta state, Nigeria.  Primary and secondary data were sources of data collection for this study. Structured questionnaire were used to elicit data from the respondents. One hundred (100) respondents were selected for this study but seventy (70) were eventually used. A survey research design was employed and a simple random sampling technique was adopted. Simple percentage method and regression statistical tool was employed as the major analytical tool. The findings revealed that recruitment and selection has a significant relationship on employee’s turnover. Also, the findings led to the conclusion that reward system has a positive effect on job satisfaction and performance appraisal can directly determine employee’s productivity. The study therefore recommended that training and development contribute  to the profitability of the organisation.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong><br/><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br/><strong>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The management of people within the organisation has become an increasingly recognized important focus for researchers and practitioner over the past 20 years. Organisations are becoming more aware of important role human resource play in the success of their organisations to achieve financial performance. As a result, organisations are becoming more employee-centric by focusing on enhancing employees’ engagement and organisational commitment<br/>It is important for organisation to adopt human resources management (HRM) system that optimizes workforce as it enables organisation to achieve competitive advantage in today’s global market economy that provides wider access to technology, finance and other resources. Pfeffer (1994) stated that firms have increasingly recognized the potential for their peopleto be a source of competitive advantage. Creating competitive advantage through people requires careful attention to the practices that best leverage these assets. According to Nishii, (2008) scholars generally agree that appropriately designed, Human resources management practices can enhance organizational performance. Related theories suggesting and supporting assumption holds that the practices of Human Resources Management influences employees attitudes and behaviours.<br/>Human Resource Management is an invisible asset in an organisation. It creates value when embedded in the operational system that enhances organisational performance and ability to deal with turbulent environment. Effective HRM assists in developing human resources into high quality and efficient workforce thus enabling the organisation to obtain a competitive advantage through their people. In contrast, inefficient workforce can increase labour cost and decrease organisation productivity. However, in order to remain competitive, grow and diversify, an organisation must ensure that its employees are qualified, placed in appropriate position, properly trained, managed effectively and committed to the firm’s success. The goal of HRM is to maximize employees contribution in order to achieve optimal productivity and effectiveness while simultaneously attaining individual objective (such as having a challenging job) and obtaining recognition) and societal objectives (such as legal compliance and demonstrating social responsibility).<br/>Human resource dimensions or practices (training, recruitment, reward system performance appraisal etc) have considerable impact on the performance of organizations and these contribute to the affirmative link between human resource management and organizational performance (Osman, 2012).<br/>Training is a flexible way to develop an employee as it consists of both formal and informal ways to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of employees (Ellstrom, 2011). Job security increases employees’ honesty, keeps employees committed to the organization and provides security to valuable information as well (Raji and Jackson, 2011). Reward system is imposed on organization to evaluate reward and organization reward employees on the basis to get value by elaborating what they have spent and what they have got (Armstrong, 2011). Employee performance can be evaluated by the evaluation of task and reward system. Employee performance is one that is affected by the knowledge transfer that helps employee to develop their understanding of networking as well as focusing on the organizational performance.<br/>Organizational performance is related to organizational justice which allows employees to get committed to task assigned to him or her. HRM dimensions greatly influences the employees attitude which in turn affects employees’ performance. If HRM system works effectively, then increase in the organizational performance will be seen (Snape and Redman, 2010). Competitive advantage is viewed as a source of competitive advantage is a must for any organization and employees are always viewed as source of competitive advantage for any organization (Barney, 1991; Pfeffer, 1994). So, human resource management must be made in such a way that can utilize employees in the best possible way to increase performance of organizations.</p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>Research problem is an intellectual stimulus calling for an answer in the form of scientific inquiry.<br/>From experience over the years, with the role of human resource management in the achievement of organizational goal in Nigeria compared to other organizations of the world. It has been observed that human resource management in Nigeria have not performed well to support the efficiency and growth of the nation.<br/>Any management that is keen on training its personnel is usually faced with the problem of cost/benefit analysis. It is very easy to work cost but it is difficult to put value on the asset. It is therefore pertinent to list the problems associated with training human resource in the organization.<br/>It has been observed that the problem facing business and increasingly number of workers are being faced with poor condition of service including remuneration. Furthermore, the foreign exchange problem has added a new dimension to the range of problem facing business organization. The overall effect of the problem is that most business organization can no longer afford to offer the employees good remuneration and adequate compensation for their labour. This is a situation that brought about ineffectiveness of human resource in the achievement of organizational goals.<br/>Presently, Nigeria economy is experiencing some economic difficulties which have resulted in retirements, retrenchments, lay-offs, mergers and acquisitions and dismissal of employees.<br/>Furthermore, prominent among the reasons why organizations perform poorly in most organization in Nigeria is the problem of fund. Thus, this is the reason for the introduction of two schemes and programmes by the federal Government through the CBN which are geared towards improving the accessibility and availability of credit to the companies in order to make them more vibrant. Even the funds cannot manage themselves without the human resource.<br/>At this point, the problem this study seeks to address is to find out the impact of HRM and how it has facilitated the growth and achievement of organizational goals.</p> <p><strong>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Research objectives are statements that the research project will attempt to achieve. They provide the guidelines for establishing research agenda of activities necessary to implement the research process (Hair et al, 2006; 663).<br/>The main objective of this study is to find out the impact of Human Resource Management (HRM) on organizational performance. Aside this, other specific objectives that will be addresses are;</p> <ol><li>To determine the relationship between recruitment and selection on employees’ turnover.</li> <li>To examine the influence of reward system on job satisfaction.</li> <li>To find out the effect of training and development on profitability</li> <li>To determine the impact of performance appraisal on employee’s productivity.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>Research Question is the question which the researcher set out to answer. It is essentially a hypothesis asked in the form of a question (Kerlinger 2006).<br/>Given the objectives of the study above, the following research questions are this formulated to guide the study</p> <ol><li>Does recruitment and selection have effect on employees’ turnover?</li> <li>What role does reward system play on job satisfaction?</li> <li>Is there any association between training and development on profitability?</li> <li>What is the relationship between performance appraisal and employee’s productivity</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5     RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong><br/>Research hypothesis is a formal statement that presents the expected relationship between an independent and dependent variable (Creswell 2006). <br/>From the research questions above, this study will be anchored on the following hypothesis<br/>Ho1:   Recruitment and selection has no significant association on employee’s turnover.<br/>Ho2: Reward system negatively influences Job satisfaction<br/>Ho3: Training and development does not affect profitability<br/>Ho4: Performance appraisal cannot directly determine employee’s productivity.</p> <p><strong>1.6     SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The study is carried out within Asaba metropolis, Oshimili South Local Government Area of Delta State, Nigeria. The study focuses on the telecommunication industry in Nigeria generally but only covers Airtel Nigeria Plc.<br/>The sampling objects used in the study are employees and customers of Airtel telecommunication industry, Asaba metropolis. It was presumed that this group of people could provide more information in response to the questions contained in the questionnaire – The impact of Human Resource Management on Organizational Performance.<br/>The highlighted indicator of the independent variable includes training and development, performance appraisal, recruitment and selection and reward system. Although, Human resource management covers a very wide range of dimensions or indicators, but focus will only be made on the above listed indicators.</p> \n\nTHE IMPACT OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ON ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ON ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE", "id": 34}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>   </p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The researcher examined the of customer and employee relationship on the management of Hospitality industry both privately owned and publicly owned establishment in Asaba Delta State. The objective is to determine whether cordial  relationship exist between customer and employees in Hospitality establishment, to this end, the researcher is interested in determining if there is significant relationship between customer and employer in the Hospitality industry. The method used in the study is a case study of both public and private hotels in Asaba Delta state. Data for the study were obtained through questionnaire administered on 90 randomly selected samples of employees and customers of the selected hotels being studied. Data obtained were analysed using sample percentage statistical method while the hypotheses were tested using x2 method. Results reveals that good customer – employee relationship enhances effective management of Hospitality industry. Secondly, customer and employees relationship is seriously impacted by inadequate employee training and lack of motivation. The study, therefore recommends that “on – the job” training of staff should be organized and also staff of hotels should be better paid and should be given reasonable incentives. The activities and styles of both publicly and privately owned hotels are different. How employees handle and treats their customers was examined and identified. The reasons of employee behaviors towards customers was discovered and observed in several ways,(1) Lack of employee training on the job of hospitality (ii) Lack of motivation and incentives. From the study, it was argued that private Hotels are more effective than public hotels because of godfatherism in the system in the public Hotel. The study also went further to show how customers are poorly served and attended to in most hotels. The study also revealed that if employee are properly trained and motivated in the hospitality establishment, the employee will be more effective to customer’s services. Then customers will repeat patronage to enhance the growth of hospitality industry globally.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0  </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The world Hospitality Industry has recently experienced a tremendous growth rate throughout the world. In fact Statistics have shown that Hospitality has today become one of ` the most promising and fastest growing industries in the service sector of the economy. More also Hospitality itself is as old as mankind and has been at the centre of the economy of Nations.</p> <p>According to the Dictionary definition of customer, <strong>CUSTOMER </strong>is a patron: one who purchases or receives a product or service from a business or merchant, or intends to do so. A person, especially one engaging in some sort of interaction with others. There are five reasons why customers is always right before the employee.</p> <p>  The phrase customers is always right was originally coined by Harry Gordon Selfridge in London in 1909, and is typically used by businesses.</p> <ol><li>To convince customers that they get good service</li> <li>Convince the employees to give customers good service fortunately more business are abundantly these maxim ironically because it lead to bad customer service</li> </ol> <p>The existence of any business is dependent on the patronage of the customers. In the hospitality industry a customer is a person who visits a hospitality firm to enjoy the services of the outfit such as food, drink, and in some cases accommodation. The services are rendered on payment of reasonable price charged by the firm. A customer takes the centre stage in management policy for successful operation of a hotel industry. It is on this background that customers retention is invariably a crucial management function as it is significantly related to survival of a business. Hence workable strategies must be designed to achieve this goal on regular basis.</p> <p>Reicheld (1995:45) defined a customer as an individual or company that purchases a product or service. The term customer is used to refer to both consumer and organizational market. Consumer market is made up of those customers that buy products and services for further production or sale of other products and services. In effect, a customer supports an organization by offering his/her hard earned money in exchange for what an organization offers. Hospitality industry is the business where providing services such as catering and entertainment takes place, Apaokagi (2010). Reicheld, (1995) explained that customer retention is the activity that a selling crganization (a hospitality firm) undertakes in order to reduce customer defections.</p> <p>Dictionary defines Employees as an individuals who provides labour to an establishment or other person.</p> <p>Many employee may have the opportunity of direct contact with customers in the two different establishment both private and public hotels. For some it will be a regular aspect of their job, for other Hotels whether private or public. Technical skills and technique are very important but equally for perhaps more important are sincere caring attitudes and manner with the food served in an environment that has an atmosphere that makes the customer feel at ease, wanted and welcome.</p> <p>     As competition and other environmental influences increase globally, it is obvious that there is growing emphases on quality improvement and error reduction in order to achieve customer satisfaction, retention and enhancing organizational value, (Iwarere, 2010) many companies and organizations have now acknowledges the critical importance of being customer-oriented and customer-driven in all their activities. Kotler [1997) asserts that as not enough to be product-driven or technology-driven, without bringing the power of customer into the centre of the business. So satisfy your customer or someone else will.</p> <p>Management inadequacies resulting to bad consequences to employees during services to customers.</p> <p>It makes employee unhappy, it give abrasive customers an unfair advantage, some customers are bad for business, it result in worse customer service, some customer are just plain wrong.</p>\n\nTHE EFFFCT OF CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP ON THE MANAGEMENT OF HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY BOTH PUBLICLY OWNED AND PRIVATELY OWNED ESTABLISHMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFFCT OF CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP ON THE MANAGEMENT OF HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY BOTH PUBLICLY OWNED AND PRIVATELY OWNED ESTABLISHMENT", "id": 35}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The most significant developments in the area of organizations in recently is the increasing attention given to human resource. People are very important to organizational efficiency as they offer services, values and also contribute to progress of the organizational life; and when these humans are controlled judiciously, these human qualities can be of impact and benefits to the organization. As revealed in Djabatey (2012) this scenario lends credence to the increasing attention being paid to the people aspect of organizational wealth. This is so because the process of developing these humans, their ability, and the entire development process of the total organization are the fulcrum of human resource management (Mullins, 1999; Djabatey, 2012). Akin to this development is the contention in National University of Ireland (2006) that the continued growth of the enterprise depends on its ability to recruit and select high quality personnel at all levels. Meanwhile, recruitment is the process of identifying and attracting potential candidates from within and outside an organization to begin evaluating them for future employment, selection begins when the right calibre of candidates are identified (Walker, 2009).</p> <p>The term recruitment can simply mean, “The process of finding and hiring the best qualified candidate for a job, these can be done by advertising for large number of employees or getting a lightly experienced individual for a particular job”. These imply that not just anybody with good grade is qualified for recruitment into the organization. A proper screening has to be made to choose who is rightly qualified for the job; a candidate who is matured, high level of reasoning, with skills and has a good moral attitude and character. These is very essential pro to the fact this is the process in which government or an organization and firms can achieve their sets of aims and objectives. However, even when those that are qualified pick interest and they apply; attention should be taken to select mainly those that have the passion and are enthusiastic in making contributions towards the organizational growth. “Recruitment can be seen as the overall process of attracting, selecting sustainable individuals within a time frame, sufficient numbers and with the right qualifications, developing their interest in an organization.” The process of recruitment can be done yearly or not depending on the organization but mostly it is not done yearly only when need arises. The need can arises as a result of establishment of braches or a vacant position created by those who left the service due to either retirement, sack or voluntary withdrawal from the service or other reasons. During this process applicants are fully informed about the criteria for selection that will lead to producing the effectiveness, as well as the opportunities the organization provides to the employees. Absolute information of the job about to apply helps the individual to give in their best when finally employed because it is when you understand what you are going to do that you can tell how to do it and how best to do it these implies that “the process of recruitment has two basic impacts. Firstly, recruitment focuses on both attraction and retention of the qualified applicant. Secondly, it should create a right image of the organization for those who come in contact with it”. The first impact implies that recruiters should have intention of retaining their qualified candidates and this can be done by firstly, giving them the opportunity to serve. This is very much important because the problem of employing the qualified candidate without encouragment can lead to inability to perform and as such the purpose of recruitment is defeated. Aside this the organization that is recruiting should try as much as possible to display its good image by showing high sense of sincerity when selecting candidates. All applicants should be given equal and fair opportunity irrespective of ethnic background, religious differences and other personal reasons. These will definitely give the applicants the impression that they are making the right choice and will try putting in their best in achieving the stated goals, aims and objectives. One of the reasons why most employees fail in their jobs is the fact that they are treated unjustly. Fairness and equity should serve as one of the guiding criteria for the recruitment of applicants.</p> <p>Recruitment of personnel into the service is often conducted through series of stages known as the resourcing cycle. The resourcing cycle starts with the identification of a vacancy and ends when the successful employee is performing the job to a suitable standard.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE GENERAL PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The nature of the recruitment policies and methods in Nigerian public and private sector has been deemed to be unfair, biased, fraudulent, secretive and unacceptable by the general populace. This lack of transparency in the recruitment processes has led to the poor performance of staff as the right people are not employed for particular jobs thus leading to poor efficiency of organizations and lack of productivity on the part of the workers which has ultimately led to many organizations being under distress and liquidations. This constant poor performance of organizations as a result of efficiency has led to the mass retrenchment of workers which has snowballed to the poor economic growth and development as evident in the current economic recession confronting our nation today. </p> <p>Therefore the problem confronting the research is to examine recruitment process and organizational efficiency with a view to finding a relationship between them using dangote sugar plc as a case study.</p> <p><strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The major aim of the study is to examine the recruitment process and organizational efficiency in dangote sugar plc. Other specific objectives of the study include;</p> <ol><li>To examine the recruitment processes in private and public organizations in Nigeria.</li> <li>To examine the relationship between recruitment process and organizational efficiency.</li> <li>To determine the impact of recruitment processes on employee productivity.</li> <li>To recommend ways of improving recruitment processes in Nigerian public and private sector.</li> </ol> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <ol><li>What are the recruitment processes in private and public organizations in Nigeria?</li> <li>What is the relationship between recruitment process and organizational efficiency?</li> <li>What is the impact of recruitment processes on employee productivity?</li> <li>What are the ways of improving recruitment processes in Nigerian public and private sector?</li> </ol> <p><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>H0: There is no significant relationship between recruitment process and organizational efficiency.</p> <p>H1: There is a significant relationship between recruitment process and organizational efficiency.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study would be of immense importance to government at all levels, the private and public sectors as it would reveal the relationship between recruitment process and organizational efficiency. the study would also benefit students, researchers and scholars who are interested in developing further studies on the subject matter.</p> <p><strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is restricted to the recruitment process and organizational efficiency in Dangote sugar plc in Kwara state.</p> <p><strong>Financial constraint:</strong> Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview)</p> <p><strong>Time constraint:</strong> The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

The research findings revealed that the causes of conflict are poor communication gap, unequal distribution of rewards, and power tussles among staff. We recommend that collective bargaining, acceptance of subordinate goals, and effective communication device to employee should be adopted by the administrators.</em></p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>Title Page                                                                         i</p> <p>Approval Page                                                          ii</p> <p>Certification                                                             iii</p> <p>Dedication                                                               iv</p> <p>Acknowledgements                                                  v</p> <p>Abstracts                                                                 vi</p> <p>Table of Contents                                                     vii</p> <p><strong>Chapter One: Introduction</strong></p> <p>1.1   Background of the Study                                        1</p> <p>1.2   Statement of Problem                                              3</p> <p>1.3   Objective of the study                                              3</p> <p>1.4   Research Questions                                                 4</p> <p>1.5   Statement of Hypotheses                                         4</p> <p>1.6   Scope of the Study                                                   5</p> <p>1.7   Significance of the study                                          6</p> <p>1.8   Limitations of the Study                                          6</p> <p>1.9   Operational Definition of Terms                               7</p> <p><strong>Chapter Two: Literature Review</strong></p> <p>2.1   Introduction                                                             8</p> <p>2.2   The Review                                                              20</p> <p>2.3   Summary of the Chapter                                          26</p> <p><strong>Chapter Three: Research Methods</strong></p> <p>3.1   Introduction                                                             28</p> <p>3.2   Research Design                                                      29</p> <p>3.3   Population of the Study                                           29</p> <p>3.4   Sample and Sampling Technique                            30</p> <p>3.5   Instrumentation                                                       30</p> <p>3.6   Method of Data Collection                                       31</p> <p>3.7   Method of Data Analysis                                          32</p> <p><strong>Chapter Four: Data Presentation, Analysis And Discussion</strong></p> <p>4.1   Introduction                                                             35</p> <p>4.2   Data Presentation and Interpretation                       36</p> <p>4.3   Data Analysis and Hypotheses Testing                    37</p> <p><strong>Chapter Five: Conclusion and Recommendation</strong></p> <p>5.1   Introduction                                                             48</p> <p>5.2   Summary of Findings                                              48</p> <p>5.3   Conclusion                                                              49</p> <p>5.4   Recommendations                                                   50</p> <p>5.5   Suggested Area for Further Studies                         51</p> <p>Reference                                                                 52</p> <p><strong>C</strong><strong>HAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study of conflict management as it is aimed in this work is to investigate how conflict can be managed among organization personnel in Hartland Construction Nigerian Limited, here in Auchi head office, and other zonal offices in the federation. Many organizations has faced different conflicts in the organization of both material and personnel, but the ability to manage these conflicts lead to the organizational effectiveness and improve efficiency, but when not properly handled, it results to loss of man hour, waste of resources and low productivity.</p> <p>Basically, conflict is inevitable in organization. It can be negative or positive in an organization depending on the way it is handled asserted by Mr. Victor Umoru. There is no meaningful development that can take place in a state of rancor and prevailing issues in the world today in general and since it cannot be eliminated entirely and one must live with it, the best attitude on effective and efficient execution should be developed towards it. That suggest that the inevitable in the industrial setting should be recognized and developed and understanding of the ways of managing, minimizing as well as resolving it.</p> <p>An organizations needs to create a peaceful environment where high degree of compromise and better understanding will be reached between the Administrators, union, employees in civil services where all this exist. There’s always a high degree of productivity and great commitment when provision of welfare services are made that in turn lead to organizational development.</p> <p>Conflicts in Nigeria organizations are disastrous especially when it is negative, thereby creating unnecessary economic lost to both institutions (Society and the organization). This at times results to industrial action such as strike, lockout, street protest, seat tight, go slow etc which results to loss of production, loss of man hour, and waste of resources. This survey tends and aimed to deal on the conflict management in an organization to ensure organizational developmental efficiency with high productivity to the societal growth (Coser, 2006).</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>The major focus of this study is to determine the following problems of conflict base on this scenario;</p> <ol><li>Limited resources</li> <li>Interdependent work</li> <li>Communication problems</li> <li>Difference in perception</li> <li>Task asymmetric</li> <li>Unclear authority structure</li> <li>Different attitude</li> <li>Individual personal problem</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.3   Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>The specific objectives of this study is to:</p> <ol><li>Determine whether or not non-profit making organization, attach different level of importance to conflict management technique.</li> <li>Determine the level of concern administrators show to conflict situation.</li> <li>Determine managerial conflicts strategies that non-profit making organization like to adopt.</li> <li>Determine the level of impact conflict has in non-profit making organizations.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4   Research Questions</strong></p> <p>a.     How significant is collective bargaining to administrators and employee in conflict resolution?</p> <p>b.     To what extent does understanding exist between administrators and employees on a particular conflict situation?</p> <p>c.     What are the causes of conflict in an organization?</p> <p>d.     To what extent has the administrators and employees agreed to conflict control?</p> <p>e.     What are the various method used in reducing conflict in your organization?</p> <p><strong>1.5   Statement of Hypotheses</strong></p> <p><strong>Hypothesis One</strong></p> <p><strong>HO:</strong>   Collective bargaining does not play significant role in conflict resolution.</p> <p><strong>HI:</strong>    Collective bargaining plays significant role in conflict resolution.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis Two</strong></p> <p><strong>HO:   </strong>Conflict does not enhance good understanding between administers and employees in an organization.</p> <p><strong>HI:    </strong>Conflict enhance good understanding between administers and employees in an organization.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis Three</strong></p> <p><strong>HO:   </strong>Misunderstanding between management and employees does not result to conflict in an organization.</p> <p><strong>HI:    </strong>Misunderstanding between management and employees results to conflict in an organization.</p> <p><strong>1.6   Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study is operationally restricted to non-profit oriented institutions in Nigeria, especially here in Auchi. Which personal interviews and questionnaires where conducted and administered to both junior and senior staff of Hartland Construction Nigerian Limited, Auchi Edo State Head Office. And the response will be used to make generalization, conclusions and recommendation base on this work.</p> <p><strong>1.7   Significant of the Study</strong></p> <p>The significant of this work is mainly expected to be beneficial to organizations’ and administrators’ methods of conflict resolution model, so as to avoid future conflict actions, and by ensuring organizational development are achieved through the use of corrective action of conflict.</p> <p>Above all, this study will contribute immensely to the wealth of knowledge in the area of management, which will be beneficial to management students, administrators, business men and managers etc. This will obviously increase the efficiency of Business growth and its productivity.</p> <p><strong>1.8   Limitations of the Study</strong></p> <p>Basically, the limitation of this work is on the poor response rate by respondent and uncooperative attitude in ensuring that the conduct of the personnel are interviewed.</p> <p>The personnel are always on patrol, and thereby finding it difficult to see the personnel at due time te interview. The unavailability of funds to procure the necessary materials was difficult. However, the data collected here were used to analyze and generalize the outcome of this research in concluding the bases of the findings on this survey.</p> <p>Finally, constant frowned attitude of some of respondents at some questions which they felt and ‘think that’ such questions might be probing to their work or office.</p> <p><strong>1.9   Operational Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Conflict: </strong>Conflict is a situation in which people groups or countries involve in a serious disagreement or argument.</p> <p><strong>Strike: </strong>Strike is a work stoppage caused by the mass refusal of employee to work.</p> <p><strong>Collective bargaining: </strong>Collective bargaining is a process whereby representatives of management and workers negotiate over issues like wages, hours and condition of employment.</p> <p><strong>Go slow: </strong>This is a deliberate reduction of productivity by workers in an organization.</p>\n\nAN ASSESSMENT OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN AN ORGANIZATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ASSESSMENT OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN AN ORGANIZATION", "id": 37}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Abstracts</strong></p> <p>Earnings management has received considerable attention in recent times. This is due to its linkage with the reliability of published accounting reports. Indication from the academic literature has shown that the practice of earnings management is quite extensive among publicly traded firms. In response to the demand for greater proportion of independent directors on corporate boards and the need for financial sophistication of audit quality, this study examines the role of independent board of directors, audit quality and board effectiveness in preventing earnings management in Nigeria. Secondary data were extracted from annual reports of the sample firms for the period between 2002 and 2011 and univariate OLS multiple regression was used as a tool for data analysis. Using an experimental research design, the study finds that board dominated by independent non-executive directors brings a greater breadth of experience to the firm and are in a better position to monitor and control managers, thereby reducing earnings management. Also, it was observed that audit quality reduces the likelihood of earnings management. It earnings management and hence, help to reduce earnings management tendencies. The study recommends that the financial reporting council of Nigeria should strengthen its role in ensuring higher quality financial reporting. Also, certain measures should be put in place to reduce the tendencies for reporting accountants to outfox the reporting principles for their private benefits. Finally, corporate governance code should be given wider applicability across companies in different sectors.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>Title Page                                                                         i</p> <p>Certification                                                                     ii</p> <p>Dedication                                                                       iii</p> <p>Acknowledgements                                                          iv</p> <p>Abstract                                                                           v</p> <p>Table of Contents                                                             vi</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION                           </strong>       </p> <ol><li>Background to the Study                                         1</li> <li>Statement of Problem                                              3</li> <li>Research Questions                                                 5</li> <li>Objectives of the Study                                            5</li> <li>Statement of Research Hypotheses                          6</li> <li>Significance of the Study                                         7</li> <li>Scope of the Study                                                   8</li> <li>Limitations of the Study                                         8</li> <li>Definitions of Terms                                                9</li> </ol> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO: REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE</strong></p> <ol><li>Introduction                                                             11</li> <li>Earnings Management                                             14</li> <li>Corporate Governance                                             19</li> <li>Earnings Quality and Corporate Governance           23</li> <li>Board Composition                                                  26</li> <li>Audit Quality and Earnings Management                        29</li> <li>Board Effectiveness and Earnings Management      34</li> </ol> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHOD AND DESIGN      </strong></p> <ol><li>Introduction                                                             38</li> <li>Research Design                                                      38</li> <li>Description of Population of the Study                    39   </li> <li>Sample Size                                                             39</li> <li>Sampling Techniques                                              39</li> <li>Sources of Data Collection                                       39</li> <li>Method of Data Presentation                                   40</li> <li>Method of Data Analysis                                          40</li> </ol> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR: DATA PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS AND</strong></p> <p><strong>INTERPRETATION                                                         </strong></p> <ol><li>Introduction                                                             42</li> <li>Presentation of Data                                                        42</li> <li>Data Analysis                                                           43</li> <li>Hypotheses Testing                                                  65</li> </ol> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, CONCLUSION</strong></p> <p><strong>AND RECOMMENDATIONS                                           </strong></p> <ol><li>Introduction                                                             68</li> <li>Summary of Findings                                              68</li> <li>Conclusion                                                              68</li> <li>Recommendations                                                   70</li> </ol> <p>References                                                               73</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Earnings management is an area of accounting research that elicits attention from across a wide spectrum of management and other stakeholders. The Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB 1990) refers to earnings management as the distortion of the reliability, relevance and predictive value of information presented in financial statement. Schipper (2009) defined earnings management as ‘the process of taking deliberate steps within the constraint of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) to bring about a desired level of reported income. Healy and Wahlen (2009) saw earnings management as when managers use judgment in financial reporting in structuring transactions to alter financial reports, either to mislead some stakeholders or to influence contractual outcomes that depend on reported accounting about the underlying economic performance of the company.</p> <p>The connection between corporate governance and earnings management has been the subject of an ongoing debate. It is believed that the diffuseness of a firm’s ownership structure plausibly serves the firm’s shareholders better than a concentrated ownership structure. The users of financial information are of the notion that managers of organizations utilize earnings management opportunistically for selfish reasons rather than for the benefit of the stakeholders. This misalignment of stakeholders and manager’s interest has cited a basis for the occurrence of earnings management as managers could use the latitude provided by accounting standards to manage income opportunistically therefore, creating a distortion in reported earnings. The very nature of accounting accruals gives managers a great deal of discretion in determining the earnings a firm reports in any given period because of the information asymmetry between managers and owners. Accounting earnings are more reliable and more informative when managers opportunistic behaviours are controlled through a variety of monitoring systems (Dechow, Sloan &amp; Sweeney, 2006).</p> <p>As a result of this misalignment of interest between managers and shareholders, there has been an international trend towards developing and implementing corporate governance to fight against the opportunistic behaviours that have undermined investors’ credibility in<br/>financial report. Corporate governance attributes help investors by aligning the interest of managers with the interest of shareholders and also by enhancing the reliability of financial information and integrity of<br/>the financial reporting process (Watts, 2011).</p> <p>It is against this background that this study is undertaken to exploratively examine the relationship between corporate governance and earnings management in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>Several studies on earnings management such as the study carried out by Olayinka (2012), Shehu (2012) and other researchers have highlighted the presence of earnings management practice in Nigeria at different times. These practices include: profit overstatement, account falsification, price manipulation, etc which have led to the distortion of the credibility of financial reports. To mitigate these financial reporting improprieties and enhance the decision usefulness of financial statements, corporate governance emerged as a veritable mechanism to stifle the windows of earnings management. Corporate governance is a mechanism that is employed to reduce the agency cost that arises as a result of the conflict of interest that exist between managers and shareholders</p> <p>Due to the incessant practice of earnings management in Nigeria, the problem of whether corporate governance variables such as board composition, audit quality, audit committee, board effectiveness, etc. can be used in curbing earnings management arises. This research is embarked upon to critically ascertain the extent to which these governance variables mitigate the existence of earnings management in Nigerian organizations.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following are the following questions raised.</p> <p>1.     Is there a significant relationship between board composition and earnings management?</p> <p>2.     Is there a significant relationship between audit quality and earnings management?</p> <p>3.     Is there any relationship between board effectiveness and the level of earnings management?</p> <p><strong>1.4   Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>The broad objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between earnings management and corporate governance as well as the effect of corporate governance on earnings management. The following are the specific objectives:</p> <p>1.     To ascertain if there is a significant relationship between board composition and earnings management.</p> <p>2.     To determine if there is a significant relationship between audit quality and earnings management.</p> <p>3.     To find out if there is a significant relationship between board effectiveness and earnings management.</p> <p><strong>1.5   Statement of Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The following are the hypotheses that will be tested in the course of the study and they are stated in their null and alternate forms.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis One</strong></p> <p><strong>HO:   </strong>There is no significant relationship between the proportion of independent board of directors and earnings management.</p> <p><strong>HI:    </strong>There is significant relationship between the proportion of independent board of directors and earnings management.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis Two</strong></p> <p><strong>HO:</strong>   There is no relationship between audit quality and earnings management</p> <p><strong>HI:</strong>    There is relationship between audit quality and earnings management</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis Three</strong></p> <p><strong>HO:</strong>   There is no significant relationship between the board effectiveness and earnings management.</p> <p><strong>HI:</strong>    There is significant relationship between the board effectiveness and earnings management.</p> <p><strong>1.6   Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>1.     The research work is relevant to investors in carrying out investment decisions in relation to organizations as the variables affecting earnings management can be used to detect the presence of opportunistic earnings management in an organization and also whether to invest in such organization or not.</p> <p>2.     The work will enlighten financial analyst about the likelihood of the occurrence of earnings management in organizations. It will also serve as a guide to financial analyst in making recommendations to its client about investment decisions with respect to the reported earnings of firms.</p> <p>3.     It will assist managers in knowing the consequent effect of the practice of earnings management on the goodwill of the organization and the investing public.</p> <p>4.     It will assist policy makers in formulating policies that will enable organizations adopt a more rigid corporate governance hence, reducing the practice of earnings management.</p> <p>5.     Subsequent researchers and academicians will find the research work useful by using it as a guide and reference point in carrying out further studies.</p> <p><strong>1.7   Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study basically seeks to investigate the relationship between earnings management and corporate governance among quoted companies on Nigerian Stock Exchange. Hence, the population of the study is the total 210 companies listed on Nigerian Stock Exchange while the sample consist of twenty selected companies listed on Nigerian Stock Exchange between 2006 and 2015.</p> <p><strong>1.8   Limitations to the Study</strong></p> <p>The population is not adequately represented as a result of the smallness of the sample size and the sample period covered. Also, the limited number of variables used for the research work poses a limitation to the study as a larger number would help elucidate the significance of corporate governance in curbing earnings management. Finally, inability to use a wider geographical scope as the study is limited to companies operating in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.9   Definition of Terms       </strong></p> <p><strong>Earning Quality: </strong>Earning quality simply mean the degree to which management’s choices of accounting estimate can affect imported income (thus choice occurs every period) some of such estimate may be difficult quantify given the company the lee way (opportunity) to report a wide range of periodic earnings.</p> <p><strong>Corporate Governance: </strong>Corporate governance is a combination of laws, regulations, listing rules and voluntary private sector practices that enable the corporation to attract capital, perform effectively, generate profit and meet both legal obligation and general societal expectation. It is all the corporation relationship among capital, product, services and even society at large.</p> <p><strong>Performance Management:</strong> This is a process for establishing a shared workforce understanding about what is to be achieved in an organization level. It is about aligning the organization objectives with the employees agreed measures, skills, competency requirements, development plans and the delivery of results. The emphasis is on improvement in order to achieve the overall business strategy and create a high performance workforce.</p> <p><strong>Management:</strong> Is a distinct process consisting of planning, organizing, starring, directing, coordinating, reporting and budgeting, performed to determine and accomplished stated objectives with the effective use of human and other resources.</p> <p><strong>Firm:</strong> A business concern, especially one involving a partnership of two or more people. It’s a business organization, such as a corporation, Limited Liability Company.

All human beings engage in communication to sustain and improve on their existence on earth. Communication being the nerve centre of the society cuts across cultures. There is no society where communication does not exist. It is the basis for all human existence. We find ourselves either consciously or unconsciously faced with-the urge to give or receive information, express our feelings, share ideals with others. Research findings have shown that the average human. Being spends no less than 80% of his life engaged in one form of communication or another every day. Communication is therefore a social affair. It is the means by which man can function within a social framework since it is not possible for human being to exist in isolation from others.</p> <p>The term communication is derived from a Latin word ‘Communis’ which means commonness i.e. to share to make common. In communication what is shared is not seen but virtually abstract. It is psychological activity and it has to do with the mind building a bridge between or across two minds. Meaning is what we have in common in the sense that the symbols that are used in encoding the message must be understood by the interlocutors. In other words, for a particular message to be meaningful, there has to be ‘mental connectivity’ between the encoder(s) and the decoder(s) of that message when what we say is correctly or fully understood by our listener, we say there is effective communication.</p> <p>Therefore, communication is effective when the speaker and the listener share the same meaning. Communication breakdown on the other hand occurs when the listener misinterprets or gets a different meaning from that intended by the speaker.</p> <p>The ubiquitous of combination technical devices like the fax, telephone, radio, computer internet etc have further enhanced and consolidated the relevance of communication in the society. All these various device have tremendous impact in making communication between individuals and people as easy and convenient world and as fast as possible. The world has become a global village as we now say, because of the free access everyone has to information from any part of the world.</p> <ol><li><strong>MEANING</strong></li> </ol> <p>As important as communication is, scholars have defined it from different perspectives inspired by their different professions. Some of such definitions are given below.</p> <p>According to Chappell and Reed (1974), “communication is any means by which a thought is transferred from one person to another”.

It becomes the role of the manager, therefore to operate instrument of control to ensure that there is integration of the component part for goals attainment.</p> <p>        Personnel performance appraisal is one of these instruments of control.</p> <p>        The human component serves as the head as it were which circulates and energizes every subsystem of the organization as system.</p> <p>        The University of Benin was found in 1970. It started as an institute of technology and was accorded. The status of a full fledged university by National Universities Commission (NUC) on 1st July, 1971. In his budget speech in April 1972, the then military governor of mid-western state, col S.O Ogbemudia. (then also visitor to the university) formally announced the change of the name of the institute of technology to the University of Benin, on 1st April, 1975. The University at the request of the state government, was taken over by the federal government and became a federal university at the onset, the university was situated at Ekewan Road in 1972, a project to build a main campus at Ugbowo and Ekosodim governance with Engineer Daniel Uheniwen as the director. Today the main site campus, is at Ugbowo, but some courses are still offered at Ekewen campus. Today, the university has continued to grow from strength to strength with a number of faculties, department, institutes and units.</p> <p>        Following NUC’s directives, the university experimented with the collegiate system in 1971/72 and 1992/93.</p> <p>        However, the light of new developments the university reverted to the faculty system except for the Schools of Medicine, Dentistry, Basic Medical Science and Institute of child health which reverted back to the collegiate system in August, 1999 with a provost as its administrative head.</p> <p>        The faculties as presently constituted are those of Agriculture, Arts Education, Engineering, Law, Life Science, Pharmacy, Physical Science, Social Science and college of medical science (which has three schools, Basic medicine and the institute of child health). In January 2006, the federal government approved the take off of the college of petroleum and gas engineering of the University of Benin ate Effunin, near Warri in Delta state, with the initial population of hundred (100) students in two department petroleum engineering and gas engineering.</p> <p>        The university offer course at various levels, post graduate undergraduate, diploma and certificate. Presently, the total student enrolment stands at over 40,000 made of both full time and part time students share among the various faculties. So personnel performance appraisal attempt to identify, record and analyse the expectation of the organization. It is base on the assumption that members of the organization respond differently and in varying degree to stimuli to which they are exposed in their work.            </p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>        The problem of the study is whether personnel appraisal make the employee’s to put in their best in order to increase production and good rendering of services in an organization. In service sector for example rampart change of weak performance in very high among workers and there are many factors that contributed to this trend. Some of them are lack of information and skills for proper appraisal of employees. This has caused harm to the growth and development of management system in Nigeria.</p> <p>        Another problem is that some managers or personnel to follow the due process or procedure, when they are appraising the employees. They judge employees base on their personnel perception, they have employee’s who have caused harm to the organization.</p> <p>        This project is also directed at providing solution to improve and encourage proper personnel appraisal in management system in Nigeria, precisely university of Benin, Benin City, Edo state.</p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The primary objective of this study is examinational cum determination of the effect of personnel appraisal in a routinised management system in Nigeria particularly emphasis on university of Benin, Edo state.</p> <p>        The onus of this examination lies on the fact that personnel appraisal is very useful in management system in Nigeria especially the above tertiary institution mentioned for development planning as well as source of reference for further ideological endeavour for today’s generation and our good children yet unborn who might wish to narrow the spectrum of ignorance and widening that of knowledge in this area of study.</p> <p>These are some of the objectives:</p> <p>1.          To identify the relationship between personnel appraisal and employee’s performance.</p> <p>2.          To examine the usefulness of employee’s performance appraisal in an organization.</p> <p>3.          to determine if there is need adapting the use of management by objective (MBO) techniques in employee’s performance appraisal.</p> <p>4.          To examine the role of personnel management in achieving organizational goal by utilizing employee’s performance appraisal.</p> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>The following research question where develop by the researcher.</p> <p>1.          Is there any relationship between personnel appraisal and employee’s performance?</p> <p>2.          What are the usefulness of employee’s performance appraisal in an organization?</p> <p>3.          Is there any need of adapting management by objective (MBO) techniques in appraising employee’s performance?</p> <p>4.          Does personnel management effectively utilizes employee’s performance in achieving organizational?</p> <p><strong>1.5   SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The research work is delimited in scope to include only the selected institution, university of Benin, Benin City, Edo state.

If various individuals in an organization cannot work as a group, then the organization’s performance-both financial and operational will never be maximized. Group efforts and team work is the major ingredient in every successful organization, hence, the need to make sure that the personality of every member in the group is okay for group/organizational goals to be achieved. Without good personalities in a group, there can never be a good group.</p> <p>The researcher used Ghana National Fire Service (Eastern Regional Office), as a case study to find out the effects of personality on group performance, as well as solutions to these negative effects.</p> <p>Concerning methodology, data used in compiling this research were gathered from both primary and secondary sources. The management and employees of Ghana National Service (Eastern Regional Office) were issued questionnaires. Text Books, Magazines and News Papers on personalities, groups and individual psychology were also used in compiling this research.</p> <p>Based on the findings revealed from the data analysis and interpretation, the researcher came up with some suggestions and recommendations. The major findings in this study include: the various personalities exhibited by employees in a group, and there are: the openness personality, conscientiousness personality, extraversion personality, and agreeableness personality. The negative effects of personality on group performance, which are: poor performance, delayed output, and incomplete output. The research also went ahead to find ways to improve group performance. These findings and recommendations, in view of the researcher, will help improve group performance in various business organizationsin Ghana, if implemented by mangers of various business organizations.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER I</strong></p> <p><strong>   INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The desire to build a sound conducive environment for an organization is the desire of every loyal employee of an organization. Personalities of employees can take an organization to greater heights, above its competitors, and at the same way, bad personalities can bring down the organization. Intelligence and emotional quotient which basically forms an employee’s personality type must be balanced, for the employee to act effectively and easily relate with his/her job, and other employees in a cordial way. However, an employee will not be able to work in a group/team if the employee does not posses a good personality. When this occurs, group efforts and performance tends to fail, thereby reducing the performance of the organization as a whole.</p> <p>However, this research was undertaken to help enlighten organizations of the various personality types employees in an organization might posses, and to suggest ways in which an organization can increase performance. Various personality issues, personality types and threats and its effects on group performance are highlighted in this study.</p> <p>1.1<strong>BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>After a thorough research on the group performances of organizations in Ghana, it became evident that individual personality and contribution played a lot of role in the success or failure of the group, hence needed much attention because; team work is the major ingredient for increased and high performances in every organization.</p> <p>The main reason for initiating this project is to research on the various personality types and traits of employees in an organization in Ghana, throw more light on the effects of these traits on group performance, and proffer solutions as well as recommendations for managers of various organizations in Ghana to deliberate upon and make informed decisions.</p> <p>The study started with casual discussion among employers and employees of various business organizations concerning their views on group performances in organizations in Ghana and their expectations. It later developed into a full research when the researcher developed more interest in the topic, and decided to get more information from more employees, government agencies, and other secondary documentations.</p> <p>The Ghana National Fire Service was established by Act 537, (GNFS Act of 1997) to give a broad objective and prevention and management of undesired fires and other related matters. To achieve this objective, the service is expected to perform the following functions:</p> <ul><li>To organize public fire education programs.</li> <li>To create and sustain awareness of the hazards of fire.</li> <li>To heighten the role of the individual in the prevention of fires.</li> <li>To provide technical advice for building plans in respect of machinery and structural layouts to facilitate escape from fire, rescue operations and fire management.</li> <li>To inspect and offer technical advice on fire extinguishers.</li> <li>To co-ordinate and advice on the training of personnel in fire fighting departments institutions in the country.</li> <li>To train and organize fire volunteer squads at community level.</li> <li>To offer rescue and evacuation services to those trapped by fire or in other emergency situations, and</li> <li>To undertake any other function incidental to the objective of the service.</li> </ul> <p><br/>1.2<strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Based on previous studies conducted on personality and group performance, it is clear that most group (especially homogeneous groups) efforts fail in most organizations, due to individual personalities in the group. Individual differences, inefficiency, and ineffectiveness cause most group tasks to fail. A study conducted by Rutherford (2006) indicates that for complex problem solving, groups made up of different types of individuals with a variety of skills, knowledge, abilities and perspectives are more effective than groups that are more homogeneous.</p> <p>One of the reasons for creating a group is for individuals or employees to showcase their skills and to contribute in the development of an organization or to achieve the group’s goals. But some individual’s personality affects or influences the effectiveness of the group or team. Since various personalities are involved in a team it may lead to lack of harmony and trust between individuals in the sense that there will be the limitation of information because of the different personalities that are involved.</p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main aim of this study is to examine various personality traits of individuals in a group and its effects on group performance.Hence the objectives of the study are outlined as follows:</p> <ol><li>To identify the various personality traits exhibited by employees in a group.</li> <li>To identify the negative effects of personality traits on group performance in an organization.</li> <li>To identify ways of improving group performance in an organization.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p> In order to achieve the objectives stated above, the following research questions were used as a guide in achieving the objectives of this research:</p> <ol><li>What are the various personality traits that are exhibited by employees in a group?</li> <li>What are the negative effects of personality trait on group performance?</li> <li>How can group performance be improved in an organization?</li> </ol> <p>1.5<strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The end product of this research shall be relevant to so many groups. It will serve as a guide to employees who engage in group assignments in various organizations such as the Ghana fire service. It shall also be relevant to professional groups for research and academic purposes to know more about the effect of personality on group or team performance and to the general public.</p> <p>1.6<strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of the research is limited to the analysis of the big five personality trait proposed by Lewis Goldberg. This research is also centered on Ghana National Fire Service, since its operations are mostly executed in groups. The Eastern Regional Branch of the Ghana national Fire Service was used as the major case study for this study.</p> <p><strong>1.7 TIME FRAME</strong></p> <p>This study lasted for five months before it was complete. The study lasted from August 2011 to December 2011.</p> <p><strong> 1.8 LIMITATION</strong></p> <p>The only limitation faced by the researcher in the course of carrying out this study was the delay in getting data from the various respondents. Most respondents were reluctant in filling questionnaires administered to them due to their busy schedules and nature of their work. The researcher found it difficult to collect responses from the various respondents, and this almost hampered the success of this study.</p> <p><strong>1.9 CHAPTER SCHEME</strong></p> <p>Chapter one of this study includes the general introduction, background information about the study, statement of the problem, objectives of the study, research questions, scope of the study, significance of the study, and the limitation of the study.</p> <p>Chapter two reviews all relevant literatures relating to the study as well as the researcher’s views concerning previous studies on personality and group performance.</p> <p>Chapter three includes the methodology applied in collecting and analyzing data, population definition, study site, and limitations.</p> <p>Chapter four presents the results of the study as well as data analyzed, and the interpretation of the analyzed data.</p> <p>Chapter five includes a summary of the study, conclusion and recommendations based on the findings from the study.</p>\n\nPERSONALITY AND ITS EFFECT ON GROUP PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PERSONALITY AND ITS EFFECT ON GROUP PERFORMANCE", "id": 41}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p> PA can improve motivation and performance, but if used inappropriately, it can have disastrous effects (Fisher <em>et al</em>, 2003). For PA to be effective, it must of necessity be anchored on the performance criteria that have been outlined for the job. Riggio (2003) describes performance criteria as the means for determining successful or unsuccessful job performance. They are one of the products of a detailed job analysis. Performance criteria spell out the specific elements of a job and make it easier to develop the means of assessing levels of successful or unsuccessful job performance. It can thus be inferred that an appraisal system not hinged on this all important criteria, can neither be appropriate nor fair, particularly to the employee, whose performance is being evaluated. In fact, some key points in the arguments of those opposed to performance appraisal is that, most of the time, wrong things are rated and the wrong methods used (Deming, 1986; Gilliland and Langdon, 1998).PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL</p> <p>Situations arise whereby only some selected job elements are evaluated or given preference or higher points above other job elements in which the employee was equally engaged during the review period. This calls to</p> <p>question the fairness of the appraisal system and its ability to effectively produce the desired outcomes. Mickerney (1995) underscored the intricacy of PA by describing it as a difficult and complex activity which is often not performed well by many organizations. The end result of this is that it produces exactly the opposite effect to those intended (Coleman, 1995).</p> <p>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>In Nigeria today, the general state of poverty makes economic reward a very important reason why people go out to work, thereby making money to rank highly as a critical motivator (Muo, 2007).This situation has made it imperative for Nigerian workers to pay particular attention to human resource (HR) practices which have direct bearing on their financial rewards and social status. One of such HR activities is performance appraisal (PA), which is the focus of this study.</p> <p>A major outcome of PA is promotion and its attendant increase in financial benefits plus enhanced professional and social status (Tessema and Soeters, 2006; Shahzad, Bashir and Ramay, 2008). Performance appraisal outcomes tend to have high motivational impact and are a major determinant of employee performance.</p> <p>It must be emphasized that an effective performance appraisal system is one that takes cognizance of all the components of an employee’s job performance, and does not focus on selected ones.</p> <p> If used effectively, PA can improve motivation and performance, but if used inappropriately, it can have disastrous effects (Fisher <em>et al</em>, 2003). For PA to be effective, it must of necessity be anchored on the performance criteria that have been outlined for the job which in many case is overlooked. Riggio (2003) describes performance criteria as the means for determining successful or unsuccessful job performance. They are one of the products of a detailed job analysis. Performance criteria spell out the specific elements of a job and make it easier to develop the means of assessing levels of successful or unsuccessful job performance.

According to Mullins (2002), the underlying objective of PA, is to improve the performance of the individual employee, thereby leading to improvement in the performance of the organization as a whole. PA is one of the ranges of tools that can be used to manage performance effectively, in that it provides data which feeds into other elements of the performance management process. As noted by Mathis and Jackson (2008), a PA system is often the link between additional pay and rewards that employees receive, and their job performance.</p> <p><strong>Motivation</strong></p> <p>Armstrong (2012) defines motivation as the force that energizes, directs, and sustains behaviour. It is concerned with the strength and direction of behavior, and the factors that influence people to behave in certain ways. Mathis and Jackson (2008) view motivation as the desire within a person that causes that person to act in order to reach a goal. Robbin (2000), offered a specific work-related definition of motivation as the willingness to exert high levels of effort towards organizational goals, conditioned by the effort and ability to satisfy some individual need. Roy (2001) defined work motivation as a process of energizing employees to the work goals through a specific path.</p>\n\nAN APPRAISAL OF PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL TECHNIQUES ON EMPLOYEE MOTIVATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN APPRAISAL OF PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL TECHNIQUES ON EMPLOYEE MOTIVATION", "id": 42}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is examining the relationship between casualization and employee commitment in Etisalat Nigeria. Allen and Meyer (1996) defined employee commitment as “a psychological status of an employee towards the organization that makes it less likely that the employee will voluntarily leave the organization” Lower levels of employee commitment amongst casual employees may arise because of the precarious nature of their employment (Campbell, 1996). Dessler et al, 2004) posited that “people have a psychological reference point to their place of employment. Once you put them in the temporary category, you are saying they are expendable and therefore they are less likely to exhibit loyalty and commitment to their organizations”.</p> <p>Employee commitment has benefits for employers and employees (Mowday, 1998). For employees, commitment to work and in an organization represents a positive relationship that could ‘potentially add meaning to life’, whereas, for employers, having committed employees has the potentials for increased performance and reduced turnover and absenteeism. Employee commitment has also been linked tentatively to an organization’s efficiency, productivity, creativity and innovation (Mir, Mir &amp; Mosca, 2002) as well as its profitability (Raab &amp; McCain, 2002).</p> <p>One of the few strong links in the literature is that between employee commitment to an organization and staff turnover. As Allen and Meyer explained ‘employee who are strongly committed are those who are least likely to leave the organization’ (1990).</p> <p>The traditional industrial relations system based on the concept of full-time employees working within an organization is increasingly being challenged by the use of nonstandard work arrangements by employers. This changing nature of work has taken a new dimension with the adoption of flexible work arrangements by many firms globally. The theme running through many of the new approaches to management in today’s globalized economy is the development of a more flexible workforce which has become employers‟ new frontier in the management of human resources. However, these changing patterns of work (e.g. casual, contract, temporary, part-time employments, subcontracting, outsourcing/insourcing etc.) occasioned by Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAP), have created concerns for workers and trade unions alike, especially in Nigeria. Job security, social security, terminal benefits and minimum conditions of work are some of the issues of concern. The push toward casualisation in Nigeria is evident of a continued effort by government and corporate elites to maximize profit at the expense of a long-term jobs policy, transparent governance and shared economic development. Casualization is a great malady that has engulfed the Nigerian workplace and banking and telecommunication sector in particular.</p> <p>Casualisation as a form of labour practice has been defined by most management writers as the process by which employment shifts from a preponderance of full time and permanent positions to higher levels of casual positions. It can also be viewed as an employment of an irregular or intermittent nature (Rodriguez, 2009).</p> <p>This is sometimes caused by some kinds of workplace politics which is the use of power within an organization for the pursuits of agendas and self-interest without regard to their effect on the organization’s efforts to achieve its goals. Some of the personal advantages may include access to tangible assets or intangible benefits such as status or pseudo-authority that influences the behavior of others. Both individual and groups may engage in this kind of act which can be highly destructive, as people focus on personal gains at the expense of the organization.</p> <p>In life, one is suppose to either move horizontally or vertically but most telecommunication companies have forced their casual staff to remain static. As there is neither promotion nor increment in their salaries. Casual staff in most cases spends 15 – 20 years in the same employment status/designation. The worst is the disdain treatment casual staff are subjected to by some of the company’s so-called full staff. They are treated as inferior beings and demoralized.</p> <p>Casual staff in companies is the grievous of all form of modern slavery. It is an aberration and infradignity for two set of employees one casual, the other ‘full staff’ to be performing the same job functions and at the end of the day, the ‘so-called full staff’ is paid higher remunerations, promoted, given the opportunities for further trainings and development in order to advance on the job while the other ‘casual staff’ is totally neglected. Experience abound whereby two individual who where employed in the same company, on the same day though in different employment tactics (i.e. full staff and casual), within the space of 10 years, the fellow employed as a full staff had risen to become a Manager while the other fellow employed as casual staff still remains at the same entry point/level where he was employed 10 years back. The only sin the latter committed was probably because he was a polytechnic graduate and was employed as casual staff.</p> <p>Etisalat Nigeria, the case study in this research is owned by Emirates Telecommunications Corporation, branded trade name Etisalat is a multinational UAE based telecommunications services provider, currently operating in 18 countries across Asia, the Middle East and Africa. As of February 2014, Etisalat is the 13th largest mobile network operator in the world, with a total customer base of more than 167 million. Etisalat was named the most powerful company in the UAE by Forbes Middle East in 2012</p> <p>Etisalat Nigeria is now in business for the last seven years and is one of the country's fastest growing network with over 23 million subscribers. Etisalat Nigeria provides network coverage in all 36 states of the federation (rolled out in under one-and-a-half years) covering most of the population, and has deployed more than 2,000 km of fibre to support broadband development. The company has a track record of introducing innovative products for mobile banking, which have made financial transactions convenient for customers and helped foster entrepreneurialism.</p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Casualization goes beyond Nigeria and beyond telecommunication companies. Around the world in nearly every economic sector, good jobs are falling prey to corporate cost-cutting moves at the expense of working families. Too many jobs are being outsourced, contracted out, or reclassified under a barrage of legal definitions designed to keep pay down, benefits low, and unions out. Casualization of employment is growing at an alarming rate. More and more workers in permanent employment are losing their jobs and are being re-employed as or replaced by casual or contract workers. This state of affairs is viewed as employers’ strategies to cut cost; maximize profit and subject the employees under economic captivity. Casual work which is supposed to be a form of temporary employment has acquired the status of permanent employment in many organizations in Nigeria without the statutory benefits associated with permanent employment status. Casual workers are subject to lower pay, barred from their right to join a union, and denied medical and other benefits. Companies have devised antics by often hiring several part-time workers instead of one or two full-time workers to avoid their obligation to provide benefits, to divide the workforce, and to dissuade unionizing efforts. However, this research is out to find out the effect of this unfair casualization of staffs by some management of companies on the employee commitment.</p> <p><strong>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The general objective of this study is to analyze the effect of casualization on employee commitment in Etisalat Nigeria while the following are the specific objectives:</p> <ol><li>To examine the effect of casualization on employee commitment in Etisalat Nigeria.</li> <li>To determine the different causes of employee casualization.</li> <li>To examine the effect of casualization of organizational performance and productivity.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4     RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <ol><li>What is the effect of casualization on employee commitment in Etisalat Nigeria?</li> <li>What are the different causes of employee casualization?</li> <li>What is the effect of casualization of organizational performance and productivity?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5     HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p><strong>Hypothesis One</strong></p> <p>HO1: There is no significant relationship between casualization and employee commitment in Etisalat Nigeria.</p> <p>HA1: There is significant relationship between casualization and employee commitment in Etisalat Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis two</strong></p> <p>HO2: There is no significant relationship between casualization and organizational performance and productivity in Etisalat Nigeria.</p> <p>HA2: There is significant relationship between casualization and organizational performance and productivity in Etisalat Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <ol><li>The outcome of this study would enable the researcher to understand better the casualization and employee commitment in the telecommunication sector of Nigeria and also determined the extent to casualization has affected organizational performance and productivity in Etisalat Nigeria.</li> <li>At the social level, results from this study would enable the people express their views on casualization and employee commitment and the effect of this precarious trend on the employees, employers and the society at large. Academically, it would be a reference point for further research in this area of study, it will add to the body of existing knowledge in the field of Human Resource Practices as regards casualized employment tactics by organizations.

It elucidates the structure of management by objective through the systematic and organized approach that allows management to focus on achievable goals and attain best possible results from available resources. </p> <p>It provides detail analysis of organization performance measures as the overall central focus of management by objective. In-view of analyzing a practical perspective, a case study is conducted using the United Bank for Africa Plc.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The imperative of attaining organizational performance objectives constitute a fundamental phenomenon for the management of modern organization. Therefore strategic measures are constantly formulated and implemented bottom-line to achieve key results. Management by objective is one type of management philosophy adopted to ensure  that organizational programme objectives or results are attainable.</p> <p>Peter Drucker (19454) defined management by objective as a dynamic system which seeks to integrate the company need to clarify and achieve its profit and growth goals with the managers need to contribute and develop him. Drucker first publicized these ideas in the practice of management in 1954 subsequently, MBO has been canvassed by other writers notably, McGregor and Humble. McGreor in the Human side of enterprise supported MBO on the grounds that it gave subordinate the opportunity to participate in good setting and performance appraisal and based on a theory Y philosophy. Humble in Improving Management Performance suggests that MBO focus on the key results areas where improved performance is likely to have a dramatic impact on organization performance. However, all writes are careful to emphasize two points first that MBO is not a management technique but a philosophy which if accepted requires a shift of managerial attitudes and perspective; second that MBO needs to be integrated with other organizational procedure and notably the budgeting process, performance appraisal, management development and management reward.</p> <p>Management by objective (MBO) also known as management by results (MBR) is a process of defining objectives within an organization so that management and employees agree to the objectives and understand what they need to do in the organization in order to achieve them. The term, management by objective was first popularized by Peter Drucker in his 1954 book, the practice of management.</p> <p>The essence of MBO is participative goal setting, choosing course of actions and decision making. An important part of MBO is the measurement and the comparison of the employee actual performance with the standards set. Ideally when the employees themselves have been involved with the goal setting and choosing the course of action to be followed by them, they are more likely to fulfill their responsibilities.</p> <p>According to George S. Odiorne,  the system of management by objectives can be described as a process where the superior and subordinate jointly identify its common goals, define each individuals major areas of responsibility in-terms of the results expected of him and use these measures as guides for operating the unit and assessing the contribution of each of its members.</p> <p>Objectives can be set in all domain of activities (production, marketing, services, sales, human resources, finance, information system etc).</p> <p>Some objectives are collected for a whole department  in the whole company, other can be individualized.</p> <p>Managers must determine the mission and the strategy goals of the enterprise.</p> <p>The goal set by top level managers are based on the analysis of what can and should be accomplished by the organization within a specific period of time.</p> <p>The functions of these managers can be centralized by appointing a project manager who can monitor and control activities of the various departments. If this cannot be done or is not desirable each manager’s contributions to the organizational goal should be clearly spelled out. Objective need quantifying and monitoring. Reliable management information systems are needed to establish relevant objectives and monitor their reach ratio in an objective way. Pay incentive (bonuses) are often linked to results in reaching the objectives.</p> <p>The case study analysis shall aim to determine the impact of MBO on organizational performance of UBA Plc.   </p> <p>1.2     <strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Historical management perspective has been on achieving organizational performance objectives reflected on profit, growth and market value. In spite of developments in various sector of the economy as technology advancement, industrial revolution, advance in production and commercial activities, the complex nature of Trade Union and industrial relation, the fact remains that organization are constantly seeking new ways and ideology to ensure that resources are maximally utilized and that set goals and objectives are achieved.</p> <p>MBO was first published by Peter Drucker in 1954 in the practice of management. One of the core ideas in MBO was where managers should focus their time and energy. According to Drucker effective MBO managers focus on result not the activity. They delegate tasks by negotiating a contract of objectives with their subordinates and by refraining from dictating a detailed road map for implementation. MBO is about setting roles and their breaking these down into more specific objectives or key result MBO involves (1) Setting company – mid goals derived from corporate strategy (2) Determining team and department level goals (3) Collaboratively setting individual – level goals that are aligned with corporate strategy (4) Developing an action plan and (5) Periodically reviewing performance and revising goals. Greenwood R. G. (1981), Management by objectives Pg. 225 – 230.</p> <p>The broader principle behind MBO is to make sure that everybody within the organization has a clear understanding of the organization’s goal as well as awareness of their own roles and responsibilities in achieving objectives that will help to attain those goals. The complete MBO system aims to get managers and empower employees acting to implement and  achieve that plans which automatically achieves the organizations goal.</p> <p>In-view of the result oriented nature of MBO as a management philosophy. It spurs the researcher to conduct a study of this nature to determine the impact of management by objective on organizational performance using UBA as a case study.   </p> <p><strong>1.3    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>There has been an increasing challenge in many organization to achieve corporate organization objective due to mobility to maximally utilize its human resources. Many firms have focused on central management with total neglect and lack of integration of low level employees in the corporate plans and objectives. The resultants effect as been that of lack of understanding, interpretation and implementation of such plans and objective loading to poor organizational performance.</p> <p>          The research therefore is confronted with the problem of determining the impact of management by objective (MBO) in organizational performance with a case study on UBA Plc.</p> <p><strong>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The research Questions include;</p> <p>1.       What is the nature of management by objective and what is the nature of MBO in UBA</p> <p>2.       What constitute organizational performance and organizational performance in UBA Plc</p> <p>3.       What is the impact of management by objective on organizational performance and what is the impact of MBO in organizational performance in UBA Plc.</p> <p><strong>1.5    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The objectives of the study consist of;</p> <p>1.       to provide a detail analysis of the concept of management by objectives and organizational performance</p> <p>2.       To determine the structure and process of management by objectives</p> <p>3.       To determine the nature of organizational performance measure</p> <p>4.       To determine the impact of MBO in organizational performance</p> <p>5.       To determine the nature of MBO in UBA Plc</p> <p>6.       To determine the organizational performance standards in UBA Plc</p> <p>7.       To determine the impact of MBO in organizational performance in UBA Plc.</p> <p><strong>1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The significance of the study includes;</p> <p>1.       To show the importance of employee involvement in the planning process and objective setting in the organization</p> <p>2.       TO provide a study framework upon which managers could build upon to derive maximum employee performance in achieving objectives.</p> <p>3.       To provide a detailed analysis of the concept of MBO as it could be applied in situation of organizations employee poor performance.</p> <p>4.       To provide information source for administration, consultants as well as Human Resources Personnel.</p> <p><strong>1.7    STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>1.       Ho      There is no organizational performance standard in UBA Plc</p> <p>          H1      There is organizational performance standard in UBA Plc    </p> <p>2.       Ho      (MBO) Management by objectives is not given significant attention in                 UBA Plc</p> <p>          H1      (MBO) Management by objectives is given significant attention in                        UBA Plc</p> <p>3.       Ho      Management by objective has no significant impact on organizational           performance in UBA Plc</p> <p>H1      Management by objective has significant impact on organizational performance in UBA Plc</p> <p><strong>1.8    SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>  The study provides detail analysis of the concept of MBO, its process and significance.

As a result of this, various rules, regulations and instructions are instituted to guide public officers in the proper conduct of the finance entrusted in their care. The constitution generally sets out total financial management and accounting of the public funds which has been in demand to the public sector more so the rendering or proper stewardship of income and expenditure of public funds.</p> <p>Management involves responsibility of effective and economically planning and regulation of the operation of the operation of an enterprise which entails controls of the established pattern of accountability over receipts and expenditure of public funds. Public funds should be use for the public purpose so as to obtain proper value for money spent.</p> <p>Government in the recent times believes at the demand of public financial management that is by ensuring that all financial transaction are properly document and conducted in accordance with providing rules and regulation, but this has proved wrong because public funds can be and quite often sophisticated and embezzled within the frame work of laid down procedures through inflated contract and over statement of bills and the accounting system. The value of law or the system of the organization or the management that do not know and do their works. This work seeks to look into problems and stewardship being carried out.</p> <p>1.2     <strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>This research embarked upon is an impact of internal control system on government ministries i.e. the importance of internal control system in government ministries.</p> <p>This is so because the importance of an internal control unit in government ministries is for the verification of accounts, check cases of fraud and embezzlement within the ministries. But in recent times most of this controls are no longer functioning as it seems inevitable resulting to misappropriation of funds in such ministries.</p> <p>The study would address the following research problems:</p> <ol><li>What are the impacts of the internal audit unit in the ministry of finance?</li> <li>What are the relationships of the practical application of internal control in Kaduna state ministry of finance?</li> <li>What are the needs for internal audit unit in government ministries?</li> <li>What are the measures to be taken to provide useful recommendations where necessary to the study as related?</li> </ol> <p>1.3     <strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objective of the study is to re-examine and re-asses the general financial administration and control system as regard the ministry over revenue and expenditure. It is also to take the various measures, techniques and professionalism used to check the activities of the ministry in such away as to give it the desired attention, remuneration and compensation. More, so as related to the execution, the research is intended to result in determining the effectiveness, efficiency and economical utilization of source resources using public opinion as part of financial administrative control techniques so as to achieve the desired result. The result will help in harmonizing the relationship of the ministry and public so that proper utilization of the public funds is achieved.</p> <p>The research work carried out the impact of internal control system for effective financial management in the Kaduna State Ministry of finance. The following objectives are the bases for the ministry;</p> <p>i.        Analyzing the impact of an internal audit unit in Kaduna state ministry of finance.</p> <p>ii.       To relate the impact to its practical application in Kaduna State Ministry of Finance.</p> <p>1.4     <strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>The research is intended to investigate the impact of internal control system in the circumstances of embezzlement and fraud detection in the ministry of finance.</p> <p>Therefore the data to be collected in this exercise will be used to test the following hypothesis.</p> <p><strong>H1</strong>: Effective internal control system can help to prevent and detection of fraud in the finance ministries.</p> <p><strong>H0</strong>: That effective internal control system may not help to prevent and</p> <p>Research is poised to confirm true or otherwise, to achieve this purpose the research has formulated the above hypothesis. That the general financial management and control system as regard revenue and expenditure is effective, efficient and technical. Also the general financial management and control system as related to the public opinion is inadequate, ineffective, and this lacks improvement in its operation achievements which will hinder general development.</p> <p> detect fraud in the ministry of finance.</p> <p>1.5     <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The importance of the study is not related to the general public wishing to known that improvement would be made of the system where there are loop holes. It also seeks to identify problems associated with the general financial management and control system in order to help in harmonizing relationship of the inadequate financial resources with the general development. It will help in planning, controlling, modeling analyzing and decision making.</p> <p>The internal audit unit is the most integral part of the internal control system in the organization. Therefore, there is need for proper organization of the internal and audit system. This research work will give a prospective view as to how the internal audit could be organized in order to keep the activities in order.</p> <p>This study will also be of help to the ministry and other related organizations as to show errors and frauds and other irregularities could be easy or easily detected and prevented. It is a strong feature of any successful business. An organization could be easily detected and prevented. It is a strong feature of any successful business. An organization with in effective internal control system will find it very difficult to protect and properly manage its funds.</p> <p>1.6     <strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study work is to look into the relationship at the public with the financial management control system of the ministry being administered. The subject of financial management is external or extremely broad and complex, the deficiency of the field is compounded by the fact that it can be approached in a variety of ways i.e. descriptive, theoretical, analytical or appreciative; for the purpose of this project these areas may not be correct completely. A situation helps greatly in the success of the study, so this study is being under light and hard financial situation.</p> <p>Thus, the study encountered obstacles which militated its scope such as:</p> <p>-        This study would require a longer period of time than the time allowed for the study.</p> <p>-        Also the financial situation will make it hard to meet up with the traveling fees to where vital information is forgotten.</p> <p>-        Also there will be lack of cooperation from the public and staff concerned. People will deliberately refuse to give out required information out of ignorance and fear of revealing the secret of the cheque as pertaining financial data.</p> <p>The study being subjected to various newsletters, journal, public broadcasting etc where vital information is likely to be obtained i.e. in this present democratic system of government. </p> <p>Accessibility to data: the research could not have access to all the needed data from the organization classified, confidential secret etc. this hindered collecting of adequate information for the preservation of future data. The books available are outdated and as such one is forced to rely on external sources for the purpose of research. This caused a delay in the work of this.</p> <p>1.7     <strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF KADUNA MINSTRY OF FINANCE.</strong></p> <p>The historical record of the ministry of finance, Kaduna dated back to the time of Northern Nigeria Region government with the headquarters in Kaduna. When in 1967 the General Yakubu Gowon Administration created 12 states in the country, the ministry became the North central states ministry of finance.</p> <p>In 1976, the state was renamed Kaduna State without any change in status and thus the ministry came to be known as the ministry of Finance Kaduna. The creation of Katsina state out of the distinct Kaduna state in 1987 brought about a change in status of the state but the ministry remained as the Kaduna state ministry of finance.</p> <p><strong>PRINCIPAL FUNCTIONS</strong></p> <p>The Kaduna state ministry of finance is saddled with the responsibilities, which concern aspect of finances which include, among others, the following:</p> <p>1.       Custody and maintenance of records of public funds.</p> <p>2.       Disbursement of funds from the consolidated revenues and other public funds.</p> <p>3.       Maintenance of records and preparation of annual accounts of the state government.</p> <p>4.       Control of the state treasury</p> <p>5.       Public debt servicing and repayment</p> <p>6.       Handles matters relating to losses of funds and stores.</p> <p>7.       Supervising ministry as far as issue of finance is concerned in the state.</p> <p>8.       Maintenance of government vehicles register and serve as centre for central stores purchases.</p> <p>9.       Board of survey and enquires (including disposal of boarded vehicles, equipment and stores).</p> <p>10.     Stores administration and management</p> <p>11.     Review of financial instructions, stores regulation and their enforcement.</p> <p>12.     Control and deployment of accounting and stores staff including recruitment and training programmed.</p> <p>13.     Maintenance of relationship with other state governments and financial institutions.</p> <p>1.8     <strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>It is intended that the following terms are going to be used from time to time in this book.

But to gain maximally from their services, it is necessary to   pay much attention to the relationship that should exist between the human being and the content of the jobs.</p> <p> It is common feature that employees in organization from time to time develop some kind of attitude about their job, pay supervisor, promotions, co-workers etc though the average  worker does not enjoy the privilege of having his salary up graded frequently, he finds himself daily designed by fresh financial responsibilities which he  does not envisaged and can hardly accommodate.</p> <p>This has negative effects on his morale and psychological balance leading to distributions characterized by lower productivity which will in turn affect long-term corporate goals.</p> <p>It is known that the primary reason for the existence of any business organization is profit maximization as this is what ensures the continued growth and survival of that organization. Also, there is no gain saying that of the factors of production, labour is by for the most volatile.  The volatility of  labour is not unrelated to the fact that human  being are rational, responding to a range of environment stimuli. Therefore, the most common problem faced by managers has been  how best to stimulate and motivate other employee for higher productivity.</p> <p>In the competitive world of business the efficient utilization of human resources for  profit maximization can only be attained through adequate and effective use of motivational technologies and  strategies.</p> <p> To achieve it’s pre-determined goal of profit maximization, therefore, an organization must be able to develop an organizational structure where managers supervisor can through  understand what motivate a worker to behave positive  and the mechanics of causing a change from negative be behavior to positive. This is all about employees morale in a profit driven organization.</p> <p>Employees morale consist of cognition, (knowledge, belief, expectation) emotion (likes and dislikes, feeling, sentiments) and also behvourial tendencies. Warsh  2002 defined morale as having employee feel good about working for the company and respecting it the employee with good morale likes his  work and is wiling to cooperated in moving from job to job explained Warsh.</p> <p>Employee (staff morale is more of various attitudes posses by employees partly related  to specific factors like wages, supervision, conditions of works, recognition of ability  fair evaluation of work, steadiness of employment, prompt settlement of grievances, advancement opportunities, social relationship on the job, fair treatment by employers, other factors include labour/social activities temperament, level of aspiration, employee age, desire health, social status and industries are mush concerned with the level employee morale because these attitude have been shown to be strongly   related to objective measures like performance since “A happy worker is a productive worker.</p> <p>Therefore, this research is going to look into morale of employee in a profit oriented organization.                                                          </p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>However large or small company or business is it is employee at all levels that can make or break it. This holds true not only for the employee organization hire on a regular basis but also for temporary and casual workers. It is  as important to research and study the needs, drives and expectations of people, the organization hire or employ and aim at responding to an satisfying them, as it is with regard to customers.</p> <p>In actual fact considering the role each employee play in s company’s success, analyzing and planning and adequate response to employees motivation deserves first place in the order of business.</p> <p>Before going any further, let us shift our approach from grouping people the generic  category of employee to individual human beings and term them as hired workers. This is what they are we must acknowledge them as human beings with individual needs, driven, characteristic/personalities and acknowledge their contribution to the business success.</p> <p>Though each person has specific needs, desire, characteristic personalities, aspirations, and capabilities, at  varying degrees of intensity people’s basic needs are the  same as illustrated by Abraham Maslow (Hierarchy of needs). Experience has shown that man always behaves in a way that will lead him to attain some goal. It is not always that the specific goal may be consciously known. This is why  man ponder over their past  behaviour and wonder why they ever took such actions. The urge or  drives that induce or motivate individual behavioural pattern are mostly sub-conscious.</p> <p>Having known the relationship that   exist between individual morale of employees and (productivity) profit, then what is important to a manager is how  he/she can understand predict and /or cause a change in the activities of his subordinates. Certainly, this cannot be done  unless the manager knows which motivate or needs that can induce his subordinates to take certain actions at any given time.</p> <p>Therefore, the focus of this research will be on the analysis of morale in profit oriented organization.</p> <p>This study will enable management to know how best to deal with the human element at any point in time and under changing circumstances.</p> <p> <strong>1.3     RESEARCH OBJECTIVES.</strong></p> <p>This research have the following objective.</p> <p>1.       To know whether good working relationship between the subordinate and their superior lead to  high employee morale.</p> <p>2.       This study intends to know if greater satisfaction will  be derived by worker, if their management  gives them a free hand to participate in their  organization decision making than when they are allowed to participate in decision.</p> <p>3.       Whether workers would have greater morale when given recognition to heir contribution(s).</p> <p>4.       To know the effect of employee high and or low  morale on the profit level of the organization.</p> <p>5.       Recommendations will also be given on how to increase or boost the  morale of employees in a profit orientated organization.</p> <p> <strong>1.4     RELEVANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study if examined will be of immense benefit to management of organization, employees, students and the general society. To management the study will give them an indication of the general level of their employees morale in the company. It will equally indicate specific areas that can create high or low employee’s morale it will also help the management of organization by guiding them in formulating good policies for it’s personnel towards morale.</p> <p>To employees,  it is going to be a way of improving their attitude through emotional release, since they are given a chance of getting things of their chests (repressed feelings) educationally it will also serve as a continuity of study in line with the principles of science. Serving as a work of reference for other scholars who would embark on the subject matte r in future time.</p> <p>Other groups that will also benefits from this study include:<br/> i.        International organization</p> <p>ii.       General society</p> <p>iii.      Consultants etc.</p> <p> <strong>1.5     SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In this project work, the researcher decided to concentrate on corporate institution being union bank of Nigeria Plc Abakaliki branch. This study is therefore restricted to all the staff of the branch.</p> <p>The bank have been chosen because of it’s long acquaintance with the banking industry in Nigeria. They fall within first three largest bank in Nigeria (source: financial standard vol. 28, January 27 2004).</p> <p> <strong>1.6     RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In the process of carrying this research the following question will be looked into.</p> <p>1.       Does good working relationship between the employees (subordinate) and superior leads to high morale?</p> <p>2.       To what extent do workers participate in decision-making?</p> <p>3        Are the employees contributions considered and valued?</p> <p>4.       What is the effect of employees morale (whether high or low) on the organizational profit level?</p> <p> <strong>1.7     LIMITATIONS OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>In the process of carrying any research certain constraints are normally encountered this work is not an exception.</p> <p>The process of obtaining information from the bank was difficult, as the bank sensitive persons are always busy and a lot of bureaucracy was involved in releasing information. The bank only gives me access to information they felt will not affect or harm them. Financial constraint was also encountered as certain experiment that required big money was not performed.</p> <p>Time- the research work was performed on a vary limited time but all these constraints are not enough to invalidate this work.</p> <p> <strong>1.8     DEFINITION OFTERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>1.

A part from being profit oriented, organization also seek to satisfy customers want as far as possible for any organization to operate and succed it need, to work. The emphasis on employment cannot be overlooked. People work in organization for various reasons, to achieve different goals. Their motives could be primary, which is physical based, or secondary, which included the need for power achievement and affiliation, also security and status. </p> <p>Generally people join organization to attain the basic needs in life</p> <p>Normally in an organization individual are bound to advance from one level to another (higher level) this is normally called promotion.</p> <p>According to Agbo (1999) Promotion normally occurs when one is advanced to a better job items of more authority responsibility, more privileges higher status, greater potentials and a higher pay.</p> <p>Promotion in any organization or firm is a very sensitive aspect in the study of management. the word promotion in this contact can be inter-changeable used with the word “advancement”. The basis for promotion is strictly on ground of the employees overall performance. Through, there are many other factors that affect promotion in any organization such as education background, company policy, job requirement, and accomplishment of company objective and of course, there must be a vacancy before any promotion occurs.</p> <p>Ibid (2001) quote without putting the right people in their right place, goal and objective cannot be adequately achieved by any organization.</p> <p>In this case, it is very important to promote the right people to the right place where they are able to perform to the best of their ability for effective achievement.</p> <p>Nowadays the types of work which people do may be changing as mechanization and the demands of the society dictate, but no business can exit entirely without people. Even company automated machine tool factors being planned by the Japanese will also have to employ a number of people. The objective and goal of the organization is to achieve the best or optimum result from the employee. This is imperative not only for the right but also for them to be duty integrated into the organisation.  The employees in on doubt have great potentials it they are properly trained organized, motivated for their promotion.</p> <p>This study is informed by the emphasis being place on promotion. The study will be carried out using the Alu-Aluminium Company as the case study. Alu –Aluminum MGG co was incorporated in 1990 by Ani.A (Mr.) it command operation at Bridgehead market Onitsha as a distributor of other companies, Aluminum product, later in 1993, the company acquired industrial kind at Nkpor Umuoji Road where it has the branch office, later in 1995, their company was at Enugu Abakaliki express way where the company is well equipped for the production of high quality roofing sheets and accessories with facilities for installing in all types of work..</p> <p>Since the establishment of the company a lot of promotion have been existing in the company using criteria which make the employees to be satisfied about the job.</p> <p> <strong>1.2    </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Inmost organization or a firm employees want to attain the highest rank possible and they do their possible achieve such a position. No one with further prospects just enter an organisation of firm to continue being at a particular position throughout his/her years of employment. People tend to aim or the other have use different types of system in their promotional programme. In this sensitive area of promotion it is obvious to a member of observers why it is done.</p> <p> Already there has been a lit of policy change and difference existing in organization. They do not come as a surprise due to different objectives and goals. Other, companies usually promoted. Their employees when they are found to be competent with the job in question follow:</p> <p>1.Dose Alu Aluminium Company have a formalized promotion programme</p> <p>2.What are the criteria for such promotions and dose the company comply with it?</p> <p>3. Who and who are qualified ?</p> <p>4.What is the aim of the promotion programme?</p> <p> <strong>1.3  PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>1.The purposes of the present study are to ascertain to what the aluminum company installed protein programme.</p> <p>2. To verity who and are qualified to be promoted</p> <p>3. To ascertain the criteria for such promotion and if the company complies with it.</p> <p>4. TO determine the aim of the promotion programme.</p> <p>5. To make necessary recommendation.</p> <p><strong>1.3    </strong><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study concern the promoting of employees with particular reference to Alo company. Not many researchers have expended time and effort on studying or researching on this aspect of promotion in organization many have marked the important of promotion in management and regard it to a very minor and insignificant aspect and instead prefer studying the appraisal system in organization.</p> <p>However, the appraisal and promotion are is no case the same nut can said to be related or go hand in hand, because without the appraisal, promotion cannot take place effectively.</p> <p>In this study therefore the appraisal system will be looked at also the training system will also looked at.</p> <p><strong>1.4    </strong><strong>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Researchers generally are not a naturally easy job, researchers also involve in problem at all sorts and at various stage of the research.</p> <p>This becomes apparent when such is conducted in the kind of environment we are in, when everyone is not literacy and those who have different degrees of literacy. Also where there is conservation, fear and ignorance of different degrees. Degrees of unenlightened in objectives and benefits of the research to the correspondents  and researchers.</p> <p>This particular studies was constrained by the following factor:</p> <p>Preliminary investigation that affected these studies. Due to the fact that thee company is Alo company, they are very sorting so many things out.</p> <p>Initially, they are almost impossible to see in order to give me a go-ahead order. They are either not on seat or having a meeting or something.</p> <p>Hours of waiting become the constant practice without seeing them.</p> <p>RESPONDENT: questionnaires were distributed and upon the fact it was a bit difficult framing. The questions and distributing, it was worse with the attitudes of respondents</p> <p>Most had a non-challant attitude-not encourage one bit.</p> <p>SECRECY AND FEAR:  most of the employees were afraid to answer some of the question. They were wondering given me some sheet away from receiving the questionnaires.</p> <p>UNELIGHTMENT: some employees out of sheer ignorance refused the questionnaires. The degree of unlightment in the objective and benefits of research to the correspondents and researcher.   </p> <p>LECTURES AND EXAMS: in the initial state of this research, lecture were going on and attendance can noted a lot especially with the final years, and the exam shortly approaching made it quite a task and then it was rushing all the was.</p> <p>COST: As a student, the coat of the research came into play, a proper, constructive research has to be money invested to achieve a good results and as student, this was a limiting factor.</p> <p>TIME: somehow, time is an impediment in most if not all human endeavors. It is a basic constraining factor.  </p> <p> <strong>1.5    </strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <ol><li>What are the criteria for the promotion in Alo company?</li> <li>What is the aim of the promotion pragramme in the company?</li> <li>Dose the company have a formalized promotion programme?</li> <li>Who and who are qualified? </li> <li>Dose promotions have any effect on worker’s attitude?</li> </ol> <p> <strong>1.6    </strong><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>1.Ho: A lo company have not adequately provided systematic criteria on promotion.</p> <p>HI: Alo Company has adequately provided systematic criteria on promotion.</p> <p>2.

The scheme involves those extra benefits which may not necessarily be money, which emanate from the kind relationship of the employer to the employees, to supplement their usual wages, from the to time which are at most times geared purposely towards the enhancement of worker performance in the organization.</p> <p>This scheme, where in existence is very important to both the organization and the employees. From the employer’s point of view, it is anticipated that a good staff employees incentive schemes will induce the employees to work hard and improve their general attitude towards the organization. But for the employee, these benefit represent some additional right such as extra income, additional security or more desirable working conditions that should not required any additional effort.</p> <p>In business organization, employers of labour have seen in staff welfare services, as the ability to evoke commitment and co-operation of the subordinates to contribute more to the achievement of the organization goals and aspirations. This discovery has led many employers of labour to the introduction of well packaged welfare services, with the sincere belief that a good staff services, scheme will induce staff to work hard and improve the general staff moral.   </p> <p>The situation remains relatively the same but for the difference in methods of payment and apparent change in emphasis. The appraised of the staff welfare scheme are defined as “something of value, a part from the agreed regular monetary payment of salaries and wages given to staff”. This will be used as the working definition for this research work.</p> <p>Staff welfare services exist, in all cultures and in all organization and had existed at all times. They like different shapes and forms and attract different names.</p> <p>In recognition of their worker need fulfillment functions, they are variously called “welfare services” welfare benefit employees “income” or simply “supplementary compensation” pay and non wage remuneration”. As non-taxable income and expense, they are beginning to be called “indirect compensation and on tax benefit”.</p> <p>In the past, they used to be tiny bits and pieces of goodies that occasionally fell from the light tables of paternalistic employers ie when the top management, play a fatherly role of the staff.</p> <p>Its should be noted that for the company to achieve its objectives her welfare services should be adequate competitive who tailored towards the real need of the staff are directly influenced by nature quality and quantity of welfare services offered because they compare themselves with their counterparts in the organization.</p> <p>In my research work and analysis I have found that workers do prefer increases in welfare services to increase in salaries especially during the period of inflation and rising prices. Workers normally get frustrated and dissatisfied when welfare services are inadequate. But if the opposite condition prevails, workers have been observed to be satisfied and more committed to give off their best to the achievement of the company’s objectives.</p> <p> <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Often workers or employees are attracted to certain organizations not only because of the pay packets that are stated in the advert but also because of the benefits attached to them: These benefits usually include housing, transports and medical allowances to mention but a few.</p> <p>These attractions may constitute a considerable objective is which such individuals made up their mind to serve in such organization. The absence or reduction in these primary attractions of such individuals into the organization will certainly lower the morale as well as efficiency of such individual’s performance, which will in turn reflect on the organization’s productivity.</p> <p>Examples a bound where organizations in recent times, have been faced with instant agitation from the workers union and staff association, poor administration of the existing ones or total withdrawal of these benefits. These dissatisfaction expressed by the staff either on the provision or administration to staff welfare service. Activities become same serious problems, which demand my proper investigation and examination in order to find lasting solution to them. These assetions will be examined with respect to a govenrmetn owned enterprise called “THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC POWER AUTHORITY PLC, ENUGU ZONE.</p> <p> <strong>OBJECTIVE / PURPOSE OF THE STUDY    </strong></p> <p>The objective or purpose of this study is as follows:</p> <p>To ascertain whether any of the services formally by the staff in the company has been withdrawn and the reasons that necessitated they’re withdrawal.</p> <p>To ascertain whether there is other benefit which the staff demanded for effective performance of their jobs that are not yet provided.</p> <p>To ascertain the problems of any that is encounter by the company in the administration of welfare services.</p> <p>To determine the effectiveness or otherwise of staff welfare program in national electric power authority as perceived by the staff.</p> <p>To make recommendation based on this study on how to improve the provision and administration staff welfare scheme in NEPA Plc Enugu zone if need be.</p> <p> <strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In the nature of the research, students are often faced with many constraints. To evade some of these constraints, students are now required to carryout a case study where a small area will be selected for study sued as a reference point for large areas. So the scope of this study covers only a large spectrum of government owned enterprise in Nigeria called NEPA Plc Enugu zone.</p> <p>It is hoped that the study of the administration of staff welfare scheme in NEPA will serve as an eye opener to efficient administration of welfare services in other government owned companies in Nigeria.</p> <p> <strong>SIGNIFICANCES OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>The role that a comprehensive staff welfare scheme plays in the efficiency with which an average worker discharges his responsibilities and the achievement of the overall corporate of an organization cannot be under played. Organization thus, try as much as possible to attain their corporate objectives by helping their staff to accomplish their own personal objectives. This they do by setting up ideal welfare scheme for the benefit of their staff.</p> <p>In another breadth, it is a matter of curiosity to observe who might be pondering on the new welfare scheme that I would be evolved by NEPA Plc Enugu zone, considering the circumstances in which the company as a new cooperate body is formed, leaving behind tow clearly distinct staff welfare scheme.</p> <p> <strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>For the purpose of this research work the following key works are defined as follows:</p> <p><strong>STAFF</strong></p> <p>Any person who enters into a company, through an (employers) in return for wages salary or other valuable consideration. In this research work, this embraces both those ordinarily involved with the execution of the assigned work and those involved in the day decision making of the firm.</p> <p> <strong>WELFARE</strong></p> <p>Is a wide variety of services that is provided by companies for their staff, and in some cases for members of staff families.

These  figures are quite alarming and close to N100.000.00 was spent for that three  months   only.</p> <p>For the injured their families can’t be fully compensated for the loss; some are incapacitated for life and therefore can’t regain health and strength.  A part from that human suffering linked with accident cannot be over emphasized.  More so there is lot of time lost by other employee who stop work in sympathy of their injured colleagues  cost of time lost by supervisor in investigating the real cause of the accident and reporting to employers remember the saying “time lost can never be regained”</p> <p>Additional losses include lost to employer through  employee welfare and benefit system and also cost due to be loss of profit on the injured workers.</p> <p>On might be prompted to ask what really is accident well “accident has bee seen by various cadres of professionals and laymen and has been interpreted to mean unforeseen happening an unexpected occurrence which produces hurt or  loss of life.</p> <p>They do not just happen rather they are caused and at last majority of them are preventable be use of safely devices and proper working system. It is in the light of this that federal government has enacted different safety laws that would play preventive roles in reducing the rate of industrial accident.</p> <p>They include:</p> <ol><li>Work man compensation ct of 1942 </li> <li>Environment safety law (e.g. of heating and  lighting)</li> <li>total accident act of 1961</li> <li>health and safety at work act of 1974</li> <li>Nigeriafactory act of 1961 etc.</li> </ol> <p>The question is of which extent has these government laws reduced the rate of industrial accidents?</p> <p>There are still a lot of hazard in or manufacturing companies general.  J.W Boley outline that accident are caused by employee’s errors supervisor error and management  error and of course machine error. This view is supported many experts.  From what been said if proper steps are not taken to identify and forestall the cause of these hazards and prevent adequate and workable safety laws there is the tendency that the rate of fatal accidents in our manufacturing concerns would continue to be on the increase.  Thus this research work would attempt to bring out the actual causes of accidents and the frequency of occurrence.  However slight reference will be made on the legal implication of these activities.   </p> <p><strong>1.4            </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The following listed below have been considered as the objective of this prices of work.</p> <p>a) To suggest and recommend ways of reducing or out righting eliminating specific hazard and unsafe  environment characteristic</p> <p>b) To find out the cause of  industrial accidents in premier breweries PLCOnitsha.</p> <p>c)  To serve as a base for future research on industrial accident in the brewery.</p> <p>d) To highlight on the relationship between specific employees and environment characteristic and accidents behavior    </p> <p><strong>1.5            </strong><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS PERCULIAR TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>COMBUSTIBLE/ EXPLODEABLE:     </strong></p> <p>These are sudden violent bursts of materials such as gases or very hot objectives.</p> <p><strong>CRISES:   </strong></p> <p>Stage where workers performance is less  than what is expected sequel to in efficiency and improper attitude to work.</p> <p><strong>HUMAN CAUSATIVE FACTORS:</strong></p> <p>These  factors are caused of accidents attributable to human beings</p> <p><strong>HORSE PLAY:  </strong></p> <p>Rough play which could result to an injury or accident to a worker.</p> <p><strong>INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE:</strong></p> <p>Process where the work environment is kept free of infectious disease and dirt the that might arise from the nature of work.</p> <p><strong>OCCUPATION DISEASE:  </strong></p> <p>Certain disease that are inherent  in certain jobs and are likely to affect the health of persons at work place.</p> <p><strong>POLICY STATEMENT:      </strong></p> <p>Statement made by the organization in simple from explaining the intention of management and indicating all  major safety programmes  measures available stipulating how the employer and employee can ensure adequate safety.</p> <p><strong>SAFETY ENGINERRING:</strong></p> <p>Process of creating a work situation in which the efficiency and effectiveness of man and machine are maximized</p> <p><strong>USAGE ACT:</strong></p> <p>This act are due to actions taken by a person without due regard for his safety or that of his colleagues.</p> <p><strong>FATAL ACCIDENTS:</strong></p> <p>These accidents might result to loss of part of the body or even total loss (Death) to work.</p> <p> <strong>REFERENCE</strong></p> <p>Gummer J.S (1987) Protection From Accident and Noise Personnel Executive</p> <p> (Badan;) Long ManNigeriaVol 3</p> <p>Emiola A (1979)NigeriaLabour Lwa Ibadan; University Press Vol 1</p> <p>Geld W.O (1988) Legal Aspect of Industrial Safety Hand Book on Industrial</p> <p>SafetyNew YorkHasper and Row</p> <p>Akpabo E (1986) Protecting Industrial  Workers Against Health  Hazards;</p> <p>Business Time;OxfordPress; P 18</p> <p>Blake R.P (1987) Industrial Safety; South African; African- Feb Publisher; 3rd</p> <p>Edition.</p> <p>Blake R.P (1988) Industrial Safety; South African; African- Feb Publisher; 4rd</p>\n\nMANAGEMENT OF EMPLOYEE WELFARE WITH EMPHASIS ON INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS AND SAFETY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MANAGEMENT OF EMPLOYEE WELFARE WITH EMPHASIS ON INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS AND SAFETY", "id": 49}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>C<strong>HAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong> INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>          In this chapter, it is going to cover the followings: the background of the study, statement of the problem, objectives of the study, significance of the study, scope and limitations of the study  and reference.</p> <p><strong>1.1                BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          In an organizational set up, the personnel manager is expected to help formulate manpower policies. to emphasis on division of labour presently, the duty of the personnel and remunerate employees.</p> <p>          Management in an organization is affected mostly due to misplacement of workers. Constantly, due to misplacement of workers. Constantly, experts ask whether to get the individual to fit into a job position or to design the job to suit the individual.</p> <p>          From observation, the management is to determine its manpower needs, the process by which management attempts to provide for its human resources to accomplish its task is term manpower planning or employment needs planning for their manpower needs.</p> <p>          Manpower planning is necessary in all organization because it is required for recruitment, without it, it  would be difficult to know the number of personnel required for recruitment, to be reassigned, due to retirement or need to be retired for better utilization. Manpower planning reduces excessive recruitment training and transfer and thereby saves management cost and  time.</p> <p>‘Bruce’ observed that the major changes in population technological innovation, size and complexity of organizations have made informal methods of employment planning obsolete for all, but they very small and stand organization. In Nigeria where there is security of qualified manpower to fill existing positions the situation is more crucial.</p> <p>Manpower planning aid an organization to start very early to seek for the positively of the future. It also helps in utilization of personnel available efficiently and effectively. Through this way, people in the organization that needs more training could be identified to upgrade their skill in other to assume more responsible positions.</p> <p> <strong>1.2            </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The role of manpower planning development in an industry cannot be over emphasized.</p> <p>Manpower as we know refer to all human resources in an organization, efficient utilization of this human resources in an organization leads to achieving the organizational objectives. A well planned manpower recruitment and training is needed to be actualizing in order to meet its aim, but the problem has always been who is to be recruited in order to meet the demand of the organization. The recruitment jobs in face with certain problem which could be either internal or both.</p> <p>The internal influences include the nature of the organization. This could be in terms of management, applicants would not like to secure jobs in an organization where there is poor management. An organization with poor financial stand is likely to lack qualitative management. The quality of management is the primary factor in determining the degree of success of an organization.</p> <p>The nature of the work done is another problem. In most cases, applicants concern on their abilities interest, post work experiences and friend’s interest attest how they go about seeking for jobs.</p> <p>Problem such as these factors to be considered when selecting manpower in the organization includes after the training, some of the employees still find it difficult to know what their duties and responsibilities are as staff.</p> <p>Also, some of the resulted staff are men of qualification rather than men of qualities, therefore, the statement of the problem of this work is to find out how manpower planning and development can effect productivity so as to find factors militating against its objectives, prospects, related problems and how it can be improved.        </p> <p><strong>1.3            </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p> This project work is specifically aimed at discovering the implications of a well laid down manpower planning and training or development in an organization precisely scale industries. The study points out.</p> <p>(a)  The consequences of unplanned manpower recruitment process on the overall productivity of the organization. </p> <p>(b)  The constraints that could make an organization unable to develop plans for it manpower planning , training and development.</p> <p>(c)    The positive productivity level of an organization if there is a well manpower planning, training and development.</p> <p> <strong>1.4            </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Many scalars of management are of the view that manpower planning constitutes a basic resource of management. It assist to activate the art of human management through creative innovative and imaginative techniques aimed at improving productivity as an important management resources, it recognizes the role of trade unions and pares way for meeting of workers rights problems are solved managerially through manpower planning. Manpower planning is all embracing. It seeks to juxtapose the right people with befitting colleagues while ensuing that proper knowledge skills, experience training and development  are matched up with the might placement at the period and cost rare all indicators of manpower, futuristic approach to management presupposed that there must be planning management is highly conscious of relevance of manpower planning especially in recent time when the needed for effective person el is highly relevant due to changes arising  from technology and other environmental factors.</p> <p>Modern organization  is on longer rely on normal manpower planning even where organization are small and informal there is need to adopt a comprehensive manpower planning as issue like improvement in techniques good service, consumption techniques and organization  structure which requires efficient resources management are tackled</p> <p> <strong>1.5            </strong><strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is carried out to outline the role of manpower planning and development as a tool to higher productivity in an industry concentration on small-scale industries. Covering the importance of personnel recruitment, sources of applicants, qualities of good itself conditions for training ,objective of training, methods and techniques of training, importance of qualified manpower and self-development some difficulties were uncounted when conducting the research, the constants include,</p> <p><strong>TIME TABLE</strong></p> <p>the time limit allocated for the collection data and completion of the whole research work for the project made it impossible to gather information that will make room for a comprehensive study of the subject matter.</p> <p><strong>FINANCE</strong></p> <p>The student researcher encountered financial difficulties in carrying out this research due to the high cost in transportation cost of station and other materials used.</p> <p><strong>LABOUR MARKET</strong></p> <p>The researcher observed that the geographic area in which source of supply and demand operates determines the price or growing rate of a certain type of labour.</p> <p><strong>COMMUNICATION  BARRIERS</strong></p> <p>Also, during the personnel interview</p> <p> the researcher experienced a lot of communication problem with the individual and some company staff interviewed.

When a worker is employed in an organization, a guide, a rule and regulation are given to him or her to make sure that he effort and performance is directed towards  one channel, which is objectives of the organization.</p> <p>As well management expects high performance and corporation from the employee who is given incentives by given remuneration but when the things expected by both management and employee is not far fetched then there exists a phenomena, which raises the eye brow of the management to ask what is a miss.</p> <p>This research work deals with such phenomena, which  such phenomena, which is “Employee performance appraisal as a strategies to management”.</p> <p> <strong>1.1                 </strong><strong>GENERAL BACKGROUND TO THE SUBJECT MATTER</strong></p> <p>The first and only indigenous network provider in Nigeria called NITEL was originally known as post &amp; telegraph communication. It was established during the coloninai era.</p> <p>The Nigeria Telecommunications Limited (NITEL) is a federal Government owned company that provides public telecommunications services in  Nigeria it started operations as a company in 1985 as an amalgam of the telecommunications Division of the default P &amp; T Department and the Nigeria  External Telecommunications limited (NIT) and now has staff strength of about 11,000.</p> <p>In 1992, NITEL was commercialized following a tripartite agreement between it, the government and the Technical Committee on Privatization &amp; Commercialization (TCPC). In the same year, NITEL pioneered the mobile telecommunications services in Nigeria, which was later excised from the company to form M-Tel in 1996. M-Tel was however reemerged resulting conglomerate was constituted into three directorates which all  reported to the corporate headquarters. The directorates were for long Distance communications, Domestic  Communications.</p> <p>M-Tel was again excised from NITEL in April 2003. As a result of   the excision, M-Tel became legally, administratively, operationally and financially autonomous but it remained fully owned by and as  a full subsidiary of NITEL. The company operates a six zonal structure, the zones are:</p> <p>(a)              Lagos zone with headquarters in Lagos</p> <p>(b)             North West Zone with headquarters in Kaduna</p> <p>(c)              North East zone with headquarters in Bauchi</p> <p>(d)             South East zone with headquarters in Enugu</p> <p>(e)              South West zone with headquarter in Ibadan</p> <p>(f)               Central zone with headquarters  in Abuja</p> <p>Each state of the Federation and the Federal capital represents a territory. Lagos  is however structured into their territories because of the volume of business in the city.</p> <p>Fully commercialization policy of the federal government, NITEL Limited, more than ever, is committed to the provision of efficient, reliable and cost effective telecommunication services nationally and internationally. This set of objectives has remained the guiding principles which the company’s operations are based.</p> <p>NITEL has about 800,000 telephone lines and about 13000 telex lines in the network with the introduction of digital system into the network  from 1990 and the commencement of GSM operations by M-Tel its subsidiary, the total installed capacity of telephone lines is expected to reach three million next year. About 450,000 lines, while 80% of transmissions digital.</p> <p>In April 2003 the management of NITEL was contracted to messers pentascope. International following another tripartie agreement between the Bureau of Public Enterprises (on behalf of the National Government). NITEL and pentascope international. This contract is for a period of three years  during which pentascope international will positively turn around the operational, technical, financial and administrative fortunes of NITEL for the betterment of the company’s customer’s shareholders and stakeholders.</p> <p>In the last quarter of 003, a comprehensive business plan was approved for NITEL. The programme is a blue print too turns the company around. Components of this programme are already being implemented. Some of these are a new organogam for the company investment in various projects that would on completion, earn significant revenues for the company and an intra-industry policy of cooperation, mutual understanding and national cohesion.</p> <p>NITEL limited has continued to live up to the expectations of the Federal Government by improving on its achievements in the efficient management of its operations and network. The company has consolidated its corporate existence and is firmly on path to providing adequate effective, modern and viable telecommunications services for t he nation development.</p> <p>This motivation which is one of the functions of management is directed at stimulating workers and therefore, the personnel management department of any organization does appraisal to verify the extent to which they have stimulated workers or employees in an organization toward achieving the organizational main objective.</p> <p>According to Abraham Mashow and Douglas McGregor who are known for motivational theories said that an employee comes to work to get both the intrinsic rewards such as recognition esteem and self-fulfillment and also the extrinsic  rewards like promotion, improved condition of service and an adequate emuneration. It may seem realistic to say that only pay increase motivates subordinates but it is a blatant lie.</p> <p>We want to use this study to explore the employees motivational strategies in NITEL Limited and then know what the employees in this company want from their jobs and how best their expectations can be met with a view to motivating them to a higher performance which leads to higher productivity.</p> <p> <strong>1.2             </strong><strong>PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER</strong></p> <p>There is a question that always strikes ones mind whenever motivation is mentioned. That question is why is it that the self employed Nigerian is always highly motivated to produce more while the public sector employees are not usually responsive to the motivation giving to them.</p> <p>  It is also observed that private company employees performances are very high compared to that of public company employees. All these question and observation revolves around the phenomenon of motivation.</p> <p>The problem above creates greater economic depress in Nigeria economy and NITEL Ltd. In particular but after this research work remedy will be made.</p> <p>In answering the question above, some psychologist and some social scientist postulated various theories on motivation, which includes Abram Maslow’s theory of motivation, the popular theory of Herzberg. “motivation Hygiene factors”. Theory  x  and  Y.</p> <p>It is a pity that many Nigerian managers and employees of labour are not aware  of this important factor called motivation and its effects on employees.</p> <p> <strong>1.3     PROBLEMS THAT THE STUDY WILL BE CONCERNED WITH</strong></p> <p> The problem employees’ performance Appraisal encounter in an organization affects its productivity. Over the years business organizations has tried a lot to eradicate this problems that some times engulf managerial progress in Business organizations and NITEL Ltd. In particulars. These problems are: </p> <ol><li>Favourtism</li> <li>Nigerian quota system</li> <li>Financial worries</li> <li>Domestics problem</li> <li>Ignorance of the effect of ones effort to the achievement of organizational goals</li> </ol> <p>This problem also attaches itself with research question and will use the same opportunities to discuss research questions.</p> <p> <strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS:</strong></p> <ol><li>Why is employees’ performance appraisal needed in an organization?</li> <li>What impact can it create in progress of an organization?</li> <li>Does employee performance appraisal have any theoretical backup and background?</li> <li>Can we be really done without Employees Performance Appraisal?</li> </ol> <p>On the reason why employee performance Appraisal is needed in an organization, both charitable and non-profit organization has failure because of inadequate employees Performance Appraisal. Employees’ Performance Appraisal is needed in an organization to either motivate workers or remind them. NITEL Ltd. Appraisal its staff yearly, after the exercise hard working staff will be promoted and some incentive will be give to them.</p> <p> <strong>1.4        THE IMPORTANCE OF STUDING THE AREA</strong></p> <p>This research is intended to discuss the various ways and methods that NITEL LTD uses to make sure their workers are influenced, it also intends to reveal some the services that NITEL LTD uses to motivate workers. If there are opportunities for promotion and training which makes employee feel integrated into the organization which makes the employee to work harder for the corporate aim of the company.</p> <p>We need to point out that human beings are not machines and so their performance depends greatly on their staff of body and soul being together. Therefore this study hopes also to reveal the prospects of the employees in the company under study and their contribution to the better performance of the organization.</p> <p>In any organization the personnel department handles a lot of jobs which includes employing workers, souring for workers, remuneration of workers, welfare, training lay-off and many others but in this research work we are concerned with the performance appraisal duty which in the actual sense uses all the other functions for its achievement.</p> <p>This research study deals with the management reasons for the use of employees performance Appraisal which is done timely to find out the workers and management loopholes and fill it to avoid liquidation and failure.</p> <p>This work is intend to explore the methods applied by NITEL LTD.

At the recruitment of new staff, training programmes are usually commenced to equip them on their job responsibilities and to make them fit for specific positions or activities.</p> <p>Most human resource managers are of the opinion and view that staff training is a veritable tool to improve the efficiency of the workers, which in turn will boost the productivity of the organization. It is against this drop of assumption that this work is set to bring out the facts for the acceptability or otherwise of the claim, so as to justify or condemn the huge sum of money and other resources that go into staff induction and training.</p> <p> <strong>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Othniel (2000), commented that the overall essence of training is to give employees at all levels sufficient skill-instruments and guideline to enable them perform their job very well, and to position them well for promotion. Basically, it falls on the personnel manager to design and co-ordinate the staff training policies and programmes of his organization. However, this does not imply that the other line managers are released of their responsibility to ensure the development of the skill and potentials of their subordinate. Rather it means to prescribe and make clear the responsibility for the personnel department.</p> <p>          Tree training situation or need arises when there is a gap between the standard performance set out by the department and the actual performance of the subordinate. The purpose of training is to close the gap, and in its place exceed the industrial performance rate without human resources, achieving goals and objectives by the organizations would be extremely difficult; and without developing the human resources capacity, achieving the best, optimum result from the employees would be a mere penury.</p> <p>          This informs the need to evaluate the us of training to enhance organizational efficiency by the employers and managers of our time. References shall be made to a random of selected business organization including banks.</p> <p> <strong>1.2     PROBLEM ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER.</strong>   </p> <p>          A number of problems are relative to the subject matter. These problems could be identified as follows:</p> <p>a.       Lack of training is responsible for low productivity in the organization.</p> <p>b.       Employees inability to operate equipment and machines especially the modern types, is related to training.</p> <p>c.       Indiscipline among employees (in terms of moral behaviour) may be due to lack of training.</p> <p>d.       Lack of the knowledge of the organization goal and objectives</p> <p>e.       The danger of employing unskilled workers if training is not introduced</p> <p>f.       Lack of integration among the workers for corporate attainments.</p> <p>g.       An ignorant employee about the nature of his job may not be able to stand the demands of the job, thereby resulting into resignation.</p> <p><strong>1.3     PROBLEMS THAT THE STUDY WILL BE CONCERNED WITH.</strong></p> <p>          Orjih (1998), gave about five problems that split relationship with staff training.</p> <p>          These problems are the major concern of the research study, they include:</p> <p><strong>a.       PROBLEM OF DIFFERENCE IN CHARACTER:   </strong>Expert in human psychology observed that individuals are never the same in values, opinions, views, orientation, attitudes, temperament, beliefs etc. Therefore training is the solution. It will reposition the workers’ dispositions to achieve the organizational goods.</p> <p><strong>b.      PROBLEM OF NEW TECHNOLOGICAL TREND:</strong></p> <p>As the demand is, skills for information technology are necessities for efficient work force. Training of employees in this areas of development will enhance the organization’s operational efficiency.</p> <p><strong>c.       PROBLEM OF DELEGATION OF RESPONSIBILITY: </strong>A successful delegation will depend on the knowledge and recognition of the abilities of the employee. It is training that will refine the potentials in the employee and make him recognized by his managers. </p> <p><strong>d.      PROBLEM OF PROFICIENCY:</strong></p> <p>          New employees need special attention until they are fully proficient in their job. Even New Expert, skilled workers without relevant experience, should be trained in their particular job.</p> <p> <strong>e.       PROBLEM OF PHYSICAL APPEARANCE:</strong></p> <p>The way workers package themselves is determined by the organization dress code and professional ethnics as well as Office conducts are inculcated into workers during their training.</p> <p><strong>f.       ACCORDING APPLEBY RC (1985);</strong></p> <p>Arrangement should be made for new employees to be introduced to the firm and to their job. Staff induction and training programme will give a new employee the room to know about his organization in areas like as belief history of his company’s products, places in the industry, organization structure, names of departmental leaders and the activities of various department.

Some other do certain things better than others. For instance, some people were better at making cloths while others were better at farming. As a result, most people began to do the type of work they did best. Then they traded food, cloths and other things they produced with their neighbours. This was the era of barter trade. But with time people began to travel far and wide to find what they want and exchange it for what they have. Business exists all over the world but not exactly the same way in every country. In places where people are local farmers, business is a simple process but where others industries exist, business activities are complicated.</p> <p>          Coordination and leadership are intimately bound as each affects the other. One cannot achieve coordination without effective leadership. Together they ensure that all efforts are channeled effectively towards the right goal. Some authorities such as Money and Reilly regard it as the first principle of organization while Koonzt and his Associates prefer to call it the essence of Management and regard each of the Managerial functions as an exercise in coordination. No matter how a firm originated, its functions must be effectively coordinated.</p> <p>          People cannot be compelled to cooperate. As a result, the right environment for the exchange of information is required. There are many conflicts, which can arise between Management and the workers, and they must be smoothed out and if to use Fayol’s phrase, enspirit de corps can be attained, problems can be more easily overcome.</p> <p>          They evaluated the contributional capabilities and shortcomings of subordinates with a view to know their performance. The result received will be the bases of promotion, recommendation for promotions or dismissal as well. There is no other to this if not through hid out, displayed positive and negative attributes. It is no gain saying that the performance appraisal is invaluable planning, coordination, policy formation, decision-making and controls. The employees on the other hand engage in co-workers supervision and managers so they are totally ignorant of the rating of these people.</p> <p>          Since formal performance of the Management is used for most appointments. And employees of human resources being the most important asset of the organization manager and supervisors must exercise utmost care in doing this. This is because when a good staff finds out that he is poorly assessed; it will for sure affect his morals and attitude to work. This will result to lowered productivity.</p> <p>          Robert Stolz, a management consultant believes and rightly say that with a right kind of evaluation a real industrial need is fulfilled and staff are carried out in organization for administrating, informative and motivational purposes. Formalized evaluation permits an orderly and rational way of determining promotion, salary increases, transfers training needs, potentials retrenchment, reassignment, termination of appointment etc. It is against this background that the researcher wants to delve into the evaluation of the effect of Management Performance in an organization; ANAMCO, ENUGU DISTRICT.</p> <p><strong> 1.2            PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>For an organization to achieve its goals and objectives, the effect of Management is sine qua non. Favouritism, nepotism and low manpower utilization prevails the rank and file of Government Parastatals thus cultivating inefficiency.</p> <p>One major factor is under development, Nigeria arises from the culpable distortions in our manpower utilization. In organizations, there are many square pegs in round holes most times; leadership is generally inefficient because our manpower selection is subjective.</p> <p>Public officers are chosen in political basis, appointment, social connection, sycophancy and even blood relation. Despite the abundance of competent manpower, mediocrity has taken over. More so, we observed escalating frustration, rehabilitating internal policies and low productivity everywhere.</p> <p>This results to why over 75% of the civil servants idle away time at offices if ever they come. They perceive their place of work as a place to collect monthly salaries and allowances without conscientiously.</p> <p>This study wants to know whether the management and the supervisory staff are living up to their obligation.</p> <p><strong> 1.3     OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY:</strong> The aim of this research is to find out how the effects of Management Performance in an organization could be assessed especially in Enugu district.</p> <ol><li>To equally know whether the present system of evaluation has any relationship with over- all performance, practices, viability, decisions, productivity and development as well as achievements of corporate goals.</li> <li>Ascertaining the problems militating against management and supervisors in this task.</li> <li>To find out whether the management is utilizing (MBO) effectively and efficiently.</li> <li>To analyze the effects of ineffective formal appraisal to the activities of ANAMMCO ENUGU DISTRICT.</li> </ol> <p><strong> 1.4   THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:</strong> This study is very significant and relevant in many respects. It would provide answers to management performance in organizations.</p> <p>        Staff and management of performance appraisal are very important to many organizations that want to remain a going concern. It will make mangers and supervisors to be alive and up and doing in their duties of evaluation and supervision. The employees stand to gain through better corporate performance.</p> <p>        Over the years, nations of what should be the focal point of evaluation modalities, for dong so, and how to reasonably ascertain performance or otherwise have been developed by various authors. Those in favour of evaluation performance among with wrath opined that:</p> <ol><li>Assessment of potentials never equals that of performance in objectivity and precision.</li> <li>Performance evaluation is a legitimate starting point even if it does not take the evaluator the whole distance.</li> <li>An individual should expect promotion to a high position only if he performs within the current job.</li> <li>However, the proponents of potentials assessment are of the opinion that:</li> </ol> <p>1.       Facts about performance can easily be detached from the pay role and other records.</p> <p>2.       Good performance in job is not necessarily a good signal of suitability for high responsibility.</p> <p>3.       A person with considerable potentials might put up only an average performance in a job because he is totally bored with it.</p> <p>In their writing “Improving total productivity” Paul Mail advocated eight-evaluation method, which he broke down into four categories viz:</p> <p>i         Evaluation according to work activity</p> <p>ii        Evaluation based on behaviour and personality</p> <p>iii       Evaluation that focuses on comparisons</p> <p>iv       Evaluation focused on result</p> <p><strong>1.5     RESEARCH QUESTIONS 1</strong></p> <p>Why is management performance assessed?</p> <ol><li>How does management assessment affect organizations?</li> <li>Can management performance evaluation be avoided and what will be its resultant effect.</li> </ol> <p>iii.   Can it reduce production efficiency?</p> <p>iv.   What are its benefits to an organization?</p> <p><strong> 1.6  LIMITATION OF STUDY/SCOPE:</strong> The subject matter of this study is one, which should have made the study a national one. The topic is one, which solves problems of management performance in organization.</p> <p>       However, the study is centered on the evaluation of management performance in an organization(s). ANAMCO ENUGU perspective and the researcher is compelled to limit the study to ANAMCO ENUGU DISTRICT. The limitations of the study are due to problems of transportation, distance, un-cooperative attitudes of workers. </p> <p><strong> 1.7  DEFINITION OF TERMS:</strong></p> <p><em>Evaluation</em></p> <p><em>Effects</em></p> <p><em>Management</em></p> <p><em>Performance</em></p> <p><em>Organization</em></p> <p>The definition of the aforementioned will be done in two categories – conceptual and operational definitions.</p> <p>1.    Conceptual definition of evaluation: To weight something, to assess.</p> <p>Operational: Assess, Appraise, to find or state the number or amount of</p> <p>2.    Conceptual: Effect: The impact of something.</p> <p>Operational: result or consequence of an action.

WHO is Your God Father and not quality or merit anymore, it should be realized that the Banking System is expected to be above board in selecting their staff.</p> <p>Their practice should be different from other service organization because of nature of work.  Quality and competence should be their watchword.  Godfather syndrome should not be welcomed.  It is on this basis that the researcher has decide to place the emphasis in this study on the practice of selection and induction in this recent time, which has prompted many organizations in closing very appropriate places for conducting seminars lectures for the benefit of the staff.</p> <p>This study will be carried out using Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, formerly known as Baclays Bank International, which come into the country in the year 1971 as one of the commercial banks.</p> <p>Baclays Bank was formed by a goldsmith family inBritainas an up giant of the goldsmith receipt used as a exchange on the dealing involving trade by barter.</p> <p>However, the era of indigenization open (second phase) in 1917 made in mandatory that foreign owned company should diversity their ownership based.  Bank which were classified among the service sectors be longs to the owners ratio of participation of 60%Nigeriaquote in “Union Bank” came into existence until when the name was changed from Baclays Bank to Union Bank of Nigeria Limited in 1979 and then they came a quoted company in 1990 when it went public.</p> <p><strong>1.2            </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p><p> The business challenges of an organization will be to realize the impacts of staff selection and induction, most especially in Union Bank of Nigeria Plc. </p> <p>The problem of the study is to understand how staff selection and induction should operational in Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, setting.</p> <p>It is easy to advocate policies but often difficult to implement them.</p> <p>How does a business integrate staff and induction in its management with all the functional departmentalization that are found in the organization?  This study will address the issues.</p> <p><strong>1.3            </strong><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to find out the followings:</p> <ol><li>To find out if the staff of Union Bank are inducted.</li> <li>To find out the people’ responsibility

of staff selection and induction on the employees of union bank who has benefited from the programme.</li> <li>To determine whose duty, it is to conduct staff selection and induction in Union Bank.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4            </strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS?</strong></p> <p>The following research question are formulated effective and comprehensive research work.</p> <ol><li>How has union bank adequately practice staff selection and induction for her staff?</li> <li>Are the staffs satisfied with the provision of staff induction programmes?</li> <li>What are the challenges that pose against selection and induction.</li> <li>To what extend has induction helped in improving staff performance in the organization?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5            </strong><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>The followings hypothesis will be fested in line with this study.</p><p> Ho:    Union Bank has not provided staff selection and induction for her staff. </p> <p>Hi:     Union Bank has adequately provided practice of staff selection and</p> <p>induction for her staff.</p> <p>Ho:    There are no challenges that pose against selection and induction of staff</p> <p>in bank industries.</p> <p>Hi:     There are great challenges that pose against selection and induction of</p> <p>staff in bank industries.</p> <p><strong>1.6            </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The practice of staff selection and induction programme plays an efficient and effective role with the employees discharging their functions or responsibility in order to achieve their organizational corporate objectives.</p> <p>Organization thus try as much as possible to attain this corporate objectives by helping their employees to accomplish their own personal objectives.</p> <p>They do by setting an ideal induction and selection programme for the benefit of their employees.</p> <p><strong>1.7            </strong><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The researcher tends to understudy the human resources department of Union Bank of Nigeria Plc which takes care of selection and induction programmes in the bank.  Despite the fact that Union Bank is very big bank with network of branches scattered across the nation and carrying out the study as a whole will be very time consuming and cumbersome.  Hence, the researcher tried to cover human resources department of the bank based inGarden Avenue.</p> <p><strong>1.8            </strong><strong>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In the course of this study, the researcher experienced some constrains.  The constraints encountered by the research include the followings:</p> <p><strong>1.       Time: </strong>A lot of time was required to enable the researcher to conduct an extensive survey of the activities of the staff selection and induction, with in the time given for the research work and at the same time perform other academic engagements.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Lack Finance:     </strong>Another limitation to this study was lack of finance.  A study of this type requires sufficient money to enable the researcher to travel from one place to another where those union banks are located in order to assess the activities of these union bank on the spot in order to obtain the relevant data for the study.  Lack of adequate finance made it difficult for the research to assent the scope of the research to other states of the country to collect data on the practice of state selection and induction in the Union Bank of Nigeria Plc.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Another limitation to this study was the difficulty during the oral interviews conducted by the researcher with some of union bank staff, some of them were unable to supply relevant.</p> <p><strong>4. </strong>Finally, another major constraint was the sourcing of secondary data institutions and libraries in search of the data, which also gave the researcher a lot of problems.</p> <p><strong>1.9       </strong><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Practice:</strong>  Practice actualize

Every organization set up so long there are people working thereconscious1y or unconsciously deals with Human Resources management and its attendant problems.</p> <p>Human Resources Management is dynamic and the source and failure of any organization depends on the human resources. This is because every other resource material, financial and so forth resolves around and indeed controlled by the human resources. There is no gain-saying that the greatest of all resources at the disposal of any organization is the personnel (Human resources). Considering this, the need for effective and efficient human resource management in any organization cannot be overlooked or ignored. This report seek therefore to study or investigate human resources management practices in some Nigeria establishments.</p> <p>This report research seeks to establish the current personnel management practice, the problems/drawback, prospect and proffer  solutions. To effectively achieve this the report is broken down into five (5) chapters for easy understanding</p>\n\nPROBLEMS OF HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND THEIR IMPACT IN ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS OF HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND THEIR IMPACT IN ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE", "id": 55}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE EFFECT OF STRESS ON WORKERS PERFORMANCE</strong></p> <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p>This study is on effect of stress on workers performance. The total population for the study is 200 staff of first bank osogbo, Lagos state. The researcher used questionnaires as the instrument for the data collection. Descriptive Survey research design was adopted for this study. A total of 133 respondents made accountants, human resource managers, senior staff and junior staff were used for the study.

Stressful experience has become part and parcel of living in contemporary society. In most human behaviour, human being will advertently go through some elements of stress. For example, when we subject ourselves to time, pressure or urgently engage in complex and difficult problem solving processes, we become exposed to high noisy environment or new of impending damage, we are most likely to go through movement of stress.<br/>Stress occupies a prominent position in psychological and medical research, psychologist view stress as a disruption of human skilled performance. In clinical research, stress and anxiety as viewed as made of pathological adoptive responses in whether context with view stress its role in human resources management cannot be overlooked. Stress has an emotional experience, which can be monetary affairs. In such cases, the social antecedent of stress is short and we may possess the psychological resources to cope and go through the situation undue disruption of adaptive responses. When this is the case stress posses and energizing effect workers motivation, this will act as a signal for us to get ready for action induced by longstanding condition of tension pains, situation, conflicts, and anxieties ever positive adoptive responses become over stretched and our reactions to it are negative in such cases, the negative effects of stress not only affect our health but diminish our productivity</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The statement was purposely studied due to the following reasons:</p> <p>1.   To achieve a full knowledge of stress and examine the way to cope with it in rural areas</p> <p>2.   Identify and monitor the symptoms of stress must especially in rural areas</p> <p>3.   To examine the possible sources of stress</p> <p>4.   To examine the technique of controlling stress through</p> <p>5.   To enable the workers to reduce cost of stress and the risk of constant exposure to stress</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objectives of the study are;</p> <p>1.   To examine the impact of stress on workers performance</p> <p>2.   To educate workers on how to manage stress in rural areas</p> <p>3.   To identify different methods which can be used to reduce stress that affects workers</p> <p>4.   To help the management to know about the existence of stress in an organization</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>For the successful completion of the study, the following research hypotheses were formulated by the researcher;  </p> <p><strong>H0: </strong>there is no impact of stress on workers performance.  </p> <p><strong>H1: </strong>there is impact of stress on workers performance</p> <p><strong>H02: </strong>there are no different methods which can be used to reduce stress that affects workers.</p> <p><strong>H2: </strong>there are different methods which can be used to reduce stress that affects workers </p> <p><strong> 1.5</strong> <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work is important because it would assist the employees of labour, to manage stress and undergone by their workers. It would also serve as an avenue and foundation for future and further study.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This write - up is intended to highlight the effort of stress on workers performance. With particular reference to First Bank of Nigeria Osogbo as a case study. The study makes use of the questionnaire which are distributed to employees of the First Bank of Nigeria. The researcher encounters some constrain which limited the scope of the study;</p> <p> <strong>a) AVAILABILITY OF RESEARCH MATERIAL:</strong> The research material available to the researcher is insufficient, thereby limiting the study  </p> <p><strong>b) TIME:</strong> The time frame allocated to the study does not enhance wider coverage as the researcher has to combine other academic activities and examinations with the study.</p> <p><strong>c) Organizational privacy</strong>: Limited Access to the selected auditing firm makes it difficult to get all the necessary and required information concerning the activities.  </p> <p><strong> 1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>STRESS: </strong><em>Stress</em> is your body's way of responding to any kind of demand or threat. When you sense danger whether it's real or imagined the body's defenses kick into high gear in a rapid, automatic process known as the “fight-or-flight” reaction or the \"<em>stress</em> response\".</p> <p><strong>WORKERS PERFORMANCE: </strong>The job related activities expected of a worker and how well those activities were executed. Many business personnel directors assess the employee performance of each staff member on an annual or quarterly basis in order to help them identify suggested areas for improvement.</p> <p><strong>1.8 ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work is organized in five chapters, for easy understanding, as follows </p> <p>Chapter one is concern with the introduction, which consist of the (overview, of the study), historical background, statement of problem, objectives of the study, research hypotheses, significance of the study, scope and limitation of the study, definition of terms and historical background of the study. Chapter two highlights the theoretical framework on which the study is based, thus the review of related literature. Chapter three deals on the research design and methodology adopted in the study. Chapter four concentrate on the data collection and analysis and presentation of finding.  Chapter five gives summary, conclusion, and recommendations made of the study    </p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF STRESS ON WORKERS PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF STRESS ON WORKERS PERFORMANCE", "id": 56}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <div><strong>OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY</strong></div> <p>For growth and survival of any organization the role of performance appraisal is a strategic factor that cannot be over emphasized. It is believed that both the individual and the organization need to know how well, actually performance is contributing to the accomplishment of the job plans, the starting plan and ultimately the overall strategic grand plan of the organization. In addition the individual employee requires feedback related to his or her own goal, development as well as the related management expectation.<br/>Performance appraisal is a structured formal interaction between subordinate and employee. The relationship between performance appraisal and organization is that, it can bring positive impact to the performance of the employee. Performance appraisal can also be seen as a developmental process since it seeks to identify the strength and weakness of the employee as a guide for further development. It is usually made in prescribed manners at a specific intervals such as quarterly, biannually or to asses employee on his or her job performance and when necessary, giving guidelines and advice to the employee for improving efficiency and effectiveness.<br/>An effective performance appraisal review system service these general purpose in other words the essence of performance appraisal is to give information for promotion, pay increase, training and development. It can also be used to discharge employee. Furthermore it provide employee with constructive feedback on how they are performing their jobs as viewed by their manager thus leading to increase in productivity. Flipo (1980- 2004) identified the following three appraisals as follows<br/>1.       A casual and unsystematic approach<br/>2.       The traditional and higher systematic measurement of<br/>-        Employee’s characteristic<br/>-        Employee’s contribution<br/>-        Both<br/>3.       Mutual goal setting through a management by objective programme (MBO) that effective performance appraisal system have the potential to provide opportunity for manager and employee to communicate and agreed upon what is expected to each of them and to plan performance based on the overall objectives of the organization. Legal implication often dictate the need for jobs to be defined explicitly for objectives to the set and agreed manager and employee performance based on the criteria that include more than just the judgement of the manager but also include the judgement of individual.</p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>This is to assess the extent to which performance appraisal impact on employee performance in Delta Line Ltd.<br/>As we all know the primary aim of every established company including the Delta line ltd, is to maximise profit, and this could easily be attained through staff productivity, to assess if the company has adequate appraisal system that can lead to promotion, pay increase training and development. Therefore it was due to the above, that this study is been carried out.</p> <p><strong>1.3     OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The specific objectives of this study include;</p> <div> <ol><li>To describe the various performance appraisal techniques used by the organization.</li> <li>Technique used in Delta line limited.</li> <li>Problems associated with different approved techniques.</li> <li>To determine some common performance appraisal problems of the employees and how it could be solved.</li> <li>To determine the extent to which performance appraisal impact on employee’s performance at Delta line limited.</li> </ol></div> <p><strong>1.4     RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>The following research question will help in achieving the objective of the study</p> <div> <ol><li>What is the relationship between performance appraisal and employee’s productivity?</li> <li>What are the techniques used in performance appraisal?</li> <li>How effective are the techniques in ensuring increase in productivity?</li> <li>What are the problems of performance appraisal?</li> </ol></div>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL ON STAFF PRODUCTIVITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL ON STAFF PRODUCTIVITY", "id": 57}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER TWO </strong><br/><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW </strong><br/><strong>MOTIVATION DEFINED </strong><br/>According to Mathis, R.L and Jackson, J. H. (2006) Motivation is the desire within a person causing that person to act according to them, people usually act for one reason to reach a goal. Thus motivation is a goal directed, driven and as such, it seldom occurs in a void.</p> <p>Weihrich, H and Kointz, H.  (2005) defined motivation as a general term applying to the entire class of drive, desires, needs, wishes and similar forces. They are of the view that, says that manager motivate their subordinate do to say that they do things which they hope will satisfy these drives and induce the subordinate to act in a  desired manner.</p> <p>Cole, R. E (1995) also defined motivation as the term used to describe those processes, both instinctive and rational, by which people seek to satisfy the basic drives, perceived needs and personal goals, which trigger human behaviour. <br/>Nwachukwu C. C. (2006) defined motivation as that energizing force that induces, compels, and maintain behaviour. Human behaviour is motivated and goal directed. <br/>Although, all the definitions above have given a true picture of what motivation entails, but the most preferred definition from the researcher perspective is the one given below because of it more comprehensive components.</p> <p>The researcher therefore will define motivation as a complex force, drives, tension, state or other mechanism that initiates and  maintains voluntary activities, directed towards the achievement of goals. <br/><strong>THEORIES OF MOTIVATION </strong><br/>Mathis, and Jackson, (2006) posits that the two most discussed groups of theories are content and process theories. <br/>i.        <strong>CONTENT THEORIES OF MOTIVATION </strong><br/>Are theories that focus on the needs, drive or triggers of human behavious in a work place. Examples are: <br/>a.       Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs theory <br/>b.      Douglas  McGregor – Theory X and theory Y<br/>c.       Herzberg Motivation – Hygiene theory <br/>d.      Mc Celland’s need theory <br/>ii.       <strong>PROCESS THEORIES OF MOTIVATION</strong><br/>Are those that try to explain and describe the process of how behaviour is energized, directed, sustained and finally stopped, that is how motivation occur. Examples are: <br/>a.       Expectancy theory <br/>b.      Equity theory<br/>c.       Re-enforcement theory <br/>d.      Attribution theory <br/>e.       Theory Z – The Japanese Approach</p> <p><strong>ABRAHAM MASLOW’S HIERARCHY OF NEEDS THEORY </strong><br/>One of the major and most widely recognized theories of motivation is the hierarchy of needs theory propounded by Abraham Maslow. Maslow’s studies into human motivation lead him to propose a theory of needs based on a hierarchical model with basic needs at bottom and higher needs at the top. This theory made a considerable influence on developments in management theory during the 1950s/60s due partly to the simplicity of the model and partly to the identification f higher level needs. <br/>The starting point of Maslow’s hierarchy theory, first published in 1954, is that most people are motivated by the desire to  satisfy specific groups of needs. <br/>These needs are as follows: <br/>a.       <strong>Physiological Needs: </strong>This group needs include such things as food, water, clothing, shelter, sleep and sexual satisfaction. These are basic survival needs. These needs can be satisfied with money. A man who is starting life needs money to obtain shelter, buying food and clothing. His major pre-occupation will be to ensure that these basic needs are substantially satisfied. <br/>b.      <strong>Safety Needs: </strong>Here, Maslow is referring to safety of lives and properties; the needs to be free from physical danger and the fear of losing job, property, food, clothing and shelter. He posits that once this safety needs are satisfied minimally, it ceases to motivate and another level of motivation comes in. <br/>c.       <strong>Belonging and love needs: </strong>The gratification of the physiological and safety needs will give rise to the emergence of the need for affection and belongingness since human are social being they need to belong and to be accepted by others. <br/>d.      <strong>Esteem Needs: </strong>Once people begin to satisfy their needs to belong, they tend to want to be held in esteem both by themselves and by others. This kind of need produces such satisfaction as power, prestige, status and self confidence. <br/>e.       <strong>Self – Actualization: </strong>Maslow regards this need as the highest need on the hierarchy. They refer to man’s desire for self-fulfillment. It is the desire to become what one is capable of becoming to maximize one’s potential and to accomplish something.</p><p>  </p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF MOTIVATIONAL TOOLS ON EMPLOYEES MORALE IN AN ORGANIZATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF MOTIVATIONAL TOOLS ON EMPLOYEES MORALE IN AN ORGANIZATION", "id": 58}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong><br/><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong><br/>2.1   <strong>PERFORMANCE EVALUATION</strong><br/>Performance evolution has been describe as an act of determining the performance ability and subsequently rating of the employee to a particular standard. Performance evaluation has been defined by various authors in their own various ways.<br/><br/>Robert and John (1997) defined performance evaluation as the process of evaluating how well employees do  their jobs compared  with  a set of standards and communicating that information to those employees.<br/><br/>Armstrong (2006), defined performance evaluation as the formal assessment and rating of individuals by their managers as usually an annual review meeting. <br/><br/>“Performance evaluation is the improvement of the performance of individuals leading to improvement in performance or organization as a whole” (Mullens 1999).<br/><br/>Lyyord and Leslie (2004).

One of its greater benefits is to encourage each manager to be more analytical and constructive thinking about his employee.</p> <p>It may force  him to face up to some of his prejudices and personal dislike and to realize (under the pressure of having to record them  on paper and ban them up) that certain of his judging may be in formal unreasonable  or unfair.</p> <p>One issue is what the managers basis comparison will be as he evaluate  performance of his personal.  There are at least three different  approaches. Each main work may be judged against some obstruct standard of perfect in which case, it is difficult to understand the meaning of perfect.<br/>Secondly, each person can be compared with others in his department which means that the man whose work is poor but is making process on perhaps achieve a higher evaluation than the already on top notch worker. In the typical situation, a manager usually uses a sit of all make bases of comparisons which he evaluates, because of find it necessary to do so to give the whole picture and to be fair. The top-notch workers is recognized, but he is the poor worker.</p> <p>Performance system relates to the assessment of staff or managerial performance and not to that manual workers.</p> <p>There are two main categories of evaluating according to Wagne Casio (l994).</p> <div> <ul><li>Informal</li> <li>Formal</li> </ul></div> <p><strong>Informal evaluation</strong>:  is the motioning assessment of an individual’s performance by his managers in the normal cause of work.

No one method is best for all organizations. The method of performance should  be carefully chosen because the supervision most often it become the focal point of involvement between the supervisor and the employee. <br/>3.     <strong>Training the supervisor and launching evaluation programme </strong><br/>A political step in performance evaluation is training of supervisor so that they do not cannot errors  during performance evaluation. Such errors may result in changes of decimation loss of employee’s morale an productivity or inaccurate between the supervisor and the employee.</p> <p>4.     <strong>Discussing method with employer</strong>:       For effective performance appraiser system the appraisee should be given the opportunity to participate and supervisors should with employee the method that will be used. This discussion should specify which areas of performance are evaluated, how often, do the evaluation take make and it significance to the employees. <br/>5.     <strong>Stating the role of appraisers</strong>: the appraise are required to observe and recall performance fill up the necessary form objective and justifying there rating to the appraisee. <br/>6.     <strong>Discussing appraisal with employees</strong>: supervisors should discuss the evaluation with their employee allowing them to discuss areas of agreement and disagreement. <br/>7.     <strong>Implementing Evaluation system</strong>: For successful implementation of elation programmed the following guide should be followed. <br/>i.      Reward the appraiser for the accuracy thoroughness objectivity and promptness in completing the evaluation.<br/>ii.     performance is simply a judgment and information process decumbent, which is neither  completing infallible.</p> <p>2.3   <strong>PURPOSE OF PERFORMANCE EVALUATION</strong><br/>On of the major reasons for employee evaluation is to obtain information for promotion, demotion, transfer, pay increase training and development.                                   </p> <p>An evaluation gives a n employee a feedback as to how management perceives his contribution to the organization. An employee perceives that he/she is poorly evaluated, it could affect his moral, increase absenteeism rate and tiredness and consequently his over all productivity, this is the reason why employee evaluation is expected to be done in spirit of objectivity honesty and fair nay.</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF PERFORMANCE EVALUATION ON WORKERS PRODUCTIVITY IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF PERFORMANCE EVALUATION ON WORKERS PRODUCTIVITY IN NIGERIA", "id": 59}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>A<strong>BSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The training of Manpower Development and Employee Performance in an Organization was studied with The Ministry of Finance in Akwa Ibom State as a reference point.

To overcome such frustrations, an increasing number of industries are choosing to provide self-service technology options for their patrons. Self-checkout at retail stores and supermarkets, pay-at-the-pump gas stations, self-checkin at airports, online banking and stock trading, and a variety of other applications (Ref).</p> <p>The hospitality industry has also adopted the transition from customer service to self service. As touchscreen terminals become more user-friendly they become capable of handling more complicated tasks. Lodging providers, fast-food operators, private clubs, fine dining restaurants, casino operations and others are trading face-to-face encounters for face-to-monitor inter­activity at a variety of unattended points of sale (Ref……..). Will this trend continue? Which forms of self-service technology will endure? Will current technologies converge to form a new self-service platform?</p> <p>Self service as a model and a market trend has gained momentum as guests in the hospitality industry increasingly accept and often prefer self service to assisted service. Most businesses report self-service applications lead to a reduction in operating expenses while markedly improving customer entertainment and satisfaction (Ref……..). For example, today, full service banking means that the bank provides a wide range of technological alternatives designed to discour­age customers from interacting with the bank’s tellers. Applications like Internet banking, ATMs and interactive voice response (IVR) systems have become popular self-service alternatives. While it appears bank customers clearly value the convenience, consistency and self-control of automated transactions, the future for hospitality industry applications is not as clear. Similar to other retailers, hoteliers and restaurateurs appreciate the extended coverage, lower operating costs and reliability of automated transactions. As a result, opportunities to conduct online and on-premises self-service applications are welcomed alternatives even for an industry that prides itself on personal hospitality. However, it is been noted that guests in the hospitality industry sees self-services as entertainment and this has left a positive experience for the guests.</p> <p>A positive guest experience leaves an impact on customers, and can make the difference in a repeat visit. As customer expectations increases the hospitalityorganizations must not simply respond to their customers’ needs and wants, they must go above and beyond expectations from a staffing interaction and service level. A dedicatedeffort through technology and service to achieve these positive touch-points will paydividends in the end through increased customer loyalty and traffic.</p> <p>This research highlights the need for going beyond traditional customer touch-pointsin hotels, resorts, casinos, and restaurants to establish customer entertainment through self-service.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Most hospitality organizations have been implementing self-service channels with a goal of reducing costs, increasing customer entertainment, satisfaction and loyalty, and reaching new customer segments. No matter how successful the self-service channel and entertaining, organizations rarely eliminate traditional personal service when they introduce a self-service channel. Instead, hospitality organizations typically maintain a portfolio of service-delivery channels which allows guests to select the way they interact (Ref…………).</p> <p>According to (Ref…………) the hospitality industry has made considerable strides in using information technology (IT) to improve service efficiency and effectiveness. IT-enabled supplementary services and after-sales service foster differentiation, which helps set a company apart from its competitors. In addition to the well-known web-based applications, the hospitality industry has innovated in a number of ways to better serve customers; for example, Sheraton Hotels and Resorts and Harrah’s Entertainment have introduced Microsoft Surface, a 30-inch, tabletop computer display that guests can use for such services as 360-degree satellite maps and tools to search for local city information, a digital jukebox, and a photo library of Sheraton properties. Less radical, but perhaps more common customer service IT applications include mobile-based reservations, kiosk based check-in, and e-folios. These service innovations have been found to improve service and guest entertainment.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The main purpose for the study is to study the impact of self-service as a method of entertaining guests in the hospitality industry. Therefore, the objectives for the research are;</p> <p>1. To find out whether hospitality industry adopt self-service in their transaction</p> <p>2. To determine the different types of self-service technology</p> <p>3. To examine the impact of service in entertainment of guest in the hospitality industry</p> <p>4. To examine the benefits of self-service to guest in the hospitality industry</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The significance of this study cannot be overemphasized. This is because there are a lot of benefits that self-service can offer customers such as entertainment and fun. Also, hospitality companies have expanded selfservice with the idea of reducing costs, increasing customer satisfaction, and reaching new customer segments. Self service has gone beyond web sites and lobby kiosks to include smart-phone apps that allow guests to search for hotel information, manage their reservation, and check in or out</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1.

A very common form of online fraud is the distribution of rogue security software. Internet services can be used to present fraudulent solicitations to prospective victims, to conduct fraudulent transactions, or to transmit the proceeds of fraud to financial institutions or to others connected with the scheme. Hospitality online transaction is not left out. Presently most hotels, resorts and tourism centers engaged in online transaction/payment such as room reservation and other services. Online fraud can occur in during the cause of reservation transaction. Online fraud could result from chat rooms, email, message boards, or on websites.</p> <p>Hospitality reservation online fraud could occur in two ways. The first is when a criminal approaches the hotel management for online reservation and proposes a business transaction, and then uses fraudulent means to pay for it, using such as a stolen or fake credit card. As a result, the hotel management do not get paid for the transaction. The hotel who accepts credit cards may receive achargeback for the transaction and lose money as a result.</p> <p>Secondly, the most common fraud is taken place using credit cards this is when the account numbers and pin numbers are obtained by malicious people (hotel staff) when a transaction is done and they use this information to withdraw money from the guest’s. , e.g.: a person named Kushela does a transaction using a credit card with hotel staff. During this transaction people (hotel staff) may steal this guest’s identity and act as him and request payment to an offshore account with an excuse that isn't verified to be true and just an excuse to steal the said credit card.</p> <p>Therefore, the impact of online fraud committed in the course of reservation in the hospitality industry has resulted to loss of trust, for both hoteliers and guests for each other.  </p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Online bookings for reservation in the Hospitality Industry are paramount. Hence, the increase of online fraud in course of reservation bookings online. Criminal activity involving the perpetration of a fraud through the use of the computer or the internet can take many different forms. One common form includes “hacking,” in which a perpetrator uses sophisticated technological tools to remotely access a secure computer or internet location. A second common criminal activity involves illegally intercepting an electronic transmission not intended for the interceptor. This may result in the interception of private information such as passwords, credit card information, or other types of so-called identity theft.</p> <p>The impact of online fraud on the Hospitality Industry has resulted to fear, distrust, loss of profit in business, bankruptancy etc.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This project work is aimed at studying the impact of online fraud committed in the cause of reservation in the Hospitality Industry with special reference to Mirage Hotel Enugu. Therefore, the objectives are as follows;</p> <p>1. To find out whether online fraud has been committed in the cause of reservation in Mirage Hotel Enugu.    </p> <p>2. To determine various ways online fraud are perpetrated in the hospitality Industry</p> <p>3. To examine the impact of online fraud in the Hospitality Industry.</p> <p>4. To suggest ways of prevention of online fraud in the Hospitality Industry.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1. Has online fraud been committed in the cause of reservation in Mirage Hotel Enugu?   </p> <p>2. What are the various ways online fraud are perpetrated in the hospitality Industry?</p> <p>3. What impact does online fraud has in the Hospitality Industry.</p> <p>4.

A healthy communication is needed for people to know and understand each other better, to create better functioning organizations and to resolve problems easier (Ruck &amp; Welch, 2012). If an adequate importance is not placed on communication problems in an organization, it may not be possible, for example, for people to have better relationships within that organization. Communication has various definitions and descriptions in the literature. Writers have suggested that communication is the activity of exchanging messages or thoughts through speaking, pointing or writing; on reciprocal terms, however, they define it as a message exchange process and they suggest that communication event happens when messages have been completely conveyed. Communication has also been defined as the process of conveying a message containing information from a source to a recipient and has been indicated to be a term expressing the exchange of feelings and thoughts between people (Okay &amp; Okay, 2011).</p> <p>Human factor comes forth as the most important factor for the organizations in tourism sector due to its labor-intensive quality. Communication is considered as an important factor in tourism establishments and especially in accommodation establishments where human factor is significantly important for the constancy and regularity of the activity of workers as well as sustainability and efficiency of organizations. An accommodation establishment which does not use communication channels properly may not be able to conduct operations regularly and correctly as well, since this specific sector provides services for human beings by human beings as a labor-intensive sector. Human beings who are positively or negatively affected by any behavior, spoken word and attitude make their decisions as a result of these interactions.</p> <p>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>Communication and public relations is one of the fundamental characteristics differentiating human beings from all other living creatures. Brownell (2010) has pointed out the importance of employees and the obligation of the management to communicate effectively with their employees in accommodation establishments and has indicated that the need for effective communication skills could increase even more due to the newly emerging international quality of labor in tourism sector and continuous changes in customer demand. He has also emphasized the quality of “racing against the clock” which is specific to accommodation establishments as well as the increased importance of timely and clear communication between employees in this specific sector.</p> <p>Frontline employees play an important role in connecting with and providing service to customers, and forming long-term relationships with them (Kusluvan, 2013). Employees’ understanding and perception of the information related to the work to be done in accommodation establishments, and the clarity of employees’ roles within the organization, in other words clear expression of the expectation of the organization from the employees play very significant roles in the relationship between employees and customers. The employee who has all the information needed for the work to be done, would be able to increase the quality of service by managing relationships with customers more effectively due to increased self-confidence and would contribute to the positive perception of customers with regard to the service quality.</p> <p>As one of the determinants of success in tourism establishments as in all kinds of other organizations, communication is the fundamental condition enabling the coordination of organizational functioning.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          Specific objectives are as follows;</p> <p>1.     To find out whether strategic communication and public relation is adopted in the management of the hotel</p> <p>2.     To examine the strategies used in communication and public relation in the management of the hotel</p> <p>3.     To investigate the effect of strategic communication and public relations in management of the hotel</p> <p>4.     To determine the benefits of strategic communication and public relations in management of hotels.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>5.     Is strategic communication and public relation adopted in the management of the hotel?</p> <p>6.     What are the strategies used in communication and public relation in the management of the hotel?</p> <p>7.     What are the effect of strategic communication and public relations in management of the hotel?</p> <p>8.     Does the effects of strategic communication and public relations in management of hotels benefit the hotel?</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The significance of the study cannot be overemphasized.

Forest resources can provide long-term national economic benefits. For example, at least 145 countries of the world are currently involved in wood production (Anon, 2010). Sufficient evidence is available that the whole world is facing an environmental crisis on account of heavy deforestation. For years remorseless destruction of forests has been going on and we have not been able to comprehend the dimension until recently. Nobody knows exactly how much of the world’s rainforests have already been destroyed and continue to be razed each year.</p> <p>Deforestation is the conversion of forest to an alternative permanent non-forested land use such as agriculture, grazing or urban development. Deforestation is primarily a concern for the developing countries of the tropics as it is shrinking areas of the tropical forests causing loss of biodiversity and enhancing the greenhouse effect (Angelsen <em>et al</em>., 2011). FAO considers a plantation of trees established primarily for timber production to be forest and therefore does not classify natural forest conversion to plantation as deforestation (but still records it as a loss of natural forests). However, FAO does not consider tree plantations that provide non-timber products to be forest although they do classify rubber plantations as forest. Forest degradation occurs when the ecosystem functions of the forest are degraded but where the area remains forested rather cleared (Anon., 2010).</p> <p>Over the years, sustainable management of forest resources has been of primary concern due to its potential impact on biological diversity and importance in maintaining global ecological functions. In spite of its importance, the natural tropical high forest has continued to diminish rapidly in the African continent, thus dwindling sustainable forest management. Nigeria could face the possibility of timber and fuel wood scarcity towards the end of the century. It has been predicted that within the next fifty years, unless adequate measures are taken, most humid tropical forestland area in Africa could be transformed into unproductive land and the deterioration of the savannah into desert will be accelerated (Hunter et al, 2010).</p> <p>The level of community nutrition is sometimes linked to fuel wood availability and cost, majority of the people residing in Ukwa local government area of Imo state use fuel wood as their main source of energy for cooking. In many areas, due to increasing population the existing wood resources are over exploited. With extensive deforestation, villagers in Ukwa local government area of Imo state are compelled to walk long distance to fetch fuel wood. This tends to have serious consequences for local agricultural production and productivity because; the rural communities also rely on this substituted resource for improving soil fertility. Apart from the deterioration in the quality of life associated with forest degradation, there are other more insidious effects that endanger the future of humans on this planet.</p> <p>In Nigeria, environmental problems that are termed degradation collectively, such as desert encroachment, erosion, flooding and drought etc all have a strong link with deforestation. In some parts of South-Eastern states for instance, escalated soil erosion, flooding, increase in aridity, all of which have strong relationship with deforestation, have affected a significant proportion of the state.</p> <p>According to (; Chowdhury 2013) academia, scholars and researchers are of the opinion that deforestation risk reduction is a systematic approach of identifying, addressing, and reducing the risks of disaster to a community. Generally, deforestation is caused by a variety of factors. However, (Ajibade, 2012) viewed deforestation as clearing of any area of its natural vegetation cover which is normally lead to decrease in plants population resulting in loss of plant biodiversity Nonetheless, excessive deforestation over a long period has been the cause of many drought like features. Deforestation presents multiple environmental problems in our society today.</p> <p>In view of the background this study intends evaluate the impact of deforestation on the environment using Ukwa L.G.A of Imo state as a case study.</p> <p><strong>1.2 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objectives of the study are as follows;</p> <p>1. To find out whether there are deforestation activities in Ukwa L.G.A of Imo state</p> <p>2. To examine the sources of deforestation in Ukwa L.G.A of Imo state</p> <p>3. To evaluate the impact of deforestation on the environment in Ukwa L.G.A of Imo state</p> <p>4. To recommend ways for controlling deforestation activities in Ukwa L.G.A of Imo state</p> <p><strong>1.3 JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Extensive tropical deforestation is a relatively modern event that gained momentum in the 20th century and particularly in the last half of the 20th century. The struggle to save the world’s rainforests and other forests continues and there is a growing worldwide concern about the issue. In order to save forests, we need to know why they are being destroyed. Distinguishing between the agents of deforestation and its causes is very important in order to understand the major determinants of deforestation. The agents of deforestation are those slash and burn farmers, commercial farmers, ranchers, loggers, firewood collectors, infra-structure developers and others who are cutting down the forests. Causes of deforestation are the forces that motivate the agents to clear the forests.</p> <p>The impact of deforestation on the environment is devastating. Hence, strategies to prevent and control the menace are being discussed in this study.</p>                                                          \n\nEVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF DEFORESTATION ON THE ENVIRONMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF DEFORESTATION ON THE ENVIRONMENT", "id": 64}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Managers are the community that visibly stands apart in present-day business organization, although heterogeneous and difficult to unequivocal defining. The reasons for this phenomenon are concerned with the process of ownership and management’s</p> <p>separation, therefore with so called “managerial revolution”. In the business encyclopedia, manager is described as a person, who fulfills the primordial managerial functions (planning, organizing, motivating and controlling) and is the superior of given human team (Encyklopedia biznesu1995). However, manager is a person who first of all is responsible for realization of management process. In particular manager is the person, that makes plans and decisions, organizes, supervises and controls human, finance and information resources (Griffin2010). Manager can be seen as a profession which essence is the management – the art of reaching goals by proper using the finance, material and human resources (Pocztowski1997). In catering management the manager is seen as a person employed for managing, fulfilling all his functions and making use of all or some part of fund/resources in order to achieve goals of the whole or its given part.</p> <p>Catering is the business of providing food service at a remote site or a site such as a hotel, public house (pub), private home or other location. Catering has evolved to become an artisanal affair. The importance of good quality food to the health and well being of older people, and how the housing and care industry needs to embrace the opportunity of expecting more from the catering. There seem to be different challenges being faced by mangers in providing efficient service. The preparation of food and its related knowledge are an inevitable part of daily living and an important part of an economy. The subject is addressing the challenges faced by managers in providing efficient catering service in the old people home.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The challenges faced by managers in providing efficient catering service for old people home cannot be overemphasized. This is because the basic human need of food with product and services from an industrial perspective could be challenging.

With rising acts of terrorism on board, the tourists and travelers have become skeptical about security issues within the hotel premises and often safety quotient of the property. The current issue looks into the safety-security issues haunting the thought process of guests and the modern options and approach that hotels have to gain the confidence of their guests.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>       Hospitality means providing service to others, as well as demonstrating consistent excellence and quality. It should also mean profitably providing value at any price level, while demonstrating your own unique points of distinction. Most of all, hospitality should be a “place”, where people can still be exceptional individuals and they can extend their own personality and style (Hogan, 2008). The hospitality industry is part of a huge group of companies known as travel and tourism industry, which provides the necessary or desirable goods and services to travelers. The hospitality and tourism industries are the largest and fastest-growing industries in the world (Walker, 2010).</p> <p>Frequent terrorisms incidents, natural disasters like Asian tsunami, hurricane and forest fire warn hospitality suppliers and buyers to be prepared for just any imaginable crisis. Security is not limited to only a single aspect it is been classified into various types. Even Taylor (2002) stated that safety involves preventing employees and customers within the hotel property from potential death and injury, such as from accidental slips, falls, cuts, burns and so forth, as well as preventing related property damage. To improve safety, many hotel companies have installed electronic locks, fire sprinklers, smoke detectors, and closed circuit televisions (Okumus, 2005).</p> <p>The security of assets, the safety of the personnel who keep them running, and the well-being of the guests becomes increasingly important as insecurity threat spreads around the globe.</p> <p>In today’s world of proliferating terrorism and heightened security concerns, security department in the hotel industry are faced with a grim, new reality.</p> <p>Hotels are increasingly vulnerable to attack by radical groups who use terror as their strategy of choice. Attacks against hotels in the Northern part of Nigeria should provide hoteliers as serious warning that no region is immune and no hotel is completely safe (Natasa 2010). The only way to prevent or reduce insecurity threats is for the security department in the hotels to be alert all the time and play their roles with full responsibilities.</p> <p>The roles and responsibilities of the security department is to make sure that guest and employees are safe and properties are prevented from damage pro-active safety and security planning is an essential role in their operations. From guests’ and personnels’ safety to facility damage and serious liability issues, hotels face new and difficult challenges that must be addressed today to minimize vulnerability in the face of the unthinkable.</p> <p>       The number of terrorist attacks against hotels throughout the world over the last few years has underscored the need to assess each location and provide security solutions for both facilities and the people who populate them. These security solutions are tools meant for security department that with help facilitate the activities of the security personnel. And the tools are CCTV, walkie-talkie, metal detector device chemical/bomb detectors etc. Every security department in hotel should base on current intelligence and provides a thorough evaluation of the locality, and reliable, practical solutions to close vulnerability gaps, protect assets personnel and guest of hospitality establishment.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Every hotel has a unique profile which means equally unique vulnerabilities. The security department must use the latest intelligence relating to the current strategic and operational threats of insecurity and applies this knowledge to address risks and vulnerabilities. The roles and responsibilities of the security department includes a comprehensive analysis of the risks and vulnerabilities of both the building and the human processes including such issues as facility access procedures, communications emergency response policies, and engaged in existing security training programs.</p> <p>However the security A department in Nike Lake Resorts Every must understand and acknowledge full responsibility for security and safety of guest employees and properties. This can only be addressed when proper measures are put in place such as manpower development security tool and equipments like cutlass and guns.</p> <p>       The major problems in securing live and properties ia to know how to apply security measures, qualify personnel and equipment.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The project aimed at presenting a study on the roles and responsibilities of security department in safeguarding guests, employees, structure and content using Nike Lake Resort Enugu as a case study. Therefore, the specific objectives are as follows:</p> <p>1.  To examine the roles and responsibilities of security department in Nike Lake Resort Enugu.</p> <p>2.  To know whether the security department is capable of safeguarding guests, employees, structure and content in Nike Lake Resort Enugu.</p> <p>3.  To find out various security gadgets available in Nike Lake Resort Enugu.</p> <p>4.  To find out security challenges faced by the security department of Nike Lake Resort Enugu and to proffer solutions.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1.  What are the roles and responsibilities of security department in Nike Lake Resort Enugu.</p> <p>2.  Is the security department capable of safeguarding guest, employees, structure and content in Nike Lake Resort Enugu?</p> <p>3.  What are the various security gadgets available in Nike Lake Resort Enugu?</p> <p>4.  What are the security challenges faced by the security department and what are the solutions?</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This work reveals and provides both knowledge and some experiences regarding the special requirements of a professional assessment of the roles and responsibilities of security department in hotels. It also provides practical and intelligence-led solutions. It also, reveal that ththotel’s security department first responsibility is to its customers and that its security plans must be transparent and unobtrusive.</p> <p>       This work will be of benefits to Nike Lake Resorts because it will expose both the management and security department to current security measures that can be applied in the Hotel management. Hence this will led to optimum trust from guests employees and other state others when the issue of security measures for other industries since security is the responsibilities of everyone.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study presents the roles and responsibilities of security department in safeguarding guests, employees, structure and content the scope of the study is limited to Nike Lake Resort  Enugu. The study will also cover issues on security department and looking into the roles and responsibilities of the security department in the Hotel industry which will include internal and external security measures. The work also covers the psychological effects of safety and security on guest and conclude with a propose conceptual frameworks to provide safety and security in the Hotel industry.</p> <p><strong>1.7 LIMITATION OS THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In course of conduction this study there were some hindrances like not having enough materials to study, also the study is faced with time constraint as it has an effect on my study time in the framework of my school assignments and quizzes. Distribution and retrieval of questionnaire was also a big constraint inadequate finding was another source of limitation. This is because it took the researcher several months to go the area of study. Lack of good response from the respondents is also of problem as some of the staff are either say or do not want to respond for security reasons.</p>                                                          \n\nA CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF SAFETY AND SECURITY CONCERNS IN HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF SAFETY AND SECURITY CONCERNS IN HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY", "id": 66}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER I</p> <p>1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Relationships between employees and management are of substantial value in any workplace. Human relations is the process of training employees, addressing their needs, fostering a workplace culture and resolving conflicts between different employees or between employees and management. Understanding some of the the ways that human relations can impact the costs, competitiveness and long-term economic sustainability of a business helps to underscore their importance.Human relations in the workplace are a major part of what makes a business work. Employees must frequently work together on projects, communicate ideas and provide motivation to get things done. Without a stable and inviting workplace culture, difficult challenges can arise both in the logistics of managing employees and in the bottom line. Businesses with engaging workplaces and a well-trained workforce are more likely to retain and attract qualified employees, foster loyalty with customers and more quickly adapt to meet the needs of a changing marketplace.The quality of workplace relations is critical to employee retention. Employee retention may seem trivial — especially in a workplace that is used to a high turnover — but managers must remember that turnover is financially very costly. Every new employee requires a substantial investment of time and energy in their recruitment and training. In addition, severing ties with old employees can sometimes be challenging, especially if the circumstances are not particularly amicable. Making sure quality employees remain interested and engaged in the business requires patience, compassion and flexibility, but can actually make the business more financially sound.Workplace relationships provide a source of employee motivation, which is important to maintaining productivity. Employees who are interested in their work and in the well-being of other employees tend to be more productive than those who are not. This productivity pays obvious financial dividends to the company, as it can get more done in less time with fewer costs. Building relationships, by both recognizing an employee’s value to the company and a concern for their needs, often goes a long way.The modern business environment often rewards businesses that are able to quickly develop products that meet changing consumer needs. In some industries — such as technology, for example — employees’ ability to come up with effective new ideas is often the difference between the entire company’s success and failure. According to Sallyport Magazine, research shows that creativity is based to large degree in social interaction. Employees’ creativity is often dependent on their ability to communicate with other employees and share ideas. Without quality workplace relationships, employees are less likely to be able to develop and share the solutions that a business needs to survive.The research therefore seek to provide an evaluation of human relation on worker productivity</p> <p>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>One of the most significant developments in recent years has been the increased importance of interpersonal skills in almost every type of work setting. For many employers, interpersonal skills represent an important category of transferable skills a worker is expected to bring to the job. Technical ability only is usually not enough to achieve career success. Studies indicate that many people who have difficulty in obtaining or holding a job possess the needed technical competence but lack interpersonal competence.Owners and managers of profit and nonprofit organizations define human relations as fitting people into work situations so as to motivate them to work together harmoniously. The process of fitting together should achieve higher levels of productivity for the organization, while also bringing employees economic, psychological, and social satisfaction. Human relations covers all types of interactions among people—their conflicts, cooperative efforts, and group relationships. It is the study of why our beliefs, attitudes and behaviors sometimes cause interpersonal conflict in our personal lives and in work-related situations.HOWever,Many organization do not give importance to this aspect of work place condition. They neglect the aspect of human relation both between management and staff and between co –workers, through in effective communication channel, lack of cooperation and integration, unresolved complaints and conflict and maintain more of a rigid  formal work environment that do not enhance worker motivation and commitment. Therefore the problem confronting this research is to  provide an evaluation of human relation on worker productivity</p> <p>1.3                 RESEARCH   QUESTION</p> <p>What is the nature of human relation and its effect on worker productivity</p> <p>What is the nature of human relation and its effect on  worker productivity  in   union bank</p> <p>1.4            OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>TO determine the nature of human relation on worker productivity</p> <p>TO determine the nature of human relation on worker productivity in Union BANK</p> <p>1.5         SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The study shall  re –invent the culture of interpersonal relationship work skill in the organization</p> <p>as  a necessary tool for fostering unity , cooperation, problem sharing and solving, communication and integration of workers in the organization</p> <p>it shall also serve as a good source of information for managers and institutions.</p> <p>1.6          STATEMENT OF  HYPOTHESIS</p> <p>1    HO   Staff productivity in union Bank is low</p> <p>Ho    staff   Productivity in Union   Bank is high</p> <p>2     Ho     Human relation in  union Bank is low</p> <p>HI     Human  relation in  UNION    BANK    is  high</p> <p>3     Ho    impact of human relation on staff  productivity in Union Bank is low</p> <p>Hi     impact of human relation on staff  productivity in Union Bank is    high</p> <p>1.7           SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The study focuses on  the evaluation   of human relation on worker productivity with a case study of UNION BANK PLC</p> <p>1.8                DEFINITION OF TERM</p> <p>HUMAN RELATION DEFINED</p> <p>Human relations movement refers to the researchers of organizational development who study the behaviour of people in groups, in particular workplace groups and other related concepts in fields such as industrial and organizational psychology. It originated in the 1930s’ Hawthorne studies, which examined the effects of social relations, motivation andemployee satisfaction on factory productivity. The movement viewed workers in terms of their psychology and fit with companies, rather than as interchangeable parts, and it resulted in the creation of the discipline of human resource management.Elton Mayostressed the following:The power of natural groups, in which social aspects take precedence over functional organizational structures.The need for reciprocal communication, in which communication is two way, from worker to chief executive, as well as vice versa.The development of high quality leadership to communicate goals and to ensure effective and coherent decision making</p> <p>MENTAL PERCEPTION</p> <p>Mental perceptions are influenced by everything that has passed through an individual’s mind. That includes all of a person’s experiences, knowledge, biases, emotions, values, and attitudes. No two people have identical perceptions because no two people have precisely the same experiences.</p> <p>ETHICS</p> <p>Ethics refer to moral rules or values governing the conduct of a person or group. Perhaps more than anything else, an individual’s adherence to values related to what is morally right determines the respect that others hold for that person. Lack of respect for one individual by another is likely to lead to poor human relations between the two.</p> <p>PERSONALITY</p> <p>An individual’s personality is the totality of complex characteristics, including behavior and emotional tendencies, personal and social traits, self-concept, and social skills. The objective of many training sessions for employees and supervisors is to improve a person’s ability to get along with others. A person’s personality has a major impact on human relations skills.</p> <p>ATTITUDE</p> <p>An attitude is a mental position one possesses with regard to a fact, issue, or belief. Attitudes that often present problems in the workplace are those that concern biased and prejudiced viewpoints. Generally, employees who possess positive attitudes and who are open-minded are judged to have more desirable personalities than those with negative attitudes who hold biased viewpoints.</p> <p>COMMUNICATION</p> <p>Good communication is essential for the smooth functioning of any organization. Managers need clear lines of communication to transmit orders and policies, build cooperation, and unify groups. Employees must be able to convey their concerns or suggestions and feel that management has heard them. Clear communication among co-workers is vital to good teamwork, problem solving, and conflict management. In short, effective human relations is founded on good communication.</p>                                                          \n\nAN EVALUATION OF HUMAN RELATION ON WORKER PRODUCTIVITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN EVALUATION OF HUMAN RELATION ON WORKER PRODUCTIVITY", "id": 67}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><strong>This study was intended to evaluate the impact of knowledge management on organizational performance.

It has been characterized as the most pervasive yet least recognized human rights abuse in the world. This study explored the public perception of violence against women in urban and rural areas in Egor LGA of Edo State, Nigeria. A cross-sectional sample survey was adopted for data collection. A total of one thousand, one hundred and sixty five (1,165) male and female respondents who were 18 years and above were selected from two rural and two urban local government areas using simple random sampling method. The study employed a uniform set of structured questionnaire schedule, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions in data collection. The study indicated that there is a high level of awareness (90.0%) of violence against women in the State. The study equally revealed that people with medium level of education and female respondents were more aware of violence against women than their corresponding counterparts. Different forms of violence against women were identified in the study and they include beating, rape, humiliation, verbal abuse, widowhood practices, early marriage, sexual harassment, female genital mutilation, forced prostitution and trafficking in women. Consequences of violence against women include depression, suicide, murder, STDs, HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, physical injuries, highmortality, high blood pressure and sudden death. Therefore, the study recommends that government and non-governmental organizations should organize workshops and seminars in both urban and rural areas and also make wider their sensitization projects to the rural areas.<br/>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Gender-based violence has been the experience of women worldwide which has affected their relationship in the homes, communities, places of work and largely their productivity in their various places of assignments (amnesty international, 2005). An increasing amount of research highlights the health burdens, intergenerational effects, and demographic consequences of such violence (United Nations, 2006). The World Health Organization defines such violence as “the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, or psychological harm or deprivation” (Krug et al, 2002).</p> <p>Gender violence is a universal reality that had existed in all societies and human settlement regardless of class, income, culture or educational attainment. This paper focuses on domestic violence, a form of gender-based violence, which is defined here as any act of violence resulting in physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women, girls or men, including threats of such act, coercion, or arbitrary deprivation of liberty. Domestic violence is also known as domestic abuse, spousal abuse, battery, family violence and intimate partner violence (IPV). It is a pattern of abusive behaviors by one partner against another in an intimate relationship such as marriage, dating, family or cohabitation.</p> <p>Domestic violence, so defined, has many forms, including physical aggression or assault (hitting, kicking, biting, shoving, restraining, slapping, throwing objects), or threats therefore; sexual abuse; emotional abuse; controlling or domineering; intimidation; stalking; passive/covert abuse otherwise known as neglect; and economic deprivation (Seimeinuk et al, 2010). Domestic violence is not limited to obvious physical violence. It can mean endangerment, criminal coercion, kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, trespassing and harassment (National Network to End Domestic Violence 2011)</p> <p>The US office and violence Against Women (OVM) defines domestic violence as a “pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship that is used by one partner to gain or maintain power and control over another intimate partner”. The definition adds that domestic violence “can happen to anyone regardless of race, age. Sexual orientation, religion, or gender”, and can take many forms including physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional, economic and psychological abuse (Office of Violence against Women, 2007).</p> <p>Women are crucial to the growth and development of any nation and the world at large. They constitute half of the world’s population and are homemakers, custodians of social cultural and fundamental values of the society and permanent change is often best achieved through them. Full community development is impossible without their understanding, cooperation and effect management. Considering the importance of women as mothers, sometimes breadwinners, teachers and guardians, they deserve respect, recognition and better treatment but the opposite is usually the case. According to Davies (1999), women are enslaved in a circle of poverty and they suffer from neglect, discrimination and exploitation. They are also subjected to different of violence by their male counterparts.</p> <p>In Nigeria, domestic violence is widely acknowledge to be of great concern, not just from a human rights perspective but also from an economic and health perspective. Women are more at risk from this gender–based violence. There have been reports of husbands killing or maiming their wives in the media. The statistics presented by This Day (2011) newspaper are daunting. About 50% of women have been battered by their husband. Shockingly, more educated women (65%) are in this terrible situation as compared with their low income counterparts (55%). Most of the women endure believing they have nowhere to go and in any case, believing for good reason that the law will not protect them.</p> <p>A staggering 97.2% of them are not prepared to report to the Nigeria police. Only one state of the federation (Lagos been one of them) have passed laws against insidious crime, whilst several Bills against it languish in our male dominated National Assembly. Of the states that have passed it, the law is yet to be fully tested.</p> <p>Only recently in Lagos state, Titilayo Arowolo, a 27 year – old mother of one was gruesomely murdered by her husband. Arowolo was allegedly axed to death by her husband, Kolade, in their Isolo home in Lagos. Before that, the scandalous story of wife battering by one Nigerian Ambassador and a traditional ruler who engaged his wife in a public brawl made the rounds, thus bringing the issue of spousal abuse once again to the front burner.</p> <p>Domestic violence that occurs in private within the family, including rape, acid attack and sexual abuse affect the physical and psychological wellbeing of women; and as such, they seem to erode the position of women at home and in the society at large. Domestic violence against women therefore deserve to be researched upon so as to expose the existence of this discrimination against women and in the process provide possible solution to curb its prevalence.</p> <p>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>It is no longer an exaggeration that the rate of violence and crime against women, (especially Nigerian women) is on the increase as even the number of perpetrators of this violent act against women appears to be ever increasing on a daily basis. In almost every tribe, the status of women is very low and women are considered the property of men. Accordingly, a husband’s right to discipline his wife is accepted. This tradition seems not to be effective in preventing domestic violence against women.</p> <p>Many times, women are maltreated and considered inferior at home, workplace, schools and so on thereby making them suffer from beating; sexual assault; sexual harassment; denial of time for relaxation; denial of right to accumulate wealth even when women actually do most of the work; emotional and psychological abuse to mention just a few. Physically, women emerge from these violent episodes every time with black eyes, bruises, rape and burns to internal injuries to the psyche may be just as disabling. Little wonder why Iloegbunam (2006), stated that one of the ironies of history is the fact that despite the role women play both at home and in the society, they have remained unnoticed and even belittled. Further, there is an inter-generational effect on children who have witnessed violence, as they are more likely to be abusive themselves as adults. Violence against women constitutes a violation of the rights and fundamental</p> <p>freedoms of women and impairs or nullifies their enjoyment of those rights and freedoms.</p> <p>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The major aim and objectives of carrying out this study was to:</p> <p>1. Examine respondent’s perception of domestic violence.</p> <p>2. Identify the forms and the vulnerable group to face domestic violence.</p> <p>3. Find out the causes of domestic violence.</p> <p>4. Investigate the effect of domestic violence on women</p> <p>1.4 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</p> <p>To guide the investigation of the issue raised in the problem definition, it is hypothesized that:</p> <p>1. There is relationship between family structure and domestic violence</p> <p>2. Domestic violence inflicts injuries on victims</p> <p>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This study is crucial and timely especially as statistics showing the rate of domestic violence globally has been on a steady increase. Among other things,</p> <p>1. This study was meant to be an eye opener to the fact that domestic violence is prevalent in Nigeria and it’s something that needed to be dealt with owing to its many negative impacts on victims of such violent.</p> <p>2. upon providing evidence of its existence, the study was also meant to suggest solutions to the phenomena called domestic violence</p> <p>3. This study was also expected to add value to the existing body of knowledge for students, academicians and researchers who may appreciate the problem of domestic abuse in Nigerian society sand equally enhance the understanding of its consequences to the society</p> <p>4. Finally, it was hoped that the study would enable policy makers appreciate the problem and come up with appropriate remedies to address the problems associated with domestic violence.</p> <p>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Egor Local Government Area of Benin City, the capital of Edo state, Nigeria was used for the study mainly because of its heterogeneity in religious affiliation of female resident in the area.</p> <p>1.7 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>As a developing country, Nigeria does not have a sophisticated database of empirical studies on domestic violent. More so, due to the fact that Nigeria do not</p> <p>yet consider the issue of domestic violence a great crime as well as the differences in the definition of domestic violence, the major challenge to this study was finding research work that would help the researcher understand the problem broadly.</p> <p>For this reason, the study utilized any resource that relates to the research problem such as scholarly works, newspaper articles and journals.</p> <p>However, the study was restricted to Egor Local Government area of Benin City, therefore findings may not apply to the entire entity called Nigeria and the world in general.</p> <p>Finally, the sample in this research study was disproportionately located in Egor Local Government, Benin City, and so the result may not be a solid representation of the whole state.</p> <p>1.7 DEFINITON OF TERMS.</p> <p>Domestic violent: Domestic violent is a confrontation between family or household members that typically involves physical harm, sexual assault, or fear of physical harm.</p> <p>Wife battering: Wife beating refers to any abusive, violent, coercive, forceful, or threatening act or word inflicted by a member of the family or</p> <p>household on a woman in the society usually to establish power through fear and intimidation.</p> <p>Cohabitation: Cohabitation is the state or condition of living together as husband and wife without been married</p> <p>Socialization: From the perspective of society, socialization refers to the process of fitting new individuals into an organized way of life and an established cultural tradition.</p>                                                           \n\nEXAMINATION OF THE EFFECTS OF GENDER BASED VIOLENCE ON WOMEN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete </button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EXAMINATION OF THE EFFECTS OF GENDER BASED VIOLENCE ON WOMEN", "id": 69}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>The management of information technology plays a crucial role, especially in the communication and information sectors such as government establishments, where they build their competitive advantage on credibility and information.</p> <p>  Every aspect of management in the modern age relies heavily on information to thrive. Nothing moves without information and it is generally believed that information is power and that he who has it has power. It has even been described as a singular resource needed to develop other resources, including workers in an organization. That is whyOdger and Keeling (2000) deduced that one way businesses meet information needs is to use Management Information System (MIS).   One approach by which organization can utilize company's capability is through the development of Management Information System (MIS). There is no universally accepted definition of Management Information System (MIS) and those that exist reflect the emphasis and perhaps prejudice of their authors.</p> <p>  However, the term \"Management Information System\" (MIS) can be seen as a database management system tailored to the needs of managers or decision makers in an organization. MIS is a system using formalized procedures to provide management at all levels in all functions with appropriate information based on data from both internal and external sources, to enable them to make timely and effective decisions for planning, directing and controlling the activities for which they are responsible Argyris (1991). It should be noted from the above definition that the emphasis is on the uses to which the information is put. Planning, directing and controlling are the essential ingredients for \"Management\". In essence, the processing of data, information, and communicating the resulting information directly to the user, is the key function of MIS. It should, therefore, be noted that MIS exists in organizations in order to help them achieve objective to plan and control their processes and operations, to help deal with the uncertainties, and to help in adopting changing or indeed initiating change.</p> <p> Essentially, therefore, information has become a critical resource, just like energy, both of which are vital to the wellbeing of individuals and organizations in the modern world. Like energy and politics, technology is changing the ways in which information is captured, processed, stored, disseminated and used augured by Charles (2002).</p> <p> Management Information System (MIS) is generally thought of as an integrated, user-machine system providing information to support operations, management and decision-making function in an organization Abdullahi (2004). As a matter of fact, MIS is a special purpose system useful for management in an organization. MIS is an accessible and rapid conveyor belt for appropriate high quality information from the generation to its users.</p> <p>  The heart of an effective MIS, therefore, is a carefully conceived, designed and executed database. Its level corresponds to adaptive decisions. As a result, Management Information System (MIS) enhances the administrative process and the operations and decision-making powers of an organization. This explains why standard and digitalized information processing devices such as the computer, word processing and inter-net are highly welcome by organizations across the world.</p> <p>  Kotler (2006) in a simpler manner defines Management Information System (MIS) \"as a planned system of the collecting, processing, storing and dissemination of data in the form of information needed to carry out the functions of management. In a way it is a documented report of the activities that were planned and executed\". In other words, Management Information System (MIS) is an integrated user machine system for providing information to support the operation of management analysis and decision making function, which utilizes computer hardware's and software's as well as manual application for its procedures.</p> <p> Despite the utilization of Management Information System (MIS) in its various forms there still seems to be some problems that infringe on the effectiveness of decision-making by managers and the productivity of employees in an organization. This includes issues bordering on monitoring the system perhaps as a result of limited numbers of departmental managers and supervisors or their exit and also non-qualitative factors like morale of workers, attitudes of workers to work as well as the lack of flexibility of Management Information System (MIS) to update itself, thus calling for an investigation to provide needed balance Akinola (2003).Management Information System (MIS) seeks to know the motive for work and to find ways by which their realization can be helped and encouraged. This service has a dynamic aspect of management Saogy (1989).</p> <p>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>Management Information System (MIS) helps management in effective planning, organizing and controlling its workforce to achieve desired results. It therefore, means that the ineffective utilization of Management Information System (MIS) can result in low and poor quality production by workers. Also implies that Management Information System (MIS) is a necessity for successful management which could adversely affect the productivity of workers if not properly managed.</p> <p>Designing and implementing an effective information system for human resource management becomes a challenge to most government organizations and ministries. The cost and management of these systems at times becomes constraints in the achievement of organizational goals.</p> <p>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The main aim of the study is to examine the impact of management information system on effective human resource management in an organization. Specific objectives of the study are:</p> <p>To determine the problems associated with Management Information System (MIS).</p> <p>To determine how Management Information System influences the Human Resources Management.</p> <p>To identify the benefits of Management Information System (MIS) in the motivation of workers.</p> <p>To determine the role played by Management Information System (MIS) in the achievement of organizational goals.</p> <p>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>In-order to achieve the stated objectives and guide the study, the following research questions will be formulated:</p> <p>How can Management Information System influence the Human Resources Management?</p> <p>What are the benefits of Management Information System (MIS) in the motivation of workers?</p> <p>What role has Management Information System (MIS) played in the achievement of organizational goals?</p> <p>What are the problems associated with Management Information System (MIS)?</p> <p>1.5   RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</p> <p>1.

It is believed that both the individual and the organization need to know how well actual performance is contributing to the accomplishment of the job plans, the staffing plan, and ultimately the overall strategic plan of the organization. In addition, the individual employee requires feedback relative to his or her own goals development, as well as that relative to management™s expectations on  improving productivity.<br/>Performance appraisal is a formal and systematic assessment of an employee to determine the degree to which the employee is performing his/her job effectively. It is usually made in a prescribed manner of specific intervals such as quarterly, bi-annually or even annually. Each employee at one time or the other wants his immediate boss or more still his employer to assess his on-the-job performance, and where necessary give him guidelinesor advice for improving his efficiency.<br/>An effective performance review system serves these general purposes. In other words, as Nwachukwu (1985) puts it, \"the essence of performance appraisal is to give information for the promotion, demotion, transfer, pay increase, training and development and discharge of an employee on  improving productivity.<br/>Secondly, it provides employees with constructive on how they are performing in their jobs as viewed by their managers, thus leading to increased productivity.<br/>Therefore, in any organization, manpower remains the most prominent and the most valuable assets among other factors of production. It is this reason performance appraisal is given recognition as a tool to improve organizational activities on  improving productivity.</p>                                                         \n\nTHE EFFECT OF PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL IN IMPROVING PRODUCTIVITY IN AN ORGANIZATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL IN IMPROVING PRODUCTIVITY IN AN ORGANIZATION", "id": 71}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><b>THE EFFECT OF NON-MONETARY INCENTIVES ON EMPLOYEES PERFORMANCE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The study examines the effect of financial incentives on staff productivity in Niyya foods Kaduna. The research question that guided the study were: Is Niyya Food remuneration based on incentive scheme? What kind of financial incentive does Niyya Food give to its works and what are the effect on what workers? What kind of non financial incentives does Niyya Food use to boost workers productivity? What are the constraints militating against Niyya Food incentive schemes and how can it be overcome?A survey method was used for this study. The population  consisted of all Staff of Niyya Food Kaduna. Out of 158 persons, a  sample size of 70 was drawn from the total population using the stratified random sampling technique. A questionnaire developed by the researcher based on likert 5-point scale was used for the study. Mean scores was used to analyse the data based on the research questions. The research result shows that Niyya Food incentive scheme does not enhance  workers performance because, it does not take into cognizance in it remuneration and do  not even evaluate or appraisal workers  performance.It was recommended thatOther non financial incentives like lectures, seminar, symposium as well as Recreational facilities, such as club with sporting facilities, entry bar and other recreational facility that would help staff unwind after work should be designed and adopted. This will facilitate efficiency and increase productivity in Niyya Food.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Background to the Study            <br/>Statement of the Problem                    <br/>1.3    Objectives of the Study                            <br/>1.4    Significance of the Study                    <br/>1.5    Research Questions                        <br/>1.6    Scope of the Study                            <br/>1.7    Definition of key Term                        <br/>CHAPTER TWO <br/>LITERATURE REVIEW <br/>2.1    Introduction                                 <br/>2.2    Conceptual Framework                        <br/>2.2.1    The Concept of Financial and Non Financial Incentives            </p><p>2.2.2    Concept of Employee Performance            <br/>2.2.3     Concept of Performance Incentives in Workplace            <br/>2.2.4    The Nexus between Incentives and Productivity            <br/>2.3    Theoretical Framework                        <br/>2.3.1    The Evolution of Motivational Concepts                <br/>2.3.2    Process Theories of Motivation                    <br/>2.3.3    Need Theories                                <br/>2.3.4    Abraham Maslow Theory                    <br/>2.3.5    Murray’s Manifest Needs Theory                <br/>2.3.6    Herzberg, and his Two-Factory Theory                <br/>2.3.7    Evaluation of the Motivational Theories Reviewed            <br/>2.4    Empirical Literature                            <br/>2.4.1    The Effect of Financial and Non Financial Incentive to the Employee Performance                                    <br/>2.4.2    Impact of Incentive on Employee’s Motivation            <br/>2.5    Summary                                    <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>3.1    Introduction                             <br/>3.2    Population and Sample Size of the Study                 <br/>3.3    Source of Data Collection                         <br/>3.4    Method of Data Collection             <br/>3.5    Method of Data Analysis                             <br/>3.6    Summary                                    <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS <br/>4.1    Introduction                                     <br/>4.2    Analysis of Respondent’s Demographic Variables                 <br/>4.3    Data Analysis                                <br/>4.4    Summary of Findings                            <br/>4.5    Discussion of Findings                             <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS<br/>5.1    Summary                                 <br/>5.2    Conclusion                                 <br/>5.3    Recommendations                            <br/>Bibliography                <br/>Appendix I                <br/>Appendix II                                <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Background to the Study<br/>All organizations are concerned with what should be done to achieve high level of productivity through staff motivation using the right kind of incentive. Most organizations in the past have been using financial incentives but their workers are still agitating for increment in salaries. Consequently the effect of non financial incentive becomes a burning issue in human resource management(Okoh,2008).<br/>The issue of adequate motivation and consequently workers productivity is aproduct of a person’s set up of needs, goals, drive and experience. Byimplication, this means that factors which govern motivation, job satisfaction,workers productivity and attitude to work differ from one society to another.<br/>However, the entire issue of the implication of adequate motivation on workersproductivity is embedded in the various theories of motivation.<br/>People are motivated by various factors at different times, according to<br/>Wilkinson et al, the first factor is the combination of the individual perceptionsof the expectations other people have of them, and their own expectations ofthemselves. This happens because people come into work situations withvarious expectations.<br/>People work together in large organisations like bank, factory where they are expectedto follow orders, which they may not approve of. In addition, they may have to obeyinstruction from supervisors they had no hand in selecting. This is the type of situationwhere the worker might have no opportunity for self-expression. The basic question thatnow arises, relates to how to create a situation in which workers can satisfy theirindividual needs while working towards organisational goals. How can workers incorporateorganisation in Nigeriawho’s workers feel that their salaries are lowwhen compared with their contemporaries in other organisation?<br/>As such a lot of theoretical concept, principles and techniques of management have evolved in response to these challenges/ but most scholars suggest that more conceptual and empirical work is required to show the link between financial and non financial incentive and staff productivity is still vague but some studies have documented in their work that financial incentive is readily perceived as having a high instrumental value that makes putting forth extra effort worthwhile and its has a long term effect in terms of labour turnover rate because of comparative value for alternative employment while non financial incentive has less initial impact as the pragmatics of financial gain, they seem to have a steady, sustainable impact(Egbe,2008).<br/>Despite the growing body of literature and empirical study on the effect of non financial incentive on workers productivity, the subject matter still remains complex. Hence, the need to undertake a survey on the effect of   non monetary incentives on staff productivity in Niyya food and drinks company Ltd Kaduna. <br/>Statement of the Problem<br/>Most organizations in Nigeria are constraint with the problem of using non performance based element like salaries to compensate it staff as against performance-related pay structure which has hamper productivity because it does not make worker put in extra effort in their work. This is so because their compensation is not based on incentive schemes that elicit additional effort of workers sequel to unfriendly government legislation on wages clause and bureaucratic inefficiency. Hence the need for the research to examine the effect of non monetary incentive on employee productivity in Niyya Food and drinks Ltd Kaduna. <br/>1.3    Objectives of the Study<br/>The main objective of this study is to examine the effect of non monetaryincentive on staff of Niyya food and drinksKaduna. Other Specificobjectives are to:<br/>Assess whether staff remuneration is based on incentive schemes that motivate them.<br/>Examine all financial incentives given to staff and their effect on worker productivity.<br/>Identify non financial incentives used in boosting staff productivity.<br/>Evaluate out the constraints militating against incentive schemeNiyya Food and drinks and make recommendations to the identified problems.<br/>1.4    Significance of the Study<br/>This study brings to light the effect of non monetary incentives on staff performance in organization. The study may therefore be beneficial to the organization understudy in area of policy formulations as regard staff incentive schemes and remuneration.<br/>To education, the study may contribute to already existing knowledge on the effect of financial and non financial incentives on workers’ performance.<br/>Finally, to those in academics and human resource researches, the study may serve as a springboard for further investigations. <br/>1.5    Research Questions<br/>This study  provide answers to the following research questions:<br/>Is Niyya Food and drinks limited’s remuneration based on incentive scheme that motivate staff performance?<br/>What kind of financial incentive do Niyya food and drinks give to its workers and what are their effect on workers productivity?<br/>What kind of non financial incentive do Niyya food and drinks use to boost workers productivity? <br/>What are the constraints militating against Niyya Food and drinks incentive scheme and how can these constraints be overcome?<br/>1.6    Scope of the Study<br/>The study covers an empirical investigation of the effect of  non monetary motivation on staff productivity in Niyya Food and drinks.

It involved the close interaction of the world in terms of innovations, transportation, exchange of ideas and so on.</p> <p>Globalisation has so far had bearings upon culture and religion and even the mode of governance. Every country now sees that it needs others even in the most seemingly unimportant of things like music and education. In terms of religion, the exchange of ideas has influenced religious believe so that even the most polarized of religions now try to exhume more of similarities than dissimilarities especially in the most popular of beliefs. In terms of business:</p> <p>[g]lobalization is a term in business that refers to the integration of an organization's operations, processes and strategies into diverse cultures, products, services and ideas. Because of its emphasis on diversity, globalization also has a deep impact on the way companies manage their employees(Jeremy Bradley)</p> <p>This is the background to the present research we have set before ourselves here.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Globalisation, while changing the world order in the aspects of military, education, communication, entertainment also bears upon the development of business. In this regard it expands the market of any product and services so that every business learns the workings of every market it aims at going into and carries out a campaign with informed themes on market. What this widening of markets for any business means is that employers have to bear in mind the factors of globalisation even up to the point of managing their employers. And if the research effort which has gone into this research is anything to go by, the effects of globalisation on Human Resources practices has not been studied before.

The researcher carried on investigation to determine the impact   of effect of materials management on resource utilization in organization as it affect organization’s productivity and output in the field of resource control and management. The researcher went further to talk about the side effect of lack of adequate materials and resources used in industrial or manufacturing situation and the consequences it has placed the country at large. The researcher drew up questionnaire and administered them on forty six (46) staff of the company (Senior and junior staff). Only closed –ended questions were used in designing the questionnaire. Thus the questionnaire method was used in gathering the relevant data and information needed for the study. The researcher formulated hypothesis which comprises of Null hypothesis (HO) and hypothesis (Hi). The data used for the study were gathered and presented in tabular form using simple percentage method. Means while, the hypothesis formulated for the study were tested using chi-square (X2) distribution method. Finally, the researcher summaries the study, drew conclusion with respect to what has been discussed in the previous chapters and proffered recommendations among which state that, “management of an organization should be committed to their role and carry its people along.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work is titled the Effect of Materials Management on resource Utilization in Organization. A case study of 7up Bottling Company PLc  Kaduna.</p> <p>Arnold (1998) said that the wealth of any country is measured by its Gross National Product i.e the output of goods and services produced by the nation in a given time. He further defined materials as those physical objects i.e something we can touch, feel or see. Services are the performance of some useful function such as banking, medical care restaurants, clothing stores, or social services. But that the source of wealth of any country is measured by the amount of goods and services produced. A production process is needed to transform our resources into useful goods. Production takes place in all forms of transformation such as the transformation of resources to manufacture useful products.</p> <p>There are many stages between the extraction of resource materials and the final consumer product. At each stage in the development of the final product, value is added. Thus, creating more wealth. Japan is a prime example of this, it has very few national resources and buys most of the raw materials it needs. However, the Japanese have developed one of the wealthiest economy in the world by transforming the raw materials they purchased and add value to them through manufacturing. To get value out of our resources, we must design production process that will make products most efficiently. Once the process exist, we need to manage their operation so they produce goods more economically. Managing the operation means planning for and controlling the resources used in the process such as labour, capital, equipment and materials. They are all important but the management plans through effective flow of materials. The flow of materials controls the performance of the process. if the right materials in the right quantity are not available at the right time, the profitability and even existence of a company, will be threatened.</p> <p>Stevenson (1993) defined materials as all physical items used during production process. they includes not only the parts and raw materials that becomes the finished goods, but also the physical items needed to support the production process such as fuel, lubricants, tools, machinery, forms and anything else that is purchased, moved, stored or shipped.</p> <p>Follet (2001) defined management as the act of getting things done through people by planning, organizing, directing, coordinating and controlling.</p> <p>Stevenson (1993) defined materials management as the activity that is concerned with purchasing, storing, and movement of materials during production and with the distribution of finished goods.</p> <p>George (1993) said that, materials management is an aspect of industrial management which is concerned with all activities that may include production control, inventory, purchasing, expenditure, traffic, materials handling, welfare, receiving, shopping, scrap and surplus, disposition and customer services.</p> <p>Billington (1995) defined materials management as the process by which goods and services that an organization needs to achieve its objectives of buying, storage and movement of materials are required.</p> <p>Lyson (1996) defined materials management as the management process which integrates the flow of supplies into, through and out of an organization to achieve a level of services that ensures that the right materials are available at the right place at the right time, at the right quantity, right quality and at the right cost.   </p> <p>Arnold (1998) said materials management is a coordinating function responsible for planning and controlling materials flow, in order to maximize the use of the formed resources and also provide the required level of customer services. </p> <p>Iornum (2007) defined materials management as an integrated management approach to the planning, purchasing ware housing, storekeeping, allocation and movement of needed materials from one place to another. He further said that its also, the management of goods and materials that involves purchasing, storage, control and transportation. </p> <p>Knod (2008) defined materials management to incorporate a broad set of activities related to acquiring, moving or handling, storage and control or monitoring of materials, thus, purchasing, distribution and other supply-chain management duties could be included.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS </strong></p> <p>This research work focuses on the Effect of Materials Management on Resource Utilization in organization. Using seven up bottling company Plc Kaduna as a case study.</p> <p>Most organizations lays little emphasis on the need to adopt effective materials management techniques in their firms. This has resulted to high level of store insecurity, high cost of production and high level of customers dissatisfaction. Hence, it is because of this phenomenon that this study tries to examine the effect of material management on resource utilization in organization.</p> <p>The study examines the following problems:</p> <p>i.             Does materials management affects the utilization of resources in seven-up bottling company plc Kaduna</p> <p>ii.            Does materials management affect the profitability of organizations</p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>i.      To determine the effect of materials management on resource utilization in seven –up bottling company plc Kaduna</p> <p>ii.      To determine various materials management problems facing organizations.</p> <p>iii.          To ascertain and analyzed the various ways by which effective materials management technique can impact on the firm’s profitability. </p> <p><strong>1.4   STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>The following hypothesis will guide this study</p> <p>Ho:   There is no significant relationship between materials management and resource utilization on production organization </p> <p>H1:   There is significant relationship between materials management and resource utilization in production organization.</p> <p><strong>1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The researcher believes that the outcome of this study will be useful to both management and employees of process and manufacturing organizations in the country.</p> <p>It will also be important and useful to other industrialists and services rendering organizations at large.</p> <p>The findings of this study will provide useful information to production and operations officers, students and researchers. Thus, the main significance of this study, is for the partial fulfillment of the requirement for the award of Higher National Diploma (HND) in production and operations management and to increase the researchers knowledge and understanding on the subject matter.</p> <p>The research will also serve as a reference point for further    related research studies.</p> <p><strong>1.6   SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Due to the wide nature of the topic and the nature of the organization used as a case study, this research work was limited to only seven-up bottling company plc. Kaduna particularly, the store department of the organization. Thus, the study sourced primary data from the staffs in the store department of the organization. Also, the study will consider relevant related literatures to provide the appropriate conceptual base for the study.</p> <p><strong>1.8   HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE CASE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Seven –up Bottling Company Plc is one of Nigeria’s leading carbonated soft drink (CSD) manufacturers was founded by Mi”. Mohammed El-Khalil, a Lebanese, in the year 1959. The Company commenced operation on October 1, 1960, which coincided with Nigeria’s Independence  day, with just one plant in Ijora-Lagos (now the administrative head office). Records showed that on that same day, a total of 14 cases of seven-up flavour were produced.</p> <p>The company was quoted in the Nigerian Stock Exchange and went public in 1984. Through hard work and determination, the company has been able to expand its plants and distribution networks to all parts of the country, its greatest period of growth actually started in the early 80’s with the opening of Ibadan plant (1980), Ikeia plant in 1981, Kano plant in 1985 and Aba plan in 1989. The acquisition of John Holt soft drinks brought Kaduna plant to limelight in late 1989. The company later opened Benin plant in 1996, Ilorin plant in 2000 and Enugu plant in 2002.</p> <p><strong>The company’s vision statement</strong> is “To be the most admired and innovative company in Nigeria by the year 2012”.</p> <p><strong>The mission statement </strong>is “To refresh and inspire a youthful lifestyle”.</p> <p>The Company produces 7-up, Pepsi, Mirinda orange, mirinda soda, mirinda lemon, mirinda fruity, mirinda tonic and teem lemonade.

The researcher discusses the various styles of leadership adopted by different managers which are autocratic, Laissaz-faire, Participative (democratic), transitional and transformational leadership. Leadership within policing has evolved over the years in some organizations to a more participative style and yet there are still leaders who cling to an antiquated domineering style. The objective of this research work is to identify the organizational leadership strategies and organization changes that have molded or are molding the policing culture. An in-depth review of the transactional and transformational style of leadership was seen as being the styles that a leader in the 21st century would want to use to meet the needs of their employees and motivate them toward success and self-actualization. A survey method was carried out by the researcher to gather information on the research work. Questionnaire was designed using structured questions to collect primary data from staff of Joint Admission Matriculation Board, Kaduna Annex. The finding revealed that a leadership strategy has contributed to the achievement of the organizational objective. Based on the finding from this research, a number of recommendations were made which include that federal government should designed programme that will support the activities of the Board and also create officer that will coordinate and monitor the affair of the management. </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p>1.1    <strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Organizational leadership strategy is a process, which allows management to be proactive rather than reactive in shaping its own future. A focused organizational leader provides and establishes visionary leadership to his organization. He understands and appreciates responsive options to the change in the management environment.</p> <p>He develops viable strategies based upon sustainable competitive advantages. A good organizational leader develops a proactive approach to strategic management, whereby management rather than just identifying and responding to change, anticipates is the bane of indigenous business organization in developing countries. </p> <p>It is therefore, expected that the findings of this study will go a long way in improving the leadership class. Leadership is the ability to persuade other to seek defined objective enthusiastically. It is human fact, which binds a group together and motivates it toward it goals, (David 2003).</p> <p>Robin, (2000) defined leadership as the ability of superiors to direct, guide and motivates people towards the attainment of given set of goals in an organization. The source of influence may be formal such as that provided by the possession of managing rank in an organization or informally outside the organization structure. Most organizational theorists agree that effective leadership is one of the most important contributors to overall organizational success. </p> <p>Thus the quality of an organization’s determining the quality of the organization itself. The natural quality of an individual in the environment in which he operate on daily events are they unfold coupled with other factors do influence his leadership pattern. Leaders are not as such born, but are in fact made. A manager may be a boss but not necessarily a leader.</p> <p>Armstrong (2001) laid out four main characteristics of transformational leadership when he discussed the </p> <p>transformational leadership of sport term’s coaches. Emphasizing ethical behavior, sharing a vision goal, improving performance through charismatic leadership and leading by example. This shows a simplified version of the components of transformational leadership provided by Bass (2001), which also has four elements intellectual stimulation, individual consideration, inspirational leadership and idealized influence. Though, many leadership researchers have argued in support of effective leadership having a positive impact on behavior with in organizations, especially transformation leadership role in improving many factors of organization.</p> <p>1.2    <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>An organization that has no good leadership is like a ship on the high sea without a captain. Resources both man and material will be bound to be wasted despite scare nature. If organization leaders are developed, economic development and growth in unending controversy as to the transferability of management principle and theories, Gonzales and Macmillan (2003), given the fact that most widely dispersed management theories and </p> <p>techniques are based on western ideology and valve systems, their uncritical transfer to developing countries has in many ways contributed to organizational inefficiency and ineffectiveness Kanungo and Iaeger (1999).</p> <p>In management, there is a consensus approach to leadership is not appropriate leadership style adopted should depend on the valves and personality of the leader the subordinate and the organization culture. The challenges of the study are to unearthen the role of culture in shaping the leadership strategies in JAMB as organizational leaders in educational institute in Nigeria and their admission into various tertiary institutes.</p> <p>In this sense, the joint admission and matriculation board (JAMB) lack the performance imperative in which the researcher highlight that can be construed as representing a cluster of defined discretionary problems or obligations requiring collective action for organizational success. For example, the nature and rate of technical change can pose a number of challenges to organizational leaders, how information is to be gathered and distributed, how to interpret the resulting flood of data, and how to gain comp active advantages from technological advances in both production and human resources system are just a few of these. In the same way, financial imperative challenges executive’s decisions.</p> <p>Senior staffing imperatives follow these challenges as executives strive to create the right human resources combination for their strategic choices. Thus a functional or social problem solving perspective of leadership is necessarily grounded in a contextual framework that present fundamental performance imperatives demanding organizational choices. The researcher intends to find out the assessment of organizational leadership strategies on organization changes in JAMB office Kaduna.</p> <p>1.3    <strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The general purpose of the study is to assess the contribution of organizational leadership strategies and how its influence organization changes. The specifics objectives of the study are:</p> <p>-         To identify the various6 types of leadership strategies adopted by managers.</p> <p>-         To ascertain the environment forces influencing the adoption of such strategies.</p> <p>-         To determine the predominant leadership strategic adopted by manager.</p> <p>-         To determine the efficiency of such strategies in achieving organizational objective in these organization.</p> <p>-         To support alternative where necessary to improve leadership effectiveness.</p> <p>1.4    <strong>STATEMENT OF THE QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>Assessing and militates against effective of organizational growth and develop model for predicting the future organizational leadership strategies need on organization changes.</p> <p>The following research questions are also relevant to this study:</p> <p>-         What are the various types of leadership strategies adapted by managers?</p> <p>-         Is there any] predominant leadership strategies adopted by managers?</p> <p>-         What are the environmental force which influence the adoption of such strategies?</p> <p>-         Is there any efficiency of such strategies in achieving organizational objectives in this organization?</p> <p>-         What are the support alternative strategies where necessary to improve leadership effectiveness?</p> <p>1.5    <strong>JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study of organizational leadership strategies on organization changes sees to be important both from the theoretical and practical perspective. The cause of organizational collapse might have wrong leadership strategies, poor implementation of strategies, wrong leadership styles and other elements. This study will assist to enhance the understanding of organizational leadership strategies on environment as influence factor in organization changes. the result could be used as a guide for existing organization to adopt in order to survive and sustain growth.</p> <p>Therefore, this study can help managers to correctly adopt leadership strategies for decision making which can be used to achieve, control and coordinate their activities more effectively in any organization.</p> <p>1.6    <strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is intended to cover the assessment of organization leadership strategies on origination changes in joint Admission   Matriculation Board (JAMB) Kaduna. This study is also constrained in terms of time, finance and logistics. Also lack of cooperation from the staff and most importantly, lack of encouragement by the management of the organization.</p> <p><strong>1.7   ORGANISATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS</strong></p> <p>Organizational effectiveness was succinctly defined by Daff (1999) as “the degree to which an organization realized its goals”. Organizations pursue multiple goals and such must be achieved in the face of competition limited resources, and disagreement among interest groups.</p>\n\nAN ASSESSMENT OF LEADERSHIP STRATEGIES ON ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ASSESSMENT OF LEADERSHIP STRATEGIES ON ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE ", "id": 75}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><strong>Production skills is a basic element in maintaining the production capacity of an organization is an important function in any production organization. The reprocess of any organization is made up of both it’s human and material assets, which are the source of generating revenue and growth. A great deal of production skills, is required to harness both the human, machine, materials, money, and assets of a production firm, and stay on top of the business, been a competitive market. Where there are various competitors in the market, the production manager should posses production skills to enable him outsmart other competitors in the market where materials, plants, and machineries are ignored, neglected, they are bound to loose values, and in some cases it lead to high staff turnover and eventually lost of product quality. Lost of sales, lack of workers safety, and at times can even lead to the winding up of such firms, without production skills. Emphasis will be on how these skills can sustain and develop more features to remain on top, or gain competitive advantage. It is  also be noted that lack of skills, can make an industry run into a great downfall to an extent of winding up. This research work will be important to coach and train workers for them to become skilled and enable them to be the best in other to be at advantage over their competitors.</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><em><strong>Production skills (defined)</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Industries and business organization be it private or public, have one thing in common, the human workforce, this could confidently be said, that organization, will not exist without its human resources, since a business organization cannot even start without a workforce, and effective and efficient skills, will gear the ability of the organization to stand out among its competitors.</strong></p> <p><strong>Production control is defined by Burbidge (1992). In his book the principles of production control, “Is the function of management which plans, directs and controls the material supply and processing activities of an enterprise, so that the specified products are produced.  By specific methods to meet an approved sales programme. These activities being carried out in such a manner that the labour, plant and capital available are used to the best advantage. </strong></p> <p><strong>Poter (2006). In his book, effective entrepreneurship, he is of the view that companies can choose between three general strategy to build competitive advantage a differentiation strategy, a low-cost strategy and third approach, frequency used by entrepreneurs in focus, or ninche strategy. A firm that uses a differentiation strategy competes on the basis of its ability to do things differently than its major competitors do. </strong></p> <p><strong>Beal, Reginald (2000). In his journal competing environmental scanning competitive strategy and organizational performance in small manufacturing firms is of the view that pursuit of an effective entrepreneurial strategy is mainly through advantages, has been mapped through the collection and analysis of information from existing and potential customers.</strong></p> <p><strong>Boxalla (1996) Boxall 1996 defines strategy as a firm’s frame work of critical ends and means. This definition helps to make the point clear, that means do not flow unproblematically from ends. Rather the historically developed means to shape what ends are conceivable and possible. </strong></p> <p><strong>Mitchell Porter (1984), Competitive advantage is a very basic word, a position a firm occupies against its competitors. The three methods of creating a sustainable competitive advantage are through: cost leadership, differentiation and focus.</strong></p> <p><strong>Iornum (2005). In his book introduction to material management defines material management as practical in business today, as “ A confederacy of traditional materials, activities bound by a common idea; the idea of an integrated management approach to planning, conversion flow and distribution of production materials from the raw materials state to the finished product state. Managers or individual should understand that core competencies include the particular set of skills and resources firm posses as well as the way those resources are used to produce outcome.</strong></p> <p><strong>Usage of these resources depends on the skills and ability of the human work force in the organization. Therefore the need for effective and skilled labour is required to stage ahead in competing with other competitors. The creation of knowledge is a dynamic and continues process.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.2      STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong></p> <p><strong>In the past years, various issues to the effective management of industries and business organizations to gain competitive advantage over others have been noticed and highlighted as follows:</strong></p> <p><strong>Unskilled Labour:</strong></p> <p><strong>Unskilled labour has been the major problem facing industries and business organization, this is as a result of personnel managers, not recruiting and selecting employees, base on merit, skill, and expertise, but rather on selection based on man know man, a connection of whom you know to get to were you want. Hence, the effect is having the wrong people at the right place and thereby affecting the quality of service or product to be delivered to the market.</strong></p> <p><strong>In Nigeria today, you will be surprise, seeing somebody who read a different course entirely been employed in a different field. i.e. a mechanical engineer working in a banking sector, such the expected performance will be upturned and unsatisfactorily.</strong></p> <p><strong>Technology </strong></p> <p><strong>Inability of industries and business organization. To use the modern ways to get things done, effectively and efficiently. Is another major problem, A supplier may be expected to produce technical, particularly during the early stages of design and manufacturing.</strong></p> <p><strong>Late Delivery speed</strong></p> <p><strong> Inability to make the product or deliver the service quickly “in some markets a firm’s ability to deliver more quickly than its competitors may be critical. A company can offer an on-site repair service in only/or 2 hours, has a significant advantage over a competing firm that guarantee service only within 24 hours.</strong></p> <p><strong>In-ability to cope with changes in demand</strong></p> <p><strong>Changes its volume, in many market, a company’s ability to respond to increase and decrease in demand is important to its ability to compete. Its is well known that a company with increasing demand can do little wrong.</strong></p> <p><strong>Poor product quality and reliability </strong></p> <p><strong>Customers wants product without defects, thus the goal of process quality is to produce defect-free products and services, product and service specification, give in dimensional tolerance and/or service error rate. Define how the product or services is to be made.</strong></p> <p><strong>Adherence to the specification is critical to ensure the reliability of the product or service as defined by its intended use.</strong></p> <p><strong>Cost or price</strong></p> <p><strong>Is another problem when the price of any product is too high it affects its competitive strength in the market.</strong></p> <p><strong>Scarcity of fuel/petroleum products</strong></p> <p><strong>I find out that sometimes when the refineries are working in full capacity, the dealers and distributors of the petroleum products hoard these products and truck drivers are said to be diverting these product elsewhere.</strong></p> <p><strong>The pipeline and products marketing company, should be also monitoring the activities of the tanker drivers, to ensure effective and efficient distribution of the petroleum products. However, all efforts have been to no avail, because usually during festival periods or towards the end of the year, fuel scarcity is experienced in most towns and cities in the country.</strong></p> <p><strong>Most of these times there are no official explanation for the scarcity. There are unpleasant long queues of people waiting to buy petrol hours wasted by house wives looking for kerosene to cook for the family, since cooking gas is out of reach to an ordinary Nigerian. </strong></p> <p><strong>With the suffering of the people in general and increase of transportation fare’s it does not speak well of an oil producing country like Nigeria for this reason, the situation needs to be properly addressed which is what prompted the researcher to undertake this research and also to give a situation analysis and meaningful recommendation.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.3      OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>The objective of the study is to analyse the impact of production skills in the management of industries/business organization to portray how far the application of production skills in the management has helped the discipline level.</strong></p> <p><strong>In this case therefore, it is important to note that management is a very complex situation, because human beings as individuals interact with one another in groups and in large organization. It is also very important to note that every human behaviour has a cause, there is a reason for a person behaving as he does.</strong></p> <p><strong>It aims to explain that a favourable working environment couple with employees loyalty and commitment and skill to work increase productivity.</strong></p> <p><strong>Finally, management could also gain from this study in that, it will help management to provide necessary refresher courses all categories of personnel to sharpen their already acquired skills.</strong></p> <p><strong>It also helps the management in facilitating their objectives and aims which are as follows:</strong></p> <p><strong>-         To profitably export petroleum products to existing and potential market at a minimum cost</strong></p> <p><strong>-         To provide an un-interrupted supply  of crude oil to the refineries</strong></p> <p><strong>-         To stimulate the sale of special products and promote import subscription of petroleum products and special products, i.e. (9waxes, base oil, bitumen, etc).</strong></p> <p><strong>1.4      STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p><strong>In order to be able to achieve the objective of our research, the following hypothesis have been developed and presented for testing:</strong></p> <p><strong>HO:</strong><strong> That application of production skills in the management of industries and business organization has no significance impact profitability of an organization </strong></p> <p><strong>HI:</strong><strong> <strong>HO:</strong> That application of production skills in the management of industries and business organization has a significance impact profitability of an organization </strong></p> <p><strong>1.5      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>The research project will be of immense benefit to all management staff and captains of industries on the important of skills. Production skills in organization and industries will help in achieving the desired objectives of providing good quality services profit making, alertness and discipline in every aspect.</strong></p> <p><strong>The project will highlight the importance of skills in the management of industries/business organization and its importance cannot be over-emphasized, to also state that production skills in organization will contribute a lot to the survival of the organization/industry and it hedge out other competitors.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.6      SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>Due to the nature of the topic and the organization under this research, the research work shall be limited to pipe-line product Marketing Company Kaduna and in particular the production department of the organization. However, note could be made where necessary of other petrochemical industries or department within the sector to arrive a conclusion with regards to production skills.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.7      LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>1.  The fact that the researcher has to some extent enjoyed the cooperation of some interviewers, does not mean that I was not at least neglected and restricted in some departments</strong></p> <p><strong>2.  The major limitation of the study was the time constraint</strong></p> <p><strong>3.  In carrying out this study, the researcher traced some constraint such as non availability of adequate equipment and modern infrastructure in P.P.M.C</strong></p> <p><strong>4.  Other limitation was the penalty for employing untrained and unskillful personnel</strong></p> <p><strong>1.8       HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF CASE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>BRIEF HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE COMPANY (PPMC)</strong></p> <p><strong>The pipelines and products marketing company limited (PPMC) was incorporated in November 1988 as a subsidiary of  the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). The emergence of the company was by no means accidental, but as a result of a painstaking effort at revolutinalizing, mordernizing and commercializing the activities of NNPC and its integral parts. Its evolution commenced some twenty years ago as a result of the economic boom of the early 70s which led to the unprecedented and phenomenal rise in domestic petroleum consumption. The private sectors capacity and capability then proved rather inadequate to service effectively the demand growth. The ensuring production and distribution, constraints precipitated incessant supply demand crisis.</strong></p> <p><strong>Long queues at the limited retail outlets (filling station) were a common sight. The government responded decisively by planning and executing the construction of two or more refineries one each at Warri and Kaduna respectively and also a country wide 3,000 kilometers petroleum products pipeline network linked to storage depots. By February 1979, following the completion of the Port-Harcourt –Aba-Enugu-Markurdi pipelines systems, the need to have an organization to operate and manage the system became necessary. A pipeline unit was consequently established. An American company, Williams International group Incorporated (WIGI) provided “ technical back up” to the unit. Department of the then commercial Division had for long been responsible for the distribution and marketing of petroleum products both departments to form the Pipeline and Products Marketing Division (PPMD), in 1982 was natural.</strong></p> <p><strong>In 1985, NNPC was re-organized into sectors for the first time “well defined strategic business units with well defined corporate objectives emerged”. The pipeline and products marketing sector (PPMS) was formed through the merger of the pipelines operation (POD) and the products marketing and marine transportation division (PMMTD) PPMS) later metamorphosed into PPMC limited during the 1988-re-organisation. The business mission of PPMC is to ensure adequate and reliable supply of petroleum products to the domestic market, safely and at low operating cost; market petrochemical and special products competitively in the domestic and international markets provide excellent customer service by effectively and efficiently transporting crude oil to the refineries and moving petroleum products to the market.</strong></p> <p><strong>The company has its head office located a long Kachia Road behind the Kaduna refinery and Petrochemical  company, with five depots and five pump stations namely; Kaduna depot, Kano depot, Jos depot, Gusau depot, Suleja depot and Minna depot. The pump stations include Sarkin Pawa pump station, Izom pump station, Zaria Pump station, Kaduna pump station and Abuja pump station.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.9      DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Management:</strong><strong> According to Rosser (1073) management is the utilization of physical and human resources, through co-operative efforts, resulting in the performance of functions of planning, organizing, staffing, directing and controlling.</strong></p> <p><strong>Skill:</strong><strong> This is the learned ability to bring about pre-determined results with maximum outlay of time or energy or both. Skills also can be defined as the capacity to bring about and end results with maximum certainty, minimum energy or minimum time.</strong></p> <p><strong>Industries:</strong><strong> collection of firms, producing similar product to produce a particular product as an end product.</strong></p> <p><strong>Application:</strong><strong> This is the action of putting something necessary into operation</strong></p> <p><strong>Strategy</strong><strong>: The process of planning something or putting a plan, into operation in a skillful way. A plan that is intended to achieve a particular purpose.</strong></p> <p><strong>Advantage</strong><strong>: A thing that helps you to be better or more successful than other people. A quality of a product that makes it better or successful or to put somebody in a better position than others people or than they were in before.</strong></p>\n\nTHE APPLICATION OF PRODUCTION SKILLS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF BUSINESS ORGANIZATION TO GAIN COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE APPLICATION OF PRODUCTION SKILLS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF BUSINESS ORGANIZATION TO GAIN COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE", "id": 76}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1   <strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Human Resource Development (HRM) as a theory is a framework for the expansion of human capital within an organization through the development of both the organization and the individual to achieve performance improvement. Many employees have failed in organizations because their need for training and development was not identified and provided as an indispensable part of management function. Human Resource Development deal with the activities undertaken to expose an employee to perform additional duties and assume positions of importance in the organizational hierarchy.</p> <p>Nwachuku C.C (2007) Human Resource Development refers to any actions which is deliberately aimed at improving once skills, knowledge, habit or attitude in the performance of a given task, either in the present or in the future. It is the creation of an environment where people or employees may require or learn specific job related behaviours, knowledge, skills, ability and attitude.</p> <p>Human resource productivity is a function of ability, will and situational factors. An organization may have employees of ability and determination with appropriate equipment and managerial support yet productivity falls below expected standards. The missing factors in any cases are the lack of adequate skills and knowledge which are acquired through training and development. An untrained worker (employee) is like a dangerous animal-once an employee has received adequate training, he is in a more confident position to contribute effectively towards the realization of organizational goals.</p> <p>Training and development is capable of making important contribution to the goals an enterprise or Business organization. Training can therefore describe not as an end in itself but as a continuous activity and an integral part of a business system.</p> <p>The management activity of preparing employees for future job (task) responsibilities is known as management development wealth and Davis (1982) mentioned that “the distinction between training and development is of intend. Training prepares employees to do their present job while development prepares for the future job. Both training and development teach employees needed skills, knowledge or attitude”.</p> <p>Regardless of its purpose, management development must be dynamic in nature but must adopt the approach that promises best produce the desired change. Each manager in an organization is responsible for fostering the development of his subordinates. This responsibility includes establishing training programmes and measurement of training result. Development of the executive is the development of the organization grow and development for high-profit.</p> <p>1.2   <strong>Statement of the Problems</strong></p> <p>The challenge in management industry or business organization has posed a treat on the realization and achievement of its set development and achievement of its set objectives this as resulted to fundamental issues of inadequate and improper acquisition, utilization and maintenance of its human resources.</p> <p>The under utilization of human resources in organizations has seriously led the organization in this because human factor is not properly managed. Mismanagement is another serious problem in our organization today and has reduced it to nothing as people are no longer kin with the work nor ready to own up to vital resources in the organization.</p> <p>Therefore the poor quality and low product have revealed the quantity of human resource put in place in Seven up Bottling company are not up to expectations and has thereby reduced the company company’s productivity.</p> <p>1.3   <strong>Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is to examine critically the effect of Human resource Development programmes on employee’s productivity. However, other sub-objectives of the study are as follows:</p> <p>                i.        To identify the need for development of employee in an organization.</p> <p>              ii.        To examine the problem of developing employees productivity in an organization</p> <p>            iii.        To find out whether development programmes could enhance an increase the productivity and smoothen the operation of an organization.</p> <p>             iv.        To determine whether human resource development programme does not enhances employee’s performance.</p> <p>               v.        To determine how resources development programme can enhances employee’s performance.</p> <p>             vi.        To examine the impact of development in an organizational performance.</p> <p>           vii.        To contribute to the existing knowledge and how best to administer development in achieving the set goals and objective of organization.</p> <p>1.4   <strong>Statement of Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>These study is based on the assumptions that development is very important and necessary to improve or increase the maintenance and enhancement of organizational ability to achieve its objectives.</p> <p>Therefore for this study, the following hypothesis has been postulated or formulated.</p> <p><strong>Ho:</strong>   Human resource development programme does not enhance employee’s performance.</p> <p><strong>Hi:</strong>    Human resource development programme have enhances employees performance.</p> <p>1.5   <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The significances of the study brings out the need for an organization to continuously develop and improve the human resource and productivity of a business organizational performances.</p> <p>Development is inevitable to human resource management. This is because continuous development will help to expose the individual worker to new technology, which increase productivity. The study will contribute positively at the rate at which, human resource can be effectively utilized and how it can bring about high productivity in an organization.</p> <p>It is also hope that the study will assist in future researchers of human resource development on the productivity in business organization.</p> <p>Development is important because it bring about job satisfaction through the enhancement of status, salary of the worker (employee) which usually increase the purchasing powers of the individual employees.</p> <p>Therefore the significance of the study is to both the individuals, employees and the organization as a whole.</p> <p>1.6   <strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The scope of this study is limited to Seven-Up Bottling company Kaduna, the effect of human resource development on employee productivity.</p> <p>1.7   <strong>Limitations of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study is limited to the effect of human resource development on business development for high-profit in business organization. This research work is associated with some constraint and difficulties which include the following:</p> <p>              i.        <strong>Financial Constraint:</strong> This is considered as the first problem or constraint encountered by the researcher. This hindered the student in getting all the needed data for the research work. This really did not help matters due to the fact as a student, there is always limited found at once disposal which formed part of those factors which discourage the researcher to go further and extend this study.</p> <p>            ii.        <strong>Time Constraints:</strong> This was the biggest constraints faced by the researcher because combing rigorous during of the institution in lectures, assignments (both individual and group) test, personal reading etc. and the carrying out of the research.</p> <p>          iii.        <strong>Unavailability of Data: </strong>Incomplete and inaccurate data also provide a lot of difficulty in undertaking this research work. As a matter of fact it is because most of the senior staff were either too busy running their official responsibility that makes them hardly available to give the researcher the needed time to gather the information or were not just working to do that, though some did not cooperate just like the senior staff.</p> <p>1.8   <strong>Historical Background of Seven-Up Bottling Company Plant</strong></p> <p>Seven-Up bottling company was conceived in the year 1959 and was actualized in 1960, when Nigeria as a nation was celebrating her independence on 1st October 1960. Seven-Up Bottling Company was rolling out her first product at the same time. The company has grown tremendously since then, when it started by producing on 7-Up and Orange crushes in Lagos and Ibadan.</p> <p>The company’s product rose to greater height when she acquired the right franchise from Messis Pepsi-Cola international of New York to battle and market Pepsi-cola, Mirinda orange, Mirinda Soda, Mirinda-tonic and Teem lemon ride, leading to the commissioning of plant all over the country in Illorin, Abba, Kaduna and Benue.</p> <p>The Kaduna plant was brought over from Arewa bottles in 1978. Seven-Up bottling company has set the price in credible authentic consumer’s sales promotion as well as making sure consumers get the value for their money.</p> <p><strong>Soft Drink Industries</strong></p> <p>Currently two soft drink companies operate in the market environment of Kaduna city today the Seven-Up bottling company Plc products of 7-Up, Pepsi, Teem and Lemon Mirinder products while the Nigerian bottling company distributing Coca-cola, Fanta-orange, Fanta-tonic, Fanta club soda and Sprit. Presently Seven-Up bottling company is striving hard to lead been second best to Coca-cola which is the largest soft drink producer in the country. The higher skilled sales force and unique products of company has generated loyalty from esteemed consumers and dealers of 7-Up bottling company.</p> <p><strong>Sales Territories</strong></p> <p>Seven-Up bottling company Kaduna plant has been divided into main sales territories making up the region. The sales territories are the Kaduna metro headed by the manager depot. At present the company has a few depot based in Jos, Suleja, Minna and Abuja. The Minna depot is headed by the depot manager while the three (3) other are headed by the depot superintendent. All depot reports directly to the sales manager depot, each sales territory is manned by competent salesmen and their sales assistance. The cost of manning each depot is usually analysed and compared equally to cost of depot superintendent. All depots report directly to the sales manager depot, each sales territory is manned by competent salesmen and their sales assistance.</p> <p><strong>Organizational Structure of Kaduna Region Seven-Up Bottling Company Kaduna Plant</strong></p> <p><strong>(Company Organization Chart)</strong></p> <p>1.9   <strong>Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>In order to avoid any form of ambiguity as regards to the terms used in this research work the following given optional definition:</p> <p><strong>Human Resource Development:</strong> This is the activities undertaken to   expose an employee to perform additional duties an assume position of importance in organization.</p> <p><strong>Productivity:</strong> Is the measure of how well resource are brought together in organizations and utilized for accomplishing a set of results, productivity is reaching the highest level of performance with the least expenditures.</p> <p><strong>Organization:</strong> This is the process of dividing work into convenient tasks or duties or grouping such duties in the format posts delegation of authority to each post and approving qualified staff to be responsible that the work is carried out as planned.</p> <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Is a term used to describe those processes both instructive and national by which people seek to satisfy the basic desires, perceived needs and personal goals which trigger human behavior.</p> <p><strong>Development:</strong> Is the act of improving once ability to face future job responsibility or challenges.</p> <p><strong>Management Development:</strong> According to Chile (1969) management development can be seen or defined as an economic resource that performs a technical function such as planning, organizing, staffing, Directing and controlling.</p> <p><strong>Training:</strong> Is the improvement of an employees skill or performance to help the individual employees current job effectively. B.S. Dele (1991) in book Management training and education sees training as the organized procedure by which people acquire knowledge and skill for a definite purpose.</p> <p><strong>Unitilization:</strong> This is a set of guidelines that will help make sure that each person gets right services and supports at the right time, in the right amount and as long as they need them</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT ON EMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT ON EMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY ", "id": 77}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    <strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></strong></p> <p><strong>Production Planning and Control are terms that though commonly used have witnessed a lot of changes both in meaning and scope in the past four years, for example, based on the extended view of production to include the tradition of all of production services both as discipline of study and as a profession can now be practiced in all organizations. As in other field of management, planning and control forms the primary function of the production management. It is for this reason that this research has decided to take a critical look into production planning and control as practical in beverage industrial sector of the Nigerian economy. This is informed by the variety of major product and beverage products in industry as exemplified by Nigerian Bottling Company (NBC), Kaduna.</strong></p> <p><strong>Buffa (2002) defined production as the process by which goods and services are created. Production can be regarded as the central focus of any manufacturing concern. It is that stage where the real action takes place i.e. the transformation of raw materials (input) into finished product (output).</strong></p> <p><strong>The Planning and Control operation are necessary because in every manufacturing unit there are people, machine and materials for production. There is the need to plan all expensive resources required for production in order to make effective use of them and maximize profit for the organization.</strong></p> <p><strong>Modern production is complex hence both technologically related operation and administrative activities must therefore be planned carefully to make account of all the possible restructure, constraint and advantages. For planning to meet order at less cost, there must be production planning.</strong></p> <p><strong>According to Mayer (2002), there is a logic behind the operation of the production process, it starts from the types of technology as well as the type of production in the particular manufacturing process.</strong></p> <p><strong>Wild (2002) defined production as a managerial function that tends to design, plan what to produce, when to produce, where to produce and for whom to produce, the quantity, the quality to produce and for whom to produce. These function attempts to define the key decision model involved in production i.e. the long-term and the short term planning as well as identify the procedure and control in a cost effective way.</strong></p> <p><strong>Apple (2002) defines production as the activity of transforming raw materials or components into finished product. However, the definition is clear that production essentially entails the transformation of raw materials into finished goods and services.</strong></p> <p><strong>Production planning involve not only the types of operations to be used but the order of these operations as well as a time or duration the operation would take and how the plan should be laid out.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.2    <strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></strong></p> <p><strong>Most organization production processes are slow and the time given to complete a given task is always exceeded. This study intends to investigate and know the reasons behind slow productivity among the employees.</strong></p> <p><strong>And most time, the use of quantitative techniques in assigning a job in an organization is not properly maintained, there is  shortage of materials due to lack of good stock control. The scope and concept of production management is not fully known by some managers. The problem and solution of production planning and control will be discussed in this research work.</strong></p> <p><strong>Lastly, the study intends to know the problems associated with the activities of planning and control in relation to Coca-Cola production and suggest possible solutions.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.3    <strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></strong></p> <p><strong>          The following are the objectives of this study:</strong></p> <p><strong>i)            To assess the impact of Production Planning and control in Nigerian Bottling Company.</strong></p> <p><strong>ii)          To determine how effective planning and control enhance the productivity of Nigerian Bottling Company.</strong></p> <p><strong>iii)        To identify the strategy for enhancing the productivity of Nigerian Bottling Company.</strong></p> <p><strong>iv)         To assess adequate measures in controlling materials in Nigerian Bottling Company.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.4    <strong>STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></strong></p> <p><strong>H0:    Effective Production Planning and Control does not enhance the productivity of Nigerian Bottling Company.</strong></p> <p><strong>H1:    Effective Production Planning and Control enhances the productivity of Nigerian Bottling Company productivity.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.5    <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></strong></p> <p><strong>The significance of this study cannot be overemphasized, because it helps managers and organizations to minimize the time and cost of production by revealing to a production manager when to assign task, which staff to assign the task, on which equipments or method to apply at any given situation or circumstances. It will also help Nigerian Bottling Company to maximize the efficiency of the operation and reduce production cost thereby maximizing profit through effective use of plant and machine sand by taking corrective measures. Nigerian Bottling Company will see its own lapses and improve on them so as to meet its own objective and also other organizations will take correction on their production system.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.6    <strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></strong></p> <p><strong>Production Planning and Control being a complex and dynamic concept has a wide area of coverage so it is clear that research of this nature cannot hold without problem. As such, this work is limited to the areas that are relevant to the problem under investigation that is effective production planning and control taking Nigerian Bottling Company into consideration.</strong></p> <p><strong>The major areas covered are the bottling line where the actual production scheduling and programming activities mostly take place. It covers other departments in relation to production because they are all interrelated.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.7    <strong>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></strong></p> <p><strong>In the course of writing this work, some limitations were encountered. For instance, the high cost of transportation limited the movement of the researcher. Also time constraint is another factor. Finance, inadequate answers to question from the organization (Nigerian Bottling Company). </strong></p> <p><strong>Another problem encountered is the respondents attitude while administering the questionnaire. Some of the employees showed non-challant attitude towards this work. Despite these problems faced, the researcher was lucky to gather adequate materials necessary for the successful completion of this project.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.8    <strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE CASE STUDY</strong></strong></p> <p><strong>Coca-Cola first arrived Nigeria in (1951), that same year, the Nigerian Bottling Company Ltd (NBC) was incorporated to bottle and sell carbonated beverages. NBC has the sole franchise to bottle Coca-Cola products in Nigeria.</strong></p> <p><strong>Coca-Cola was an instant hit with the Nigerian consumer and has remained so over the last six decades. NBC has continued its journey in keeping its promise of refreshing consumers, straightening its communities, enhancing the workplace and preserving the environment while recording many memorable milestones along the way.

It is about changing behaviour and making things happen. Management focuses on getting people developed, joining effort with them, hence, to extend an action to objectives and accomplishing results. Indeed, all the study done into how managers spend their time shows that they are creatures of the moment, constantly immersed in the nitty-gritty of making things happen. (Mullins 2010)<br/>     Training and development is very important for an organization to compete with  this challenging and changing world. Training and development is directly related to employees but it ultimate  effect  goes  to the organization. The importance of training  cannot be over-emphasized because  it increases the efficiency  and effectiveness of both employees  and the organization. Training is important to enhance the capabilities of employees. Training has impact on the return on investment.<br/>      The knowledge, skills and abilities that are required of employees, to perform well on the job, requires effective training programs that may also affect employees motivation and commitment. (Meyer &amp; Allen 1991).<br/>    Employee is a blood stream of any business and training is a necessity in the work place. The achievement or failure of the organization depends  on its employees' performance. Therefore, top management  should  invest in training  and development  of employees to improve  their performance.<br/>1.2.      Statement  of the  Problem<br/>It is obviously true that training improves skills, knowledge and ultimately workers performance and productivity in organizations. (Cole 2002).<br/>Most organizations in Nigeria especially  the private sector engage in training of staff and have department in charge of training.

The world today is very different from the one which experienced the two world wars. During the second half of the twentieth century, considerable advancement in science and technology along with the establishment of broadly-based government and strengthening of institutions, has led to significant socio-economic progress and improvement in lives of a large number of people in many countries, (Asian Development Bank 1999).</strong></p> <p><strong>In today’s intensely competitive and global market place, maintaining a competitive advantage by becoming a low cost leader puts a heavy premium on having a highly committed and competent workforce. In a growing number of organizations human capital is now viewed as a source of competitive advantage.</strong></p> <p><strong>There is greater recognition that distinctive competencies are obtained through highly developed employee skills distinctive organizational cultures, management processes and systems (Siddharil Chaturvedi 2004). In the prison service, a close study of colonial and past colonial laws seems to emphasize the custodial functions of the prison while silent on correctional functions of the modern prison. In view of the increasing emphasis on correctional educational in most countries in Europe and North American, it becomes clear that there is the need to humanize the Nigerian prisons system through provision of education which will not doubt help ex-offenders develop positive social skills (Evawoma-E Enuku,U. 1991) the rate at which the in-mates population is growing can not be compared with that of the staff.</strong></p> <p><strong>For instance, the average daily prison population in 1976 was nearly 26,000, a 25 percent increase from 1975 ten years later Nigeria prison population was about 54,000 by 1989 the prison population had increased to 58,000 and in recent years prison population has been on the increase reaching well over 70,000 in 1997 (Evawoma Enuku U. 1998).</strong></p> <p><strong>The over growing couple with in-human conditions in the prisons have led to the prisons being variously described as “human cages” (Kayode, 1987) human zoos (Neuswatch, 1985; tell, 1998). It therefore becomes very pertinent that there should be proper personnel development in the prison service to enable them discharge their duties effectively. Also, the fact that prisons are built for correction and re-integration of ex-convicts the need for effective human capital development in the staffing of prison personnel cannot be over emphasized.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.2      STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p><strong>Human capital development cannot be over emphasized, if organizational goals must be achieved. Human capital development is mandatory in collaboration with other resources in achieving organizational goals and objectives. Human capital development as a means of increasing productivity cannot be achieved unless it is adequately planned and executed by the management. This is done by ensuring that the staff development policy is strictly adhered to.</strong></p> <p><strong>In making provision for development programmes, there is bound to be problem especially in the presence of limited resources and  increasing need for updating workers at the work place to be able to meet up with the day to day challenges that come up due to technological advancement and loss of staff through retirement, resignation, dismissal, death etc.  These factors usually make it necessary to employ new hands who require development programmes if not there will be poor performance, crippled work, reduced morale and the staff cannot be abreast of challenges within and outside the organization. Based on the problem indentified the researcher is faced with the following questions:</strong></p> <p><strong>1.   Are there enough provisions for development of staff?</strong></p> <p><strong>2.   Do personnel consider development to be important?</strong></p> <p><strong>3.   Is lack of development programmes responsible to reduced efficiency?</strong></p> <p><strong>4.   Are there enough resources available for staff development programmes?</strong></p> <p><strong>5.   Are there yard sticks used in measuring efficiency?</strong></p> <p><strong>The above questions are of concern to the researcher</strong></p> <p><strong>1.3      OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>The objective of this study is to critically examine Human capital development as a means of increasing productivity. The specific objectives are:</strong></p> <p><strong>1.   To identify the need for human capital development programmes in prison services.</strong></p> <p><strong>2.   To examine the problems of developing employees for productivity</strong></p> <p><strong>3.   To look into whether the development of qualitative programmes increases productivity and smoothen the provision of prison services.</strong></p> <p><strong>4.   To determine human factors as an integral part of organizational resources for organizational survival.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.4      STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p><strong>For the purpose of this study, the following hypothesis are formulated:</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho:</strong><strong>   Human Capital development does not have significant effect on employees’ productivity.</strong></p> <p><strong>H1</strong><strong>:   Human Capital development have significant effect on employees productivity.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.5      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>The importance of this project cannot be over emphasized because the prison as stated under the statement of the general problem is an institution for reformation of the character of in-mates. It was also observed that the number of these in-mates is growing by day. Going by these therefore, there is</strong></p> <p><strong>1.   The need for human capital development in the service to be able to face the emerging challenges.</strong></p> <p><strong>2.   The findings of this research will highlight the strengths and weakness in the area of human capital development that will be very useful in making recommendations that will enhance improved performance of the staff.</strong></p> <p><strong>3.   The findings of this research will give rise to a reference material for students and other researchers with interest in human capital development or the prison service in Nigeria.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.6       SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>In this research, the researcher will focus on evaluation of Human capital development as a means of increasing productivity in public organizations for national development using Nigeria Prisons Service as a case study. It may not be possible to cover the entire organization; but basically, it is normal to state the nature of the project work and to guide anybody who might  wish to use the work to study an organization for future use. For that purpose, we are to look at human capital development as a means of increasing productivity in public organizations.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.7      LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>The limitations of this research can be viewed from the fact that the it became difficult to granted interviews to the researcher by  members of staff of the Nigeria Prisons Service, Kaduna Command. They were so busy that appointments were booked, changed and new booking obtained before the conduct of the interviews.</strong></p> <p><strong>Also some considered the information required to be official and as such wanted to obtain permission from their superior before participation.</strong></p> <p><strong>However, efforts were made to reduce the limitations to the lowest minimum by proper education of the interviews that the research is an academic exercise from which findings could help in improving prison service.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.8      HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF COMMAND PRISON KADUNA</strong></p> <p><strong>Kaduna prison camp was established in 1962 when the prison was established. No missionary ever worked there. It was sullied for by the priest working in Narayi.  It started as a chapel where the in-mates worshiped but later parishioners around the vicinity came to attend mass there, thus arose the need for a bigger church. It is the first and only open prison in Nigeria. Imprisonment is not new as there have always been a means of isolating the deviants so as to prevent them from causing further trouble in the society. For example, the Ogboni House was used as prison by the Yorubas and the existence of prison among the fulanis who used their buildings to isolate offender as a form of punishment were recorded. The first prison in Nigeria was established in 1872 located on Broad street Lagos prison began all over the  world not as ultimate institutions for punishment and correction but initially means for the custody of persons caught up in the criminal justice systems. Awaiting trails or the execution of their punishment such as whipping, banishment and death (Rolhman cited in Alemika, 1987). However, in the mid-nineteenth century, the function of the prison as short term custodia facility changed in Europe and North America to institution for ensuring punishment, penitence and correction of the offender.</strong></p> <p><strong>Nigeria had a dual prison system for more than half century until the consolidation of the federal and local prison in 1965. This consolidation followed findings from Mr. Garrat’s report in 1960 of the situation in the prisons which were crowded dirty and under staffed. The take over of the prisons by the federal government was the greatest land mark in the history of prison administration in Nigeria. This led to improved condition of service and recruitment of more educated prison staff. The Nigeria Prison Service, a department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs was headquartered in Lagos and headed by a director responsible for administering nearly 400 facilities including regular prisons special penal institutions, and lock up.</strong></p> <p><strong>All of these facilities since 1975 came under federal control. Each state had its own prison headquarters under the supervision of Assistant Director of Prison, and the prisons themselves, depending on the type, size and in-mate population, were variously under chief superintendents, or assistant superintendent.  The average daily prison population in1976 was increased by 25 percent Kaduna housed more than 4000 inmates. The most common offenses were theft, assault, traffic violations and unlawful possession, which together accounted for 53 percent of prison admissions between 1982 and 1984. Thieves represented the largest single category of offenders, accounting for between 37 and 46 percent of prison admissions between 1982 and 1984 admission to prison in Kaduna Exceeded 10,000 in 1983. This figure did not reflect the geographical distribution of crimes. The prisoners constitute people between the ages of twenty six and fifty consistently constituted the largest category of prisoners, ranging between 53 and 78 percent between 1980 and 1984. In 1984 Christians and Muslims accounted for 45 and 37 percent of prison admissions respectively and women for almost 4 percent prisoners admitted were connected, whereas the rest were on remand or awaiting trail. Among those convicted about three fourth served terms of less than two years while 59 percent were first-time offenders and 41 percent were recidivist. Foreigners constituted an unknown proportion, 1989, for example about 200 aliens from other West African states were held in Kaduna Federal Prisons for illegal emerald mining.</strong></p> <p><strong>Although the government had announced a prison construction program, little progress was evident and conditions were projected to worsen by the year 2000 Kaduna Prison population rose drastically.

The world today is very different from the one which experienced the two world wars. During the second half of the twentieth century, considerable advancement in science and technology along with the establishment of broadly-based government and strengthening of institutions, has led to significant socio-economic progress and improvement in lives of a large number of people in many countries, (Asian Development Bank 1999).</strong></p> <p><strong>In today’s intensely competitive and global market place, maintaining a competitive advantage by becoming a low cost leader puts a heavy premium on having a highly committed and competent workforce.
