The objectives are to examine the relationship between board size, board independence, board shareholding and firm size. The result of the findings are as follows; board size of insurance firms has a negative but not significant impact on insurance audit quality, board independence has a positive but not significant impact on insurance firms audit quality, that directors’ shareholding has a positive and significant impact on insurance firms’ audit quality and that insurance firms size has a positive and significant impact on insurance firms audit quality. It is recommended that; Technocrat should be appointed as director and the size of the board of director should of a manageable size. This is because proponents of large board size believe it provides an increased pool of expertise because larger boards are likely to have more knowledge and skills at their disposal. The board should be given adequate authority and power to carry out their function without interference from other stakeholder of the firm. This can be achieved through a well laid down process of appointment and dismissal of directors. The board of directors has a significant role to play in ensuring good corporate governance in the insurance firm and at the heart of the corporate governance debate is the view that the board of directors is the guardian of shareholders’ interest (Dezoort et al., 2002). Boards are being criticized for failing to meet their governance responsibilities. These responsibilities put great emphasis on formal issues such as board independence, board leadership structure, board size and committees.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION<br/>Background of the Study    -    -    -<br/>Statement of the Research Problem    -    -<br/>Research Question    -    -    -    <br/>Objectives of Study    -<br/>Research Hypotheses    -    <br/>Scope of The Study    -<br/>1.7    Significance of the study    -    -<br/>CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>2.1 Introduction    -    -    -    <br/>2.2 Corporate Governance    -    -<br/>2.3    Financial performance    -    -    -    <br/>2.4    Relationship between Corporate Governance and<br/> Performance    -    -    -<br/>2.5    Board of Directors    -    -    <br/>2.6    The Role of Annual General Meeting (AGM)    <br/>2.7    Audit Committees    -    <br/>2.8    Theoretical Framework    -<br/>CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>3.1    Introduction    -    -    -<br/>3.2    Research Design    -<br/>3.3    Population and Sample of the Study    -    <br/>3.4    Sources of Data    <br/>3.5    Model Specification    -    -<br/>3.6 The Panel Data Regression    <br/>CHAPTER FOUR: EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS<br/>4.1    Introduction    -    <br/>4.2   Empirical Tests and Results Based On Panel Data Analysis    <br/>4.3.

According to Edwards &amp; Clough (2005) recent failures in corporate governance have led to the proliferation of corporate governance codes which emphasize, in particular, accountability and conformance measures in organizations. The essence of these codes is to determine what entails good corporate governance in an organization. For any organization to succeed in achieving good performance, it must be able to embrace conventional good corporate governance attributes as stipulated    in<br/>codes such as the Cadbury code in the United Kingdom (UK) (Edwards &amp; Clough, 2005).<br/>    Maher and Anderson (1999) assert that corporate organizations have a responsibility to various parties such as shareholders and other stakeholders such as employees, suppliers and even the society. They further argue that the corporate governance practices in an organization are very significant in determining the incentives and disincentives faced by all the above stakeholders who potentially contribute to firm performance. Corporate governance is primarily concerned<br/>with how effective different governance systems are in promoting long term investment and commitment amongst the various stakeholders. Kester (1992) indicates that the central problem of governance is to devise specialized systems of incentives, safeguards, and dispute resolution processes that will promote the continuity of business relationships that are efficient in the presence of self-interested opportunism.<br/>Corporate governance practices dictate the means through which performance is achieved and measured. According to Yacuzzi (2005), in every organization there are always forces that oppose change. Corporate governance ensures that there exist policies that can encourage performance. It is the work of the governing body to ensure that corporate performance is measured appropriately. This involves putting in place the measures that the organization will adopt in measuring or evaluating the level of performance.<br/>The National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) recently launched Code of Corporate Governance for the Insurance Industry in Nigeria as part of its strategic efforts to rebuild and sustain the waning confidence of stakeholders in insurance. Indeed, the insurance industry regulator expects that “the hidden potential of the sector will be unleashed for maximum impact that will induce economic growth in Nigeria” through compliance to the Code. It is trite to state that the initiative could not have come at a better time than now when the major causal factor of the current global economic meltdown is attributed to unwholesome and sharp practices of corporate leaders in advanced jurisdictions and in our local environment. The global economy has lost a lot financially in terms stock market crashes, credit squeeze, unemployment, depreciation of the various currencies, fall in growth rates, etc. and as a result, the necessity for the empirical analysis into corporate governance and performance of insurance companies in Nigeria.<br/>STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM<br/>As an importance element of the financial system, insurance plays a vital role in the Nigeria fast growing economy. Notwithstanding its numerous contributions, this sector is faced with some problems that have hindered its progress and goal actualization. This problems ranges from: ethical issues, poor premium management, poor labour practices, weak regulatory mechanism and enforcement mechanism (Akingbola, 2010). Also insurance in Nigeria lacks proper code of conduct on how its activities should be carried out and lack of ethical behavior in insurance business practice (Soares, 2014 and Irukwu, 2009).To add voice to the poor performance of insurance practice, Nduna, (2013) opined “that lack of bank account by citizens hinders the collection of life insurance premium which has also slowed down development of insurance in Africa. In year 2003, three top officers of Skanda insurance company in Sweden were interrogated for not utilizing properly, the corporate assets (Momoh &amp;Ukpong, 2013). Itis in the light of the identified problems above, and to bridge the gap in body of existing literature, an empirically investigation is carried out to ascertain corporate governance impact on financial performance of quoted insurance companies in Nigeria.<br/>Research Question<br/>What is the relationship between board size and performance of insurance companies<br/>What is the relationship between board meeting and performance of insurance companies<br/>What is the relationship between independent directors and performance of insurance companies<br/>What is the relationship between audit committee meetings and performance of insurance companies<br/>1.4 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The main objective of this study is to empirically investigate the relationship between corporate governance and performance of insurance companies in Nigeria, while the specific objectives are to;<br/>Examine the relationship between board size and performance of insurance companies.<br/>Determine the relationship between board meeting and performance of insurance companies.<br/>Ascertain the relationship between independent directors and performance of insurance companies.<br/>Investigate the relationship between audit committee meeting and performance of insurance companies.<br/> RESEARCH HYPOTHESES<br/>H1: there is no significant impact of board size on audit quality in insurance firms in Nigeria.<br/>H2: there is no significant impact of board independence on audit quality in insurance firms in Nigeria.<br/>H3: there is no significant impact of insurance firms size on audit quality in insurance firms in Nigeria.<br/>H4: there is no significant impact of directors’ shareholding on audit quality in insurance firms in Nigeria.<br/> SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>A period of 7 years will be considered for the study between taking variable data used in this study like board size, board meeting, independent directors, and audit committee meetings from the financial records of selected insurance companies from 2009-2015 as this will capture current trend in corporate governance as it relates to the performance of insurance companies in Nigeria. <br/>1.7    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>Management: The study will improve quality of principal-agent relationship that exist between the management and owners of the firm and reduce the conflict of interest using the result of the findings if implemented will create the expected value on firm performance. <br/>Stakeholders: Furthermore, it will enhance the knowledge of all stakeholders and serve as a reference material to other researcher interested in the subject matter<br/>Regulatory Authorities: this study will be insightful to the body in charge of formulating the policy of the code of corporate governance in Nigeria. As emphasis will be drawn from this research work as to the right mixture or attributes of corporate governance that will facilitate firm performance especially in the insurance industry.<br/><br/>\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND AUDIT QUALITY IN NIGERIAN INSURANCE COMPANIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND AUDIT QUALITY IN NIGERIAN INSURANCE COMPANIES", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>PENSION REFORM ACT OF 2004 ANALYSIS OF IT'S IMPACT ON NIGERIAN WORKERS</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of this write-up was to determine the impact of pension reform Act 2004 on the Image of pension Workers in Nigeria. The pension Reform Act 2004 was characterized by some problems like non-compliance, ignorance of the benefit of the pension reform act 2004 which has hinder the smooth administration of the reform act.

studies have been carried out on the impacts of pension reform Act 2004 on both the image of pension business in Nigeria and the entire workers in Nigeria.</p> <p>However, much have not been discourse about impact on the new pension reform act 2004 will bring on the image of pension workers in Nigeria.</p> <p>Pension natural can be described as a sum of money paid regularly to a person who has come to the end of his normal working life or it can be defined as a series of regular payment provided by government or former employer for a person who has come to the end of his normal working life or who no longer works because of age, disablement etc or to his widow or defendant children by the state by his former employer as or from funds to which he and his employers have both contributed. Thus, the introduction of the pension reform act 2004 was due to inability of the previous pension system to meet the need of the people.</p> <p>Thus this research is embark as a result of the quest to bring to the effect. The new pension reform act 2004 have created so far on the image of pension workers in Nigeria.</p> <p>It is also hope that this write up will enlighten the readers especially business student and pension administrators on the analysis of the impact of pension reforms act 2004 on the image of pension on Nigeria worker.</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>Like any other business venture, there are some problem that militate against th</p>\n\nPENSION REFORM ACT OF 2004 ANALYSIS OF IT'S IMPACT ON NIGERIAN WORKERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PENSION REFORM ACT OF 2004 ANALYSIS OF IT'S IMPACT ON NIGERIAN WORKERS", "id": 2}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>MANAGEMENT OF LIFE ASSURANCE FUND IN NIGERIA INSURANCE INDUSTRY (A CASE </strong></p> <p><strong>STUDY OF UNION ASSURANCE LIMITED)</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     </strong><strong>Background Of The Study</strong></p> <p>It is common to report of business failing than business succeeding almost always, the failure or success of a business can be attributed to its management. When a business is mismanaged, it will lead to liquidation the company will not meet their  solvency margin thereby running away from their obligation image. However it will also have a drastic effect on the Nigeria economy when it failed. In order top nurture the interaction, this research focus on insurance industries and how they management life assurance premium, to know if the premium are invested as stipulated by law, how they handle claim and the beneficiaries and also how life assurance fund help in the economic development of Nigeria.</p> <p>Moreover, management of life assurance fund in insurance industry related primarily to the way the industry management life assurance premium in order to achieve organizational goal and objective using available fund efficiently and effectively.</p> <p>However in context to management, union assurance limited. Limited is an associate of union bank of Nigeria plc. The company was registered as an insurer on November 18, 1993 and actually commence business in 1998. At the time, it was the first attempt by any bank top venture into universal banking. It therefore become the life assurance specialist’s underwriter with in the same period. recently, union assurance is redefining those strong potential to challenge industry management with the top five brackets. Apart from restructuring its operations, the company is diversifying and expanding at a period where competitor mare contracting due to uncertain economic conditions. (a new management driving change and excellence is  in place and venturing into new frontiers that were uncultivated. The changed in management has also brought to bear on the company’s operation innovation which are impacting passively on the work culture in union assurance) union assurance also has a robust investment portfolio cutting across assets in the equity, money bond and property marked totaling over N5 billion they also employs a conservative but dynamic investment strategy geared towards increasing the company income and profitability.</p> <p>More so, in managing life assurance fund money is pooled together with that of other investors to create a single strong fund that provide significant investors benefits which include an instant increase in buying strength there by contributing towards economic development in Nigeria. However, life assurance fund accumulate through payment made by the assured person called premium so that should death occur, prior to a specified date or upon survival at an agreed period funds would be made available from the scheme to pay whatever benefits that are due. The idea for assistance and association is not new to the Nigeria society various town and clan union and social clubs have various ways of showing benevolence to their bereaved. It is customary for people to pay condolence visit and present a sympathy purse. Practices are similar to mutual life assurance.</p> <p>In addition to this, there are also the long-term needs to create and sustain an enable environment that will engender safe practice against destructive runs in managing life assurance funds, protecting and ensuring fair play among insures in the industry.</p> <p><strong>1.2  State of problem          </strong></p> <p>Complex set of interrelated problem are identify as following:</p> <p>i.            Mismanagement </p> <p>ii.          Inability to invest life assurance fund in varieties of security due to lack of experts.</p> <p>iii.        Ineffective investment management of life assurance fund which affect expectations of the insuring public and growth of the industry.</p> <p><strong>1.3  Objective of the study</strong></p> <p>Having been exposed to the problem the research tends to achieve the following: </p> <p>1.          To described implication and suggest possible ways of managing life insurance fund.</p> <p>a.          To assess the factors that determines the area of investments of life assurance fund.</p> <p>b.          To ascertain whether life assurance fund are invested more on short- term investment than on long-term investment instrument or vice versa.</p> <p>c.           To promote investors confidence toward life assurance.</p> <p><strong>1.4     </strong><strong>Research Question</strong></p> <p>1.        What appropriate strategies can be put in place to ensure effective management of life assurance funds?</p> <p>2.        What factors determine the areas of investment of life assurance fund?</p> <p>3.        What form of investment is life assurance fund put into most (long term or short-term investments insurance)?</p> <p>4.        What are the trend expectation of the insuring public?</p> <p><strong>1.5     </strong><strong>Research Hypothesis </strong></p> <p>The research work tends the following hypothesis listed below<strong>:</strong></p> <p><strong>HO:</strong>   Management of life assurance has no positive effect on the economic growth and development of Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>H1:  </strong>Management of life assurance fund has positive on the economic growth and development of Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6     </strong><strong>Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>It is aimed that study will help the insurance to plan organize and control life assurance fund in order to maintain proficiency and standard in insurance practice thereby investing life assurance fund in varieties of investment.

However, with the enactment of Insurance Decree[1], the awareness of insurance policies was enhanced. Thus, more people took steps to insure their properties or lives. Unfortunately, however, much as the high percentage of them normally end up unable to have their claims indemnified, either as a result of a breach of one insurance principle or another. These principles are numerous and they are the basis upon which insurance contracts are based. Failure to adhere to any of the principles may render an insurance contract void. The need to understand as well as having a second knowledge of the basic principles of insurance cannot be over emphasized.</p> <p>These principles of insurance which are i) Insurable interest; ii) Utmost good faith/Duty of disclose; iii) Subrogation; iv) proximate cause; v) Indemnity; vi) ‘No Premium, No Policy’, are the bedrock of insurance contract, the absence of any of which the purpose of insurance will be defeated.</p> <p>The purpose of insurance cannot be farfetched. This can easily be seen from the various definitions of insurance. Insurance contract has been defined in the case of <em>PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY V INLAND REVENUE COMMISSIONER<strong>[2]</strong>, as </em></p> <p>a contract whereby a person called the ‘insurer’ undertakes in return for the consideration called the premium to pay another person called the ‘assured’ a sum of money or its equivalent on the happening of a specified event </p> <p>Insurance is an intricate economic and social device for the handling of risks to life and property. It is social in nature because it represents the various co-operations of various individuals for mutual benefits by combining together funds to reduce the consequence of similar risk.</p> <p>Simply put, insurance is the placing back of a person who has suffered a loss in the same position he was before loss occurred. It aims to eradicate the consequence of a loss by not allowing the insured to suffer the consequential loss. However, as earlier stated, unless one meets the requirements of all the basic principles of insurance, he will be estopped from claiming under an insurance contract.</p><p> 1.1.0    BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY </p> <p>Insurance law is reputed for its general principles, and the principles of indemnity is one of them, others are insurable interest, utmost good faith, subrogation, contribution and proximate cause. A principle denotes a general guiding rule, which does not include specific directions, which vary according to the subject matter.</p> <p>The basic principles applicable to insurance law flow from the nature of insurance contract as conceived, many years ago, by Law Merchants and taken over by the Common Law. The principles are common to all classes of insurance, both life and nonlife and both marine and non-marine. By its nature, insurance contract postulates that a sum of money will be paid on the happening of the insured event by the insurers; however, the event must be uncertain. The uncertainty related to whether the event will ever happen as in fire or accident insurance or as in life insurance where death is a necessary end to all human life, but the time of death is uncertain. In comparison with other areas of the law, there is no other law, which attracts the number of general principle s with deep-rooted effect as insurance.</p><p> 1.2.0    AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF STUDY </p> <p>The aim of this topic is to enlighten the general public about this area of insurance, which though seem insignificant yet is the basis of the insurance contract. This topic therefore aims to consider the position of the insurer as well as the insured. Also, the aims and objectives of this study is to eliminate or at least to minimize such misunderstandings by stating the ‘rules of the game’ for the benefit of the parties taking part in the insurance contract or transaction.</p> <p> 1.3.0    FOCUS OF STUDY </p> <p>This project focus mainly on the basic principles of insurance under the Nigerian Law of Insurance, how it affects insurance policies, how this effects can be minimized as well as a determination of when an insured is entitled to claim and when he is not based on these principles.</p><p> 1.4.0    SCOPE OF STUDY </p> <p>The scope of this study is within the Nigerian Law of Insurance. The areas to be covered inter-alia include the analysis of the basic principles of insurance which consist of</p> <p>Insurance Interest, Utmost Good Faith, disclosure and Proposal, form, the Premium Policy, indemnity, Subrogation and Proximate cause, as it relates to the contract of insurance under the Nigerian Law of Insurance.</p><p> 1.5.0    METHODOLOGY </p> <p>The style to be adopted in this essay will be expository and narrative. For this essay to achieve its aim, reliance will be placed on secondary sources of information gathered from textbooks, law reports, view of jurist, judicial decisions, dictionaries and encyclopaedia on the subject matter and of course, the internet. It is pertinent to mention that many articles, journals have not been written in this area of law, the few that are available will be well utilised.</p><p> 1.6.0    LITERATURE REVIEW </p> <p>Though many foreign books did not treat the topic of this essay in details but one of its concepts insurable interest, most Nigerian Authors however, lighten the burden of this work with their tactful treatment of the basic principles of insurance. Important Authors in this regard include J. O. Irukwu, on <em>Insurance Law and Practice in Nigeria</em>; Professor Olusegun Yerokun, on <em>Insurance Law in Nigeria</em> and Funmi Adeyemi, on <em>Nigeria Insurance Law. </em></p> <p>According to J. O. Irukwu<em>, the fundamental principles of Insurance Lawand Practice</em> as applicable to Nigeria are insurable interest, utmost good faith, disclosure, indemnity, subrogation and proximate cause. Though Irukwu, on this subject has principles laid down before the now operating Insurance Act 2003 in Nigeria, some of these principles remains in conformation with the insurance Act 2003. To make the work an updated are however, Funmi Adeyemi and Professor Olusegun Yerokun’s insurance text which contains the prevailing law will equally be used among other materials. Olusegun Yerokun’s text which is Insurance Law in Nigeria provides a comprehensive analysis of insurance law in all its aspects. As a result of the repeal of the Insurance Decree, 1991 and the promulgation of the Insurance Decree, 1997, and the now operating Insurance Act 2003, the contents reflect the changes in law. The basic principles of insurance according to Yerokun are Insurable Interest, Utmost Good Faith, Indemnity, Subrogation,</p> <p>Disclosure, Premium and Proximate Cause. There is also the work of M. C. Okany on <em>Nigerian Commercial Law</em>, which is of the opinion that contracts of insurance are governed by the general principles of contract but, on account of their special nature, all contracts of insurance are in addition governed by special or fundamental principles. These principles of insurance according to M. C Okany are Utmost Good Faith, Insurable Interest, Indemnity and Subrogation. The work and contribution of these distinguished authors are acknowledged to be of great value.</p> <p>There are also foreign authors who have in no small measure distinguished themselves and whose works are relevant to this research, some of these authors are: John Birds on <em>Modern Insurance Law</em>; Opined that the basic principles of insurance are insurable interest, fraud, Non-Disclosure and Misrepresentation, Premiums and Subrogation. He is of the view the most important and reliable is the insurable interest; There is also the work of MacGillivray and Parkington on <em>Insurance Law</em>. The General principles of insurance according to them are insurable interest, premium and subrogation, they never include non-disclosure and misrepresentation as John Bird. Raoul Colinvaux on <em>The Law of Insurance</em>, includes indemnity, which makes his none comprehensive than the other two, which is insurable interest, non-disclosure and misrepresentation premium, indemnity and subrogation and in addition, Hardy Ivamy ‘<em>General Principles of Insurance Law</em> will also be consulted. All these foreign authors in their books are of the opinion that the basic principles of Insurance are Insurable Interest, Non-Disclosure, The</p> <p>Premium, Indemnity and Subrogation.</p> <p>Also, notable judicial pronouncements of the courts and the opinion of jurists are also relied upon coupled with reference to various legislations on insurance like the Marine Insurance Act, 1961; Insurance Act, 2003.</p><p> 1.7.0    DEFINITION OF TERMS  </p> <p>For proper understanding of this project topic, there is need to acquaint ourselves with some basic insurance terminologies.</p> <p><strong>Risk:</strong> In insurance law, the danger or hazard of a loss of the property insured[3]. In a contract of insurance, the insurer undertakes to protect the insured from a specified loss and the insurer receives a premium for running the risk of such loss. Thus, risk must attach to a policy.</p> <p><strong>Mitigation of Loss:</strong> In the event of some mishap to the insured property, the insured must take all necessary steps to mitigate or minimize the loss, just as any prudent person would do in those circumstances. If he does not do so, the insurer can avoid the payment of loss attributable to his negligence, but it must be remembered that though the insured is bound to do his best for his insurer, he is nor bound to do so at the risk of his life. <strong>Insure:</strong> To make sure or secure, to guarantee, as to insure safety to anyone. It also mean to indemnify a person against pecuniary loss from specified perils or possible liability4.</p> <p><strong>Insured:</strong> The insured is the policy-holder who is entitled to indemnity or monetary compensation on the happening of an event insured against. The insured is also the person who obtains or is otherwise covered by insurance on his health, life or property[4].</p> <p><strong>Insurer:</strong> He is the party who undertakes in consideration of an amount paid to him by the insured (premium) to pay money to the insured or assured on the happening of a stated event. Examples of the kinds of insurers we have include, the Mutual Insurance Association, NICON Insurance Companies Limited, among other[5].</p> <p><strong>Third Party:</strong> There are two parties to an insurance contract, the insurer and the insured. All others are strangers to the contract, and are referred to as third parties because they are not parties to the insurance contract between the insured and the insurer. For instance, the pedestrian who is knocked down by the insured in a motor accident is a third party and a stranger to the contract between the insurer and the insured[6].</p> <p><strong>Insurance Company:</strong> A corporation or association whose business is to make contracts of insurance[7].It must also be registered under the Nigerian Law.</p><p> 1.8.0    CONCLUSION </p> <p>Insurance is fast becoming a household name in Nigeria with more persons gradually becoming interested in the subject.</p> <p>This chapter began with the general introduction which breakdown the issue in question and tried to see it’s important or usefulness in helping us to understand the meaning of insurance and also satisfy our curiosity of knowing what insurance and the basic principles of insurance is all about.</p> <p>Though brief, the introduction has tried to shed light on the importance of insurance to our human race or existence and definition in place by judicial decisis. It went ahead to states its aims and objectives of the study. It continued with scope of study, focus of study and followed by the research methodology which had been stated that is the sources from which information concerning the project is gotten. The literature review is not leftout. Also, the research continued with certain terms that the reader would be coming across in the course of this work. This chapter in its little way is a form of a steppingstone as to what should be expected in the research work in subsequent chapters.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] No. 68 of 1994</p> </div> <div> <p>[2] (1904) 2 K.

However , it  is  possible  to  say  that  the  precise  relationship  between trade  barriers  in  form  of  tariff  or  free  trade  in  the  long  run  economic  growth  remains  a  difficult  theoretical  issue  that  is  being  explored  in a variety  of  ways.</p> <p>Simithian  and  Ricardian  conclusion  reinforced  by  the Hercscher-ohlin  theorem  recommend free trade  as  the  best  commercial  partners. This doctrine  that  is  focused  on  improvement  in  the  level  of  income  is  based  on   static framework that  may  limit  the  interpretation  of  the  long run  effect.</p> <p>Relationship  between  economic    growth  and  tariffs  depends  mostly  on the  characteristics  of  a  country. Tariff  can  benefit  a  country   depending on  whether it  is  developed  or  developing  or  developed (a developed  one  seems  to  lose)  either  big or  small  country and  whether  it  has  comparative  advantage  in  sector  receiving protection. Tariffs  are  imposed  on  imported  goods  and  are  used  to  refer  to  schedule  of duties applicable to a list of  commodities    as  the commodities  imported or  exported. These  taxes  could  be  assessed  either  as  a percentage  of  volume  of the  commodity concerned  (ad valorem),  or on the basis  of  some  physical  features  as : weight, length, an specific gravity.(Johnson,1971).</p> <p>Tariffs rates vary according to the type of goods imported.  Import  tariffs  will increase  the  cost  of  importers  and  increase  the  price  of  imported goods in  the  local  markets,  thus  lowering  the  quantity  of  goods  imported. Tariffs  may  be  imposed  on  export,  and  in  an  economy  with  floating  exchange  rates,  export  tariffs  have  similar  effect  as  import  tariffs .However,  since  export  are often  perceived  as  „‟hurting‟‟  local  industries  while  import  tariffs  are  perceived  as  helping  local  industries,  export  tariffs are  seldom  implemented  (Meier,2000)</p> <p>Protectionists  believe  that    infant  industries  must  be  protected  in  order  to  allow  them  growth  to  a point  where  they  can  fairly  compete  with  the  larger  matured  industries  established  in  foreign  countries. They  believe  that  without  tariffs,  infant  industries  will die  before  they  reach  a  size  of  economies  of  scale,  industrial  infrastructure,  and  skill  in  manufacturing  have  progressed  sufficiently  to  allow  the  industry to  compete  in  the  global market. They argue  that  government  have  a  responsibility  to  protect  their  corporations  through  tariffs  as  well  as  their  when  putting its  companies  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  by  enacting laws  for  social  goods .They believe  that  these  law  end  up  destroying  domestic  companies  and  ultimately  hurting  the  citizens,  but  these laws  were  designed  to  protect.</p> <p>Tariffs  is  always  seen as  a  redress  to  social  and  economic  costs  of   trade  or  as  a way  of  enhancing  economic  advantages. However,  in  most  cases  economists,  argue  that  erecting  barriers  on  trade  impose  costs  in  the  economy  that  exceeds  the  benefit  gotten. These  costs  can  rise  from  insufficient  resource  allocation,  intractable  implementation  and  foreign  retaliation.The  precise  relationship between  tariffs  and  economic  growth  has  long  remained a  difficult  theoretical  issue  that  is  being  explored  in  variety  of  ways.  The  question   often  asked  by  international  and  development  economists,  as  well  as  their  supporters  is  that  which  one  lead  to  a  faster  economic  growth,  is  free  trade  or  protected  trade?,  economists  are  still  in  search  for  the acceptable  answer to  this  question.</p> <p> 1.2      STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </p> <p>    Tariffs  can  be  used  to  protect  infant  industries  and  this  tariff  has  its  problem  it  creates. High  tariff  and   other  forms  of  trade  barriers  have  been  regarded  as  impediments  to  economic  growth.  The  use  of  tariffs  to  protect  and  to  stimulate  the  production  of  the  import  substitution  in  Nigeria  has  obvious  problem.  By protectingthese industries, inefficiency may be encouraged.</p> <p>High  tariffs  and  other forms  have  burdened  consumers  with  high  price  and  have  shielded  producers  from  international  competition.  However  a  safe  guard  against  frequent tariff changes  and  high  tariff  rates  between  1995  to  2005.  Nigeria‟s  tariffs  policy  has  faced  great  challenges  of  cumbersome  and  lengthy  imports  procedures,  frequent  change    in  tariff.  High  duties  on  consumer  goods  widen  the  gap  between  applied  and  bound  rate  with  their  associated  negative  impact  on  the  economy.</p> <p>    The  Nigeria  government  can  make  adequate  and  reliable  tariff  policies,  and  also  encourage  this  infant  industries  to produce  those  goods  that  tariff  has  been impose  on;  the  quality  of  this  goods  should  match  those  formally  imported.  This study  should  be  able  to  expose  how the  tariff  imposed  and the  structure  of  this  tariff, can  make  an  impact on  the  economic  growth  of  Nigeria  and how  this  can  improve  the  economy  as a  whole.</p> <p> 1.3     OBJECTIVE  OF  THE  STUDY </p> <p>    The  objective  of  the  study  are  as  follows  below;</p> <p>1.                     To  determine  the  nature  of  the relationship  that  exist  between tariffs  and  economic  growth  in  Nigeria.</p> <p>2.                     To investigate if tariff actually leads to economic growth in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.                     To  examine  the  extent  to  which  tariffs  imposition  has  improved</p> <p>Nigeria‟s  economy  for  the  period  1980 to  2010.</p> <p>4.                     To identify and analyse the remedy for tariffs impediments inNigeria.</p> <p> 1.4      STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS </p> <p>The working hypothesis for this study is as follow;</p> <p>1.                 – Hi:  There  is  no  significant  relationship between  tariffs and growth,  thus  it  has not  caused  any  economic growth in  Nigeria.</p> <p>2.                 –H0: Tariff has influence and impact on economy growth ofNigeria to an </p> <p>extent.</p> <p> 1.5        RELEVANCE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>This  study  will  be  relevant  to  the  Nigeria society  in  the following ways;</p> <p>1.                 It will help us to understand the tariff structure of Nigeria</p> <p>2.                 It will contribute to the literature review</p> <p>3.                 It will provide empirical evidence on the nature of relationship that exist between tariff and economic growth in Nigeria; this will in turn guide policy makers in their policies formulation.</p> <p>4.                 Investigating into the tariff regime will enable us to know the positive contributions it has made to improve the export of locally produced goods.</p> <p>5.                 It will help the government and policy makers to be able to formulate adequate policy on trade.</p> <p>6.                 It will help us to know, if tariff can lead to economic growth or not Nigeria</p> <p> 1.6     LIMITATIONS OF STUDY </p> <p>Usually,  tariff  are  in form  of  excise  duties,  import  tariff and  export tariff. inadequate  complete  reliable  data,  as data  collected  from  some economic journals and textbooks vary from  each  other.

This involves conflicts of interest and the actors are always eager to achieve their interest at the expense of others. Therefore, to achieve their respective ultimate aims they reports to bickering and violence.</p> <p>Electoral violence in Nigerian politics can be regarded as a sort of response to frustrating circumstance. Elections in Nigeria area a contest of guts, blood shared and tears. The Federal Election of 1904 was base on the system of the winner take us all and the loser forfeits all, the nationally divisive and determined effects of a population census and the general institutionalized opposition of the government in power which is the origin of electoral violence in Nigerian politics. The 1979 political system officially adopted the presidential democracy modeled after the America type.</p> <p>This politics of the second republic became characterized by thuggery, kidnapping, rigging, muddled elections etc. all resulting in an unprecedented violence. The first election of 1979 witnessed more conflicts. The second election, 1983 was almost a breakdown of law and order in most part of the country. And also the weakness of the FEDECO contributed to the failure of the 1983 elections.  </p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>Cover page-      -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       i</p> <p>Title page-                -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       ii</p> <p>Approval page--       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       iii</p> <p>Dedication-      -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       iv</p> <p>Acknowledgement-  -       -       -       -       -       -       -       vi</p> <p>Abstract-  -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       vii</p> <p>Table of contents-    -       -       -       -       -       -       -       viii</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.0   Introduction-   -       -       -       -       -       -       -       1</p> <p>1.1      Background of the study.-       -       -       -       -       -       2</p> <p>1.2      Statement of the Problem-       -       -       -       -       -       4</p> <p>1.3      Objective of the study-     -       -       -       -       -       5</p> <p>1.4      Significance of the study-        -       -       -       -       -       5</p> <p>1.5      Literature review-     -       -       -       -       -       -       6</p> <p>1.6      Research hypothesis-      -       -       -       -       -       17</p> <p>1.7      Scope and limitation of the study-   -       -       -       17</p> <p>1.8      The definition of the key concept-    -       -       -       18</p> <p>1.9      Research methodology-    -       -       -       -       -       20</p> <p>Reference -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       21</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p>2.0   An overview of electoral violence in the</p> <p>second republic-      -       -       -       -       -       -       22</p> <p>2.1   Historical Antecedent-     -       -       -       -       -       22</p> <p>2.2   Events that escalated violence in</p> <p>Nigeria politics-        -       -       -       -       -       -       -       26</p> <p>        1962 and 1963 population Census-        -       -       -       26</p> <p>        1964 Federal Elections -  -       -       -       -       -       30</p> <p>1965 Western Nigerian parliamentary</p> <p>Elections-        -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       33</p> <p> References-     -       -       -       -       -       -       -       37</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p> <p>3.0   Research Design and Methodology--       -       -       38</p> <p>3.1      Sources of Data-      -       -       -       -       -       -       38</p> <p>3.2      The emergence of political parties 1978 – 1979-      39</p> <p>3.3      Voting partern of 1979 election-      -       -       -       43</p> <p>3.4      The Rigging of 1979 election-  -       -       -       -       44</p> <p>3.5      The result of the election-        -       -       -       -       -       48</p> <p>References-      -       -       -       -       -       -       -       51</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></p> <p>4.0      The Second republic and election an analysis-        -       52</p> <p>4.1      Violence in 1979 Election-       -       -       -       -       -       57</p> <p>4.2      Violence in 1983 election-       -       -       -       -       -       60</p> <p>4.3      Functions and extent of independence of FEDECO-        69</p> <p>Reference-        -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       70</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></p> <p>5.0   Summary of finding, Recommendation and</p> <p>Conclusion-     -       -       -       -       -       -       -       74</p> <p>5.1   Summary of findings-      -       -       -       -       -       74</p> <p>5.2   Recommendations-  -       -       -       -       -       -       77</p> <p>5.3   Conclusion-     -       -       -       -       -       -       -       79</p> <p>        Reference -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       80</p> <p>        Bibliography-   -       -       -       -       -       -       -       81</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0   INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Explanatory of violence – Violence is one social phenomenon that does not and never did assure even its perpetrators safety their lives and property. It is an ill wind that blows nobody and good.</p> <p>Electoral violence in Nigerian politics has become very endemic. It seems that one hardly prepare for politicking in Nigeria, without making very adequate provision for violence. This is because politics involves conflicts of interest and the actors always eager to achieve their interest at the expanse of others. Therefore, is achieve their respective ultimate arms, they reports too bickering and violence.</p> <p>Nigeria’s adoption of parliamentary democracy at independence was by no means accidental. It was by design. For one thing, Britain Nigerian’s colonial master, had been in the practice of parliamentary democracy at independence was by no means accidental. It was by design. For one thing, Britain, Nigeria’s colonial master had been in the practice of parliamentary democracy for continues and even at independence, parliamentary democracy became one of the British colonial legates. What astonishes one is the inability of Nigerians to have embedded the rules of the game of politics such as tolerance, free and fair elections ability to accept election verdicts, ability to accept election verdicts and the willingness to quite political science if and when the electorate say no.   </p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Since Nigeria’s independence on October 1, 1960, Electoral violence has been a major feature of Nigeria politics and has been a subject of discussion both at private and public places students of political science and contemporary political scientists aluke have delude into the field of electoral violence of Nigerian politics.</p>\n\nELECTORAL VIOLENCE IN NIGERIA POLITICS A RESEARCH PROJECT SUBMITTED IN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF THE REQUIREMENT AWARD OF DEGREE IN POLITICAL SCIENCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ELECTORAL VIOLENCE IN NIGERIA POLITICS A RESEARCH PROJECT SUBMITTED IN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF THE REQUIREMENT AWARD OF DEGREE IN POLITICAL SCIENCE", "id": 6}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF INSURANCE INDUSTRY TOWARDS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF NIGERIA</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p> Evaluation of the impact risk survey in the manufacturing firm in Nigeria. The research was aimed at evaluation the impact of risk survey in manufacturing firms in Nigeria with a case study of Emenite Limited which is the researchers’ topic, objective of this study is to determine how risk managers survey their risk and how it is being control in manufacturing firm, and also these underwriting consideration in risk survey. The research method used was design in a manner to ensure adequate representation of Emenite Limited in Enugu Research findings established that reduction in the volume of loss and increase in profit maximization are the important of risk survey in the manufacturing firms. Apart form the existing risk control in manufacturing firms, other various new risk controls should be adopted.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>Title page                                                              ii</p> <p>Approval page                                                        iii</p> <p>Dedication                                                             iv</p> <p>Acknowledgement                                                  v</p> <p>Abstract                                                                vi</p> <p>Table of contents                                                    vii</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1       Background of the study                                         1</p> <p>1.2       Statement of the problem                                3</p> <p>1.3       Objectives of the study                                    4</p> <p>1.4       Research question                                           5</p> <p>1.5       Significance of the study                                         6</p> <p>1.6       Scope and limitations of the study                     6</p> <p>1.7       Definition of operational terms                                 7</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO: REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE</strong></p> <p>2.2      Brief history of Emenite limited                          10</p> <p>2.3      Basic categories of risk                                     13</p> <p>2.4      Concept of risk survey                                      15</p> <p>2.5      Reasons for risk survey                                     16</p> <p>2.6      The products offer by Emenite limited                18</p> <p>2.7      Various risks exposed to Emenite as a company   19</p> <p>2.8      Duties of a risk survey in a manufacturing firm    21</p> <p>2.9      Factors to be considered in risk survey               22</p> <p>2.10  The implication of risk survey in a manufacturing</p> <p>firm                                                               24</p> <p>2.11  Various method/strategies used in risk control     25</p> <p>2.12  The legal frame work of risk survey                           29</p> <p>2.13  The problems facing insurance industry in risk</p> <p>control                                                           32</p> <p>2.14  The prospects of effective risk management</p> <p> in manufacturing firms                                    34</p> <p>2.15  Challenges facing the insurance industry in</p> <p>effective risk management                                35</p> <p>2.16  Safety audit according to David (1989)               36</p> <p>2.17  Important of safety audit in manufacturing firm   37</p> <p>2.18  Advantages and disadvantages of risk survey</p> <p>(according to Odoh 2003)                                 38</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>3.1      Research design                                              40</p> <p>3.2      Source of data                                                40</p> <p>3.2.1                Primary data                                            40</p> <p>3.2.2                Secondary data                                        41</p> <p>3.3      Location of the study                                       41</p> <p>3.4      Population of the study                                     41</p> <p>3.5      Validity of the study                                                42</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR: SUMMARY OF FINDINGS</strong></p> <p>Summary of findings                                               43</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE: CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION</strong></p> <p>5.1      Conclusion                                                      45</p> <p>5.2      Recommendation                                             46</p> <p>5.3      Suggestion for further studies                                  47</p> <p>Bibliography                                                    49</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Risk is integral to everyday life. Once we have said that risk is always at the centre of insurance. We should also understand that risk is at the centre of our life. This means that for every human endeavor there is ‘risk’ as a result of our different economic pursuits. According to David (2001) risk exists where the future is unknown. It represents both desirable events and undesirable event. It is a desirable event when one internationally initiates certain things in order to better his socio-economic well being. Because of these desirable and undesirable events, an organization will want to transfer their risk to an instance company, which thereby brings about risk survey.</p> <p>According to David (1989) the prime object of a risk survey is to provide the underwriter with as complete a picture of the risk being offered as possible; to enable him decide whether the risk was acceptable and how it compared with the same kind and as the basis for deciding premium and other terms.</p> <p>In the present day the surveyor is still closely concerned with provision of underwriting information and in many situations the information disclosed by the completed proposal form, will need to be supplemented by a surveyors report before the picture is completed. However, the surveyor is now more closely concerned with accident preventions, surveying represents one aspect of the wider subject of risk control. Moreover, practice varies among individual answers and there are no established criteria for surveying manufacturing firms. However, it may safely be stated that risks of unusual character or with special features will normally be surveyed in that firm. A safety or risk audit will be conducted.</p> <p>A safety audit is a critical examination of an individual operation in its entirely to identify potential hazard and level of risk Audits are often undertaken by multidisciplinary terms individual members should have a good knowledge of legal requirements, an understanding of reasonable practice in the industry and above all the ability to communicate with at levels of personnel or department within the organization. In many companies, this expertise is not readily available and so audits tend to be undertaken by external specialist such as consulting engineers acting independently or employed by insurance companies. In a manufacturing firm like Emenite Limited. Risks that presents a serious injury/hazard are those where there are substantial involvement machinery(s) Reports from the Health and safety executive in Emenite limited however, shows that some 80% of accidents are not caused by machinery but by such simple things as falls, lifting heavy weight or defective hand tools.</p> <p>Risk survey will thereby go a long way in boosting productivity in manufacturing firm via review of risk and it will also help to facilitate improvement in the work force of the company like Emenite Limited.</p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>For the purpose of this study, the researcher identified some key factors that will help in identifying the problem.</p> <p>a.          There are various risk exposures in manufacturing firms</p> <p>b.          The ways of handling such risk exposures have not been encouraging.</p> <p>c.           Risk surveyors in manufacturing firms have not been living up to their expectations.</p> <p>d.          There have been lots of bottlenecks in implementing the preferred recommendations.</p> <p>e.          To know the role of surveys in identifying such risk and controlling the effects of the operation of manufacturing firms in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>a.          To find out the various risk exposure in manufacturing firms in Nigeria</p> <p>b.          To find out various ways of handling such risks exposures in manufacturing firms.</p> <p>c.           To find out the problems facing the insurance companies on identifying such risk exposures in manufacturing firms.</p> <p>d.          To know the role of risk survey in manufacturing firms</p> <p>e.          To make recommendations on how to improve the manufacturing firms through adequate risk survey tools by the insurance industry.</p> <p><strong>1.4     </strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>a.          What are the various risks exposures in manufacturing firm in Nigeria?</p> <p>b.          How can such risks exposures be handled by the insurance industry in order to keep the manufacturing firms going?</p> <p>c.           What are the problems facing the insurance industry in risk survey in manufacturing firms?</p> <p>d.          What are the roles of risk surveying the manufacturing firms in Nigeria?</p> <p>e.          What are the recommendations to improve risks surveys in manufacturing firms?</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work will be of immense help to:</p> <p><strong>The student</strong>: it will help the researcher to know more on the impact of insurance industry towards economic development of Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>The Stake holders</strong>: this study will be of great importance to stake holders as it will enrich their knowledge on the various risk in manufacturing firms.</p> <p><strong>Insurance company: </strong>this will equally be of help to the insurance companies and financial institutions in Nigeria because when they abide by the recommendations provided by the researcher it will help them in time of decision making.</p>\n\nA CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF INSURANCE INDUSTRY TOWARDS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF INSURANCE INDUSTRY TOWARDS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF NIGERIA", "id": 7}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF EXTENDING INSURANCE SERVICES TO THE RURAL AREAS</strong></p> <p><strong>(A STUDY OF OBA IN ANAMBRA STATE)</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The interest to write in this particular topic “Problems and Prospect of Extending Insurance Services to the rural areas” grow out of the present significant roles of insurance industry in extending service to the rural areas.

ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>In today’s modern society, the need for extending insurance services to the rural areas by the insurance industry is of a great important. The insurance industries which part of financial institution exist for the purpose of indemnifying an insured in the case of any loss occurrence. Furthermore, the insurance industry in Nigeria and has not been accepted by its people as to take its rightful place in the nation’s economy.</p> <p>The importance of the provision of insurance services has been recognized in modern Nigeria, through the various products offered by insurance firms, which are life assurance policies that is classified into individual life assurance, group life assurance and pension, and health insurance business while general insurance business like fire, marine, motor insurance business etc are offered to the consumers of insurance products who are individuals, social clubs, unions association etc.</p> <p>However, products offered to these groups/ person(s) are for protection against losses incurred by them and keeping them in business. Similarly, it is a fact that the major problem facing the growth and development of the industry in Nigeria today is ignorance an apathy for insurance services in the country. For this purpose, business concerns which is also very peculiar to the rural dwellers who are not easily accessible due to geographical factors and lack of infrastructural facilities in the rural areas of the country.</p> <p>Hence, the rural dwellers are mostly engaged in small medium scale activities such as subsistence forming, fishing, palm wine tapping, hunting e.t.c. which they may find difficult to buy insurance protection for their benefits against losses that might arise in the course of their daily activities.</p> <p>Thus, poverty and high rate of illiteracy which is a real factor limiting against the development and growth of the industry in the rural area. In the essence, the industry should do well to solve the inherent difficulties faced by the rural dwellers in finding ways and means of taking insurance services to them at affordable prices(premium) increase their performance, efficiency and profitability by embarking on awareness campaigns and creating of good wills.  Similarly, new products should be developed to suit their needs so as to attack and stimulate participation from the rural dwellers and to settle claims as at and when due with equity, modesty and quick response without prejudice.</p> <p><strong>1.1  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>The following are the statement of the problems:</p> <p>Rural areas do not know what is insurance; talk of insuring  their risk. Poverty and high rate of illiteracy which is a real factor against the development and growth of the industry in the rural areas, lack of trained personnel lead to the unavailability of trained personnel who would work in local areas where the prospective insured dwells. Lack of adequate infrastructure lead to the absence of transportation and communication, also affect the extension of insurance services to the rural dwellers.</p> <p>Ignorance and apathy to insurance services also bring about the high level of ignorance even among the so-called educated class and the meaning of insurance which is yet to be comprehended and by extension to the rural dwellers has affected the demand for insurance.</p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of the Nigerian Insurance Industry in the extension of insurance services to the rural areas. The main objective of this work is to:</p> <p>ü To find out whether the insurance companies extend services to the rural areas or not.</p> <p>üTo find out why the insurance industry has not been accepted by the rural dwellers.</p> <p>üTo evaluate the causative factors of these problems and to provide possible solutions.</p> <p>üTo determine whether geographical factors and lack of infrastructural facilities affect the location of insurance companies in the rural areas.</p> <p>üTo find out the reason for lack of insurance culture and to offer strategies for developing insurance culture in the rural environments.</p> <p>üTo make useful recommendations based on the finding and then give possible solution to it.</p> <p>ü </p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In the cost of this research, certain research questions were generated to guide the researchers in their findings.</p> <p>-Apathy and ignorance for insurance services hinder the provision of insurance services to the rural areas.</p> <p>-Special packages at affordable price (premium) would attract participation from rural dwellers.</p> <p>-  Poverty and illiteracy limit factors against the development and growth of the industry in the rural areas.</p> <p>Geographical factors and lack of infrastructural facilities limit the extension of insurance services to the rural areas.</p> <p>-Prompt payments of claims encourage the acceptance of insurance services by the rural dwellers.</p> <p><strong>1.4     </strong><strong>RESEARCH OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>The following hypotheses from the frame</p>\n\nPROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF EXTENDING INSURANCE SERVICES TO THE RURAL AREAS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF EXTENDING INSURANCE SERVICES TO THE RURAL AREAS", "id": 8}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div> <p><strong>LIMITATIONS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF INSURANCE IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p><strong>(A STUDY OF NATIONAL INSURANCE CORPORATION OF NIGERIA NICON)</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>Regulation of Nigeria’s insurance industry has become substantially intensified in the last two decades.

The last two decades has witnessed among others, government regulatory intervention through the establishment of a regulator and mandatory recapitalization.</p> <p>Temporally, the trajectory of developments in the last decade which coincides with post-authoritarian military rule in the country is significant. As a developing economy, the Nigerian insurance industry presents an example of untapped and gross under-utilization of its boundless potentials. Adopting a qualitative approach, this paper explores the factors responsible for the industry’s slow growth in comparison with its huge human and material resources and what lessons might be learnt to chart a way forward.</p> <p>The first part of the paper traces the origin of insurance in the country to its colonial heritage. The second part examines the rationale for regulating insurance business. The focus then shifts to regulation of insurance in Nigeria. The paper is yet to be concluded as there are outstanding issues for analysis in on which research is still in progress.</p> <p>Nigeria, a country of more than 140 million people with a landmass of about 923,768.64sq. km and immense human and material resources is a former British colony. Hence, the country shares almost all its political and economic settings from its former colonial heritage. Before the introduction of the modern form of insurance, some form of social insurance had existed in the Nigerian society. These social schemes evolved through the existence of extended family system and social associations such as age grades and other unions (Osoka, 2008). Until 1966, Nigeria copied British parliamentary system of government. This British system still dominates aspects of the country’s socio-economic settings. For instance, the legal practices in Nigeria still reflect its colonial heritage. Economic institutions such banks and insurance companies, in practice, copy the British style of conducting their businesses.2 However, the country’s progress since independence in 1960, has however been undermined by long years of military rule, political instability and systemic corruption. In 1999, a civilian government was finally elected to office after a successful political transition process.</p> <p>The development of insurance are intertwined with the advent of British trading companies in the region and the subsequent increased inter-regional trade. Increased trade and commerce led to increased activities in shipping and banking, and it soon became necessary for some of the foreign firms to handle some of their risks locally (Uche and Chikeleze, 2001). Trading companies were therefore subsequently granted insurance agency licences by foreign insurance companies. Such licences made it possible for such firms to issue covers and assist in claimssupervision.</p> <p>The first of such agency in Nigeria came into force in 1918 when the Africa and East Trade Companies introduced the Royal Exchange Assurance Agency. Other agencies included Patterson Zochonis (PZ) Liverpool, London and Globe, BEWAC’s Legal and General Assurance and the Law Union and Rock (Osoka, 2008). There was an initial slow pace of the growth of the insurance industry in the country, particularly between 1921 and 1949. This has been traced to adverse effect of the World War II on trading activities both in United Kingdom and Nigeria. As soon as the war ended, business activities gradually picked up again, and insurance industry in Nigeria began to record remarkable improvement in growth. It was not until 1958 that the first indigenous insurance company, the African Insurance Company Limited, was established (Nigeria Re, 1993). At independence, only four of the then 25 firms in existence were indigenous.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The problem militating against the development of insurance in Nigeria are:</p> <p>Inadequate orientation about insurance and its benefits in the rural communities One of the earliest and the most resilient problems the insurance industry, and the broking firms in particular has been contending with and will continue to contend with is the problem of ignorance as the benefits of insurance products. Many do not know what insurance is all about; even the educated ones.</p> <p>Some believe insurance is a smart way of extorting money from the people. The problems created by some dubious practitioners who will collect premium without remitting same to the appropriate quarters do not help matters either.</p> <p>Poor knowledge of the benefits of insurance by Nigerians It is believed that insurance practitioners, especially the brokers will still need to do more in this area, especially in educating the public on the numerous benefits of insurance products and how such benefits can be harnessed. Furthermore, as a result of the persistent political and economic crises, we have been unable to educate the public about what they stand to gain from insurance.</p> <p>Poor attitude of Nigerian towards insurance business in Nigeria</p> <p>Hence the old attitude towards the insurance that was based on ignorance keeps rearing its ugly head against the growth of the industry, especially the broking subsector.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research work is to examine the limitations to the development of insurance in Nigeria.</p> <p>The specific objectives of this research work are to:</p> <p>1.  To find out how insurance cover are sold to the consumers.</p> <p>2.  To examine the extent of development of insurance in Nigeria</p> <p>3.  To find out the factors militating against the development of insurance in Nigeria.</p> <p>4.  And also proffer solutions to the problems identifies.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The following research questions were formulated by the researcher:</p> <p>How is insurance covers sold to the consumers in Nigeria?</p> <p>What is the role of insurance policy in the development of Nigeria?</p> <p>What is the extent of development of insurance in Nigeria?</p> <p>What are the factors militating against the development of insurance in Nigeria?</p> <p>How the problems  militating against the development of insurance in Nigeria be solved?</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>The following are the hypothesis formulated by the researcher in this research work:</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS ONE</strong></p> <p>Ho: Insurance covers is not sold expensively to the consumers in Nigeria.</p> <p>H­­­1: Insurance covers is sold very expensive to the consumers in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS TWO</strong></p> <p>H­0: Insurance do not have any role to play in the development of Nigeria.</p> <p>H1: Insurance has significant role to play in the development of Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS THREE</strong></p> <p>H0: insurance has no significant growth in Nigeria</p> <p>H1: Insurance has significantly grow in  Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS FOUR</strong></p> <p>H0: there is no problem militating against the development of insurance in Nigeria.</p> <p>H1: there are so many problems militating against the development of insurance in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work will be of immense help to:</p> <p><strong>The student</strong>: it will help the researcher to know more on the factor militating against the development of insurance in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>The Stake holders</strong>: this study will be of great importance to stake holders as it will enrich their knowledge on the effects of this problems on investment.</p> <p><strong>Insurance company: </strong>this will equally be of help to the insurance companies and financial institutions in Nigeria because when they abide by the recommendations provided by the researcher it will help them in time of financial crisis.</p> <p><strong>The country at large: </strong>this study will be of great importance to the country Nigeria as it will help the policy makers to prorogate laws that will guide insurance contracts in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY  </strong></p> <p>The area of this research work is Enugu metropolis were the NICON insurance is situated and the study is on the limitations to the development of insurance in Nigeria. </p> <p>The researcher in carrying out this study encountered numerous problems, which includes:</p> <p>i)      Fund.</p> <p>ii)     Time.</p> <p>iii)    Lack of research materials</p> <p>iv)    Responds of the respondents</p> <p>i)      FUND – This included lack of enough fund to move around and visit the various areas in the state, and also lack of money to buy enough research material which constitutes on impediment of to researchers high cost of transportation in the city due to long distance also imposed its own limitation on the researcher.</p> <p>ii)     TIME – Time is</p></div></div>\n\nLIMITATIONS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF INSURANCE IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " LIMITATIONS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF INSURANCE IN NIGERIA", "id": 9}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE EFFECT OF INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN PROMOTING BANKING SERVICES IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p><strong>(A CASE OF SKYE BANK ENUGU)</strong></p> <p><strong>                   ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research study is to identify the effect of insurance industry in promoting banking services in Nigeria.

Since economic development is perceived as a multi-dimensional process, it requires not only capital and technology but also attitude and the creation of the institutional structures. It also includes special protection of the financial institutions.</p> <p>          The banking system has thus been singled out for this special protection because of the vital roles banks play in an economy especially in the process of economic development. According to C. Arthur Williams jr (1992), the establishment of insurance protection and cover through Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) was informed by economic circumstances and by a number of other considerations. The economic circumstances involved the new economic policy of government, the bitter experience of prior bank failures in Nigeria and the lessons from other countries with bank deposit insurance scheme.</p> <p>          The distress in the banking system often precipitate other crises and this has necessitated regulatory and supervisory authorities to take a series of actions and intervention in response to these problems.</p> <p>The emergency of Nigeria Deposit Insurance corporation into financial sector of the Nigeria economy was borne out of necessity and need to check the incessant rise and fall of indigenous banks, Thus, the objectives of the Nigeria Deposit Insurance corporation are to protect bank depositors, ensure stability in the industry, encourage healthy competition among banks at foster, informed risk taking by insured institution, grant financial assistance to banks experiencing difficulties among others.</p> <p>Insurance industry also stand as a risk transfer mechanism that can also provide cover and protection to some certain uncertainties that can negatively affect Nigeria banking services. According to J.O Irukwu (1999), Insurance cover risks like:</p> <p>Loss of building and contents to fire and special perils</p> <p>Loss of cash-in-transit and cash-in-safe</p> <p>Loss or break down of computers and other business machines</p> <p>Loss due to infidelity of employees</p> <p>Loss due to bad debts</p> <p>Theft in the business premises</p> <p>Loss of key employees</p> <p>Loss due to professional negligence</p> <p>          The researcher in this research work was prompted by the curiosity to know the challenges facing Nigeria banking and how much insurance industry has contributed to tackle and solve those challenges.</p> <p><strong>1.2                  </strong><strong> STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS.</strong></p> <p>The under listed problems are what led to this research:</p> <p>1.                 Liquidation of banks</p> <p>2.                 Weakness of internal control</p> <p>3.                 Inconsistency in monetary and banking policy</p> <p>4.                 Fraudulent and unprofessional  conduct of bank staff, depositors and customers</p> <p><strong>1.3                  </strong><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>1.     To determine the effect of insurance industry on bank liquidation in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.     To evaluate the extent of weakness of internal control system in Nigerian banking industry.</p> <p>3.     To examine the impact of inconsistency in monetary and banking policy.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN PROMOTING BANKING SERVICES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN PROMOTING BANKING SERVICES IN NIGERIA", "id": 10}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE EFFECT OF RECRUITMENT, SELECTION PLACEMENT ON ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS</strong></p> <p><strong>(A STUDY OF AFRICAN SAFETY INSURANCE COMPANY OKPARA AVENUE ENUGU)</strong></p> <p><strong><em>Abstract</em></strong></p> <p><em>The effect of recruitment, selection and placement of an employee in the right position in organization cannot be over emphasized.

It demand and knowledge to recruit, select and place an employee in the right position for an organization to achieve the organizational objectives. The proper application of recruitment, selection and placement of policies in an organization has been the major concern of most personnel managers.</p> <p>       The effect of recruitment, selection and placement of an employee in the right position in organization cannot be over emphasized.

After recruitment and selection have taken place, the job holders may either be sent on training or not depending on the training needed and of course the feasibility of training before being placed under recruitment, the internal source which is one of the most useful, through often neglected. Source of manpower recruitment policy is based on utilizing present personnel through transfers, promotion, recalls from lay off or retirement.</p> <p>       This as in matter of fact, reduced the cost spending in developing source of applications advertising in Newspaper, radio and television etc. This source is known to be very reliable since it deals with employees whose ability is already known which finally suits to organization effectiveness.</p> <p>       In the contrast, having from outside may use to reduce the inbreeding often asserted with internal source. The external source deals with people who are current employed of the company. The people that fall under this category are under employed, unemployed person, newly qualifies applicants and dissatisfied workers selection follows immediately after recruitment.</p> <p>       As cited by C.C. Nwachukwu 1988, that placing an employee in a Job that is not qualified and make him of his intrinsic satisfaction and makes him doubt   his ability hence a threat to himself the entire organization. Therefore, personnel managers greater care should taken by herring to manpower or human resources requirements of various development and eliminating bras, favouritism and increase organization effectiveness in tram of output.</p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>·        Poor system of recruitment and selection staff affecting organizational performance in African safely insurance company.</p> <p>·        Improper policy implementation hampering the operational performance of African Safely insurance company.</p> <p>·        Improper placement of the employees at the right position in the organizational performance in African safely insurance company.</p> <p>·        The employees of the organization are not properly placed at the right position at the right time.</p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of the study included the following:-</p> <p>i.            To know the effect of poor system of recruitment, selection and placement on organizational effectiveness.</p> <p>ii.           To expose the reason behind implementation in African safety insurance company.</p> <p>iii.         To examine the system of recruitment and selection of staff and hoe it affects organization performance in African safety insurance company.</p> <p>iv.         To find out why there is improper placement of the employees at the right position in the organization.</p> <p><strong>1.4     </strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>i.            are there effects of recruitment selection and placement on organizational effectiveness in African safety insurance company.</p> <p>ii.           Are there policies that problems in the operational performance of African safety insurance company.</p> <p>iii.         Are there effects of non placement of position and at the right time on the performance of the organization.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF RECRUITMENT, SELECTION PLACEMENT ON ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF RECRUITMENT, SELECTION PLACEMENT ON ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE IMPACT OF MOTOR INSURANCE POLICY ON THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ECONOMY</strong></p> <p><strong>(A STUDY OF NICON INSURANCE)</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This research work titled “The impact of motor insurance policy on the growth and development of the economy” Nigeria  motorist are not embracing motor insurance policies and one of the objectives are to know why Nigeria motorist embrace motor insurance policies, and the scope of the study is NICON insurance motor Department, The information for the study was collected using primary and secondary methods of data collection.

However, as the number of cars multiply on the highways rate of accident injured and death also multiple. Hence, the need for motor insurance.</p> <p>       The first country that gave a lead in this direction was the great Britain. Other countries have the Traffic Act at 1930, introduced a compulsory insurance. The Act made it an offence for anyone to use or permit the use of a meter vehicle on a read unless there is in force a policy of insurance covering the liability of the motorist against death or motor accident.</p> <p>       The idea of compulsory insurance was recognized quite early in west Africa and British legislation on the subject was extended to the four west African British colonies, Nigeria, Gold Coast, Sierra Leone and Gambia, each of these territories now has it own specific legislation on this subject.</p> <p>       Modern insurance was introduced in Nigeria by European trading companies which establish trading post in Nigeria and their companies were appointed agent for insurance business by British companies in London Later, Nigeria traders and merchant of substantial status where given power to secure insurance business issues cover meters mostly on cargo and assistance in settlement of claim.</p> <p>       As a result of this progress, Royal exchange Assurance branch office was established in Nigeria in the year 1921 and this company dominated insurance business for almost thirty years before the establishment of other companies such as provincial insurance company, nor which union, fire insurance company and Nigeria General insurance company limited to mention but a few – the incorporation of Nigeria into the Board Traffic Act by the British Parharment in 1945 imposed a statutory obligation on the users of motor vehicle to provide security against their legal liability for causing death of or bodily injury to the third parties.</p> <p>       Thus, the study is meant to evaluate the impact of motor insurance policies on the growth and development of the economy. Looking of NICON insurance company as a study.</p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>Statement of the Problems</strong></p> <p>1.  Nigerian motorist are not embracing motor insurance policies.</p> <p>2.  People are not aware of the compensation in motor insurance policies.</p> <p>3.  Nigerian motor and third parties have not actually felt the impact motor insurance policies.</p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong>Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>The following are the objective of the study.</p> <p>1.  To know why Nigeria motorist embraced motor insurance policies.</p> <p>2.  To create awareness of the compensation motor insurance policies.</p> <p>3.  To ensure that the Nigeria motorist and third parties actually felt impact of motor insurance policies.</p> <p><strong>1.4     </strong><strong>Research Question</strong></p> <p>1.  Have Nigeria motorist been embracing motor insurance policies.</p> <p>2.  Are people aware of the compensation on motor policies.</p> <p>3.  Have Nigeria motorist and third parties actually felt the impact of motor insurance policies.</p> <p><strong>1.5     </strong><strong>Research Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>Hi: Nigeria motorist have been embracing motor insurance policies.</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MOTOR INSURANCE POLICY ON THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ECONOMY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF MOTOR INSURANCE POLICY ON THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ECONOMY", "id": 12}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE ROLE OF INSURANCE MIDDLEMAN IN THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF INSURANCE BUSINESS</strong></p> <p><strong>(A CASE STUDY OF ALPHA BROKER)</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This research work, the researcher examined the role of insurance middlemen in the growth and development of insurance business.

The researcher found out that Insurance middleman has significant impact in the development of Nigerian insurance industry. Insurance middleman/intermediaries has so many roles to play in Nigerian insurance business. There is significant relationship between insurance middleman/intermediaries and the development of Nigerian economy. Based on the findings the researcher recommends that There should be periodically arranged programmes which will aim at keeping the insurance intermediaries abreast of the development with the industry. Emphasis should be laid on good public relations and most importantly, insurance intermediaries should stick to the principle of utmost good faith\" so as to discharge their duties to the public with honesty and integrity thereby improving the bad image of insurance companies and result in more revenue. The intermediaries should try to maintain after sales services. They should know whether their clients are having any problems with their policies or insurance company. They should always be in touch with their policyholders.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>Title page                                                                                       i</p> <p>Approval Page                                                                        ii</p> <p>Dedication                                                                              iii</p> <p>Acknowledgement                                                                 iv</p> <p>Abstract                                                                                 vi</p> <p>Table of Content                                                                    vii</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1      Background of the Study                                               1</p> <p>1.2      Statement of the Problem                                              3</p> <p>1.3      Objective of the Study                                                    4</p> <p>1.4      Research Question                                                         5</p> <p>1.5      Research Hypothesis                                                      6</p> <p>1.6      Significance of the Study                                                7</p> <p>1.7      Scope and Limitations of the Study                               8</p> <p>1.8      Definition of the Terms                                                   9</p> <p>Reference       </p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF INSURANCE MIDDLEMAN IN THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF INSURANCE BUSINESS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF INSURANCE MIDDLEMAN IN THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF INSURANCE BUSINESS", "id": 13}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE PROBLEMS OF DEBT MANAGEMENT IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTION</strong></p> <p><strong>(A STUDY OF UNION BANK PLC GARDEN AVENUE ENUGU)</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This work is to carryout research on debt recovery techniques in the banking sector issues, problems and prospects (A study of Union Bank of Nigeria plc).

sector of the economy is made up of banks and non-banks financial institutions like financial house, mortgage house and other institutions that provide financial services and intermediation to the various segment of the economy.</p> <p>       In modern society, economic prosperity and progress depend largely on level of savings in a Nation.  It happens that someone’s savings is made available to an investor for productive venture like what happens in Commercial Banks.  When this happens, a debt is created.  A debt has been described as an obligation to made future payment. </p> <p>It is against the borrower’s promise to make future payment. As a result of this, the owners of these funds face the risk of not getting their money in good time or losses it entirely when the custodian of these funds cannot manage them well hence debt management becomes a singvenon to guarantee the confidence of the individual depositor that his money is safe.</p> <p>Debt management involves arrangement put in place for repayment of these credit facilities</p> <p>       In the same way, it is also fulfill a wider role in safe guiding the stability of the individual bank and thus the banking system as a whole.

They are smarting from the wealth sport industry from the recapitalization and expanding globally to compete internation communities. They are currently participating in the local content initiative of out and gas business energy insurance marine and aviation and other transportational and logistic risks. Hence, Nigerian supporting industry is an area that have not actually benefited from the activities of insurance since insurance has been defined as a social security welfare, it will help the  participants to boast their confidence in participating in sports without fear. Nigeria is not only seen as a leading country in Africa in the field of sports but also a world achiever in the field such as world cup of various categories is over emphasized.</p> <p>because he scored four goals in match.the family comprehensively recovered by way of insurance protection which is not obtainable in Africa setting Ukpai (2004) advocated that insurance in sports will create confidence, provides for retirement protection, protects various elements of disability and equally improves an economy.

The first attempt at adopting a health insurance system, Nigeria started in 1962 during the first republic. The federal government invited Dr. Halevi through the international labour organization (120) to look into starting a health insurance system in Lagos. Then minister for health Dr. Majekodunmi also presented the first bill to the parliament. When a committee was commissioned to study the national insurance (Oji, 2003). The health population and indeed work force are indisputable tools for rapid socio-economic and sustainable development the world over. Despite thus indisputable fact, in Nigeria like most Africa countries, the provision of quality accessible and affordable health care remark a serious problem (WHO, 2007, Oba, 2008), thus is because the health sector is permeably face with cross shortage of personnel, inadequate and outdated medical equipment policy inconsistence and corruption. Other factor that impede quality health care delivery IN Enugu include inability of the consume to pay for health services gender bias due to religious or cultural beliefs and inequality in the distribution of health care facilities between urban and rural areas. In 2007 for instance, world health organization (WHO) report on health care delivery ranked Nigeria 187 out of 191 countries than in 2005 only 48 and 35 percent of the children within the age of zero to one year old were fully immunized against tuberculosis and measles respectively between 1998 and 2005, 28 percent of the children with in the ages of 5 years who suffered from diarrhea received and equate treatment.</p> <p>A social health insurance scheme involves contribution base on means and utilization based on need. A health insurance scheme has been define as an arrangement in which contribution are made by or behalf of employees or individual (members) to purchasing institution (a fund) which is responsible for purchasing coursed services from providers or behalf of the members of the scheme (Kutzin) 1997. It is the opinion of Nigeria government that the NHIS will probably provide effective health care services and help to improve accessibility to health care services and help to improve accessibility to health care services (Ibwaye 2007). But the assessment of the programme after four years of operation reveals less than 3% coverage (Ikpong: 2007), and these was as a result of poor implement of the scheme in Nigeria. This research will evaluate the effect of national health insurance in enhancing health care delivery in Enugu.</p> <p><strong>1.9     </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The following are problems that prompted the research of this project work:</p> <p>1.  Failure to understand the significant contribution of effective and efficient national insurance scheme in Enugu.</p> <p>2.  Failure on the part of the Nigeria government to enhance easy accessibility of national health insurance scheme.</p> <p>3.  Poor effective administration and management of the activities and operation of the national health insurance scheme in Enugu.</p> <p>4.  Unawareness of the existence, roles, important benefits and workability of national health insurance scheme.</p> <p><strong>1.10                </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The following are the objectives of the research work:</p> <p>1.  To find out the significant contributions of effective and efficient national insurance scheme in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To find out whether the government enhance easy accessibility of the national insurance in Enugu.</p> <p>3.  To examine whether there is any awareness of the existence, roles, important benefits and workability of the business activities of national insurance scheme in Enugu.</p> <p>4.  To find out the problems facing effective and efficient administration and management of national insurance scheme in Enugu.</p> <p><strong>1.11                </strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The research question of thus research work include the following:</p> <p>1.  Is there any significant contribution of effective and efficient national health insurance in Enugu?</p> <p>2.  Are there any problem of effective and efficient administration and management of the national health insurance scheme in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  Does Nigeria government enhancing easy accessibility to national health insurance role, important benefits and workability of the national health insurance sc</p>\n\nTHE EVALUATION OF THE EFFECT OF NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEME IN ENHANCING HEALTH CARE DELIVERY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EVALUATION OF THE EFFECT OF NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEME IN ENHANCING HEALTH CARE DELIVERY", "id": 16}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE IMPORTANCE AND ROLES OF INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN NIGERIA ECONOMY</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The need for this research paper is partial fulfillment of the researcher’s program in insurance and as a result of the need to know the importance and roles of insurance industry in Nigeria economy.

In this project work the researcher want to identify the history of insurance industry in the Nigeria economy and also the actual roles and the importance of insurance industry to the common man and the society at large. such roles importance include in every sector  of the economy, like, the banking sector, Agricultural/Sector, aviation sector, Business sector etc. the research work also treated the types of insurance industry in Nigeria, here the researcher compared it with the types operated overseas and the method used to the standard. Also the project work, focused on the problem encountered by the industry and all the necessary measures that can be used to improve Nigeria insurance up to the worlds standard.</p> <p>       The development of insurance industry, in Nigeria has passed through three distinguishable phase; the initial often door phase, roughly between 1990 and 1960, the transitional phase which concludes with the first national development plan period, 1962 – 1969 and the take off phase (1990 to the present times) witness the toughening of the framework of government regulation and represent a radical change in governments attitude towards the control the industry, there was when the insurance market were dominated with European compaine who monopolies the insurance industry, during this early period, a number of factors did not ensure an active market. Economic activity is at low level, there was  no insurance consciousness by the populace, due to non–existence of some legislation, like that of motor vehicle and other things, it made Nigeria market to grow in a low peace and also the third world war hindered the growth of the market.</p> <p>       After the war, Nigeria experienced a lot of improvement, and after that was the introduction of worker’s compensation act 1940 and the road traffic act 1945 which came into force on 1st April 1950. Due to the increase in insurance industry in Nigeria.</p> <p>This was after Nigeria had their, independent there was a rapid increase in the number of company established and an increase in insurance industry and some of the foreign companies were turned to indigenous companies. The first step was to regulate the operations of the insurance companies to ensure a sound and efficiency insurance market, which would not only discharge its duties to members of the insuring public but would constitute the solid foundation for future growth and development. It was also discovered that some of the insurance companies are not investing in Nigeria, because there was no provision in the law. This leads to the Act of 1964 which states that any insurer should invest Two – Fifth its premium in Nigeria.</p> <p>       As Nigeria insurance industry increase; it was discovered that it is operated by some in experience people, and led to problem and the government arrested the situation by appointing.</p> <p>       Dr. Karl Reichel in October 1996 a united Nations expert the most far reaching action of government, which improves insurance business in Nigeria was the establishment of the National insurance corporation of Nigeria (NICON) in 1 July, 1969. In June 1970 the Post of the superintendent and deputy supper intendance was credited. This phase experience increase in adoption of direct mechanism, a charging situation which was the inevitable result of the growing belief that effective control of the economy must necessarily accomplish the achievement of political independence.</p> <p>       This was where all the problems and weakness in the previous stages was corrected, and the government had control or exclusive public ownership of very strategic industries. The policy of the federal military government to participate in a number of key industries was formulated and implemented. They set up their owned enterprises. The government also helped in the promotion supervision and control of insurance industry in other to protect the investing public.</p> <p>       One of the recent developments is the creation of reinsurance, which was mainly operated by Europeans and others and also the lunch of the National health insurance Scheme (NHIS) by president Olusegun Obasanjo (GCFR on 29th May 2005). The present stage has thus exhibited the features of the “take of phase”, the market is greatly boosted by legislative provision for compulsory insurance, set owned industries dot the industrial map of the company, again with the indirect effect of boosting the insurance business new legislation is passed with a view to indulgencing the insurance industry and providing a strong financial base for the companies and ensuring a high standard of insurance practice in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>In this section the researcher focused on the prevalence problem that has led to the insurance industries in Nigeria not performing so well. These problems militating against the insurance industries roles in Nigeria economy are as follows:-</p> <p>1.  Ignorance in the part of the members of the public</p> <p>2.  To a certain extent, lack of expert in the field.</p> <p>3.  Poor infrastructures and information technology</p> <p>4.  Limited number of insurance company with a maximum capacity to sustain heavy loses.</p> <p>5.  Lack of information</p> <p>6.  Non –compliance/disclosure of materials fact by the subscribing public to the insurance company.</p> <p>7.  Poor management of existing insurance industry</p> <p>8.  Poor liquidity in the some insurance industries.</p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objectives that made the researcher to go into this topic are as follows:</p> <p>i.            To find out the major roles and importance of insurance industry in Nigeria economy.</p> <p>ii.           To find out a way to increase the roles to the standard in the world today.</p> <p>iii.         To find out if there are possible approach, which can be used to eliminate the poor standard of insurance services in Nigeria.</p> <p>iv.         To bring to the knowledge of the public the importance of insurance industry in the economy.</p> <p>v.          To make suggestion and recommendations that could be useful in solving the identified problems.</p> <p><strong>1.4     </strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>1.  What are the importance of insurance industry in Nigeria economy</p> <p>2.  Do insurance company provide claim settlement in accordance with the law and terms of relevant insurance policy?</p> <p>3.  What roles do insurance company play in the Nigeria economy?</p> <p><strong>1.5     </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY OPERATION</strong></p> <p>This study is meant to highlight the importance and roles of insurance industry in Nigeria economy.

Uncertainties, regarding the quality and quality of the crop/livestock output due to natural hazards, are one of the basic risks that are constantly faced by every farmer. But majority of farmers are subsistence in natures and are seldom able to bear such risk especially when large loss involved. The information for the study was collected using primary and secondary methods of data collection. For the primary data collection, questionnaires, personal observations and oral interviews were used while existing literature relevant to the topic was consulted for the secondary data. The researcher used chi-square statistical model to analyze the data. At the end of the research work the researcher  find out the following: that Agricultural insurance scheme has helped the farmers to get agricultural loans easily from the farmers to get agricultural loans easily from the financial institution by the use of her policy document, which banks accept as enough collateral security from farmers. Based on the findings the researcher made the following recommendations: Government provision of befitting accommodation for the NAIC that pilot the scheme. Since the scheme to established and 100% owned by the federal government, the government should assist in providing, benefiting accommodation for the office because of its importance to the Nigeria farmers, Government should assist the Nigeria Agricultural Insurance Corporation in the publicity of the scheme especially at the grassroots. This will encourage the farmers to go and take loan and invest it in agriculture without fear of uncertainlees, Before a farmer is qualified for a loan in agricultural bank/Commercial Banks, there is a minimum saving required by the bank to qualify you certain amount of loan. Guideline: Bank should be well acquainted with the modalities of the scheme so to educate their loaners in their local branches on the operations of the scheme.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>Title page                                                                     i</p> <p>Approval page                                                                      ii</p> <p>Dedication                                                                    iii</p> <p>Acknowledgment                                                           iv</p> <p>Abstract                                                                       v</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0     </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1               Background of the study                                      1</p> <p>1.2               Statement of problem                                         5</p> <p>1.3               Objective of the study                                         5</p> <p>1.4               Research question                                              6</p> <p>1.5               Research Hypothesis                                           7</p> <p>1.6               Significance of the study                                      8</p> <p>1.7               Scope and Limitation of the study                         9</p> <p>1.8                          Definition of terms                                                                               12</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE</strong></p> <p>2.1 An overview                                                            15</p> <p>2.2  The meaning and concept of agricultural      insurance 15</p> <p>2.3  Historical background of agricultural     insurance in other countries                                                                        18</p> <p>2.4  Evolution of Nigerian agricultural   insurance scheme   19</p> <p>2.5  Reasons for low productivity and the    effects     of natural hazards in Nigeria    agriculture                                        24</p> <p>2.6  Risk in agricultural classification of        these risks             26</p> <p>2.7 funding and administration of agricultural insurance scheme in Nigeria                                                                     30</p> <p>2.8      Basic agricultural insurance policies available in</p> <p>the scheme                                                            35</p> <p>2.9      Beneficiaries and advantages of agricultural insurance scheme in Nigeria                                                        38</p> <p>2.10  Procedure for insurance                                           40</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p> <p><strong>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND DESIGN</strong></p> <p>3.1      An overview                                                   45</p> <p>3.2      Sources of data                                               45         </p> <p>3.2.1        Primary data                                                46</p> <p>3.2.2        Secondary data                                            46</p> <p>3.3      Population of the study                                     47</p> <p>3.4      Sample size of study and sampling techniques     49</p> <p>3.5      Instrument in determining sample size               51</p> <p>3.6      Validity of the instrument                                 51</p> <p>3.7      Method of data presentation analysis                  53</p><p> CHAPTER FOUR </p> <p><strong>DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS </strong></p> <p>4.1  An overview                                                      56</p> <p>4.2      Data presentation                                            57</p> <p>4.3      Data analysis                                                  58</p> <p>4.4      Testing of Hypothesis                                       68</p> <p>4.5      Discussion of findings                                       76</p><p> CHAPTER FIVE </p> <p><strong>SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION</strong></p> <p>5.1      Summary findings                                            78</p> <p>5.2      Conclusion                                                      79</p> <p>5.3      Recommendations                                           81</p> <p>5.4      Suggestion for further studies                                  83</p> <p>Bibliography</p> <p>Appendix</p> <p>Questionnaire</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The principle feature, which distinguishes agriculture from other production sectors, is its great dependence on nature which itself is beyond man’s control. The agricultural sector, as importance as it is exposed to extremely high degree of disk arising out of natural factors like weather conditions. Uncertainties, regarding the quality and quality of the crop/livestock output due to natural hazards, are one of the basic risks that are constantly faced by every farmer. But majority of farmers are subsistence in natures and are seldom able to bear such risk especially when large loss involved. The decline in the supply of products in turn creates a shortage of inputs in other sectors of the economy; thus the entire economy is open to the serious consequences of agricultural risks of which the farmers, are most direct and primary victims. Most of these events that result in these losses are beyond the control or prevention by individuals or society as a whole.</p> <p>It is therefore, important that devices be employed for minimizing the adverse economic effect of these natural hazards in agriculture. Not only lives and well being of individuals but also the economic viability of the entire nation may be at state.</p> <p>Agricultural insurance is therefore the most important available device for minimizing the adverse effects of natural hazards. Agricultural Insurance Scheme is a collective system or scheme for reducing economic uncertainties through the basic techniques of risk pooling whereas the frequency of the severity of crop losses of individual farmers cannot be predicted, the predictability and severity of losses frequency is substantially increased when similar exposure of large number of farmers are pooled.</p> <p>However, there are measures established to increase agricultural production and from income like the Agricultural Development Project (ADP), operation feed the Nation (OFN), the Green Revolution, the Nigeria Agricultural and Co-operative Bank and various River Basin Authorities in deferred states. These measures have not been with success because of the huge losses of agricultural production caused by natural disaster/hazards which has been the major constrains in increasing food production in Nigeria economy. Agricultural insurance therefore offers production to farmers (Insured) from the effect of these natural disaster and ensure payment of appropriate compensation sufficient to keep the formers in the business after suffering a loss. It minimizes and eliminates the need for emergency assistance provided by government during the period of agricultural disaster.</p> <p>Agricultural Insurance Scheme is therefore; aimed at encouraging banks to be more liberal in extending agricultural credits to farmers for increased food production since their loans are under agricultural insurance policy cover. Most importantly, the scheme includes research and development which generates innovations that reduce risks of diseases, pets and yield losses in agricultural production and give protection to farmers. It provides financial support and increases the growth of agricultural credit from lending institutions and farmers. Therefore, farmers are encouraged to ensure their farm projects with Nigerian Agricultural Insurance Corporation (NAIC), so as to have more coincidence to embark on wider ranger of Agricultural productions.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>There has been so many problems associated with Nigeria Agricultural insurance cooperation in agricultural development in Nigeria. Some of such problem includes:</p> <p>1.  Nigeria Agricultural insurance cooperation are not adequately covering Agricultural risk.</p> <p>2.  Nigeria Government is not adequately funding Nigeria Agricultural insurance cooperation.</p> <p>3.  Famers in the rural Areas don’t even know the existence of Nigeria Agricultural insurance cooperation.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research work is to examine the role of Nigeria Agricultural insurance cooperation in the development of Nigerian agricultural industry, the specific objective of the study include the following:</p> <p>1.  To examine why Nigeria Agricultural insurance cooperation are not adequately covering agricultural risk.</p> <p>2.  To examine why Nigerian government is not adequately funding Nigeria Agricultural insurance cooperation and its economic implication.</p> <p>3.  To know why famers in the rural area do not know about the existence of Nigeria Agricultural insurance cooperation.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>1.

<p>In Nigeria the issue of taking life assurance policy has been neglected, in the sense that at this present time, it is estimated that not up to two percent (2%)  of Nigerian’s own life assurance policies, from the research made on the internet, life assurance business is more operated and recognized in other countries such as UK, USA, Canada, Germany and other European countries, in Africa  life assurance business is more recognized in South Africa for this fact, the benefits and roles life assurance plays in this country is being viewed from a very cooked point there by making it slightly visible moreover, the life assurance industry has  entered on era of accelerated change as a result of increased competition, such as other life institution e.g. National Health Insurance Sector (NHIS). Hence professional marketing management is now a pre-requisite, if a company is to return or advance its position in the competition hierarchy.</p> <p>Based on the investigations made on net, the major contention of this or the major aim of writing this is to pinpoint some of the challenges affecting life assurance industries in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2  Statement of problem</strong></p> <p>a.  Previous studies has shown that sub-standard policies which was designed by the underwriter’s could not meet the current change in the society towards satisfying individuals needs.</p> <p>b.  High rate of poverty in the country that results to no interest or concern by the individuals to effect life assurance policy.</p> <p>c.   The low demand for life assurance policies which could b e as a result of in appropriate marketing strategies.</p> <p>d.  The high rate of illiteracy which affects the easy or free flow of life assurance business in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3  Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>In this study, the main objective is to find out the problems militating against or the challenges affecting the marketing of life assurance policies in Nigeria and to proffer solutions remedy on way out of the problem or how the problem will be solved.</p> <p>Those specific objectives as are as follows:</p> <p>a.  To know whether those policies were designed to meet the current change of the need of the individuals/ the consumers.</p> <p>b.  To find out how the high level of poverty in the country affects the patronage of life assurance policy.</p> <p>c.   To examine whether those strategic method in marketing of life assurance policies are suitable for the business in promoting the industry.</p> <p>d.  To find out if there is any alternative means for creating an awareness of life assurance policies to the uneducated one in the society.</p> <p><strong>1.4  Research Questions</strong></p> <p>a.  How does those policies designed, meet the need of the individuals/ the consumers.</p> <p>b.  To what extent has high level of poverty in the country affected the patronage of life assurance policies?</p> <p>c.   How do those strategic methods in marketing of life assurance policies suitable for the business in promoting the industry.</p> <p>d.  What are those alternative means for creating an awareness of life assurance policies to the uneducated ones in the society?</p>\n\nMARKETING OF LIFE ASSURANCE POLICIES IN NIGERIA PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MARKETING OF LIFE ASSURANCE POLICIES IN NIGERIA PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS", "id": 20}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE IN ENHANCING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY</strong></p> <p><strong>(A CASE STUDY IN UZO-UWANI L.G.A) </strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>Insurance is needed in order to alleviate the financial losses suffered by policy holders or the general public where the liability under policy is a contingent’s one. Therefore agricultural insurance takes care of the losses suffered by the farmers. To do this very successfully by an underwriter the compensation has to be made from contribution (premium) of all parties participating in the insurance. It is the aim of this research work therefore to find out if agricultural insurance has contributes in any meaningful way to enhancing agricultural productivity. Weather agricultural insurance has actually gained acceptance by the rural farmers. If compensation and adequately paid when losses are encountered by the farmers. And the possible areas the farmer can over with agricultural insurance policy the research work. Contains a general background discussion on the role of agricultural insurance in enhancing agricultural productivity. It went further to state the problem to be studies and why this research study was carried out, the scope and limitation of the study and finally the research questions and the definition of terms. AA number of related literature as it affects agricultural insurance were critically reviewed to provide enough background to the study. With the design of the study, the methods used in collecting relevant data it also deals with the way questionnaires were distributed and the treatment of data. The data got from the research survey were analyzed interpreted and presented.

It has then been embraced by a lot of the world like Canada, Mauritius, Zimbabwe, Philippines, Iran, Zambia and Nigeria with varying degrees of success and failures in agriculture production.</p> <p>In Nigeria, there has been growing need since, 1976 to evolve a worthwhile and more permanent natural approach to risk management in agricultural and this has continued to attract the attention of the various governments. To this effect, Nigeria agricultural Insurance Corporation was established by funded largely by her with the predication of state government and organization private sector.

One of the reasons for this failure is that most farmers in Nigeria have never discovered the need to insure their farms and other agricultural of the federal government in establishing the Nigeria agricultural insurance scheme (NAIS).</p> <p>Sourcing of fund has proved highly impossible because the lending institution also are supposed to fund agricultural development are quite doubtful of advancing loan to this sector because of the risks of uncertainty and insecurity.</p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong>significance of the study</strong></p> <p>Agricultural insurance unlike the conventional insurance is relatively new in Nigeria. consequently, there are many problems involved in collecting data and other materials for research in the field of insurance. this problem underscore the significance of this piece of work hence, the study will be helpful to students of insurance and other interested displine who may wish to carry out further study on this new field.</p> <p>The research will assist both the federal government and the Nigeria agricultural insurance corporation which are directly as the device better ways of improving their performance. this will also enlighten e various marketing intermediaries on the need to participate more effectively in the operation of the scheme to ensure it success.</p> <p>Furthermore, since the scheme serve as a kind of production to the insuring public (ie the insured farmers) thereby enhancing greater confidence to all farmers) (whether insured or not) on adopting a new and improved farming practice and in making greater economy’s perhaps aids to increase the state agricultural production.</p> <p><strong>1.4     </strong><strong>objective of the study</strong></p> <p>1.  To investigate the number of claims that was reported to NAIC yearly.</p> <p>2.  To investigate the amount paid by the farmers as premium.</p> <p>3.  To investigate the performance of the relevant financial institution and agricultural lending institution on the insurance policy.</p> <p>4.  The research will also check the output achieved in farming activities under the agricultural insurance scheme.</p> <p>5.  To investigate the claim settlement methods and procedures of the agricultural insurance scheme.</p> <p>6.  To investigate significant difference between the period covered by Niger insurance Plc and Nigerian Agricultural Insurance Corporation in Nigeria. </p> <p><strong>1.5     </strong><strong>Scope and Limitation of the study</strong></p> <p>Nigeria Agricultural Insurance Corporation is the only corporation underwriting all agricultural policies in Nigeria with a network of branches made the study unique. The research work carried out tend to be in dynamic setting as the scope of the work extend from the head office of the Nigeria agricultural insurance corporation in Abuja to the nearby zonal office here in Enugu. The research work covered agricultural crop, insurance product. The volume of work local require in a research of this nature could not be carried out without some limitations. first, was inadequacy of finance, second was the death of book, journal magazine on agricultural insurance as secondary source of data collection thirdly, the illiteracy level of respondent farmers constituted serious handling and mount loss of vital information relevant to this piece of work.</p> <p><strong>1.6     </strong><strong>definition of terms</strong></p> <p>The following terms used in this study should taken to mean the following:</p> <p><strong>1.  </strong><strong>Agricultural Insurance:</strong> Is insurance cover giver to farmers or stake holders in the agricultural sector.</p> <p><strong>2.  </strong><strong>Underwriting: </strong>It means undertaking by signing an insurance policy0 to pay damage when ever losses occur.

Various innovative technological applications allows the insurers to recognize the risks and opportunities easily. The modeling device examines the loss histories and compare them with the risk characteristics  while it searches for correlation's. Such insurance technology help the insurance companies to charge higher prices for the higher risk client base and lower price for the safer opportunities.

It is this consideration that is called premium, the law of Insurance States that no cover without premium on the other hand, as far as insurance is concerned.

In the observation of this fact, the federal government gave approval for the establishment of more insurance companies in the past century.</p> <p>Ever since the establishment and formation of insurance industry, premium has been a vital tool for the contract of insurance to be effectively binding on both parties to the contract.</p> <p>Premium is the monetary consideration passing from the insured to the insurer for the undertaking to pay the sum insured in the event of the risk insured against happening. It is a necessary element and ingredient in the formation of an insurance contract.</p> <p>Insurers have table in rates of premium chargeable by them for each class of risk underwritten. In construction these tables, they are guided as far as possible by experience. The rates of premium ordinarily charged may be increased or decreased depending on whether the insured seeks a wider protection than that which the insurers are willing to provide for property similar to that for which insurance is sought of if the insured is prepared to accept a narrow cover or to comply with any special requirement imposed by the insurers.</p> <p>On the other hand, when a person buys some  product, his major or primary objective, aim or concern is whether that product will be fit for the purpose for which he is buying it. Most of the time, he would have satisfied himself by inspecting the product and that it is performing before eh actually pays for it.</p> <p>But as far as insurance is concerned, there is no tangible product to test, what the insured purchase is just a promise to pay a claim arising after the purchase and consisted with the policy sold. The actual test therefore does to come until such a claim comes up from the insured or other party concerned. If the insured is satisfied, then he made a good bargain. But where however the insurer fails, the insured is disappointed. His disappointment may result in serious consequences to the insurer. The insured may feel so badly injured that he may resort to court action with its attendant bad publicity for the insurer. Therefore, an insurer will be regarded as good if he has a good reputation as far as settling of claim is concerned.</p> <p>Meanwhile, claims settlement is a very vital issue that may cause dispute between the insurers and their policy holders, infact, most of the disputes that arise in insurance contact have to do with settlement of claims and “quantum” i.e. the amount to be paid. So an important factor that distinguishes a good insurance company is its claims settlement services.</p> <p>It does not mean therefore that an insurer should be over liberal in order not to edge it’s self out of the market. Meanwhile, admitted genuine claims should be settled promptly for an insurance company to maintain a good public image and confidence.</p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>1.          Poor relationship between premium payment and claims settlement in Nigeria insurance industry.</p> <p>2.          Inadequate knowledge of the effect of claims settlement on insurance practice.</p> <p>3.          Lack of proper management of premium payment by the insured.</p> <p>4.          Challenges facing insurance that hinders effective claim settlement in insurance business in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>1.          To evaluate and analysis the relationship between premium payment and claim settlement in Nigeria insurance industry.</p> <p>2.          To determine if adequate premium payment will have impact on claim settlement in insurance industry.</p> <p>3.          To determine the role of premium payment will have impact on clam settlement in Nigeria insurance industry.</p> <p>4.          To find out and highlight problems facing insurance that hinders effective claim settlement in insurance business in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.4     </strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>Based on the objectives of the study, the following questions were formulated:</p> <p>1.          Is there any relationship between premium payment and claim settlement in Nigeria insurance industry.</p> <p>2.          Is there any implication of inadequate premium payment on claim settlement.</p> <p>3.          Is there any role of premium payment towards claim settlement in Nigeria insurance industry.</p> <p>4.          Are there problems facing insurance practice that hinders effective claim settlement in insurance business in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.5     </strong><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>1.    Ho:  There is no direct relationship between premium payment and claims settlement.</p> <p>       Hi:   There is a direct relationship between premium payment and claims settlement.</p> <p>2.    Ho:  Adequate premium payment will not have any effect on claim settlement in insurance industry.</p> <p>       Hi:   Adequate premium payment will have any effect on claim settlement in insurance industry.</p> <p>3.    Ho:  Insurance Industry does not face challenges due to premium payment and claims settlement</p> <p>       Hi:   Insurance Industry faces challenges due to premium payment and claims settlement</p> <p><strong>1.6     </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>THE STUDENT</strong></p> <p>       It will serve as a secondary data for students who will carry out related research study in future.</p> <p><strong>THE STAKEHOLDERS</strong></p> <p>       This work will review the activities of insurance companies as concerning premium payment and claims settlement.</p> <p><strong>THE INSURANCE COMPANY</strong></p> <p>       The knowledge gained in this work will help insurance companies to know the effect of claim settlement on insurance practice.</p> <p><strong>THE COUNTRY AT LARGE</strong></p> <p>       It will help the general public to know the effect and advantages of adequate premium payment on claims settlement growth and development of insurance companies.</p> <p><strong>1.7     </strong><strong>SCOPE OF THE ST</strong></p>\n\nTHE ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PREMIUM AND CLAIM SETTLEMENT IN NIGERIA INSURANCE INDUSTRY  (BETWEEN THE YEAR 2002-2012)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PREMIUM AND CLAIM SETTLEMENT IN NIGERIA INSURANCE INDUSTRY  (BETWEEN THE YEAR 2002-2012)", "id": 24}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE ROLE OF INSURANCE COMPANY IN NIGERIA AS NON-BANKING FINANCIAL INSTITUTION: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS:</strong></p> <p><strong>A CASE STUDY OF LIMITED NIGERIA INSURANCE COMPANY (UNIC) </strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>This study attempt to provide a general information and knowledge about the impact of insurance companies in the business world.

The first insurance company to have a full branch office in Nigeria was the Royal Exchange Assurance. It opened its first office in Lagos in 1921 and until 1949 it practically dominated insurance business in the country. Therefore, there was high degrees of awareness of the importance of insurance services to the economic growth and business world particularly in Edo State and Nigeria in general. At the end of 1989 to 1998, insurance companies were operating as registered companies in Nigeria and most are indigenous. The leading indigenes insurance company in Nigeria is the National Insurance Cooperation of Nigeria (NICON) which is fully owned by the Federal Government of Nigeria which underwrites about 25% of the total insurance business in Nigeria.</p> <p>        Some of the objectives of the company is to encourage commercial houses, cooperation’s and companies to go into ventures by giving them cover against possible losses. It also encourages the spirit of savings by way of life assurance which provides benefits for the dependent, in case of untimely death of the assured. The board is run by experienced men and a set of businessmen and it headed by a chairman. The management of the company is completely Nigerianised (i.e. Nigerians) as mentioned before. The chief executive is the general manager who directly responsible to the board of directors. He supervised day-to-day running of the company and he is assisted by experienced and able senior management staffs who are in charge of finance, administration, life and pension and technical department. This was however, attributed to government stringent economic measure and poor economic situations of the country. According to the insurance Act of 1976, insurance in Nigeria is divided into two main classes. Thus life assurance and non-life insurance.</p> <ol><li>Life Assurance <ol><li>Whole life assurance</li> <li>Endowment</li> <li>Children education and assurance</li> <li>Mortgage protection</li> <li>Terms assurance</li> <li>Group business protection </li> </ol></li> <li> Non-Life Insurance <ol><li>Motor vehicles</li> <li>Burglary house breaking</li> <li>Fire</li> <li>Cash-in-transit</li> <li>Goods-in-transit</li> <li>Bonds</li> <li>All risks/contractors</li> <li>Fidelity</li> <li>Workman’s accident</li> </ol></li> </ol> <p><strong>1.2    BACKGROUND STUDY OF BENIN CITY AND BUSINESS IN BENIN CITY</strong></p> <p>        The emerged of insurance company in Edo State can be traced to 1968 when the first branch of UNIC insurance company opened in Benin City. This awareness brought a boom to the insurance industry. It was during this period of boom in the insurance company that UNIC insurance company limited came into existence in Benin City. One of the main objective of the UNIC insurance company is to increase investment and better public awareness of the benefit of insurance to society at large. In the first two years of its inception the UNIC insurance company incurred net losses of N10, 000 and N54, 000 respectively of course, this was the formative years, then followed a period of modest growth and success during which profit were recorded. But between 1989 and 1991, there was a succession of high loss margin. This was however attributed to government stringent economic measures and poor economic situation of the country. However, UNIC insurance company offers all types of insurance protection. Some of the demerit of the UNIC insurance company is that poor public awareness regarding the principle of insurance has not helped, and even among those Nigerians that do know the benefits of insurance cover, there remains a widespread perception that Nigerian insurance are reluctant to settle claims.   </p> <p>1.3    <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong> </p> <p>          The Nigeria insurance company has been described as undeveloped when compare with those in the developed countries. For some time now. Nigeria insurance company has be subjected to explosive criticism from economic, commercial educationist, even professionals in insurance field etc. so, many accusation have been levied against the insurance companies. The most common of such criticism is the one which relates to settlement of claims majority of the insurance companies customers and non-customers alike have been feeling dissatisfied about settlement of claims as many of them would say. When it comes to their (insurer) turn to pay claims, they will flimsy excuses.</p> <p>1.4<strong>    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY </strong>    </p> <p>          The fundamental and cardinal objectives of this study are to critically examine and determine the impact of insurance companies in the business world. The broader objectives of the study could be summarized as follows;</p> <ol><li>The probable impact of insurance companies constriction, in term of stimulation of business activities among the people of the nation.</li> <li>The degree with which fear of risk has been removed from the minds of investor in the economy.</li> <li>The determination of economic situation or atmosphere, of the contribution of insurance companies had created in the business economy.</li> <li>The probable impacts of insurance companies on investment in the nation.</li> <li>The degree with which the economic activities of businesses are accelerated through insurance companies.</li> <li>Finally, possible ways in which the insurance companies have contributed to economic development of business world.   </li> </ol> <p>1.5    <strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The purpose of the study is multi-dimensional. Its importance cannot be overemphasized. The insurance companies play an important role in the growth and development of the nation economy. The researchers purpose to this study therefore are summarized under the following headings;</p> <ol><li>To help clarify some misconception about the operation of the insurance companies, such misconception include non-payment of claims by insurers: pool of thieves etc will be clarified.</li> <li>To identify and examine the ways in which insurance companies create in individual the sense of thrift that is how insurance practice help create in an individual the sense of thrift by saving through easy monthly installments.</li> <li>To examine the willingness or unwillingness of business establishment in taking insurance policies.

Among income earners, only a few have small proportion of their disposable income as savings. This small amount which cannot be used for any meaningful investment project, can be saved through insurance contract or policy. This small amount of money from many insurance policy holders are pooled together which form a pool of investment loan.</li> </ol> <p>1.6    <strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY </strong>   </p> <p>        The scope of the study is limited to the role of insurance companies in the business world especially in Edo State. Also, since Edo State is a very large state with local government areas, the researcher confined herself to Benin City, being the capital and a true representation of the whole state.

Research has shown that there is a significant relationship between the extent to which one understands and the importance one attaches to insurance. The more clear and understandable one finds insurance to be and the more likely it is that the insurance intermediaries will be know the importance of insurance before the facilitators can be recognized. This shows that low level of literacy constitutes to the problems encountered by the insurance intermediaries. Because the intermediaries work for the insurance company, any problem that affects the company affects them.</p> <p>            The experience of some people who had be dealings with insurance over the years ha snot be very cordial such unfavourable relationship had been publicize over the years that it has created a poor perception of insurance intermediaries and the insurance companies to the general public. Insurance have not help issues by their reticent in publishing their activities. One has to be aware of insurance before one makes a conscious effort to understand what it is all about.  The insurance industry has the duty to create awareness of the existences of their intermediaries and their industry in the minds of the public.</p> <p>            Individual insurance companies have the responsibility of letting the public know that its intermediaries exist and what functions they perform. Literature such as one of the roles of insurance companies and intermediaries to individuals and the society in general should be widely circulated.</p> <p>            Handling of insurance claim is another area were insurance intermediaries encounter problem. This is obvious because when an insurance company could not settle her claim with the insured (policyholder) the impact fall on the intermediaries that facilitate contractual relationship between the insured and the insurance company. This makes the general public to call both the intermediaries and insurance companies fraudsters. A good insurance transaction lies essentially on the ease with which are insurer claim cheque is received. Claims handling is one area were an effective communication is necessary, as well as reaching prompt decision immediately all facts are known. The inability of the insurance companies to do this makes it difficult for an intermediary to help his clients in sorting out their claim with the company.</p> <p>Location of the insurance company also is one of the problems encountered by intermediaries because they find it difficult to transact business in rural area. There is no comparison between an insurance company situated in the city and that of rural area.

<p>        According to Brettl. J. the subject matter of insurance is money and money only.  They act as mobilizers of funds from surplus units and channel them to deficit units.</p> <p>        This channeling can be refered to as indemnity.</p> <p>        This can be put in another way, that the primary purpose traditionally of insurance to spread the financial losses of insured members over the whole of the insuring uncertainty by compensating the unfortunate few from the contributions of all members.</p> <p>        Premium changed by the insurance company is its primary sources of manning income, therefore the insurance companies help on premium for its insured or person, financial rights or liability to mention but a few.</p> <p>        However, the financial compensation promised by the insurer is what is called the subject matter of the contract.</p> <p>        Insurance contract is subject to the general Principles of Nigerian Law of Contract as in any other commercial activity.  It these principles that makes for its validity.  Not only does it affect insurance but it operates in every other commercial aspect of life.</p> <p><strong>1.1    BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>        The role of insurance as one of the major economic activities of a nation has long received would acclamation.  It is not a dispute that insurance has attained a high degree of commercial sophistication.</p> <p>        Insurance business plays a major role in shaping the economic furtunes of the business enterprise institutions and individuals.</p> <p>        The economic profits of any country usually has an impact on both cost and benefits of insurance.  Thus one should consider the examination of the subject of insurance regulation timely in view of current economic climate.     </p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>        It has been a concern within the insurance industry on the introduction of the prudential guidelines, as it affects the performance appraisal of the insurance companies.</p> <p>        This research work is geared towards investigating the impact of this guideline as it affects the insurance industry in Nigerian.</p> <p>        In 1979 there was an act guiding the operations of insurance and ie- insurance business in Nigeria.</p> <p>        This act stipulated that minimum of 25 percent of the total assets of the insurance companies should be held by government and semi-government securities.</p> <p>        Non life insurance companies should invest not less than 10 percent of their total assets in real estate,  while the minimum proportion for life insurance companies was fixed at 25 percent.</p> <p>        However, in recognition of the financial intimidation role of insurance companies by government the lending operation of the companies were brought under the control of the C.B.N with effect from April 1978.  From then an insurance companies required to render monthly returns of their operation to the bank within 30 days from the end of each month.</p> <p>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</p> <p>a.           To ascertain the impact of the prudential guidelines on insurance companies.</p> <p>b.           To examine the facts contained in the prudential guidelines issues.</p> <p>c.           To examine the performance of insurance companies with regards to premium income and profit since the introduction of the prudential guidelines.</p> <p>d.           To identify the problems insurance companies face as a result of the introduction of prudential guidelines.</p> <p>e.           To know whether insurance companies now send monthly report to regulatory bodies.</p> <p>f.            Recommendations on the researcher’s findings.</p> <p><strong>1.4    SI9GNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>a.           INSURANCE COMPANIES</p> <p>This licensed companies will, through this research, work improve on their performance since the researcher will let the public know all that is required of the insurance companies as contained in the prudential guidelines issued on licensed insurance companies.</p> <p>b.     THE GOVERNMENT</p> <p>        Since the government though it regulatory bodies like NISB, C.B.N, etc issued the prudential guidelines this research will help the government know whether to let the prudential guideline continue or to withdraw it from being used by insurance companies.</p> <p>C      THE PUBLIC</p> <p>        The public here includes, the “insured” and the intending ones.  This research work will help particularly the intending policy buyers to be aware of the new insurance policy on the insured.</p> <p>1.5        SCOPE LIMITATION AND DELIMITATION                 </p> <p>SCOPE</p> <p>        This research work covers the facts of the guidelines, premium income and profits position of insurance companies before and after the prudential guidelines, how the insurance companies welcome this new guidelines the impact the guidelines have made so far and the problems facing insurance companies as a result of the guidelines.</p> <p>LIMITATION</p> <p>        In Nigeria researchers are most of the time, regarded as tax collectors  and they face many problems in the society.  The researcher are not exempted and so, had a share of problems.</p> <p>i.      Finance and Time wasted   </p> <p>        The research had to call on C.B.N, NDIC and some insurance companies within Enugu before obtaining the required information. </p> <p>        There was a huge transportation cost because of the researcher’s regular visits to the insurance companies and NDIC and much time was wasted which could have been employed in accomplishing some other things.</p> <p>ii.      Secrecy and lack of Statistics</p> <p>        To obtain the required information from the CBN, NDIC and others insurance companies was difficult because every information they considered confidential and so not information needed by the researcher was made available to him.</p> <p>DELIMITATION</p> <p>        Due to the above limitation, the researcher purposely did not write out names of distressed insurance companies as a result of guidelines issued and detailed of their transactions.</p> <p>1.6    RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</p> <p>1.6.1         H0    The prudential guidelines has not made any impact on licensed insurance companies. Since its introduction.</p> <p>HI     The prudential guidelines has made some impacts on licensed insurance companies since its introduction.  </p> <p>1.6.2         H0    The insurance companies indemnity and premiums positions have not changed in spite of the introduction of the prudential guidelines.</p> <p>                HI     The insurance companies indemnity and premiums positions have introduction op the prudential guidelines.</p> <p>1.6.3         H0    Insurance companies do not send monthly reports to CBN, NDIC since the prudential guidelines was issued under compulsion.</p> <p>                HI:    It has become a law that insurance companies disclose all about them to CBN, NDIC monthly as a result of introduction of prudential guidelines issued.</p> <p>1.6.4         H0:   Insurance companies are not having problems as a result of the prudential guidelines issued to them.</p> <p>                HI:    Insurance companies are experiencing problems which is do to the result of the prudential guidelines issued to them.</p> </div>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF THE PRUDENTIAL GUIDELINES IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF THE PRUDENTIAL GUIDELINES IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY", "id": 27}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>MARKETING OF LIFE ASSURANCE POLICIES IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p><strong>(A STUDY OF LEADWAY ASSURANCE</strong><strong> PLC ENUGU)</strong></p> <div> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>In Nigeria the issue of taking life assurance policy has been neglected in the sense that at this presence time, it is estimated that not up to two percent (2%) of Nigerians own life assurance policies due to poor education and inappropriate marketing strategies for this fact, the benefits and role life assurance plays in this country is being viewed from a very crooked point thereby making it slightly visible.This study therefore focuses on marketing of life assurance policies in Nigeria.

For this fact, the benefits and roles life assurance plays in this country is being viewed from a very crooked point thereby making it slightly visible.</p> <p>        Moreover, the life assurance industry has entered on era of accelerated change as a result of increased competition in the products and pricing within all the insurance sectors. Hence professional marketing management is now a prerequisite, if a company is to return or advance its position in the competitive hierarchy they must follow suit.    </p> <p>However, before choosing the kind of cover to take, the intending assured should first of all sit down and analyzed his need. Life assurance has been said to be for those who live too long and those who die too soon. The needs of people in both these categories can be met.  Most salary earners and wage earners have other people depending on them, it could be parents, a wife, children or even brothers and sister. In life assurance programs, funds are accumulated  through payments made by the assured person called premium so that, should death occur, prior to a specified date or upon survival at an agreed period funds would be made available from the scheme to pay whatever benefits that are due.</p> <p>        The idea of assistance and association is not new to the Nigerian society. Various town and clan unions and social dubs, have various ways of showing benevolence to their bereaved members as discussed earlier. It is customary for people to pay condolence visit and present a sympathy purse. These practices are similar to mutual life assurance.</p> <p>        However, life assurance as practiced today is part of the nation’s colonial heritage. Obviously, the British introduced life assurance into Nigeria, hence the practice closely follows, the British pattern.      The earliest colonial insurance interest in Nigeria was directed to the general insurance of goods and cargo.</p> <p>Few life businesses which tricked in were referred to British Home Officers in London for processing. Only the affluent could afford it then because it was considered as enormous risk to insure person living in the tropics and the cost of providing such life cover was very expensive and uneconomical.</p> <p>With independent in 1960, life assurance started to change. Lead way Assurance Company was incorporated between Nigerians and expatriates. It therefore became the life specialist’s underwriter. Within the same period, the Nigerian life and pension consultants together with the Nigeria universities management consultant indicated the development of group life and pensions scheme in Nigeria. Before 1960, many Nigerians shunned the idea of effecting life assurance cover. They felt generally that the insurance agents were wishing them bad-luck, premature death and therefore would never have anything to do with the insurance and their agents.</p> <p><strong>1.2         Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>a)   Lack of statistics which result to problem in payment of benefits.</p> <p>b)   Inability by insurance marketer to design policies which will meet the current change in the society.</p> <p>c)   The effect of insurance image in Nigeria due to tribalism, religions strife etc.</p> <p>d)   The low demand for life assurance policy which could be attributed to lack or poor education and inappropriate marketing strategies.</p> <p>All have contributed to the problem which tends to impede development of life assurance in the Nigeria society.</p> <p><strong>1.3    Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>        Having been exposed to the problems, we have to look into what the researcher intend to achieve which is as follows;</p> <p>a)   To provide a new statistical method that will enhance payment of benefit</p> <p>b)   To identify those policies that suits the current demand in the society</p> <p>c)   To promote insurance image and enhance inhabitance co-existence in the society</p> <p>d)   To provide a strategic method in marketing life assurance polices and promotes public awareness.</p> <p><strong>1.4    Research Questions</strong></p> <p>1.   Are there any method used in valuing payment of benefit?</p> <p>2.   Does the organization carry out marketing research to know the current trends of an event in the society?</p> <p>3.   Does socio-cultural beliefs of the society affect the operation of life assurance policy?</p> <p>4.   Does lack of public awareness hinder the activities of life assurance?</p> <p><strong>1.5    Research Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>Ho:  Insurance companies have no strategic method in</p> <p>marketing life assurance policy.</p> <p>H1:  insurance companies have strategic method in</p> <p>marketing life assurance policy.</p> <p><strong>1.6    Significance of Study</strong></p> <p>        The study of the problems facing marketing of life assurance companies is significant in many ways, especially to the insurers, the life assurance intermediary and the insuring public.</p> <p>        Hence at the end of this study, the insurers and the life assurance intermediaries will be able to identify the problem militating against the effective marketing of life policy in the society. The study is also meant to highlight the need for adequate sales promotion methods, advertising principles and understanding of the life assurance policy.</p> <p>        Finally, it points out the need for marketers in the life assurance industry to appreciate the concepts, strategies and application of marketing as a spring board for growth and also the need for them to work with the actuaries of the life policies to specific target markets.</p> </div>\n\nMARKETING OF LIFE ASSURANCE POLICIES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MARKETING OF LIFE ASSURANCE POLICIES IN NIGERIA", "id": 28}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>MARKETING CONCEPTS A SURE WAY OF ENHANCING GROWTH IN THE SALE OF INSURANCE SERVICES</strong></p> <div> <p><strong> ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This project aims to apprise the Marketing Concepts a Sure Way of Enhancing Growth in the Sale of Insurance Services.

Insurance allows the individual insure to substitute a small cost (i.e. premium) for so large but uncertain loss (not to Exceed the amount of insurance under an arrangement whereby the fortunate many who escape loss will helps to compensate the unfortunate few who suffer loss. The aim of insurance contract is to provide indemnity, ie compensation for injuring or loss sustained. Insurance has two broad classes which include life and non-life insurance. Life insurance comprise of whole life assurance, term assurance, endowment assurance and Annuity while Non-life insurance consist of fire insurance, marine insurance, motor vehicle insurance, contractors “all risk” and engineering risk insurance occupy a strategic position in on economy because it is the only business which exists for the survival of other business. Moreover, for these insurance product and service which is available to consumers to reach target market (that is desire people), adequate sensitization and awareness should be create in order to reach out to all the consumers. One of these is the adoption of selling concept. An organization produces a product and then uses various methods of selling to persuade a customer to buy their product. Their aim is to sell what they product and not to satisfying what the customers wants and need. Selling concept which include product, place, price and marketing which include product, place price and promotion have a long way in satisfying potential consumers and encourage others towards insurance products.  The focus of marketing mix remain how to make people embrace insurance product, use the products and enjoy the varieties of services offered by the insurance company and in turn make profit.</p> <p>        The marketing concept is a philosophy of the business which states that the customer wants satisfaction is the economic and social justification of their wants at a profitable volume in an integrated business operation. The marketing concept can also be said to be the philosophy that recognizes that the consumers is at the centre of everything we do in business. Its concept believes that without consumers there on be no marketing and based on this it should be aimed at satisfying the need of the consumer.</p> <p>        The marketing concept is based on three fundament beliefs:</p> <p>1.     <strong>Marketing orientation:</strong>      The insurance company should try to research and find out how best to create awareness or orientate the customers.</p> <p>2.     <strong>Profitable sale volume</strong>: Target customers should be examined by the company to find out whether their product, customers, sale men and territories are profitable.</p> <p>3.     <strong>Co-ordination of marketing activities:</strong> This measure as used to determine the extent of the implementation of the marketing concept. Here, the organizational status of the chief marketing executives and the extent of integration of marketing functions under the chief marketing functions is the main concern.</p> <p>Therefore, the major problems facing the marketing concepts in Nigeria is implementation that is why strategies are being mapped out by most companies to meet the demand of the customers by applying marketing concept to its business.</p> <p><strong>Problems of the insurance services in Nigeria </strong><strong>are as follows:</strong></p> <p>Delayed settlement of genuine claims; low level of regulatory compliance; absence of new products; delayed remittance of premium by intermediaries; inroad of banks into the industry; moral hazards and sharp practices; government’s policy inconsistency; weak regulatory measures; illegal commissions and rebates; and poor image of the industry. This last problem has made for shallowness of the market for insurance.</p> <p>Considering that so much have changed between the socio-economic environment of your days in insurance business and now – The average Nigerian is considering the pressing needs of food and shelter, before giving any thought to insurance (<strong>Man never chop to keep money for insurance</strong>). Without even taking cognizance of prevalent general insufficiency of income among Nigerians to patronize insurance, what about the well-known conception that a typical Nigerian insurance company is never ready to pay in any event of sad occurrence? When compulsory, many Nigerians now prefer cheaper premium ‘to fulfill all righteousness’. Some are of the view that even with the government (the biggest consumer of insurance in the land), incidents of debts remain very high. It is alleged that government officials often prefer to divert funds meant for insurance to other uses. In a nutshell, there is high apathy towards insurance in Nigeria.</p> <p>While researching for this piece, an insurance expert summarized the following as <strong>other problems</strong> of insurance in Nigeria:</p> <p>- The industries which feed the short term insurance underwriting business are affected by adverse market situation (e.g. manufacturers).</p> <p>- Long term insurance contracts, which are more rewarding are not really there. The industry is merely making do with short term insurance market (e.g. property insurance; compulsory life insurance; individual and other life insurance). These come at a time when even many marginally insured refrain from paying premium.</p> <p>- Those long term business which typical insurance companies should rely upon (e.g. group life insurance, annuity insurance, investment related insurance) are farfetched. Who does not know that the rates of returns on short term insurance (often affected by commercial rate inflation index) are not quite profitable?</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>                Inspire of the growing number of insurance companies in Nigeria, its growth is still being hindered because the insurance sector still witness a low level confidence in the insuring public, the general patronage is still at lowest. Internal problems among the executives in an organization hinder the smooth implementation of marketing concept to insurance activities this is due to inability of the management of various insurance companies to engage the services of qualified marketers. Finally, these and other numerous problems; both internal and external environment still hinder the operations of the insurance sectors of the economy. In view of these problems stated that necessitate this research work. The researcher wants to identify the problems and then put forward a solution to the problem. </p> <p><strong>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to examine the extent and scope of the application of marketing concept to insurance industry.</p> <p>        The specific objectives of the study are:</p> <p>I.      To examine the relevance of the marketing concept in the marketing of insurance services in Nigeria.</p> <p>ii.      To examine the problem encountered in the adoption of marketing concept in insurance industry in Nigeria.</p> <p>iii.     To examine the extent to which marketing concept has enhanced marketing of insurance in Nigeria.</p> <p>iv.     To make recommendation based on the findings of the study for organizational improvement.</p> <p><strong>1</strong>.<strong>4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS          </strong></p> <p>1.     To what extent is marketing concept relevant to insurance services in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.     To what extent do problems encountered in the adoption of marketing concept in insurance industry been successful?</p> <p>3.     To what extent does marketing concept enhance marketing of insurance in Nigeria?</p> <p>4.     To what degree of success to the problems in the application of marketing concept in insurance industry Nigeria been realized?</p> <p><strong>1.5    STATEMENT OF THE HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>The following hypotheses were formulated in order to carry out a detailed research on the topic they include:  </p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS 1</strong></p> <p>Ho:   The application of marketing concept has no enhance the marketing of insurance in Nigeria.</p> <p>Hi:    The application of marketing concept has enhanced the marketing of insurance in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS 11                  </strong></p> <p>Ho:   The marketing concept cannot be successfully applied in the insurance industry in the area of marketing.</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS 111</strong></p> <p>Ho:   The marketing concept has not increased sales volumes of insurance products in Nigeria.</p> <p>Hi:    The marketing concept has increase sales volumes of insurance products in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        This study will be of immense benefit to managers and departmental executives as it will help them to adopting marketing concept to their business activities.</p> <p>        The study is equally important in portraying the problems encountered by insurance company in adopting marketing concept in the operation. This will serve as a vital information to new entrants into the industry as they will strive to avoid those problems.</p> <p>        Moreover, the loss of public confidence on the industry operation will be removed, as information on the application of marketing examines. This will enable managers and departmental executives to shift emphasis from sales concept to marketing concept. It is equally helps the intermediaries who are independent business organizations that directly and in the flow of products and its markets.</p> <p>        Finally, this research work will be useful to potential users of information, lectures, student’s marketers, suppliers, financial institution, non business organizations, insurance and the public as it will serve as are reference point for further research.</p> </div>\n\nMARKETING CONCEPTS A SURE WAY OF ENHANCING GROWTH IN THE SALE OF INSURANCE SERVICES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MARKETING CONCEPTS A SURE WAY OF ENHANCING GROWTH IN THE SALE OF INSURANCE SERVICES", "id": 29}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>A CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE IMPACT OF GOOD ACCOUNTING SYSTEM IN THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT</strong></p> <p><strong>OF   INSURANCE INDUSTRY</strong></p> <p><strong>(A CASE STUDY OF IGI, LEADWAY AND NICON INSURANCE COMPANIES)</strong></p> <div> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study survey critical review of the impact of good accounting system in the growth and development of insurance industry.

Though it employs the general accounting principles, concepts and conventions, there are needs for a clear understanding of its preparations.</p> <p>        In the days of T-form presentation of financial statement an insurance company account could be easily recognized from the sides of the “T” to which income and expenditure items are posted, they are not in conventional form. The convention was placing revenue to the right of the “T” insurance company revenue items to the left of the “T’ and expenditure items to the right.</p> <p>        Nowadays, there are other features that distinguish accounting system in insurance industry or company or company’s from their accounting system, they are:</p> <p>i.             Requirement by law for remitting of quarterly and annual returns to central bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Nigerian Insurance supervisory bank (NISB).</p> <p>ii.             Prescription by law of the type and level of investment of insurance</p> <p>iii.          Requirement by law for condition of returns to the Nigerian Insurance supervision board (NISB) with stated deadline.</p> <p>iv.          Requirement by law of the maintenance reserves known as “TECHNICAL RESEARVES” comprising of insurance funds, reserves for outstanding losses reserves for incurred but not reported and contingency reserves.</p> <p>All these are in addition to rendition of the required returns to the corporate affairs commission (CAC) being and incorporated company under in pursuant to the companies and allied matters decree (CAMD) 1991.</p> <p>    From the above, it can therefore be seen that without a proper understanding of intricacies involved in both the interpretation of the decree as well as items that makes up insurance accounts and right treatment is afforded to the financial statement as narrated wil not give a true and fair view of the statement of affairs and of profit and loss for the period.</p> <p>    Having read and studied the above insurance industry, the researcher felt it work bring out a detailed research work in order to benefit the students in higher institutions and readers alike.</p> <p><strong>1.2  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>    Some of the problems facing accounting system in insurance industry includes:</p> <p>1.   Good accounting system has not been adequately carried out in insurance.</p> <p>2.   Inadequate accounting management in insurance industry causes fraud.</p> <p>3.     financial statement mis-interpretation also causes a problem.</p> <p><strong>1.3       </strong><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objectives of this research work is to find solution to the above mentioned problems and at the same time explain and illustrate some of the items so as to practically assist staff of the account department of the insurance industry as follows:</p> <p>1.   To examine why good accounting system has not been adequately carried in insurance.</p> <p>2.   To evaluate how inadequate accounting management in insurance industry can cause fraud.</p> <p>3.   To explain how financial statement misinterpretation can cause problem.</p> <p><strong>1.4  RESEARCH QUESTIONS.</strong></p> <p>Some of the research questions are:</p> <p>1.   Why is good accounting system has not been adequately carried out in insurance?</p> <p>2.   How is inadequate accounting management in insurance industry caused fraud?</p> <p>3.    Explain how financial statement mis- interpretation also caused a problem?</p> <p><strong>1.5       </strong><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p> In this research work, Null Hypothesis (Ho) and alternative hypothesis (Hi) will be used, Null hypothesis (Ho) will use for rejection while alternative hypothesis (Hi) will be used for acceptance.</p> <p>1.   Ho: Good accounting system has not been adequately carried out in insurance.</p> <p>Hi: Good accounting system has been adequately carried out in insurance.</p> <p>2.   Ho: Inadequate accounting management in insurance industry causes fraud.</p> <p>Hi: Inadequate accounting management in insurance industry does not  causes fraud.</p> <p>3.   Ho: Financial statement mis-interpretation also causes a problem.</p> <p>Hi: Financial statement mis-interpretation does not causes a problem.</p> <p><strong>1.6       </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Industry keeps growing which shows an increase in the public funds placed in another person’s hand in form of premium.

A healthy nation is a wealthy nation because of the absence of debilitating diseases and epidemics in such a country, which, along with hunger and squalor, impoverishes the citizenry (Nwatu, 2000:12). </p> <p>The national health insurance scheme (NHIS) functions as a social health insurance program designed by the federal government of Nigeria to improve every services related to financial health sector, and to improve access of health care for the majority of Nigeria. The evolution of the National Health Insurance scheme details back to 1962, when the need for health insurance in the provision of health care to Nigeria citizen was first announced. Furthermore, the introduction of the structural adjustment program in 1986 adversely affected health allocation and other factors that led to the introduction of the national health insurance scheme. This general poor stated of the nation’s health care services is giving the government a lot of concern. The concept of social health insurance was first mooted in 1962 by Heuvi committee, which passed the proposal through the Lagos health bill. Unfortunately it was truncated in 1985, Dr. Emmanuel Usman, the minister of health set up a committee on national health review led by Mr. L. Ligailu.  At its 42nd meeting, the national council on health (NCH) approved the NIS to ensure full private sector participation. This model ensured the introduction of health maintenance organization (HMO) and financial managers of the scheme. On October 15th the national health insurance scheme was finally launched. </p> <p>In the developed world, insurance in one form or the other is a veritable and sustainable tool for financing healthcare. The National Health Insurance (NHIS) was launched in Nigerian on October 15, 1997 and was passed into law in May 1999. The original scheme has been modified to include healthcare for less privileged persons in the country (FMH, 1998). According to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2005, Nigeria was ranked 197th out of 2000 nations; life expectancy was put at 48 years for male and 50 years for female while healthy life expectancy (HALE) for both sexes was put at 42 years. Nigeria accounts for 10% of global maternal mortality with 59,000 women dying annually from pregnancy and child birth; only 39% are delivered by skilled health professionals. In order to provide equitable distribution of health, the NHIS was introduced in Nigeria The need for the establishment of the scheme was informed by the general poor state of the nation’s healthcare services, excessive dependence and pressure on the government’s provision of health facilities, dwindling funding of health care in the face of rising cost, poor integration of private health facilities in the nation’s healthcare delivery system and overwhelming dependence on out-of-pocket expenses to purchase health. Like any other insurance scheme, the premium for the NHIS is the amount charged by the insurance compared with the promise to pay for any eventual “covered medical treatment” for the designated “coverage”. Consequently health insurance makes it possible to substitute a small but certain cost for a larger but uncertain loss (chain) under an arrangement in which the healthy majority compensate for the risks and costs of the unfortunate ill minority. The NHIS currently represents 15% of one’s basic salary. The employer is to pay 10% while the employee contributes 5% of his/her basic salary to enjoy healthcare benefits. The contribution made by the insured person entitles his/her spouse and four children under the age of 18 to full health benefits (FMH 2005) NHIS was designed to provide minimum economic security for workers with regard to unfavorable losses resulting from accidental injury, sickness, old age unemployment and premature death of family wage earner. NHIS is made compulsory because the government based on past experiences predicted that some citizens cannot engage in the scheme and the government also has the duty to protect the general welfare of all citizens (Ibiwoye and Adedeke, 2007). It is also the government’s belief that NHIS will help to break the vicious cycle of poverty in the country. It is also a form of social support for workers (Jutting, 2003). There is lack of health care coverage and little equity. Access to healthcare is limited and most Nigerians are unable to pay for health services and health facilities are far from being equitably distributed. All these contributed to the limitation in health services (Samin and Awe, 2009). The available health services are very expensive and the common man cannot afford it; only the privileged few can get access to good health. This study aims at assessing the level of knowledge and attitude of civil servants resident in Nigeria to NHIS.</p> <p>According to Abacha (1985:3), the public hospitals had become (consulting clinics\" Given the rapid population growth rate, what the nation needed was a commensurate increasing level of the services. But the decreasing finance of the government oil left the government with no other choice than reducing budgetary allocation to the health sector (Ozuh, 2004:30) prior to the government almost solely financed health services in public health institutions. But by the turn of the 1980s, it had become joint responsibility of the government and the citizens (Ughamadu, 2003:23). In other words both the government and the citizens shared the costs of healthcare services in public health institutions with the greater burden weighing heavily on the government. Subsidization of healthcare services was paramount in healthcare budgetary allocation.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>In Nigeria, health insurance scheme is new; the target of its introduction is to achieve good health to all citizens in Nigeria. Most of Nigeria are unemployed, resident in the rural areas without hospital, water and infrastructure and inadequate personnel.</p> <p>The researcher intend to cross-examine the strategies to be used in marketing health insurance in the situation of poor infrastructural development, unemployment and how level of income or capital and to indemnify what will be the inability factor in marketing health insurance scheme in Nigeria. To make suggestions to the government on the best way to market health insurance policies with the rural support, private sectors and non-governmental organizations. </p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study is to examine the evaluation of the problem facing national health insurance scheme in Nigeria.</p> <p>Specifically, the study intend to;</p> <p>i)  To evaluate the problems facing national health insurance scheme in Nigeria. </p> <p>ii)   Examine the benefits and problems of the scheme</p> <p>iii)  Examine the goals of the scheme</p> <p>iv)  Examine the roles of the operators of the scheme.</p> <p>v) Identify various methods to be used in marketing health insurance        service in Nigeria   </p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>For the successful completion of the study, the following research hypotheses were formulated by the researcher;</p> <p><strong>H</strong>0: there is no significant problem facing national health insurance scheme in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>H</strong>1: there are significant problems facing national health insurance scheme in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>H02: </strong>there is no significant relationship between the health insurance scheme and the Nigeria government.</p> <p><strong>H2: </strong> there is a significant relationship between the health insurance scheme and the Nigeria government.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is believed that at the completion of the study, the findings will be of benefit to the; Federal Ministry of Health, National Health Insurance Scheme Council (NHISC) to identify all the constraints to effective implementation of the scheme. The regulatory aspect of these challenges will be established in this study so that the NHISC will take remedial measures. To the Health Maintenance Organization (HMOs) as it will not only highlight the challenges facing them under the scheme but will also provide useful information on how they can effectively address these challenges especially those arising from their internal constituencies. To the Health Services Providers (HSPs), as those already operating under the scheme will be provided with useful information on how to brace up with their challenges while those not yet operating under the scheme will find in this study the need to be integrated into the national healthcare delivery system via the NHIS.

Despite the low number of insurance companies listed in the stock exchange, there are positive prospects of improvement after the recent capitalization. The problems encountered during the research would be addressed through the implementation of the suggested solution. It was finally conclude that capital market contributes to the growth of insurance sector in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p>For any country to be economically sound, she must experience a growing economic sector. It is of interest to Nigeria and other third world countries to attain a steady economic growth rate, as this would enhance National development. Economic growth and development involves an increase overtime of per capital real gross National product (G.N.P) and the welfare of the population. </p> <p>For economic growth to be achieved, a certain issues that act as constraints ought to be tacked. These issues include technological development, human resources development, low productivity, capital formation, price stability etc. (Iniodu 1996). And as Nwankwo (1991) observes, capital formation which is the function of an efficient financial system is very vital” capital formation involves the mobilization and channeling or resources form the surplus spending units (ssu) to the deficit spending unit (Osu). The Nigeria capital market is a critical part of the financial system which performs this allocative role. </p> <p>The market is the long term end for financial market. It is made up of the market and institutions, which facilitate the issuance and secondary trading of long term financial instruments. Unlike the money market which function basically to provide short-term funds, the capital market provides funds to industries and government to meet their long-term requirements. </p> <p>The capital market has it’s mission statement that is “promoting the Nigeria capital market to respond to the socio-economic development need of the nation”. The objective of the capital market is to mobilize long-term funds for investment. The capital market is performing various functions. The capital market provides an additional channel for engaging and mobilizing domestic savings for productive investment and represents alternative to bank deposit, real estate investment and the financing of consumption loans. It also provides deposit with better protection against inflation and currency and depreciation. Another major function of Nigeria capital market is to improve the efficiency management changes as compared with the administrative or potential mechanism of public sector corporations. The capital market facilitates the transfer of enterprises from the public sector to the private sector and encourages privatization by increasing the marketability of new issues. The capital market employs some instruments used to raise funds, these instruments are equities-ordinary shares  and preference shares. Debt government bonds (federal state and local government). Industrial loans / debenture stocks and bonds.</p> <p>The players in the capital market are the funds providers who are individuals, unit trusts, pension funds, insurance companies, government intermediaries are the stock broking firms, issuing housing, registers, audit firms and regulators e.g. securities and exchange Commission. The Nigeria stock exchange central bank of Nigeria and the federal ministry of finance. </p> <p>However, there is a growing concern about the efficiency or otherwise of the Nigeria capital market and to the role f the insurance sector. Ajayi (1984) sees it as “efficient in the sense that, the capital market has increased the nation’s output and equitable distribution of the output. </p> <p>But, Williams (1988) see that capital market as “inefficient in pooling funds for investment” he observe further that by participation of only a few elites, it has helped to widen the gap between the rich and poor. </p> <p>This project attempts to determine the influence of this market on the growth of the insurance companies in Nigeria. In particularly, its sees to clarify the role of the insurance companies as key players in the capital market and how role has strengthened insurance business in Nigeria. </p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>To understand the subject matter we will look at the capital market on the growth of insurance in Nigeria. We want to, also believe that the insurance company is a member of the capital market which function among others involves in the channeling of long-term funds from the surplus to the deficit for investment, but after the finding of William (1988) was sees the capital market as being inefficient, implying that insurance company is inefficient in pooling funds fro investment. He also added that only a few elites get such funds thereby creating a gap between the rich and the poor. </p> <p>        At this point I will like to identify those factors that have render the insurance sector the efficient and that must be done to correct those capital of both life and general insurance to #20 million and #50 million, where the general business includes oil and gas insurance, among another activities. Reinsurance has a minimum paid-up capital of #150 million (Akpan 1999). One of the major sources of capital insurance companies is the capital market that has being fully descried in the introduction. </p> <p>Examining the performance of the five companies quoted on the stock exchange, prestige assurance, Nigeria insurance and Allco insurance company’s profit before taxation and also an increase in the profit after taxation. Dividends were also recommended a dividend payout of NGN, 55,440, 625, while Allco recommended NGN 70 million to share holders. This was made possible by the allotment of right issues in the year 2003 per all three insurance companies which was as a result of the company’s recapitalization plan. </p> <p>        The same cannot be said for crusade and unic insurance, which recorded a slight decrease in 2002 and 2001 despite the impact of the capital market. This can be as a result of the general impact of variable knowing fully well that the main function of an insurance company is indemnity which is taking an individual to where he or she was before he or she suffers loss and finally is want to know why only few insurance companies are quoted. </p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objective of this research are as following:</p> <p>1)     Examine the capital market in the development of the insurance sector..</p> <p>ii)     Appraise the impact of the Nigeria capital market on the growth of the insurance business in Nigeria.</p> <p>iii)    Identity the problem confronting the insurance companies as beneficiaries of the services provide by the Nigeria capital market.</p> <p>iv)    Make recommendations on the efficient management of the Nigeria capital market.</p> <p><strong>1.4   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>At this time, the Nigeria government is intensifying efforts to boost the country’s economy, the need to research on the fact that led to economic growth in Nigeria cannot be understated. This study will aid our understanding of economic development via the insurance sub-sectors participation in the capital market. </p> <p>Thus, this research work is considered to be important to:</p> <p>i)      The government for policy formulation.</p> <p>ii)     The business community for the purpose of investment and capital formulation. </p> <p>iii)    The result of work will serve as a reference materials for  researches. </p> <p>iv)    This study will enhance the knowledge of the researcher more about the capital market and the insurance sector. </p> <p><strong>1.5   SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        In the course of carrying out this research work the researcher was faced with some limitation.

The government responsibility to supervise, regulate and control the activities of insurance companies and intermediaries is to protect the interest of the insuring public and to save them from exploitation by unreliable insurers. Because of the intangible nature of insurance product, the government wants to make sure that those engaged in it must be competent person who will fulfil their promise a d pledges when the need arise. Also because of the complexity  of insurance business it is necessary that the government regulate ********************** the policy holders. Also because of violation ***********************trust that occurs in insurance transistors, the government has found it necessary to regulate insurance industries so as to control such violations. The project attempts to appraise the effectiveness of government policies in regulating the insurance companies in  Nigeria. The insurance industry in Nigeria has acute shortage of high level of manpower for most classes of insurance, also many Nigerians suffer financial loss due to lack of knowledge in insurance. Due to this problem, government should introduce programs regarding to insurance to the public as to highlight them on the benefit accrued to insurance due to constant financial loss they encounter as a result of lack of insurance knowledge. </p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>Title page</p> <p>Approval page</p> <p>Dedication </p> <p>Acknowledgement </p> <p>Abstract</p> <p>Table of content </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.0       Introduction</p> <p> 1.1      Background of the study</p> <p>1.2     Statement of the problem</p> <p>1.3     Purpose of the study</p> <p>1.4     Significance of the study</p> <p>1.5     Scope of the study</p> <p>1.6     Definition of the term</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p>2.0     Literature review</p> <p>2.1            The origin of the insurance industry </p> <p>2.2            The development of modern insurance in Nigeria</p> <p>2.3            The insurance market and intermediaries</p> <p>2.4            The socio-economic significance of insurance </p> <p>2.5            Structure and performance of the insurance industry </p> <p>2.6            Government regulation of the insurance companies </p> <p>2.7            The impact of structural adjustment programs  on insurance companies operation in Nigeria </p> <p><strong>CHAPTAER THREE</strong></p> <p>3.0            Research methodology </p> <p>Introduction </p> <p>3.1     Restatements of research question and hypothesis</p> <p>3.2     Research design</p> <p>3.3     Sources of data</p> <p>3.4     Population of study</p> <p>3.5     Sample size / Design and procedure</p> <p>3.6     Data collection instrument / process</p> <p>3.7     Data presentation and analysis on techniques</p> <p>3.8     Limitation of the methodology</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></p> <p>4.0     Data Presentation and Analysis</p> <p>4.1     Presentation and analysis of data</p> <p>4.2     Hypothesis testing</p> <p>4.3     Analysis of result</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></p> <p>5.0     Summary of finding, Recommendation and conclusion </p> <p>5.1     Summary of findings </p> <p>5.2     Recommendation </p> <p>5.3     Suggestion for further research</p> <p>5.4     Conclusion </p> <p>References</p> <p>Appendix </p> <p>Questionnaires</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1            </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>“Risk is a phenomenon which has been in existence since the beginning of the world. Risk exists whenever the future is unknown” (Lemon 1989: 17). This means that the word implies some element of doubt about future and the outcome may be worse than what it had been at the moment. This man in his daily operations could be viewed as a risk manager, in that man does his best possible to reduce, eliminate, avoid, retain or share risk where they are present. </p> <p>Tough there were some forms of risk management before the advent of insurance companies in Nigeria such as the extended family system, age grade  association and others. insurance in its modern form was introduced into Nigeria by British. </p> <p>In 1921, the Royal Exchange Assurance Company was established and it was the first insurance company to open full branch in Nigeria.  In 1949, three other companies emerged. In 1958, Africa insurance company. By 1965, the number of insurance companies rose to 70. in 1977, the Nigeria Re-insurance company was established as a federal government owned insurance company. Nigeria was however under the British colonial rule up to 1960 when she gained her political independence and as a developing country. From 1960 to date a lot of insurance companies came into operation. Insurance is a modern method of sharing loss or spreading risk lightly over a great number of people so that the few unfortunate ones o r persons who sustain or suffer loss do not heavy financial loss as a result of their misfortune to the community. the insured pay premium into a common pool outcome of which the unfortunate few who suffer loss are compensated. </p> <p><strong>The secondary function of insurance companies includes:</strong></p> <p>1.                 Provision of loans for building on the security of a life policy.</p> <p>2.                  Encourage and promote commercial enterprise men and industrialist</p> <p>The accumulated sum of money by insurer re invested to state approved securities and this helps to provide the state with a steady flow investment funds with which the state can provide development and promotions to the local industries which will be of benefit to the community. </p> <p>Insurance is a contract whereby a person called the insurer or assurer agrees in consideration of money paid to him or her known as premium by another person called the insured or assured to indemnify him against loss resulting to him on the happening of certain events. However, it was known that risk exist whenever the future is unknown and therefore insurance exist primarily to combat the adverse effect of risk. </p> <p>The purpose of insurance is to compensate or indemnify the victim for his financial loss. It should be noted here that the insurance neither eliminate the loss nor stops the disaster from  happening, what insurance does is to soften the blow in a purely financial sence by offering monetary compensation to the victim whereby placing him in the same financial position after loss as he was before though within the terms of the policy.</p> <p>Re-insurance is the transfer of insurance business from one insurance company ot another. The original insurer who obtain the insurance contract form the insured or assured is called the direct insurer or the ceding company. Re-insurance arose from the need of the original insurer to spread the risk he has undertaken. Under re-insurance contract is between the ceding company policies. Therefore in the event of a loss, the insured cannot enforce the re-insurance contract. </p> <p>However, the effect of re-insurance contract on the ceding company includes:</p> <p>i         Re- insurance reduces the probability of the ceding </p> <p>company’s ruin by assuming his catastrophe risk.</p> <p>ii       Re- insurance stabilizes the ceding company’s balance sheet by taking on apart of his risk of random fluctuation risk of change and risk error. </p> <p>iii      Re- insurance increases the amount of capital effectively available to the ceding company by freeing equity that was tied up to cover risk.</p> <p>iv      Re-insurance enlarges the ceding company’s underwriting capacity by accepting a proportional share of risks and by providing part of the necessary reserves. </p> <p>          The insurance section is made up of a large number of companies with varying sizes, among which the NAICOM was established. The government uses this commission to regulate the insurance industry. The government uses this commission to regulate the insurance industry. It was established in 1997 by NAICOM decree N0 1 of 1997. Prior to the establishment of National insurance commission, the insurance business regulation and supervision were done by the insurance department of the ministry of finance. </p> <p>          The national insurance supervisory board (NISB) was established in 1991 to take over the supervision of insurance form the director of insurance. National insurance commission (NAICOM) is the head by the commission finance and administration and deputy director for insurance technical. </p> <p><strong>NAICOM Decree 1 of 1997 stated the functions of NAICOM as follows:</strong></p> <p>1       To ensure eh effective administration, supervision regulation and control of insurance business in Nigeria.</p> <p>2        Establishment of standards of the conduct of insurance business in Nigeria. </p> <p>3        Approval of rate insurance premium to be paid of all classes of insurance business. </p> <p>4        Regulation of transactions between insurers and re- insurance in Nigeria and those outside Nigeria</p> <p>5        Ensuring adequate protection of strategic government assets and other properties. </p> <p>6        To act as adviser to the federal government on all insurance related matter. </p> <p>7        Approve standards, conditions and warranties applicable to all classes of insurance business.</p> <p>8        To protect insurance policy holders and beneficiaries and third parties to insurance contract.</p> <p>9        To publish for sale and distribution to he public, annual reports and statistics on the re- insurance industry. </p> <p>10    To liaise with and advise federal ministries, extra ministerial departments, statutory bodies and other government agencies on all matters relating to insurance contained in annual technical agreements to which Nigeria is signatory.</p> <p>11    To contribute to the educational program of the chartered institute of Nigeria and the West African insurance institute. </p> <p>12    To carry out such other activities connected or incidental to its other functions under the decrees. </p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The insurance industry in Nigeria has acute shortage of high level manpower for most classes of insurance and re- insurance business. the Nigeria insurance industry does not enjoy the required public goodwill and reason for this has to do with the damage done to practice of the profession by the get rich entrepreneur who goes about the business of insurance with the little regard to the principle of the profession. As a result of this, the government has come up with so many policies aimed at the study though will save the insurance industry. The extent to which all those government policies affect insurance companies and provides solution to ensure  the survival of these insurance companies is another thing. The research therefore, is indicated to examine the impact of various control measures as promulgated by government to regulate the activities of the insurance industry. </p> <p><strong>1.3     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this research is essential in a direct investigation on the impact of government policies on the insurance industry in Nigeria. </p> <p>Ø To look into the factors hindering the performance of insurance companies through the various government regulatory policies. </p> <p>Ø To determine the impact of those government policies on the insurance companies and the insuring public</p> <p>Ø Since the insurance industry is the second largest deposit mobilization institution in the country, it therefore encourages saving which plays an important role in the social and economic well being of the country. </p> <p>Ø To evaluate the performance of the industry therefore, is necessary for the growth of the economy. </p> <p><strong>1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>i        To enlighten the Nigerian populace about the benefit that they could drive by taken up insurance cover. </p> <p>ii       To guide the policy makers when hey are enacting laws concerning insurance.</p> <p>iii      Ascertain the need or otherwise for government intervention through regulatory body in the insurance industry. </p> <p><strong>1.5     SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>i        To determine the impact of government policies in regulating the activities of the Nigerian insurance industry. </p> <p>ii       The study therefore will concentrate on the Nigeria insurance industry. </p> <p><strong>1.6     DEFINITION OF THE TERM</strong></p> <p>i        <strong>INSURER / ASSURER: </strong>This is the insurance or assurance company that issue out policy to the policy holder. </p> <p>ii       <strong>INSURED / ASSURED:</strong> This are policy holders in the insurance business. </p> <p>iii      <strong>PERIL: </strong>This is known as a prime cause or what gives rise to the loss. </p> <p>iv      <strong>PREMIUM: </strong>This is periodic consideration payment by the policy holder to the insurance company which will necessitate compensation by the insurer to the insured. </p> <p>v       <strong>POLICY: </strong>This is a written contract of insurance which is issued to the policy holder. </p> <p>vi      <strong>RE-INSURANCE: </strong>This is an insurance company re-insuring again a risk that had already been insured to another insurance company. </p> <p>vii     <strong>CEDING COMPANY: </strong>This is the direct insurer or the original insurer who is re-insuring the risk to another insurer. </p> <p>viii    <strong>UNDERWRITING: </strong>This is a process by which an insurance company determine weather or not on the basis it will accept an application for insurance. </p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF PROMOTIONAL STRATEGY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF INSURANCE IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF PROMOTIONAL STRATEGY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF INSURANCE IN NIGERIA", "id": 33}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The aim of this project is to analyze the role of the National Insurance Commission in depending insurance service among the vast population of Nigeria.

In the course of the study many problems encountered are to be solved by the recommendations that will ensure adequate coverage of the limitations. The type of research method used is primary source of data collection </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong></p> <p><strong>1.0   INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p>        National Insurance Commission is a body that ensure is effective administration, supervision, regulation and control of insurance industries in Nigeria.  </p> <p>The national insurance Commission (NAICON) under the able watch of Mr. Fola Daniel is on top of the situation. The industry is poised to take advantage of serial despoliation and corruption enthroned every where in our economic landscape that poll into insignificance value that enables the society. The insurance consumer Association of Nigeria (INSCAN) and NGO ably led by rear Admiral Isaac Areola is protecting the insurance consumer in Nigeria against unfair practice from insurers. </p> <p>Insurers should therefore enhance after. Sale service, such as prompt payment / settlement of claims as well as effective intermediation model. And also develop environmentally friendly products, based on market research and ensure an efficacious marketing that will speak to the customers in the grass root. </p> <p>        The bottom line for effective insurance coverage is a prompt payment of claims. Insurance operator should ensure that they take settlement of claim seriously for that will guarantee adequate penetration of insurance to grass root. The commissioner for insurance Fola Daniel sates that the easiest way to attract the public to patronize insurance is treating those who are already insured through prompt payment of claims. “If one tells his friend that his insurance company did not pay claim after his loss, that single complaint is capable of stopping more than 20 peoples from buying insurance in future” in his statement, he said that prompt payment of claim remain the best instrument. For insurance awareness and penetration expatiating on its utmost importance, that commissioner state that NACCOM will continue to ensure that operators live up to their claim responsibility adding that the commission had received 86 claims complaint out of which 52 valued at 1.2 billion have been resolved and 34 in court. He read the ‘riot act’ that the axe will be yielded on operators who consistently fail to settle discharged claim promptly by losing their license. Insurers had been mandated to administer claim. In accordance for that will enable those at grassroot to embrace insurance and in order to standardize insurance practice. </p> <p>        Moreover, the weak legal framework for the regulation and supervision of insurance industry in Nigeria has been attributed to the poor public perception of the sector; low level of awareness amongst the populace; high political economic and financial systemic risk; non remittance of accumulated premium and investment losses resulting from decline in insurance penetrations. </p> <p>        Furthermore, a lot of companies are being built in the urban area forgetting that many Nigerian are living in the rural area without having the knowledge of what insurance is all about and are eager to boy the policy if well explained. </p> <p>According to Mr. Fola Daniel, he said that derive to penetrate insurance into the grassroot will see the insurance market growing in an accelerated rate of hitting 8:64% in the net four years. According to the commissioner of insurance, premium income will increase from N300 billion in 2012 to N1 trillion in 2017, motor insurance will increase by ten percent (10%), life insurance by three percent (3%)  and oil and gas by two and half percent 2 ½  % .</p> <p>        The industry’s contribution to the Gross Domestic product will be three percent (3%) and the insurable population will increase to twenty-two percent (22%). The Nigeria insurance penetration is expected to rise above six percent (6%) when compared to Kenyan 3.2% and South African 15%. </p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        The Nigerian Insurance Industry has come of age, the genesis of the industry in 1921 had gone through transformation. It morph and from the insurance companies Act 1961, the insurance (miscellaneous provision) Act 1964, the companies decree 1968, the insurance decree 59 of 1976, the insurance Decree 58 of 1991, insurance decree 2 of 1997 to the present insurance Act 2003. There is still room for amendment following strident calls for more consolidations was upgraded to National Insurance Supervision. Board headed by Chief Oladipo Bailey who become the first commissioner of insurance when the National Insurance Commission was set up by Decree N0 1 of 1997, He was later replaced by Barr.

CASE STUDY OF LEA PRIMARY SCHOOL LUGBE VILLAGE, FCT ABUJA</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>A communicable disease is an illness caused by a specific infectious agent or it's toxic products(1) .It arises through transmission of that agent or its products from an infected person or animal to a susceptible host either direct or indirectly through an intermediate plant or animal host ,vector or the inanimate environment (2). Infectious disease can be a major cause of illness among children and can affect a child's schooling by causing absenteeism .They may in turn, affect other children and staff, and can prevent parents careers ability to work, especially where both parents careers work (3) .School health programs could not be fully implemented without having staff and parent's cooperation and involvement .Parents, community leaders and teachers often can and do serve as role models for students. Students serve as a linkage with school and family while parents can and should cooperate with schools to help their children. (4)Communicable diseases spread quickly among students in the classroom, there must be gathered printable and advise for germ prevention in school (5). Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in public concern about communicable diseases in the schools all over the world .School administrations must find ways to strike a balance between protecting the general school population from exposure to dangerous communicable diseases and ensuring the infected student's right to privacy and to public education. This study focuses on evaluation of health education as a tool to the prevention and control of communicable diseases among primary school pupils, excluding immunization and harm reduction interventions, which are the subjects of additional evidence. It takes its lead from two meetings, one held by Interior Health in November 2005 and a second by Vancouver Health Authority in February 2006, which focused on population health and health promotion, including specific sessions on their relevance to communicable diseases. Both meetings demonstrated the gap between the rich discourse located in academic literature on health promotion and population health and its application on the ground. More so, these meetings confirmed that health promotion strategies have not been a priority focus of communicable disease prevention initiatives. This was reconfirmed through a search of the literature and discussions with a key informant that has been intimately involved with international reviews of the evidence base for health promotion. Health protection strategies important to communicable diseases include those relevant to safe food, drinking water and recreational water, and adequate community sanitation. Preventive intervention strategies, which impact on communicable diseases, include primary prevention initiatives such as immunization and vector control, and early secondary prevention strategies such as post-exposure prophylaxis, screening and treatment of communicable diseases and contact tracing and management. Health assessment and disease surveillance strategies important for communicable disease prevention and control include detecting disease clusters and outbreaks through community-based, hospital-based, and clinical epidemiology, and laboratory surveillance networks, health promotion strategies important for communicable disease prevention and control, which are the focus of this evidence study, include a set of strategies that enable people to increase control over and improve their health. Health promotion strategies are considered to be equally valid for the prevention and control of communicable diseases, 1 despite the focus of this approach on non-communicable diseases, especially in the developed world. The Bangkok Charter, developed in August 2005, explicitly mentioned communicable diseases in its revised definition of health promotion. This renewed interest is also evident in Canada and can be ascribed to the growing concern about the threats posed by a number of communicable disease trends, such as the persistence of AIDS and hepatitis C, the advent of new and emergent diseases, and the continuing development of antimicrobial resistance. These concerns have served to emphasize the important contribution of health promotion strategies to the prevention and control of these diseases. Before turning to review the evidence for effectiveness of health promotion strategies in tackling communicable diseases, let us briefly locate health promotion within the core functions framework and review its parameters and the continuing evolvement of its philosophical constructs. The need for this is dictated by the largely conceptual basis of the Ottawa Charterii and similar health promotion frameworks, and the fact that in relation to their conceptual and strategic development, health promotion and public health are customers of social, behavioral and other sciences. This leads naturally into a consideration of a model to guide the assessment of the evidence of health promotion strategies in tackling communicable diseases.</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Health promotion strategies are considered to be equally valid for the prevention and control of communicable diseases, despite the focus of this approach on non-communicable diseases, especially in the developed world. The Bangkok Charter, developed in August 2005, explicitly mentioned communicable diseases in its revised definition of health promotion. This renewed interest is also evident in Canada and can be ascribed to the growing concern about the threats posed by a number of communicable disease trends in the developing nation. It is in view of this that the researcher intends to evaluate the impact of health education in eradicating communicable disease among primary school pupils.</p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study is on evaluation of health education as a tool for eradicating communicable disease among primary school pupils; but to aid the completion of the study, the researcher intends to achieve the following objectives;</p> <p>i)             To evaluate the effect of health education in minimizing communicable disease among primary school pupils</p> <p>ii)           To ascertain the impact of health education on the health of pupils</p> <p>iii)          To investigate the relationship between health education and the academic performance of the pupils</p> <p>iv)         To ascertain the role of parent in educating the pupils on how to prevent communicable disease in schools</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>To aid the completion of the study, the following research hypotheses was formulated by the researcher</p> <p><strong>H0:</strong>health education does not have any significant effect in minimizing communicable disease among primary school pupils</p> <p><strong>H1: </strong>health education does have a significant effect in minimizing communicable disease among primary school pupils.</p> <p><strong>H02: </strong>parent does not play any significant role in educating their kids on the dangers of communicable disease</p> <p><strong>H2: </strong>parent does play a significant role in educating their kids on the dangers of communicable disease</p> <p><strong>1.4      </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>At the completion of the study, the findings will be of great importance to parents, as the study seek to emphasis on the role of the parents in educating their wards on the possible measures of preventing communicable diseases in their school environment, the study will also be of importance to the teachers in imbibing a rigorous approach towards health education on the pupils. The study will also be of importance to researchers who intend to embark on study in similar topic as the study will serve as a reference point to the researcher.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>The scope of the study covers an evaluation of health education a tool for eradicating communicable disease among primary school pupils with emphasis on lea primary school Lugbe village, FCT Abuja.

Moreso, if that “business” is that of insurance. The average Nigerian might not know much about insurance but he or she knows that insurance companies “don’t pay claims” <br/>In otherwords, the insurance industry has a bad image. This was the reason behind the federal governments creation of different insurance regulatory bodies. To prevent “quacks from doing insurance business and to protect the insuring public, insurance laws and regulatory bodies have been created to further protect the insuring public. <br/>The question now is, who are these regulatory bodies? How do they operate and how effective are they in performing their duties? This project in addition to “appraising” these regulatory bodies, will trace the genesis of regulating insurance business and finally, make recommendations on how the regulatory bodies can do better. </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF STUDY </strong><br/>The business of insurance is based on the concept of spreading a risk, so that “it lies easily upon the many than heavily upon the few. Insurance is a pool of funds into which contributions are made and from which those who suffer loss are compensated. <br/>As a contract, the insured and the insurer must be honest in all their dealings with each other. On the part of the insurer, he must be able, financially to settle all legitimate claims made on him as and when due. In the past, almost anyone, with or without experience and adequate capital could own an insurance company. As a result, most legitimate claims were not paid. This sad state of affairs was due largely to the “freedom” or rather, the absence of adequate Government supervision. <br/>In other to stop this exploitation, the Government set up the “J.C. Obande” commission in 1961. Their report led to the 1961 insurance companies act, more decrees and acts followed leading to the present insurance Act of 2003. <br/>In addition, from 1961 to date, the following regulatory bodies supervise the insurance industry they include; the Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N), the National Deposit Insurance Commission (N.D.I.C), the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) and finally the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) which plays a more direct role in the supervision of insurers. Each of these bodies performs functions aimed at regulating the insurance industry. An assessment of their performance will be made.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </strong><br/>For the pragmatist, the value of an idea (e.g. supervision of insurance) lies in its practical results. So, the questions is, how far and how well have the regulators performed? <br/>1. Why is it necessary to regulate or supervise the insurance industry?<br/>2. How are insurers supervised?<br/>3. How effective is the supervision? <br/>4. Can supervision be made better? <br/><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF STUDY</strong><br/>This research work has the following objectives:<br/>1. To trace as far as possible, the origin of insurance<br/>2. To show the time and method of the introduction of insurance into Nigeria.<br/>3. The history and method of insurance supervision in Nigeria.<br/>4. The contribution of regulatory bodies to the insurance industry. <br/>5. To appraise their performance and determine if they have done well so far. <br/>6. Finally, to suggest how they can improve.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>This project is intended to serve a number of purposes and all effort has been made to ensure that it has been written to meet these purposes. <br/>1. This project will highlight the supervisory bodies and educate on their functions and mode of operation.<br/>2. To suggest ways of improving their effectiveness. <br/>3. Every research should ad to the volume of knowledge already accumulated. This project is not as exception.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES </strong><br/>The following hypothesis were formed to achieve the objectives of the research.<br/>1.

The ACB bank, but when the bank was managed by colonial masters there was a lot of disparity in employment given out loans to Nigeria indigenes and also having their head office in London. The Nigeria citizen objected to that and formed their own bank which was ruined by poor management, fraud, inadequate capital and other problems.<br/>Bank distress has always being the case, in 1950’s we have 25 banks got distressed. In 1980’s the IBB Babangida Administration introduced SAP to reduce the over dependence on oil sector to Agricultural sector and bank deregulation. Many banks also got distressed, because of these, in march 1988, the Nigeria government thought of establishing Deposit insurance scheme as obtainable in other countries of the world like in America it was introduced in 1933 to regulate and monitor banks failure and distress because of this, the Nigeria deposit insurance scheme was into operation in June 1989 to regulate and monitor the activities of the commercial banks and also to protect bank depositors and also to restore confidence in the banking industry. Since then, the issue of bank distress has reduced the case in front is to know the roles activities of the Nigeria deposit insurance and to know if the services are adequacy both to the bank depositors and the Nigeria economy.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement Of The Problem.</strong><br/>The problem under the study is to reveal the activities of the <br/>Nigeria despot insurance since it was established in 1988 and know the situation before their establishment.<br/>In a nutshell the statement of the study are:<br/>1.

Research has shown that there is a significant relationship between the extent to which one understands and the importance one attaches to insurance. The more clear and understandable one finds insurance to be and the more likely it is that the insurance intermediaries will be know the importance of insurance before the facilitators can be recognized. This shows that low level of literacy constitutes to the problems encountered by the insurance intermediaries. Because the intermediaries work for the insurance company, any problem that affects the company affects them.<br/>The experience of some people who had be dealings with insurance over the years ha snot be very cordial such unfavourable relationship had been publicize over the years that it has created a poor perception of insurance intermediaries and the insurance companies to the general public. Insurance have not help issues by their reticent in publishing their activities. One has to be aware of insurance before one makes a conscious effort to understand what it is all about. The insurance industry has the duty to create awareness of the existences of their intermediaries and their industry in the minds of the public.<br/>Individual insurance companies have the responsibility of letting the public know that its intermediaries exist and what functions they perform. Literature such as one of the roles of insurance companies and intermediaries to individuals and the society in general should be widely circulated.<br/>Handling of insurance claim is another area were insurance intermediaries encounter problem. This is obvious because when an insurance company could not settle her claim with the insured (policyholder) the impact fall on the intermediaries that facilitate contractual relationship between the insured and the insurance company. This makes the general public to call both the intermediaries and insurance companies fraudsters. A good insurance transaction lies essentially on the ease with which are insurer claim cheque is received. Claims handling is one area were an effective communication is necessary, as well as reaching prompt decision immediately all facts are known. The inability of the insurance companies to do this makes it difficult for an intermediary to help his clients in sorting out their claim with the company.<br/>Location of the insurance company also is one of the problems encountered by intermediaries because they find it difficult to transact business in rural area. There is no comparison between an insurance company situated in the city and that of rural area. Insurance company situated in a rural area might not be progressing because of the low level of literacy of people in the area.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </em></strong><br/>The image of insurance industry and their intermediaries is noting to write home about. This is to those who do not know what insurance is all about. Having complied with the rules and regulations of the insurance supervisory authorities in which they operate, though there are still problems in the insurance companies and the among them are as follows.<br/>(a) Ineffective publicity, lack of information about different classes of insurance and benefits behinds each classes of insurance to the policyholder is acting as one of the problems being encountered by the insurance companies and their intermediaries.<br/>(b) Public unawareness of the essence of insurance takes time for the brokers and agents to be known in the public. Many of our people today are still ignorance of what insurance is all about and this is really telling on the insurance companies.<br/>(c) Location of the insurance company is one of the problems being encountered by insurance intermediaries.<br/>(d) The find it difficult to transact business in a small area. Take for instance, an insurance company whose Head office is at Ngwo will be loosing a lot while other competitors situated in the city such as Lagos are progressing.<br/>(e) Competition among the brokers and agents by using unorthodox method which is due to variation in rates. There has been always difficult among these intermediaries. Another problem is what affects the insurance companies also affect them.</p> <p><strong><em>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF STUDY</em></strong><br/>This study is aimed at achieving the following objectives.<br/>1. To find out the causes of the problem that the intermediaries encounter.<br/>2. The important of intermediaries in the insurance industry.<br/>3. Who are insurance intermediaries.<br/>4. To make suggestion on how to eradicate the problem.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY </em></strong><br/>The study will be of immense value to brokerage firm, the insurance companies, the general public and to student of insurance and other related fields. <br/>The work will be of immense help to future researchers who will make their own investigation into this subject area.<br/>The study will reveal the important of these intermediaries to the insurance company. Having mentioned some of the jobs done by the intermediaries, there are other areas by which they are useful to the company.</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 SCOPE AND LIMITATION </em></strong><br/>SCOPE <br/>The area of this thesis is Nigeria. The research is to find out the problems encountered by intermediaries and the causes. <br/>LIMITATION <br/>This study is limited to the Brokers and Agents in Nigerian insurance industry. In the process of carrying out this study, the researcher encountered some problems which include finance cost of transportation to areas where data are to be collected was too high.<br/>Another major limitation to this study was the attitude of the respondents towards answering question.<br/>TIME <br/>A research of this nature which is expected to produced for reaching results would have required more time to make in-depth personal observation possible but since the paper has to be submitted within a specific time I have to utilize the much time.<br/>FINANCE<br/>The general problem student is finance and money required to travel to brokerage firms and agents offices constantly to get information. Besides money was also required to type the questionnaire and distribute and collect them back. Money was also weeded to get out the final volume of the work.</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 DEFINITION OF TERMS</em></strong><br/>Brokers: Person who buys and sells for others. And regarded as professional expert. The gives advice and recommends to people.<br/>Agent: Person who acts for or who manages the business affairs of other.<br/>Premium: A little consideration which the insured pays to the insurer in view of the risk insured so that if loss occur the insurer will put the insured in the same financial position he was before the loss.<br/>Insured: The party entitled to receive money under an assurance contract on the happening of a stated contingency.<br/>Liability: State of being liable or responsibility for an act. </p>\n\nPROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY INTERMEDIARIES IN THE NIGERIA INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND THE FUTURE PROSPECTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY INTERMEDIARIES IN THE NIGERIA INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND THE FUTURE PROSPECTS", "id": 38}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong><br/>The concepts “insurance” has been defined by many authors and from different perspectives but all those definition are emphasizing on one things, that is being a pool of risk and also a risk transfer from one person to another.<br/>According to Falgan J.I (1989). Insurance is defined as a social derive of reducing risk by combing a sufficient number of exposure units to make their individual losses, collectively<br/>Insurance allows the individual insured to substitute a small cost (ie premium) for so large but uncertain loss (not to exceed the amount of insurance) under an arrangement whereby the fortunate many who escape loss will help the fortunate many who escape loss will help compensate the unfortunate few who suffer loss. The aim of insurance contract is to provide indemnity, ie compensation for injury or loss sustained. Insurance has two broad classes which include life and non-life insurance. Life insurance comprise of whole life assurance, term assurance, endowment assurance and anmioty whole non-life insurance consist of fire insurance, marine insurance, motor vehicle insurance, contractors “all risk” and engineering risk insurance miscellaneous insurance and oil and gas insurance, occupy a strategic position in an economy because it is the only business which exists for the survival of other business.<br/>The marketing concepts is a philosophy of business that sates that the customer wants satisfaction as the economic and social justification of their wants at a profitable volume in an integrated business operation.</p> <p>The marketing concepts can also be said to be the philosophy that recognizes that the consumers is at the center of everything we do in business it’s concepts believers that without the consumers there can be no marketing and based on this it should be aimed at satisfying the need of the consumer. The following are some of the factors that enhanced the adoption of the marketing concepts.<br/><strong>a. MASS MARKERS AND MASS AFFLUENCE:</strong> The existent of well to do consumers: whose patronage, a discordant collection of producers would compete, inspires these producers to adopt the marketing concept. In this state of market competition, with consumers who are affluent, marketing concepts helps producers to sufficient satisfy these consumer so as earn.</p> <p><strong>b. ENHANCES IN MARKETING CHANNELS:</strong> Nigerian distribution channels here changed considerably over the years, becoming more complex and more diversified. This has enabled the consumer to locate and buy products of their choice easier from producer. Producers always adopt marketing concepts to ease the diversification and complexity of distribution channels.</p> <p><strong>c. TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES:</strong> Technological charge in most developing countries as enhanced the production of goods and services in amazing varieties which can be made available to consumer the speed associated with these technological changes means that producers would more seriously compete for the consumers money. Marketing concepts offers the surest way for fully satisfying consumers want under this situation.</p> <p><strong>d. GROWTH OF MASS COMMUNICATION MEDIA: </strong>this also contributes to the adoption of marketing concept in the sense that many more consumers in far places can be informed about the existence of products. In this way an insure in owerri, Imo state could compete with an insurer in far away Lagos for the patronage of consumers in Lagos. This existence growth of mass communication means that competition for the consumer money is generally more intense since a producer would be well aware that even a competition who base in overseas coned fight for a local consumer. To cope in this state of intensely competitive market situation, we are likely to adopt and implement the marketing concept.</p> <p><strong>e. A CROP OF PROFESSIONAL MANGERS:</strong> The existence of a crop of professional managers, the transfer of full management and executive responsibility and authority for the different organizations from the founder to a crop of educated and professional mangers would enhance the adoption of the marketing concept.<br/>In spite of the inductive appeal of the marketing concepts, many firms are unable to adopt it in their organization. This state of affair is normally due to one a combination of these factors.</p> <p>i. Product orientation: level of economic development of a society and certain peculiar characteristics in the dynamic cycle of an economy may mean that certain goods and services. Which vary in duration due to the would perhaps perceive its major function as service a s possible for sale to satisfy the overwhelming demand. This situation cause competition to be mild and marketing concepts would remain unappreciated and un adopted.</p> <p><strong>ii. COMMUNICATION DIFFICULTIES AND UNCOORDINATED PROLIFERATION OF SPECIALIZE:</strong> the existence of communication difficulties among the different function department within the organization may arise as a result of completely of the function performed by the various departments and their lack of relationship with one another. The growing complexity usually followed by in coordinate proliferation of special lost. It may also head to work at purpose, frication and inefficiencies.</p> <p><strong>iii. CONFLICTS AMONG DEPARTMENT GOALS:</strong> This is the usually strong drive within the different specialist to justify their own positions <br/><br/>The marketing concept is based on three fundamental beliefs.<br/>i. Marketing orientation: the insurance company should try to research and find out how best to create awareness or orientate the customers.<br/>ii. Profitable sale volumes: Target customers should be examined by the company to find out whether their products, customers, salesman and territories are profitable.<br/>iii. Co-ordination of marketing activities: This is also referred to as organizational characteristics of the chief marketing executive. This measure is used determine the extent of the implementation of the marketing concepts. Here, the organizational status of the chief marketing executives and the extent of integration of marketing functions under the chief marketing functions is the main concern.<br/>However, to accepts a concept is one thing to implement that concepts is another thing. It is vie of the majority of the executive that most marketers in Nigeria are most actually putting the marketing in Nigeria are most actually putting the marketing concepts into operations in their day to day marketing activities although they have paid considerable attention to the concept.<br/>Therefore, the major problem facing the marketing concepts in Nigeria is implementation, that is why strategies are being mapped out by most companies to meet the demand of the customers by applying marketing concepts to it business. Those strategies will be operating on these premises;<br/>1. Emphasis must be on customers wants.<br/>2. The insurance company must determine first what the customers want and then figure out to make and deliver a product to satisfy those want.<br/>3. The insurance company’s management must be profit oriented.<br/>4. The company planning must be long-men oriented in terms of new products, tomorrow’s markets and future growth.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>In site of the growing number of insurance companies in Nigeria, the level of confidence on the insuring public is still low. This is because some companies adopt selling concepts to marketing concepts in their marketing activities.<br/>Moreover, internal problems among executives in an organization can hinder the smooth implementation of marketing concept to insurance activities. Conflicts among departmental head communication difficulties and in coordination of to effectively and efficiently apply the marketing concept to insurance operations.<br/>Finally, over mechanization on the sale concept rather than the marketing concept ha resulted in reduced sales, profits and efficiently in company’s operation. This has adversely affected the industry because people are beginning to lose faith in insurance industry.</p> <p><strong>1.3 STATEMENT OF THE HYPOTHESIS</strong><br/>The following hypothesis were formulated in order to carry out a detailed research on the topic they include.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis I</strong><br/><strong>Ho;</strong> the application of marketing concept has not enhanced the marketing insurance in Nigeria.<br/><strong>Hi:</strong> the application of marketing concepts has enhanced the marketing of insurance in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis II<br/>HO; </strong>The marketing concept cannot be successfully applied in the insurance industry in the area of marketing<br/><strong>HI; </strong>The marketing concepts cannot be successfully applied in the insurance industry in the area of marketing.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis III</strong><br/><strong>HO;</strong> Marketing concept has not increased sales volumes of insurance products in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.4 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>The aim of this study is to examine the extent and scope of the application of marketing concept to insurance industry. <br/>The specific objectives of the study are;<br/>i. To examine the relevance of the marketing concept in the marketing of insurance services in Nigeria.<br/>ii. To identify those factors that militates against efficient application of marketing concept in insurance activities (ie marketing).<br/>iii. To examine the problems encountered in the adoption of marketing concept in insurance industry in Nigeria.<br/>iv. To examine the extent to which marketing concept has enhanced marketing of insurance in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>This study will be of immense benefit to mangers and departmental executives as it will help them to determine the best way to apply marketing concept to their business activities.<br/>The study is equally significant in portraying the problems encountered by insurance companies in adopting marketing concept in the operation. This will serve as a vital information to new entrants into the industry as they will strive to avoid those problems.<br/>More over, the lose of pubic confidence on the industry operation will be removed, as information on the application of marketing examines. This will enable managers and department executives to shift emphasis from sales concept to marketing concept. Finally, this research work will be useful to potential users of information, lecturers, student marketers, insurers and the public as it will serve as are reference point for further research.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong><br/>This study is on the application of marketing concept and its operational mechanices in insurance industry in Nigeria. The study concerns Nigeria, but because of time and distance, the study was conducted in enugu state. The reason behind the choice of the area was of time and inability of the researcher to cover all the insurance companies in different states.</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>INSURANCE :</strong> this is can be defined as any device aimed at reducing the chances of risk occurring, and when it happens, it reduce the extent of it damage thereby providing the affected persons with compensation it is commonly know as a safe-guard against risks.<br/><strong>INSURED:</strong> this refers to the person or corporation purchasing insurance. They are also referred to as policy holder.<br/><strong>MARKET:</strong> this refers to all the insurers who trade in a specific area (eg the London market).

The phrase can be induced or possibly eliminated if human beings can foresee or visualize what would happen in future. Life itself is full of risks and uncertainties abound. Every individual faces risks, either of personal nature or business nature.<br/>A businessman for instance faces the risk of his goods being damaged by fire while his dependant may suffer loss of income through his death. Equally, a manufacturing firm runs the physical risk of possible loss of goods by fire or theft or such other technical risk as loss of trade as a result of government policies, loss of trade of trade due to change in fashion, loss of profit as a result of fire outbreak. A car owner for instance stands to face the possible theft of his car and damage through accident. Efforts can be made to avoid some of these risks. Accidents can be avoided if proper precautions are taken. An individual can avoid airplane disaster or crash by not engaging in air travel no matter how careful one can be, some form of danger still hangs around.<br/>Some risks are inherent in nature or life itself and cannot be avoided. For instance, men are mortal and must die, when complete avoidance is impossible, man attempts to reduce or possibly assumes risks. A thatched roof house is a greater fire risk than one with tiled roof. Many people accept the small risk of building house of standard construction than that of thatched roof. Here the risk has not been avoided but reduced. Risk assumption may also arise out of ignorance or may even be an intentional art where the degree of expose risk is slight or possible loss is minimal. Assumption is even possible where a deliberate provision has been made for consequences of loss happening. Many individuals would however prefer to shift or spread the risk where possible. It is here that Social Economic Services rendered by Insurance companies will be appreciated. Insurance has been described as a social device by which the Insured agrees to transfer all or part of his risks to the Insurer who agrees to indemnify him when the risk insured against happens on the payment of the premium. The basic role of insurance is to create a common pool into which the individual or organization contribute premium commensurate with the degree of risk for which insurance is sought. The members of the pool who are unfortunate to suffer loss are compensated with the contributions of others in the pool. In this way, the larger society is made to be made to be responsible for providing compensation for the unfortunate few who unavoidably incur financial losses through the operation of certain mishap.<br/>It is therefore obligatory on the part of the insurer to compensate the insured (their client) whenever, is loss on the item insured against as long as the insured abides to the conditions stated in the contract or policy. Thus, the modern society retain insurance as the method of solving the risk associated with their activities, in that it helps to soften the financial blow that would have resulted. When the public feels that this function is not being carried out the industry may suffer or face a possible collapse.</p> <p><strong>1.1 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>The major reason for the establishment of insurance company is to provide a cushion for individual or organization that has or may suffer some misfortune at a price called premium. Sometimes when loss occurs and claims presented, they are delayed or declined and when paid it does not restore the insured to his former financial position. This has formed the architect of dispute between the insured and the insurer. These I think affect the attitude of insuring public and development of the insurance industry in Nigeria. It is therefore the purpose of the study to find out why claims are delayed or not paid at all and the role played by the insuring public that result in claim being settled or declined. The study also finds out if approach to claim settlement affect attitude of the insuring public and to what extent it affect the development of the insurance industry.</p> <p><strong>1.2 OBJECTIVE/PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong><br/>The objective of this research work is to look into the performance of the Nigerian insurance industry viz a viz the procedure and approach to claim settlement. Individuals hold diverse opinion about this industry and the general impression is that the insurance industry has failed to win the confidence of the insuring public. Often times, people make remark such as “unwilling to settle claim but always willing to collect premium and use its small prints in the policy to decline its liability”. It is the belief about the industry is allowed to continue and not corrected that the industry will totally collapse and the after effect will be over bearing on the economy. When we consider the importance of insurance in the economic development of any nation, it is therefore the intention of the researcher to find out if this allegation is true or otherwise, proffer solution and make recommendation that will help to solve these problems.</p> <p>The purpose of study among other things is to:-<br/>- Find out if insurance companies are capitalizing on the ignorance or illiteracy of the insuring public.<br/>- To find out what the perception of the public is towards insurance companies.<br/>- To find out if there are laws that make it impossible for them to settle claim that are genuine.<br/>- To find out what makes it difficult for insurance companies to settle claim when they arise.<br/>- To find out the effect of rate cutting on the insurance companies.</p> <p><strong>1.3 RESEARCH QUESTION</strong><br/>Having defined the background to the problem and purpose of study, it is therefore expected that practical answers will be provided to the following questions at the end of the study.<br/>- Does illiteracy of the public have nay effect on the ability of the insurer to settle claim?<br/>- Does the insuring public involve intermediates in their insurance affair or contract?<br/>- Should emphasis be laid on police report before claim settlement?<br/>- Why is the issue of under settlement common?<br/>- Is there a shift from comprehensive to third party motor?<br/>- How effective is their approach in claim settlement?</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong><br/>Claim administration is the core of insurance business; an efficient and prompt setting service is the best of advertising for an insurance company.<br/>But since claim settlement has been a subject of controversy this study will help :-<br/>-The insurer claim. Setting superior value and effective settlement of claim. The insurance company can change their customer expectations and make them the engine fuel of innovation by listening to their careful analysis, complaints compliment and evaluation of their services delivered.<br/>-The study will also be relevant to academicians who may wish to know themselves of data and information about claim settlement situation in enugu, it will also enlighten the public at large on insurance matters. More so the study will serve as a dimension to putup researchers and will give them the bases for validating and disapproving the finding of this study.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF STUDY </strong><br/>The scope of this study covers Nigeria but because of time and difficulty in reaching all the insurance companies in Nigeria, the researcher close to cover only the registered insurance companies in Enugu state.<br/><strong>LIMITATION:-</strong> in carry out a research work researcher is bound to encounter some difficulties which act as limiting factor. The following are the limitation in this study.<br/>The cost of carrying out a research work is getting very high especially during this period of harsh economic reality which places a greater burden on the researcher’s limited resources. <br/>In order to carry out an in-depth study on any subject matter time is absolutely required.<br/>The researcher was constrained in carry out in-depth study on major matter due to complete factors affecting the disposal of time.<br/>The level of some of the respondents caused some communication problem for researcher and this her to rely on the service of interpreter during interviews.<br/>Getting response from commercial vehicle owners was an uphill task.<br/>These were inadequate materials hence, the researcher was faced with difficulties, in sourcing relevant material for this study.<br/>The researcher has rely on mostly on material from oriental insurance co. The nature of this topic was very general and wide. The researcher has to narrow it down to vehicle insurance claim since it is the most common, compulsory and formed the basis on which conclusion about insurance is drawn.</p> <p><strong>1.6 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/><strong>POLICY:-</strong>this is a document which gives the term and condition of insurance contract.

After their assessment, their judgement is final and they are paid for such services by the insurance company.</p> <p><strong>NOTICE OF RENEWAL: -</strong> A policy meant for one year for instance, 2000-1st January 2001 is expected to lapse at the end of one year. So before it lapses, a renewal is sent to the insured reminding him to come and renew his policy because any claim on lapsed policy is not entertained.</p> <p><strong>ALMOST GOODFAITH: - </strong>Due to its fiduciary nature it is required by this doctrine that all parties to an insurance contract should disclose material fact concerning the contract that they want to enter into whether required or not.</p> <p><strong>PROXIMATE CAUSE: -</strong> The active efficient cause that sets in motion a chain of events which brings about a result without intervention of any force stated and working actively. From new and independent source in Pawsay V. Scottish union and national (1907).<br/><br/><strong>CONTRIBUTION:- </strong>is the right of an insurer to call upon others similar but not necessarily equally liable to the same insured to share the cost of an indemnity payment (J.I.Stell, Elements of insurance study course II textbook, London, chapter 5 page 5)</p> <p><strong>SUBROGATION: -</strong> Is a contract that beholds indemnity contract.

Foreign direct investment influence poverty reduction to really feel the impact of FDI, the government should ensure there is FDl in flow to real sector</em>.</p> <p><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The importance of foreign capital to developing countries is well known. It supplements their domestic savings and it is often accompanied with technology and managerial skills which are indispensable in economic development. Foreign direct investment can contribute in significant ways to breaking of the growth – poverty vicious circle, and there lies Nigerians hope. The Nigerian government hopes that Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) can make up for domestic capital shortfalls, provide technology, managerial skills, facilitate access to foreign market and generate both technological and efficient spillovers to local firms. By providing access to external markets, transferring technology and building capacity in the local firms generally, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is expected to improve the integration of the continent global economy, spur economic growth and alleviate poverty.</p> <p>Direct foreign investment has been characterized as the best form of foreign finance. The packages of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) comes with finance, technology and highly skilled personnel (Lall and Streeton 1977). Indeed in the case of Nigeria as in 3rd world countries Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) was the main channel through which their import-substitution industrialization strategies were prosecuted.</p> <p>It is widely believed that given the appropriate host-country policies and a basic level of development, benefits that might accrue from Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) include employment creation, the acquisition of new technology and knowledge, increased tax revenue from cooperate profits generated by Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). All of these form of benefits are expected to contributed to higher economic and employment growth, which is the most important and effective tool for achieving improvements in human well-being for alleviating poverty in Nigeria.</p> <p>Although, the impact of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) on poverty alleviation depend principally on many factors such as host country policies and institutions. The most efficient way Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) help in alleviating poverty is the widening access to employment opportunities.</p> <p> The ability of Nigeria to alleviate poverty depends on adequate inflow of foreign investment resources. The country has been experiencing difficulties in her effort to alleviate poverty for decades now. At present, majority of Nigerians are living below the poverty level. Consequently given the low level of per capital income characterizing the less developed economies, the traditional model of economics assumes that average and marginal consumption propensities are high, savings are low and that the formation of new productive capital is restricted.</p>\n\nFOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND POVERTY REDUCTION IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND POVERTY REDUCTION IN NIGERIA", "id": 41}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Insurance is a unique industry and one of the contributing tractors to its uniqueness is the product on the insurer that is, the promise to indemnity at a future date, is tangible. It has been generally accepted that insurance industry exist to guarantee the continued existence of other industries (Mehr and Camack (1976).</p> <p>As an illustration if a factory that is insured is destroyed, insurers will indemnify the insured by replacing or reinstating the factory thereby guaranteeing the continued existence of the factory. The reputation of any insurance company depends to a large extend on the sort or claims services provided by that insurance company to its policyholders.A company may be run very efficiently and soundly in every respect, its policies may be delivered promptly and renewals handle efficient claims department may ruin the reputation of the insurance company (OJUKWU 2006: 32).</p>\n\nROLE OF CLAIMS SETTLEMENTS IN THE GROWTH OF AN INSURANCE COMPANY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ROLE OF CLAIMS SETTLEMENTS IN THE GROWTH OF AN INSURANCE COMPANY", "id": 42}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div><strong>ABSTRACT<br/><br/></strong></div> This research project assessed the effects of agricultural insurance on food productivity in Nigeria.

When we consider the importance of insurance in the economic development of any nation, it is therefore the intention of the researcher to find out if this allegation is true or otherwise, proffer solution and make recommendation that will help to solve these problems.</div> <div><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong><br/><br/>Title page                                    ii<br/>Approval page                                iii<br/>Dedication                                    iv<br/>Acknowledgement                                v<br/>Title page                                    vii<br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER ONE<br/>Background of Study                            1</strong>    <br/>1.1    Statement of problem                        3<br/>1.2    Objective/Purpose of Study                    4<br/>1.3    Research Question                            6<br/>1.4    Significance Of Study                        6<br/>1.5    Scope &amp; Limitations of Study                    7<br/>1.6    Definition of Terms                        9<br/><strong>Reference                                13<br/><br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Literature Review                            14</strong><br/>2.1     Historical Development of Insurance                15<br/>2.2     Insurance Market                            18<br/>2.3     Benefits of Insurance                        34<br/>2.4     Classes of insurance                        38<br/>2.5     Claims Settlement                            40<br/>2.6     General Claims Procedure                    42<br/>2.7     Conditions under which Insurer may refuse to settle claims                    46<br/>2.8    Exception clauses relieving the Insurer from Liabilities when claim is filed.                48<br/><strong> Reference                                51<br/><br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0     Methodology and Research Design                53</strong><br/>3.1     Sources of Data                            55<br/>3.2     Description of Population                    55<br/>3.3     Sampling Procedure                        55<br/>3.4     Instrument of Data Collection                    56<br/>3.5     Data collection Procedure                    57<br/>3.6     Statistical method of Analysis                    57<br/><strong>    Reference                                58<br/><br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>Data Presentation and Analysis of Data            59<br/><br/>CHAPTER FIVE    <br/>Summary of findings/Recommendations and Conclusion    72</strong><br/>5.1    Summary of findings                            72<br/>5.2    Recommendation                            73<br/>5.3    Conclusion                                75<br/><strong>Bibliography                            77<br/>Appendix                                83</strong><br/>                            </div>\n\nAN APPRAISAL OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES APPROACH TO CLAIM SETTLEMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN APPRAISAL OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES APPROACH TO CLAIM SETTLEMENT", "id": 44}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong><br/><br/>In this research study titled an evaluation of the role of NDIC to bank depositors and their services adequacy.

Questa with appropriate answers. The insurer on the often hard inspect the paid of  the insured before  the insured could course for the settlement of claims and the policy holder should come for the claim, immediately the loss has been sustained. Fround, the insured will notify and clear his mind from fraudulent company in other to enter for a legal contract with the insurance company. The other hand of the detection  bodt the insurer and the insured will so into inspection before any risk could be selted moreso the policy evidence of contract between the insured and the insurer and it is well established in law that general wile of contention and interpretation shall apply to insurance contracts as well as to other contacts. Checking operation the insured show his responsibilities in enlightening the insured how a risk or  peril should be avoided and rather imp wired the policy holders risks. The objectives of this project is to study the detection and checks of claims fraud most especially in  Nigeria because of the ill educated people in Nigeria who could not enter into insurance policy because they be live that God will insure them conclusion all the insurance companies should take steps in ensuring the wording of the policy are bodily written so that one would not need  to strain the eyes before being able to read through the lines of princited words and they should consider the use of simple and understandable English language while drafting the policy. Ambiguous terms should not be used. Appropriate sales production scheme or advertising channel must be taken. <br/><br/></div> <div><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong><br/><br/>Title page                                        <br/>Approval page                                     <br/>Dedication                                         <br/>Acknowledgment                                 <br/>Abstract                                        <br/>Table of content    <br/>                                <br/><strong>CHAPTER ONE <br/>Introduction   </strong>                              <br/>1.1    Background of study                            <br/>1.2    Statement of problem                             <br/>1.3    Purpose / objection of study                         <br/>1.4    Significance of the study                             <br/>1.5    Scope and limitation of the study     <br/>                <br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Literature Review  </strong>                                   <br/>2.1 What is insurance                                 <br/>2.1.1 Classes of Insurance                             <br/>2.1.2 The benefit of insurance                             <br/>2.2 insurance claims                                 <br/>2.2.1 Claim settlement procedure                         <br/>2.2.2 Causes of delay in claim settlement                     <br/>2.3 What is fraud?                                     <br/>2.4 How claims fraud can arise                                       <br/>2.5 Ways of detecting and checking claims fraud<br/>                 <br/><strong>CHAPTER THREE <br/>Research methodology </strong>                               <br/>3.1 sources of date                                    <br/>3.2 location of date                                  <br/>3.3 Method of data collection     <br/>                        <br/><strong>CHAPTER FOUR  </strong>      <br/>4.1 date presentation and analysis <br/>                        <br/><strong>CHAPTER FIVE    <br/>Summary of Findings, Conclusion and Recommendation </strong>            <br/>5.1 Findings                                        <br/>5.2 Conclusion                                    <br/>5.3 Recommendation    <br/><strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/> QUESTIONNAIRE</strong></div>\n\nA STUDY OF THE DETECTION AND CHECKS OF CLAIMS FRAUD IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A STUDY OF THE DETECTION AND CHECKS OF CLAIMS FRAUD IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY", "id": 46}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> The effect of risk survey in a manufacturing  firm (a case of emenite Plc). Is over emphasized. Risk is the center of human activities and a manufacturing firm like Emenite will need the activities of risk management to survey. So it is only when there is adequate risk survey that the risk manager will be able to identify various risk exposure. Using organizational charts, Hazard and operational studies, check list and so on. When this happens, they will evaluate the identified risk so as to recommend appropriate risk management principle for risk handling. The chapter one of this project started with introduction historical background, statement of problem, purposes of study, significance of study. In chapter two it looked into the literature  review of past materials concerning this topic. Chapter three is about the source of data, population, sample size, validity and reliability of instrument. Finally chapter four discussed about the summary of findings and discussion were it was  found that risk survey  will help to identify these risk that are insurable. Chapter five which looked into conclusion and recommendation therefore recommended to ensure that there is adequate law that will guide local insurer and insure for effectiveness in provement in local initiative. <br/><br/></div> <div> <div><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></div> Title page                                     i<br/>Approval page                                    ii<br/>Dedication                                    iii<br/>Acknowledgement                                 iv<br/>Abstract                                         vii<br/>Table of content                                 viii<br/><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong><br/><strong>1.0    Introduction                                 1</strong><br/>1.1    Background of the study                     1<br/>1.2    Statement of problems                         4<br/>1.3    Objective of the study                         5<br/>1.4    Research questions                         6<br/>1.5    Significance of the study                     7<br/>1.6    Scope and limitation of the study                8<br/>1.7    Definition of operational terms                 9<br/><strong>Reference                                 12<br/><br/>CHAPTER TWO <br/>2.0    Review of Related literature                    13</strong><br/>2.1    An overview                                 13<br/>2.2    Definition of risk                             14<br/>2.3    Categories of risk                            15<br/>2.4    Concept of risk survey                        17<br/>2.5    The reasons why we survey identify, control and Transfer rise     18<br/>2.6    Various risk exposed                        19<br/>2.7    Duties of A risk survey in a manufacturing firm    22<br/>2.8    Benefit of risk survey                         23<br/><strong>Reference                                    24 <br/><br/>CHAPTER THREE <br/>3.0    Research Methodology and Design             25</strong><br/>3.1    An Overview                                 25<br/>3.2    Source of data                                25<br/>3.3    Instrument used for this study                26<br/>3.4    Population of the study                        26<br/>3.5    Sample size and sampling techniques             27<br/>3.6    Validity of the instrument                     28<br/>3.7    Reliability of the instrument                     29<br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER FOUR <br/>4.0    summary of findings and discussion             30</strong><br/>4.1    Summary of findings                        30<br/>4.2    Discussion of findings                         31<br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER FIVE  <br/>5.0    Conclusion and Recommendation             34</strong><br/>5.1    Conclusion                                 34<br/>5.2    Recommendation                             36<br/>5.3    Suggestion for further studies                 37<br/><strong>Bibliography                                38<br/>Appendix                                 39<br/></strong></div>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF RISK SURVEY IN A MANUFACTURING FIRM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF RISK SURVEY IN A MANUFACTURING FIRM", "id": 47}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study investigates the determinants of the effect of consumer behaviour on insurance business in Nigeria.  It analyze the interpretation of data collection from respondents.</p> <p>The research questionnaire were draw to get data from banking, civil service, self-employed, married/single and divorced.  The result of the questionnaire were used for positive correlation co-efficient which means that consumer perception about risk influences the desire to buy insurance.</p> <p>The study recommends the price of insurance significantly affect the proportion of income spent on insurance consumers.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0   INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The aim of marketing is to meet and satisfy target consumers’ needs and wants. The field of consumer behaviour according to Kotler (2003) studies “how individuals, groups and organization select, buy, use and dispose of goods, services, ideas or experiences to satisfy their needs and desires”.</p> <p>Marketing theories and practices according to Osuagwu (2002) have much to learn from the behavioural sciences but preoccupation with techniques may tempt marketers to ignore the real world situations. Halbert (1965) states that “behaviuoral sciences’ contribution lies in the fact that they require learning to take explicit account of the human social aspects of individual and groups engaged in the marketing behaviour rather than specific tools, techniques or ideas”. Through the behaviuoral science contributions, marketers have come to know that people tend to obey the pleasure pain – principle, using the former and avoiding the latter. A person’s value is as conditioned by his behaviuor as much as that of people around him.</p> <p>Therefore, any organization unable to provide goods and services that fulfill the needs and wants of consumer has lost its basic reason of distance. This is the crux of marketing concept, which encouraged organization to be consumer oriented in order to survive in a competitive environment.</p> <p>Consumer behaviour then ”is the behaviour customers or clients display in searching for, buying, using, evaluating and disposing of products, services and idea which they expect will satisfy their needs and wants.  This then makes consumer behaviour a study of how individuals make to spend their resources on consumption related items and their evaluation of such purchase decisions.</p> <p>However, the service nature of insurance even makes the study of consumer behaviour very important. Insurance according to Oyetayo (2001) can be defined “as the contractual agreement between two parties called insurer and insured whereby the former promises to indemnify the industry that suppose to the virile aspect of any economy has been relegated to the background, this is  however unconnected to the bad consumer attitude towards the purchase of insurance. </p> <p>The success of any economy is majorly traced to the performance of its industries and business, however, for these industries and businesses to attain good performance, there must necessarily be a good security system to secure lives and properties. Okwo (2005) describes insurance “as the handmaiden of commerce  and industry, suggesting that modern commerce and industry cannot function efficiently without a well planned and organized insurance system.  Moreover, success of the first world countries cannot but be traced to the their well organized security system (insurance) and effective and efficient buying behaviour of the insuring public which has made the business of insurance the forerunner of other industries. </p> <p>However,  this research work shall consist the</p> <p>(a)    The study of consumer behaviour of the insuring public in Nigeria</p> <p>(b)    Approaches of consumer behaviour</p> <p>(c)     Factors affecting consumers’ attitude</p> <p>(d)    Levels of business behaiour in Nigeria.</p> <p>(e)     Consumer decision – making processes in insurance industry and</p> <p>(f)      Stages of the buying decision process in insurance</p> <p><strong>1.1   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The attitude of insuring public towards the purchase of insurance products/services has affected the industry in no small measure. Despite the numerical growth and to some extend, expansion in the insurance industry in Nigeria, the insurance market requires a through empirical investigation to determine the cost structure and optimal production levels in which an insurance company can efficiently operate.</p> <p>Poor perception of insurance service in Nigeria is worrisome. Most insuring public do not believe in insurance. Religious believe that only God insures have affected the industry. They see no reason in buying insurance products or services.      </p> <p>The level of illiteracy also have a negative effect on the buying behaviuor of insurance services. Illiterate according to Oxford Advance Dictionary (6thedition ) “ is somebody or person not knowing how to read and write” But insurance illiteracy goes beyond this reason, even those who know how to write and read still find it difficult to understand what insurance entails, its benefits and importance to individuals and society at large.</p> <p>The conservative attitude of insurance companies leading to lack of awareness is also worrisome.  There is nothing like aggressive marketing or advertisement to insuring public and also educate them about the workability benefit of insurance services.</p> <p>Low participation by government and its parastatals also contribute to low consumer’s attitude towards insurance products or services. Government parastatals like NAICOM (National Insurance Commission) can also support the insurance companies in the public enlightment of insurance so as to increase the clients’ base in the industry.</p> <p>Bad claim experience also has its own negative effect in the industry.  The insurance companies were accused of not paying genuine claims.  This had also contributed to the attitude in the industry.  Whatever name the insurance industry has today was definitely given by those who had been victims of some dubious insurers who defaulted in paying genuine claim at one time or the other.  To streamline insurance business activities and stem the upsurge of the mushroom insurance  companies, insurance capital base was raised from to N2 million, N3, million and N10 million for life business, general insurance business and reinsurance businesses respectively, leaving the industry with 58 registered insurance and reinsurance companies from about 152 insurance and reinsurance companies prior the consolidation exercise.</p> <p><strong>1.2   PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study are as follows;</p> <p>(a)     To find out effect of consumer attitude

This has become so great that the traditional methods of assisting those affected by misfortunes in our societies are no longer adequate. Therefore, societies call for a more reliable and adequate means by which risk or any misfortunes can be covered in the future, and here lies the importance of insurance which safeguard against risks or losses incurred by clients.</p> <p>Majority of the people in our society today are either ignorant or have a misconception of what insurance entails. What role it plays or its usefulness in the promotion of trade and commerce. As a service industry insurance plays a very important role in the economic and social development of a nation. In appreciation of this, the government has continued to take steps to regulate the activities of the insurance business in order to create a sound and efficientinsurance market.</p> <p>Insurance business is one of the subjects that have been securing the public in this country. Many people outside the periphery of the business have looked at the institution with disdain and they are simply suspicious of the insurer and their styles of business. They claim that insurer are only interested in collecting premium and hardly settle claims, whenever they arise.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The insurance industry is one of the misrepresented businesses in the world today. This is mainly due to lack of knowledge on the part of the public concerning their activities. The degree of knowledge varies from century to century and is relative to the state of socio- economic development in each individual country concerned, which may in turn be governed by the level of the literacy component of each community.</p> <p>In developing economy, problems association with the misconception of the impact of insurance are not as pronounced as in under developed countries, industry Nigeria. All attempts in developing a sound insurance. Industry have been confronted by market distortions, high race of inflation, various government regulations, unethical practices and fraudulent tendencies of the insuring public there are overwhelming. There is little behavior, which indicates that, the Nigerian public. Literature or otherwise know little or nothing about the operation of the insurance business.</p> <p><strong>1.3     Research Questions</strong></p> <p>Consequently, many questions have been asked.</p> <p>(1)     Should, Companies/brokers continue to exploit the general public as a result of their ignorance about the industry?</p> <p>(2)     Is there any need to control the business at all?</p> <p>(3)     What are the control measures?</p> <p><strong>1.4     Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>On a cursory look at the Insurance mechanism, it would be seen that insurance is a service rendering business. There are special social characteristic of insurance that set it apart from tangible goods industries.

Furthermore, the objective of the study is to throw light on the activities of the insurance with the view to arousing the awareness of the policyholder and prospective ones. This will be achieved by highlighting the insurance mechanism, discovering the weak areas, that need to be strengthened and recommendation will be proffered for further study.</p> <p>Also the study is to highlight the fundamental principle of insurance, which the society has not been able to recognize. This work is made in such way as to highlight the need for Insurance in our society. Taking all these into consideration, the following are the objective of this study:</p> <p>1.                  The main objective of this study is to outline the functions, roles and contribution of insurance business to the development of the national economy.</p> <p>2.                 To identify if insurance business are useful to our day to - day activities and the entire society.</p> <p>3.                 To ascertain if insurance business actually perform their financial roles diligently.</p> <p>4.                 To suggest way of improving the function of the insurance business.</p> <p><strong>1.5     Statement of Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>To establish the fact about insurance business and impact on economic development in Nigeria the following hypothesis have been formulated:</p> <p>(1)             The Insurance business does not play any significant role in the economic growth of anation.</p> <p>(2)             Trade cannot achieve its desired goals in a nation with the aid of insurance business. </p> <p>(3)             People who insure their insurable properties have no advantage over those who do not in terms of losses</p> <p><strong>1.6     Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The scope of the study has been limited to the insurance companies in <br/> Nigeria.

The government responsibility to supervise, regulate and control the activities of insurance companies and intermediaries is to protect the interest of the insuring public and to save them from exploitation by unreliable insurers. Because of the intangible nature of insurance product, the government wants to make sure that those engaged in it must be competent person who will fulfill their promise and pledges when the need arises.</p> <p>Also because of the complexity of insurance business, it is necessary that the government regulate it to protect the policy holders. Also because of violation of public trust that occurs in insurance transistors, the government has found it necessary to regulate insurance industries so as to control such violations. The project attempts to appraise the effectiveness of government policies in regulating the insurance companies in Nigeria. The insurance industry in Nigeria has acute shortage of high level of manpower for most classes of insurance, also many Nigerians suffer financial loss due to lack of knowledge in insurance.</p> <p>Due to this problem, government should introduce programs regarding to insurance to the public as to highlight them on the benefit accrued to insurance due to constant financial loss they encounter as a result of lack of insurance knowledge.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>“Risk is a phenomenon which has been in existence since the beginning of the world. Risk exists whenever the future is unknown” (Lemon 1989: 17). This means that the word implies some element of doubt about the future and the outcome may be worse than what it had been at the moment. This man in his daily operations could be viewed as a risk manager, in that man does his best possible to reduce, eliminate, avoid, retain or share risk where they are present.</p> <p>          Though there were some forms of risk management before the advent of insurance companies in Nigeria such as the extended family system, age grade association and others. Insurance in its modern form was introduced into Nigeria by British.</p> <p>          In 1921, the Royal Exchange Assurance Company was established and it was the first insurance company to open full branch in Nigeria. In 1949, three other companies emerged. In 1958, Africa insurance company. By 1965, the number of insurance companies rose to 70. In 1977, the Nigeria Re- insurance company was established as a federal government owned insurance company. Nigeria was however under the British colonial rule up to 1960 when she gained her political independence and as a developing country. From 1960 to date a lot of insurance companies came into operation. Insurance is a modern method of sharing loss or spreading risk lightly over a great number of people so that the few unfortunate ones or persons who sustain or suffer loss do not heavy financial loss as a result of their misfortune to the community. The insured pay premium into a common pool outcome of which the unfortunate few who suffer loss are compensated.</p> <p><strong>The secondary function of insurance companies includes:</strong></p> <p>1.       Provision of loans for building on the security of a life policy.</p> <p>2.       Encourage and promote commercial enterprise men and industrialist</p> <p>3.       The accumulated sum of money by insurer reinvested to state approved securities and this helps to provide the state with a steady flow investment funds with which the state can provide development and promotions to the local industries which will be of benefit to the community.</p> <p>Insurance is a contract whereby a person called the insurer or assurer agrees in consideration of money paid to him or her known as premium by another person called the insured or assured to indemnify him against loss resulting to him on the happening of certain events. However, it was known that risk exist whenever the future is unknown and therefore insurance exist primarily to combat the adverse effect of risk.</p> <p>The purpose of insurance is to compensate or indemnify the victim for his financial loss. It should be noted here that the insurance neither eliminate the loss nor stops the disaster from happening, what insurance does is to soften the blow in a purely financial sence by offering monetary compensation to the victim whereby placing him in the same financial position after loss as he was before though within the terms of the policy.</p> <p>Re- insurance is the transfer of insurance business from one insurance company to another. The original insurer who obtain the insurance contract from the insured or assured is called the direct insurer or the ceding company. Re- insurance arose form the need of the original insurer to spread the risk he has undertaken. Under re- insurance contract is between the ceding company policies. Therefore in the event of a loss, the insured cannot enforce the re- insurance contract.</p> <p>However, the effect of re- insurance contract on the ceding company includes:</p> <p>i        Re- insurance reduces the probability of the ceding company’s ruin by assuming his catastrophe risk.</p> <p>ii       Re- insurance stabilizes the ceding company’s balance sheet by taking on apart of his risk of random fluctuation risk of change and risk error.</p> <p>iii      Re- insurance increases the amount of capital effectively available to the ceding company by freeing equity that was tied up to cover risk.</p> <p>iv      Re- insurance enlarges the ceding company’s underwriting capacity by accepting a proportional share of risks and by providing part of the necessary reserves.</p> <p>The insurance sector is made up of a large number of companies with varying sizes, among which the NAICOM was established. The government uses this commission to regulate the insurance industry. The government uses this commission to regulate the insurance industry. It was established in 1997 by NAICOM decree N0. 1 of 1997. Prior to the establishment of National insurance commission, the insurance business regulation and supervision were done by the insurance department of the Ministry of finance.</p> <p>The national insurance supervisory board (NISB) was established in 1991 to take over the supervision of insurance from the director of insurance. National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) is the head by the commission finance and administration and deputy director for insurance technical.</p> <p><strong>NAICOM Decree 1 of 1997 stated the functions of NAICOM as follows:</strong></p> <p>1.       To ensure the effective administration, supervision regulation and control of insurance business in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.       Establishment of standards of the conduct of insurance business in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.       Approval of rate insurance premium to be paid of all classes of insurance business.</p> <p>4.       Regulation of transactions between insurers and re- insurance in Nigeria and those outside Nigeria.</p> <p>5.       Ensuring adequate protection of strategic government assets and other properties.</p> <p>6.       To act as adviser to the federal government on all insurance related matters. </p> <p>7.       Approve standards, conditions and warranties applicable to all classes of insurance business.</p> <p>8.       To protect insurance policy holders and beneficiaries and third parties to insurance contract</p> <p>9.       To publish for sale and distribution to the public, annual reports and statistics on the re- insurance industry.</p> <p>10.     To liaise with and advise federal ministries, extra ministerial departments, statutory bodies and other government agencies on all matters relating to insurance contained in annual technical agreements to which Nigeria is signatory.</p> <p>11.     To contribute to the educational program of the chartered institute of Nigeriaand the West African insurance institute.</p> <p>12.     To carry out such other activities connected or incidental to its other functions under the decrees.</p> <p>1.2     <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The insurance industry in Nigeria has acute shortage of high level manpower for most classes of insurance and re- insurance business. The Nigeria insurance industry does not enjoy the required public goodwill and reason for this has to do with the damage done to practice of the profession by the get rich entrepreneur who goes about the business of insurance with the little regard to the principle of the profession. As a result of this, the government has come up with so many policies aimed at the study though will save the insurance industry. The extent to which all those government policies affect insurance companies and provides solution to ensure the survival of these insurance companies is another thing. The research therefore, is indicated to examine the impact of various control measures as promulgated by government to regulate the activities of the insurance industry.</p> <p>1.3            <strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this research is essential in a direct investigation on the impact of government policies on the insurance industry in Nigeria.</p> <p>*        To look into the factors hindering the performance of insurance companies through the various government regulatory policies.</p> <p>*        To determine the impact of those government policies on the insurance companies and the insuring public.</p> <p>*        Since the insurance industry is the second largest deposit mobilization institution in the country, it therefore encourages saving which plays an important role in the social and economic well being of the country.</p> <p>*        To evaluate the performance of the industry therefore, is necessary for the growth of the economy.</p> <p>1.4     <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>i        To enlighten the Nigerian populace about the benefit that they could drive by taken up insurance cover.</p> <p>ii       To guide the policy makers when they are enacting laws concerning insurance.</p> <p>iii      Ascertain the need or otherwise for government intervention through regulatory body in the insurance industry.</p> <p>1.5     <strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>i        To determine the impact of government policies in regulating the activities of the Nigerian insurance industry.</p> <p>ii       The study therefore will concentrate on the Nigeria insurance industry.</p> <p>1.6     <strong>DEFINITION OF THE TERM</strong></p> <p>i        INSURER / ASSURER: This is the insurance or assurance company that issue out policy to the policy holder.</p> <p>ii       INSURED / ASSURED: This are policy holders in the insurance business</p> <p>iii      PERIL: This is known as a prime cause or what gives rise to the loss.</p> <p>iv      PREMIUM: This is periodic consideration payment by the policy holder to the insurance company which will necessitate compensation by the insurer to the insured.</p> <p>v       POLICY: This is a written contract of insurance which is issued to the policy holder.</p> <p>vi      RE- INSURANCE: This is an insurance company re-insuring again a risk that had already been insured to another insurance company.</p> <p>vii     CEDING COMPANY: This is the direct insurer or the original insurer who is re-insuring the risk to another insurer.</p> <p>viii    UNDERWRITING: This is a process by which an insurance company determine weather or not on the basis it will accept an application for insurance. </p>                                                           \n\nTHE IMPACT OF THE GOVERNMENT POLICIES IN REGULATING THE ACTIVITIES OF INSURANCE COMPANIES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF THE GOVERNMENT POLICIES IN REGULATING THE ACTIVITIES OF INSURANCE COMPANIES IN NIGERIA", "id": 50}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0       INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>“Marketing and marketing communications mix is changing. New insights, new tools, new opportunities and new challenges are emerging as the 21st century progresses. The world’s 61/4 billion consumers and almost 400 million business customers are becoming increasingly accessible” (Smith and Taylor, 2004, p 4) which makes them ready targets for new global competitors.</p> <p>“Marketing has moved from ‘customer acquisition’ (winning new customers) through ‘customer retention’ (keeping customers for life) through customer selection (dumping unprofitable customers while selectively seeking and keeping the more profitable ones)” (Smith and Taylor 2004, pg 4) towards ‘customer relationship’ (interacting with customers, gathering and analysing data on them and forecasting customer trends and/or behaviours to enhance customer experience). This fact is further buttressed by Arens, Weigold and Arens, (2008, p. 307), in this statement “the key to building brand equity in the twenty-first century is the development of interdependent, mutually satisfying relationships with customers and other stakeholders.” Today’s marketers must therefore embrace continual change and the opportunities and challenges that come with marketing.</p> <p>One of the areas of marketing in which this continual change is currently being experienced is in the area of the marketing communications mix and brand managers need to have “a basic understanding of the communication tools available to them and how they can best be used in the overall communication mix” (Arens, Weigold and Arens, 2008, p 307). One of the new communication tools available to brands now is social media marketing which is a subset of digital marketing.</p> <p>Social media, although a relatively recent phenomenon, is becoming an increasingly important part of any business’ marketing and client base development platform. Social media provides a unique opportunity for brands to foster their relationships with customers but “the dynamic, ubiquitous, and often real-time interaction enabled by social media significantly changes the landscape for brand management” (Gensler, Völckner, Liu-Thompkins and Wiertz, p. 1). Brands on the other hand are highly valuable assets for businesses and brand managers aim to “create strong brands with a rich and clear knowledge structure in consumer memory by authoring compelling brand stories” (Keller 1993; Srivastava, Shervani, and Fahey 1998). However, today, “a brand is no longer what we tell the consumer it is - it is what consumers tell each other it is” (Cook, 2012).</p> <p>“Consumer-generated brand stories told through social media are much more impactful than stories spread through traditional channels because they utilize social networks, are digital, visible, ubiquitous, available in real-time, and dynamic” (Hennig-Thurau et al. 2010 p. 12). This has led to the blend of social media and customer relationship management (CRM) with the end result being “Social CRM” a means of enabling brands listen, engage and successfully coordinate or integrate consumer-generated and firm-generated brand stories on social media into their communication mix to create compelling brand stories that strengthen customer relationship and move them further into the sales funnel.</p> <p>Of all the marketing promotional tools, digital marketing has experienced the most changes within a short period of time with more and more marketers embracing the many opportunities it presents. Digital marketing is simply marketing online: “identifying, anticipating and satisfying customers’ needs online” (Smith and Taylor 2004, p. 620). This is split into several areas such as Search Engine Marketing, Search Engine Optimization, social media marketing, mobile media marketing, interactive out of home (OOH) as well as digital TV and radio with social media marketing being one of the most important and ubiquitous types.</p> <p>Social media marketing can be said to be a hybrid element of the marketing promotional mix. This is so because in a traditional sense it enables brands to talk to their customers, while in a non-traditional sense it enables customers to talk directly to one another and to the brand in real time. For instance, it is now possible for one customer to communicate with hundreds or even thousands of other people about products/services and the companies that provide them. This stands in contrast to the traditional marketing communications paradigm where communication is usually one-sided.</p> <p>When companies join the social channels, consumers can interact with them and they in turn can communicate with customers and potential customers directly. This interaction feels more personal to users than traditional methods of marketing and can instil a feeling of loyalty. Social media also isn’t just valuable in and of itself; it is also valuable as a source of analytics and data which can hint at what types of content will work as paid media. Brands therefore use social media on the whole to connect with customers, stimulate and promote positive brand-related stories as well as listen to and influence consumer-generated brand stories while customers use social media to discover, research, and share information about brands and products or services.</p> <p>Also, the fact that social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, etc. enable brands to reach a much wider audience than some traditional media alone like TV, radio, print etc. at a fraction of the cost, (as most social networking sites can be used at no cost) has made it easier for brands to accept it. Thus, now, instead of shelling out millions of Naira for a 30 second ad slot on TV or radio, brands can now generate buzz simply by creating viral content and encouraging engagement.</p> <p>Market share according to the Merriam Webster Dictionary 2013 is defined as “the percentage of the market for a product or service that a company supplies”. It can therefore be implied that market share helps determine how well a business is performing. “Past data analyses have consistently demonstrated that most businesses with high market share enjoy above-average profit margins and rates of return on investment while most businesses with smaller market share have below-average margins and returns on investment.” (Nielsen 2013). One of the first research suggesting the relationship between market share and profitability came from Profit Impact of Marketing Strategist (PIMS) program sponsored by the Strategic Planning Institute in Cambridge Massachusetts and was first published in the mid-1970s.</p> <p>According to (Werner and Kumar, 2003, p. 82), the financial advantage of a strong market position thus makes it a common strategic marketing goal in most organizations. Usually, only market leaders are satisfied to just hold on to their existing marketing shares while the number 2, 3 and below competitors are aggressively trying to catch up with the leaders.</p> <p><strong>1.1       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>With the advent of social media and more than half of the world’s population registered with different social media platforms “brand managers have lost their pivotal role as authors of their brands' stories” (Gensler et al, 2013, p 2). Instead, consumers who are now empowered to share their brand stories easily and widely through social networks have gained a more important voice that brand managers can no longer afford to ignore - even for firms that decide not to actively participate in social media themselves. As a result of this, the concept of Social Media is now top of the agenda for many marketing executives as they try to identify ways in which they can leverage their brands on social media platforms. Social media has become an essential part of online marketing strategy due to its cost effectiveness, ability to reach targeted audiences quickly and generate more leads and sales. A research by Forbes (2014) also reveals that 94% of corporate are using social media and 85% said it has given their business more exposure.</p> <p>This has culminated in a rapid adoption and creation of social media pages on the major social media platforms by a growing number of brands both global and local and Nigeria has not been left behind. This desire to become involved in social media is understandable and the growth in social networks has been phenomenal. But in order to make the best use of this medium it is imperative that marketers not only understand what social media is, they also need to know what role it can play in their marketing communication mix, how the use of social media marketing can affect their brand’s awareness, relationship with customers, product purchase and consequently market share.</p> <p><strong>1.2       RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>It is hoped that this research work will achieve the objectives below:</p> <p>·         To evaluate the factors that influences emerging popularity of social media in the Nigerian service (insurance) industry.</p> <p>·         To identify the social media platforms commonly used by brands in the service industry in Nigeria and its effects on market share improvement.</p> <p>·         To examine the role of social media marketing in a company’s marketing communications mix.</p> <ul><li>To discuss the impact of social media marketing on brand awareness of insurance companies.</li> </ul> <p>·         To evaluate the role of social media on consumers’ effective demand in the insurance industry.</p> <ul><li>To identify the ways in which social media marketing can have an impact on the market share of an insurance company.</li> </ul> <p>Major terms that will be examined in this study are marketing, traditional marketing or media, digital marketing, social media, social media marketing, social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram and Blog, customer relationship management, brand loyalty, service industry, insurance and market share.</p> <p><strong>1.3       RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>This research will be hinged on these questions:</p> <p>·         What are the factors responsible for the adoption of social media marketing by insurance companies in Nigeria?</p> <ul><li>What role does social media marketing play in the marketing communications mix of an insurance company?</li> <li>How has the use of social media impacted the awareness of these selected insurance firms?</li> <li>Has the adoption of social media marketing by these firms resulted in effective demand for their products?</li> <li>Can the use of social media help improve the market share of the select insurance companies?</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.4       HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>This research work will be based on the following hypotheses:</p> <p>H01 - Social media has no effect on the awareness of a company in the service industry.</p> <p> H02 - Social media marketing does not lead to effective demand for a product.</p> <p>H03 - The use of social media cannot improve the market share of a company in the service industry.</p> <p><strong>1.5       RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>Social media marketing is still a new concept worldwide and the use of social media by brands in Nigeria is still at the infancy stage. In the Nigerian insurance sector, the insurance companies blazing a trail in social media marketing are Mansard Insurance and Leadway Assurance whilst some like AIICO Insurance and Goldlink Insurance are catching the fire but at a slow rate with the remaining Insurance companies being totally absent on social media at the moment. Thus this research work will cover these 4 insurance companies with a presence on at least one social media platform at the time of this research.</p> <p>The research questions on which this study is hinged will be addressed with a quantitative research method. Considering the subject matter of this research work, the survey research method will be used with the above listed research questions expanded into questionnaire form and administered on a randomly selected sample size of 250 respondents out of the potential customers of insurance companies who are on social media platforms. This sample size of 250 respondents will be chosen using simple random sampling and will consist of people who are members of a brand community on any social media platform be it Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram or Blog and are between the ages of 18 – 60 years. A link to the questionnaire will be available online and also seeded on popular social media platforms.</p> <p><strong>1.6       SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The major variable to be considered in choosing respondents for the research is that they must have an account on at least one of these social media platforms – Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn and Blog and be part of a brand’s community on these platforms. These respondents should be between the ages of 18 - 60 years with 18 years being the minimum age a person must have attained before being able to sign up for an insurance cover in Nigeria and 60 years being the maximum age an individual must not have exceeded to be able to sign up for most insurance covers in Nigeria. These selected respondents can be located anywhere in Nigeria since the questionnaire will be distributed online and therefore not restricted to any geographical location. No special educational qualification is required for the respondents as insurance is now available to almost everyone irrespective of socio-economic class with Insurance companies now rolling out products specifically designed for low income earners like artisans, drivers, traders, etc in addition to their regular standard policies. One of such Insurance policies is MTN Y’ello Life created by Mansard Insurance in partnership with MTN with a premium of just N15/daily. Finally, as stated earlier, this research work will cover the 4 insurance companies in Nigeria with a current presence on social media platforms namely Mansard Insurance, Leadway Assurance, AIICO Insurance and Goldlink Insurance with the first 2 having the most activity on social media.</p> <p><strong>1.7       SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>A growing number of companies irrespective of industry be it service, consumer or industrial are now using social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter to enhance their brand communication and to promote and disseminate their product information among consumers. The importance of this research work therefore lies in the fact that when completed, it will provide marketers in the insurance sector with relevant information on how their use of social media can have an impact on their relationship with customers which may in turn affect the customer’s purchase of their insurance policies and consequently the market share of their brand when compared with that of their competitors. This is of great importance in light of recent developments which shows that more marketers are now willing to spend more on social media marketing as depicted in a research by Nielsen and Vizu, April 2013 which showed that “70% of brand marketers were planning to spend more on their social media marketing”.</p> <p>It is believed that when this research work is completed, its findings will contribute meaningfully to the existing information on social media marketing, serve as a guide to brand managers in the insurance sector on the use of social media marketing and also provide a basis for future studies in Social Media Marketing.</p> <p><strong>1.8       OPERATIONAL/CONCEPTUAL DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Blog</strong> – is an abbreviated version of a ‘weblog’ which is a term used to describe websites that maintain an ongoing chronicle of information by an individual with links to articles on other websites.</p> <p><strong>Brand loyalty</strong> – this is the extent of faithfulness of consumers to a particular brand, expressed through their repeated purchases irrespective of the marketing pressure generated by the competing brands.</p> <p><strong>Customer relationship management </strong>– is a strategy for managing all a company’s interaction with current and prospective customers as a means of increasing productivity, improving customer satisfaction and retention.</p> <p><strong>Digital marketing</strong>– this is the promotion of products or brands through electronic channels and it is of various types such as SEO, SEM, social media, mobile phones, electronic billboards as well as digital TV and radio channels.</p> <p><strong>Effective Demand</strong> – this is a reflection of the extent to which buyers’ income, perceptions, loyalty/preference and needs combine to result in an actual purchase rather than a mere desire to purchase.

They must react to the competitive threats not only from local source but also from regional, national and international source; likewise they must seek to explore all opportunities that are available in the immediate, national and Global environment. Deregulation has also increased competitive pressure for insurance organizations to survive, grow and prosper. In such a competitive environment, insurance managers must employ a lot of the resources at their disposal as efficiently as possible so as to accomplish the objectives and goals of the enterprise. Management Information System provides information in form of reports and displays to insurance managers and many business professionals (Munirat, Sanni and Kazeem, 2014).</p> <p>Management Information System takes into account integrative nature of information flow as well as the structuring of the organization around decision centers. Standards of performance are part of any good plans; hence, determination of standards like other aspects of the planning process depends on the availability of relevant management information system. Management information system aids the functioning and monitoring of an insurance organization. It also describes the components and resources to ensure the proper functioning of insurance.</p> <p>Management information system has changed the physical layout of offices to accommodate local networks and departmental integrated systems. It is also a formalized procedure to provide management at all levels and in all functions with appropriate information from all relevant source to enable them make timely and effective decisions for planning, directing, evaluating, and controlling the activities for which they are responsible for (Munirat, Sanni and Kazeem, 2014).</p> <p>Moreover, the potential of management information system to provide firms competitive advantage has been a topic of interest to both practitioners and academicians over the last five (5) decades. This interest is reflected in the large number of studies that have examined the strategic value of performance of management information system and its impact on firm performance. This attention to performance of management information system stems from the fact that insurance organizations often make significant investment of time and financial resources in the acquisition of information technology and its services in recent times (Oladipo, 2012).</p> <p>The role of information in decision-making among insurance practitioners cannot be overemphasized; and effective decision-making demands accurate, timely and relevant information. As the numbers of employees, customers and transaction increases in an organization the more it become multifaceted, and the information needed for effective management, planning, decision-making and control invariably becomes more complex (Olumoye, 2013).</p> <p>In the context of insurance, decision-making is the task of every top management in the industry and they need relevant and timely information to assist in taking decisions. According to Lucey (2005), relevant information increases knowledge, reduces uncertainty and is usable for the intended purpose. However, there are difficulties in producing relevant and timely information among most organizations in Nigeria and the insurance industry is not exempted. Hence this study seeks to explore the impact of performance of management information system (MIS) on the insurance industry in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the study</strong></p> <p><strong>****</strong>Intentionally left blank</p> <p><strong>1.3       Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The primary aim of the study is to examine the impact of performance of management information system on the insurance industry in Nigeria.

The claims experience can therefore significantly influence the client’s understanding of and satisfaction with insurance. A positive claims experience may result in a long-term client and champion of the insurance programme. A negative experience, on the other hand, can lead to mistrust and policy termination. Claims settlement is therefore an integral part of an insurer’s efforts to provide good customer service and to retain clients (Rendek, Holtz and Fonseca, 2014).</p> <p>The history of insurance industry in Nigeria could be traced to the British colonial trading companies that established agency offices in Nigeria, on behalf of insurance companies in UK. After the Nigerian political independence of 1960, indigenously owned insurance companies sprang up, which as a result of inadequacy of capital, were unable to pay claims at as when due. This inadequacy of capital coupled with lack of technical and managerial skill, poor insurance regulatory framework, brought confidence crisis and strong apathy to insurance purchase in Nigeria (Augustine and Bamidele, 2013).</p> <p>The rising intricacy of the world economic system in today’s industrial age has increased the importance of insurance in the process of manufacturing and profit-making dealings. Accordingly the absence of insurance will constantly subject the individual/organization to the fear of a huge financial loss in the event of a tragedy and so will affect their decision making course of action in diverse ways (Harry, 2012).</p> <p>Claim settlement is a critical aspect of the insurance business. Insurance on its right is an investment options for common investor. The insured expects specific return from the policy over and above the sum assured. Therefore, the insured or the beneficiary named in the insurance policy desperately seeks settlement of their claims by the insurance company. The insurance company looks at the claim settlement from the different perspective by ensuring adequate return from the risk assumed. Thus, poor claim settlement may lead to confrontation between the policyholder and the insurance company (Ashturkar, 2014).</p> <p>Claim settlement is the defining moment in the relationship between an insurance company and its customer. Butler and Francis (2010) see claim payment as a chance to show that the years spent paying premiums were worth the expense. Hence, insurers have been criticized for their marketing methods, based on cloudiness, twisting and mis-selling. If a company does not effectively handle its claims service, it can tarnish its image hence affect the sales and marketing of their insurance products. Insurance company’s attitude to claims settlement has in the past provoked a lot of public criticism and even attracted the attention of governments.</p> <p>Consequently, the reputation of any insurance company and consumers demand for insurance depends, to a large extent, on the sort of claims services provided by the company to its customers. Insurance companies in Nigeria now wish to improve their public image, and retain the trust of their brokers (middlemen) and clients in order to meet their sales and marketing department projections. Swift handling of claims is surely the way to do it. This study examines the impact of poor claims settlement on the demand for insurance with a special reference being made to Cornerstone Insurance Plc.</p> <p><strong>1.2    Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>In Nigeria, the insurance companies, just like other insurance companies in other parts of the world, do pay claims, yet they have a dented image in the eyes of the insuring public (Omar, 2007). The problem of running an effective claims administration that would satisfy the customers and earn their confidence as well as cause them to repurchase insurance products has remained too long in the insurance industry in the sub-region and the world at large.</p> <p>Claims settlement is like a mirror through which the members of the public see an insurance company. A company, which fails to settle claims to the satisfaction of customers, would definitely attract less business, as it is likely to discourage such clients to continue to insure with the company. Such clients might even advise their friends, colleagues and relations not to patronize such a company.</p> <p>The consequent effects of the above problem could lead to downward trends in sales and marketing figure, low premium income, low capital formation (savings and loans) and minimal contribution of an insurance company to the gross domestic product (GDP) of Nigeria.</p> <p>An insurance company is basically set up like other profit-oriented industry for financial gains while rendering essential services to their clients. But in recent times poor handling of claims has been a major drawback to performance of insurance companies. The menace has been so prevalent that many policyholders in Nigeria often contemplate terminating their policies in the face of the insurance companies not indemnifying them on account of losses suffered. Omar (2007) identifies lack of trust and confidence in insurance institution, poor claims management, lack of reliable actuarial data for research and underdeveloped financial market as some of the bottlenecks to the financial performance of the insurance industry in Nigeria. Therefore, this study examines the impact of poor claims settlement on the demand for insurance in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3    Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study is being conducted with the following objectives:</p> <p>        I.            To investigate the effect of poor claims settlement on the demand for insurance.</p> <p>     II.            To explore the link between effective claims settlement and insurance companies’ performance in Nigeria.</p> <p>   III.            To examine the impact of poor claims management on public perception of insurance business in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.4     Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The study will be guided by the following research questions:</p> <p><strong>1.</strong>What is the impact of poor claims settlement on the demand for insurance?</p> <p><strong>2.</strong>Is effective claims settlement a significant predictor of insurance companies performance in Nigeria?</p> <p><strong>3.</strong>Does poor claims management impact on public perception of insurance business in Nigeria?</p> <p><strong>1.5    Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The under listed hypotheses will be statistically tested in the course of this study.</p> <p>1)     <strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>:</strong>      There is no significant relationship between poor claims settlement and      demand for insurance.</p> <p><strong>            H</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>:</strong>       There is a significant relationship between poor claims settlement and         demand for insurance.</p> <p>2)     <strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>:</strong>      Effective claims settlement is not a significant predictor of insurance          companies’ performance in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>            H</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>:</strong>       Effective claims settlement is a significant predictor of insurance     companies’ performance in Nigeria.</p>                                                          \n\nIMPACT OF POOR CLAIMS SETTLEMENT ON THE DEMAND FOR INSURANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF POOR CLAIMS SETTLEMENT ON THE DEMAND FOR INSURANCE", "id": 53}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>In today’s economy, the financial services industry that insurance belongs is exposed to increasing performance pressures and competitive forces (Goergen, 2001). Modern media, such as the internet, have created new challenges for this industry (Fuchs, 2001). New business concepts, a change in client sophistication and an increasing number of new competitors entering into the market, such as independent financial consultants, have changed the business models and the competitive forces that established financial services organizations are facing today worldwide (Davis, 2006; Shameem and Gupta, 2012).</p> <p>Branding has become a prominent paradigm and has begun to be linked to strategic management decisions of organizations including insurance especially in the advanced economies. The concept is based on the recognition that clients buy brand products not because of their inherent qualities but also because of a bias, a disposition towards the providers. Bayton (cited in Osei and Katsner, 2014), points out that people tend to “humanize” companies, attribute personality characteristics to them, see them much as they do to humans in terms of being “mature,” “liberal,” “friendly,” and such other related attributes. Maintaining or expanding market share, keeping customers and business relations loyal, pre-empting competitive moves, and maintaining a profitable position will depend on differentiation and a unique positioning in the minds of corporate audiences (Van Heerden and Puth, 1995).</p> <p>Sunter (1993) indicates that the only way consumers will be able to differentiate between institutions in future is through image and brands. The importance of having a well-defined identity is therefore of major relevance for service providers such as insurance institutions. Thus, Gronroos (1984) argues that image is of utmost importance to service firms and is to a great extent determined by customers’ assessment of the services they receive.</p> <p>A strong brand helps in creating a sustainable competitive advantage (Doyle, 1990). It gives to consumer a reason to prefer a brand over another competitor’s brand – a reason which cannot be easily copied from other competitors (Barney, 1991). Literature suggests that strong brands are characterized by perceived quality, perceived uniqueness/differentiation, vivid/rich imagery and deep customer relationship (Berry, 2000; Young &amp; Rubicam, 2001). Strong brand help companies to enlarge their market share, increase profits, charge higher prices, build and maintain loyalty, and even surpass accidental failures in the eyes of consumers. Today, brands have become a very valuable asset for a company (Cerri, 2012).</p> <p>An attempt to define the relationship between customers and brands produced the term “brand equity” in the marketing literature (Wood, 2000). The brand equity generates a type of added value for products which help with companies' long term interests and capabilities (Chen, 2008). Over the past two decades, a great deal of research has addressed various aspects of brand equity; brand equity is generally accepted as a critical success factor to differentiate companies and service providers from its competitors. Brands with high levels of equity are associated with outstanding performance including sustained price premiums, inelastic price sensitivity, high market shares, and successful expansion into new businesses, competitive cost structures and high profitability all contributing to companies’ competitive advantage (Keller and Lehmann, 2003; Vazquez et al., 2002).</p> <p>Brand equity is significant in assisting consumers to process information, especially, when the information is overloaded (Krishan and Hartline, 2001). For firms, growing brand equity is a key objective to be achieved by gaining more favourable associations and feelings of target consumers (Falkenberg. 1996). In other words, financial meaning from the perspective of the value of the brand to the firm and customer-based meaning from the perspective of the value of the brand to the customer which both come from a marketing decision-making context (Kim and An, 2003).</p> <p>With growing stress on product or service differentiation in the face of stiff competition, brand equity and management has taken the centre stage in firms’ strategic planning agenda in liberalized global business environment. Since the concept of brand equity began gaining widespread attention in the 1980s, many different methods of defining and measuring brand equity have been conceptualized. Researchers mainly embrace the task of defining the term brand equity exclusively from either the perspective of the consumer or the firm (Das, 2012).</p> <p>Keller and Lehmann (2003) divide brand equity measures into three categories: customer mindset, product market outcome, and financial outcome measures. The first category of measurement i.e. measuring brand equity from customers’ perspective by taking into consideration the impact of the brand on customer mindset have become very popular throughout the world. Customer mindset includes “everything that exists in the minds of customers with respect to a brand (e.g. thoughts, feelings, experiences, images, perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes)”.</p> <p>Insurance industry has been recognized globally as a driver of economic growth and development. The industry provides financial security to policy holders, through the pooling and investment of premiums out of which those who suffer unexpected losses are indemnified (Unachukwu, Afolabi, Alabi, 2015).</p> <p>Today, the insurance industry is characterized by globalization, standardization, fast technological changes and large scale advantages. These changes have resulted in questions being raised among insurance providers such as \"who are we'? and `what kind of business do we operate\"? questions that are closely related to management of identity and branding (Balmer, 2008, Hatch and Schultz, 1997).</p> <p>Thus, the constant changes experienced within the insurance industry have led not only to intense competition among the insurance firms but also making these companies to portray its image intensively (Gronroos, 1990). Also insurance is a business built on trust and the major ingredient that gives flavour to the strategic roles played by insurance in the economy is confidence at such the corporate brand remains a priceless asset that will not only strengthen the already existing public confidence but create brand awareness and association for the industry. It is therefore, more important for insurance to understand their customers and the image perceived by customers of the organization (Balmer, 2008).</p> <p>Brand equity is a set of assets and commitments linked to a brand's name and symbol that adds to (or subtracts from) the value provided by a product or service to a firm and/or that firm's customers (Aaker, 1996). Brand equity is the differential effect of brand recognition on consumer response to the marketing of that brand Keller (1993).</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Even with the understanding that there is an abysmal culture of insurance in Nigeria, many insurance companies in a bid to achieve and sustain competitive advantage in the Nigerian insurance industry seem to be too busy chasing profitability even at the expense of their brand equity. They seem not to realize that competitiveness is not just about immediate rewards but certainly the impression that people and businesses hold about a given service or brand owing to the trust that they repose in it.</p> <p>Customer, analysts, employees, institutions or general public decide when a company deserves their regard, association and trust depending on its service delivery towards the market and the society, and this service delivery is expected to shape the performance of the corporate entity be it an insurance company or any other form of business.</p> <p>Various firms aim to achieve higher customer loyalty, trust, associated increased sales and reduced operating costs which are all benefits of brand equity. This can be achieved through truthful awareness creation or brand awareness, brand association, ethics, goodwill and having a history of excellent service delivery to various stakeholder groups thereby increasing the competitive advantage of an insurance company.</p> <p>In the advanced insurance business clime the management of corporate assets like brand, identity and reputation are integrated into the managerial tactical tools to strengthen not just competitive advantage but to command impromptu demand. But in the developing countries, particularly in Nigeria the significance of corporate branding seem not to be acknowledged by the insurance practitioners; a reason why many feel that the poor performance of the insurance industry in Nigeria may not be unconnected to corporate brand equity. Hence, this research work seeks to explore the effect of brand equity measurements on service delivery in selected insurance companies in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>       <strong>Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study is to find out the effect of brand equity measurements on service delivery in insurance companies in Nigeria.

The past few years in Nigeria have witnessed concerted efforts by the various successive governments in the country at improving the living standards among the older category through Pension system, particularly with shifts in pension reforms, its payments and the maturing of pension plans.</p> <p>It is well acknowledged in the literature that the responsibility of any government is to provide and sustain the welfare of its workers while in the service and after retirement. This is so because productivity and rate of growth are largely and positively related to incentives given to workers. This also has been recognized by successive governments in Nigeria as seen from various salary and pension reviews in the country. However, the essence of pension scheme is to provide workers with regular and stable income after retirement in order to cope with challenges of postretirement livelihood (Dogon-daji and Mukhtar, 2010). Hence, a worker who has worked in a given establishment for some years deserve some benefit which could take the form of pension or gratuity payable to the worker by the employer at the time of retirement.</p> <p>Edogbanya (2013) viewed pension as a sum of money paid regularly to a person who no longer work because of old age, disability, retirement or to his widowed or dependent children by the state, former employers or from provident fund to which he and his employer both contributed.</p> <p>The pre 2004 pension reforms had a number of problems that were adjudged to be against workers welfare, Olanrewaju (2011) and Dostal (2010) pointed out the major weaknesses of the pre 2004 pension reforms to include: Massive accumulation of debt estimated at over two trillion naira; large-scale arrears of unfunded entitlement of retirees; inadequate budgetary provisions coupled with rising life expectancy; increasing number of employers, wages and pensions; and inadequate supervision and regulation of pension system. These shortcomings adversely affected payments of retirement benefits to retirees in Nigeria.</p> <p>Contributory Pension Scheme is a full funded pension scheme that tries to generate adequate funds (contribution) through savings. The scheme assists improvident individuals to save, and these savings are meant to satisfy the interest of the employee at retirement, shareholders, and also contribute effectively to economic development. Contributory Pension Scheme has been identified as an institutional investor that generates long-term contractual savings and stimulates the development of securities market (Mesike and Ibiwoye, 2012). Hence, this study presents a critical appraisal of contributory pension scheme and retirees’ welfare.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of the Research Problem</strong></p> <p>The problems that have bedeviled the Pension Scheme that existed in Nigeria prior to 2004 have made it increasingly unsustainable. It was for these problems of increasing public expenditure/huge deficit, arbitrary increases in salaries and pensions as well as poor administrative structures, that the need for pension reform became inevitable. The problems were further aggravated with the constant political manipulation, besides non-payment of pensions for several years, which greatly lowered the welfare of retirees. Even the promised benefits were often inadequate due to rampant inflation against which pensioners had no protection, coupled with inaccurate record keeping that gave opportunities for corruption.</p> <p>Although the new pension reform is guided by the key principles of sustainability, accountability, equity, flexibility and practicability, there is also this fear that funds or Retirees Savings Account (RSA) contributory can be mismanaged by the existing trustees. Also, risk of a given portfolio determines the return thereof. Some pension fund administrators do not have the necessary risk management profile while some fail to pay regard to rating signals needed to making sound investment decision.</p> <p>In the face of all these, managing and administering contributory pension funds have continued to pose major challenge to Nigerian government. Yet, contributory pension scheme which guarantees employees certain level of comfort in their years of retirement has become a source of worry and concern to employees and retirees in the recent times. As it has become a common knowledge to see retirees forming unending queues in a bid to collect pension payment with occasional reports of untimely deaths due to the exercise.</p> <p>The retirees under the old Pension Scheme are groaning because they are finding it increasingly difficult to access their retirement benefits several months and years after they have been discharged by their erstwhile employers and all these in turn, psychologically affect the welfare and performance of many Nigerian employees in the organization. It is against this backdrop that this study seeks to present a critical appraisal of contributory pension scheme and retirees’ welfare in order to confirm the adequacy and wellbeing of the retirees in Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study is to examine contributory pension scheme and workers welfare in Nigeria.Other specific objectives include:</p> <p>     i.        To examine if there is any significant relationship between contributory pension scheme and retirees’ welfare in Nigeria.</p> <p>    ii.        To investigate the effect of the contributory pension scheme on retirees’ life expectancy.</p> <p>  iii.        To find out if the New Pension scheme is better than the Old Scheme in meeting worker’s welfare in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.4    Research Questions</strong></p> <p>In this study, attempt will be made to provide answers to the following questions:</p> <p>a.            Is there any significant relationship between contributory pension scheme and retirees’ perceived welfare in Nigeria?</p> <p>b.            What is the effect of the contributory pension scheme on retirees’ life expectancy?</p> <p>c.             Is the New Pension scheme better than the Old Scheme in meeting worker’s welfare in Nigeria?</p> <p><strong>1.5    Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>These are statements that would be tested to determine the significance of the relationships between the variables being studied.

The insurance firms as financial intermediaries play a significant role within a nation’s financial system by mobilizing funds from the surplus economic unit and channeling it to the deficit investment unit of the economy. An aspect of the insurance business is the life insurance (Sulaiman, Migiro and Yeshihareg, 2015).</p> <p>Life insurance plays an important role in an individual’s personal financial plan, as suggested by most personal finance and financial planning books. Life insurance helps individuals save money while protecting against personal risks in life. However, research work on life insurance show that life insurance density and penetration is one of the lowest in Africa despite our demography. This phenomenon is evident in a report by the Swiss Re Sigma for the year 2013 which reveals that Nigeria being the most populous and richest in the continent is having just 0.69% insurance penetration ratios – implying that the majority of the population are still vulnerable to life’s risks that may permanently strip away their future earnings (Asinobi and Ojo, 2014).</p> <p>Life insurance is a policy that replaces a lost stream of income that results from the death of an individual (Todd, 2004). Life insurance is undertaken to provide protection to the insured's family, creditors, or others against the loss of earning capability of the insured in the event of his death or serious injury. According to Oke et al (2010) life insurance is a protection of an economic value of an asset.</p> <p>Laying affirmation to the inevitability of the occurrence of death someday Liquat (2006) submits that, there is a general agreement as to the fact that risk is present in all human endeavours as there is uncertainty as to what will be the likely outcome about a person’s action, and there is no certainty however about the exact time, date, year or place when such event like death will occur to anyone.</p> <p>Hence, for the human life, there is uncertainty about when death will occur, but there is the certainty that death must occur.  The need therefore to provide for the needs of one’s dependants after life necessitate the need for life assurance. In addition, life assurance the endowment type may be taken out to provide for specific expenditure in the future and the categories for which life assurance will provide for include the risks of premature death, death, longevity, disability and sickness (Oyetayo, 2006; Vaughan and Vaughan, 2002).</p> <p>Despite the potential benefits of life insurance policies as aforementioned above, marketing of these policies in Nigeria are being threatened by consumers’ demographic factors (Omar, 2005). Researchers such as Delafrooz and Paim (2011), Mahdzan and Victoria (2013) have indicated that demographic factors such as age distribution, culture, religion, employment status, life expectancy, level of dependency in the family, marital status as well as the number of educated people in that country are fundamental determinants of the success of marketing life insurance. Hence, understanding the consumer’s demographic factors and attitude towards insurance and creating a demand for life insurance is essential in facilitating the success of life insurance services (Sharma, Vijay, Pateria and Sharma, 2012; Annamalah, 2013).</p> <p>In view of the above issues, this study examines the extent demographic factors influence the demand of life insurance.</p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Marketing and demand for any product may be affected by a number of factors depending on the nature of the product and the considered utility derivable from it. And for a product like life assurance, the purchase decision arises from the satisfaction that a consumer gains from the increase in financial security achieved by transferring the risk of loss to an assurer. However, such factors as the country’s demographic spatial distribution; covering age distribution, culture, religion, employment status, life expectancy, level of dependency of the old on their children, marital status as well as the number of educated people in that country will be important influences on the demand for life insurance product.</p> <p>Researches linking consumers’ demographic factors with demand for life insurance products in developing countries with Nigeria inclusive have shown that insurance services seem not to have been so accepted enthusiastically. The abysmal level of consumers’ perception and ultimate demand for life insurance products in developing economies has attracted relative worries among researchers and practitioners alike.</p> <p>Moreover, Omar’s (2005) assessment of consumers’ perception towards life insurance patronage in Nigeria revealed that there is lack of trust and confidence in the insurance companies, there is also lack of education about life insurance product, owing to lack of marketing communication strategy that is based on re-orientating and informing the consumers of the benefits inherent in life insurance so as to reinforce the purchasing decision. Some of the problems associated with this vicious cycle of perceptual error have been one of improper building of marketing strategy around consumers’ demographic factors.</p> <p>The role of culture in Nigeria is all pervasive that demand for life insurance is grossly affected to the extent that it defines consumers risk aversion. Now, religion is another drawback since it provides an insight into the individual’s behaviour; and understanding religion is an important component of understanding a nation’s unique culture. Religion historically has provided a strong source of cultural opposition to life insurance as many religious people believe that a reliance on life insurance results from a distrust of God’s protecting care. Until the nineteenth century, European nations condemned and banned life insurance on religious grounds. Even until now religious antagonism to life insurance still remains in several Islamic countries.</p> <p>Indeed, several studies from the advanced economies have found sufficient evidences to suggest that demographic factors are related to marketing of life insurance policies (Baek and DeVaney, 2005; Delafrooz and Paim, 2011; Annamalah, 2013; Mahdzan and Victoria, 2013). But empirical studies on demographic factors on the one hand, and marketing of life insurance policies on the other hand in Nigeria appears to be scanty and inadequate. Hence, this study anticipates filling in the gap by exploring demographic factors and marketing of life insurance policies in Nigeria through an empirical examination of selected insurance companies.</p> <p><strong>1.3       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is to examine demographic factors and marketing of life insurance policies in Nigeria. The specific objectives are:</p> <p>§  To examine the effect of life expectancy on marketing of life insurance policies in Nigeria.</p> <p>§  To investigate the effect of dependency ratio on purchase of life insurance products.</p> <p><strong>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The undertaking of this research project will beam a searchlight on the following research questions;</p> <p><strong>1.</strong>Do life expectancy have any effect on marketing of life insurance policies in Nigeria?</p> <p><strong>2.</strong>What is the relationship between dependency ratio and demand for life insurance products?</p> <p><strong>1.5       RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p><strong>Hypothesis One:</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho:     </strong>There is no significant relationship between life expectancy and marketing of life           insurance policies in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>Hi: </strong>     There is a significant relationship between demographic factors and marketing of life     insurance policies in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis Two:</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho:     </strong>Dependency ratio is not positively related to demand for life insurance products.</p> <p><strong>Hi: </strong>     Dependency ratio is positively related to demand for life insurance products.</p>                                                          \n\nDEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS AND MARKETING OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS AND MARKETING OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES IN NIGERIA", "id": 56}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The history of insurance industry in Nigeria could be traced to the British colonial trading companies that established agency offices in Nigeria, on behalf of insurance companies in the UK. After the Nigerian political independence of 1960, indigenously owned insurance companies sprang up with many inadequacies which in turn brought confidence crisis and strong apathy to not just life insurance purchase but an industry-wide boy cut (Augustine and Bamidele, 2013).</p> <p>The federal government of Nigeria in an attempt to urge Nigerians to patronize the life insurance cover has put a number of policies, programmes and incentives in place without achieving any significant changes in the economy (CBN, 2006). Among the programmes put in place are compulsory national health insurance scheme, life insurance policy for all workers and health care services to the grass root level. But in spite of all the efforts made by the government, the management and development of life insurance policy in Nigeria have been unimpressive, leaving the nation with low industrial production and the entire populace with a low quality of life (Mojekwu and Ibekwe, 2015). This antecedent has forced stakeholders to now look at how to build an appropriate framework that would educate consumers on the need for insurance policy.</p> <p>Consumer education is often considered an integral part of insurance schemes; a win-win solution that benefits both insurance practitioners and their clients. It is supposed to help potential clients make sound choices and practitioners stimulate demand. Insurance education gives consumers an overview of insurance and provides a comprehensive insurance knowledge (Dror, Dalal and Matul, 2010). It can be acquired through formal and informal way.</p> <p>The literacy level of a country can provide a picture of the percentage of the population with formal education and informal education which of course can give an insight of how people in such country are knowledgeable about insurance (Churchill, 2006). It should however be noted that not all those with formal education has an in-depth of what insurance really means, some  of these people with formal education still thinks the best  thing is self insurance which means that they prefer to maintain a fund to cover possible losses rather than by purchasing an insurance policy (Ackah and Owusu, 2012). Research has shown that this set of people practice self insurance the most. A previous study by Garba and Jibril (2011) suggested that lack of knowledge about insurance product and to an extent misunderstanding of the concept of insurance account for low uptake of life insurance policy among low income population in Nigeria.</p> <p>Insurance education can be defined as a process whereby the knowledge of the consumers in relation to the insurance products and concepts, and the financial risks and protection is increased, so that the consumers can make the correct choices (Leppert et al., 2012). Insurance education is computed to give a quantifiable measure of a person’s knowledge and attitude towards insurance (Ackah and Owusu, 2012).</p> <p>Most people in the informal sector do not take up insurance as a way of preparing towards future unforeseen misfortunes, this could be because the perception among some individuals who felt that preparing ahead of possible misfortunes is like inviting evil. Other reasons given for low insurance up-take were the general lack of insurance knowledge amongst the populace, low income level and reliance on God’s protection to prevent calamities (Ackah and Owusu, 2012).</p> <p>Life insurance plays an important role in an individual’s personal financial plan, as suggested by most personal finance and financial planning books (Sarwar and Qureshi, 2013; Bawa and Ruchita, 2011; Sarkodie and Yusif, 2015). Life insurance helps individuals save money while protecting against personal risks in life. However, financial planners and representatives of life insurance companies would attest that many individuals are often reluctant to allocate funds to life insurance and fail to see its underlying benefits as a personal risk management tool (Asinobi and Ojo, 2014).</p> <p>Life insurance is a policy that replaces a lost stream of income that results from the death of an individual (Todd, 2004). Life insurance is undertaken to provide protection to the insured's family, creditors, or others against the loss of earning capability of the insured in the event of his death or serious injury. According to Oke et al (2010) life insurance is a protection of an economic value of an asset.</p> <p>Adeyemi (2005) opines that the importance of insurance education and its over bearing contribution to the attendant growth of life and general insurance practices in Nigerian cannot be undermined. Similarly, Tajudeen et al (2009) are affirmative to the need for articulate insurance education, since the insurance industry is perceived as an indispensable tool of economic progress, growth and development. This research work is therefore carried out to examine the effect of Insurance Education on Demand for Life Insurance.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The significance of insurance education to the demand for life insurance policies in Nigeria cannot be overstated, but despite the role played by the insurance industry to individuals, businesses and economic development of the nation at large, it is well known that people have poor attitude towards ownership and patronage of life insurance policies. When compared with the developed foreign countries, the Nigerian insurance industry has achieved only a little because of the lack of insurance education, ineffective marketing strategies, poor affordability and low investment in insurance products (Obasi, 2010).</p> <p>Several researches cut across the different products being marketed by the insurance companies identified poverty, low per capita income, lack of trust and confidence in insurance institution and lack of awareness of insurance as being responsible for the poor patronages for life insurance services in Nigeria.</p> <p>Identifying the bottlenecks to the growth of the insurance industry in Nigeria, Omar (2007) explains that low level of income, low level of education, lack of insurance awareness, low personal selling rate, low advertisement rate, low knowledge of insurance utility are some of the impediment to customer’s patronage of insurance policies.</p> <p>Other impediments to the growth of the insurance industry in Nigeria include; poorly developed distribution channels, poor capitalisation; lack of requisite skill to participate in highly specialized transactions especially in high value risk segments such as marine, aviation, and oil and gas; unsophisticated product offerings, with only a few companies creating new opportunities and exploring ways of filling existing gaps in the market; inability to attract and retain skilled talents; low technology leverage; and low investment and assets management. Therefore, this research study is carried out to examine the relationship between Insurance Education and the Demand for Life Insurance in Nigeria with a special reference to secondary school teachers in Lagos Mainland Local Government.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The major objective of this research work is to explore the link between insurance education and demand for life insurance.

It is one of the financial institutions in Nigeria today that could aid the growth of small and medium scale businesses. It is on this knowledge that Egeria (cited in Victor, 2013) describes insurance as handmade of commerce which plays a vital role in the going concern of humans (entrepreneurs) as an economic animal. Chikeleze and Echekoba (2008) defined insurance as a contract whereby one party, called the insurer, in return for a consideration, called the premium, undertakes to pay the other party, called the insured a sum of money or its equivalent in kind upon the happening of specified event that is contrary to the interest of the insured.</p> <p>Insurance represents a promise of future compensation relating to specific losses in exchange for periodic payments. Insurers are similar to banks and capital markets as they solve the need of business units and private households in financial intermediation (Victor, 2013).</p> <p>The contribution of insurance industry to an economy‘s growth and efficiency is not the only entry point into its role in business development. The contribution of insurance to poverty alleviation and the welfare of the poor is also potentially of considerable importance. And also, case studies and other qualitative evidence make a persuasive case that the potential social value of insurance provision to the growth of small and medium scale business warrants a great deal of more experimentation with business models and products to develop scaleable approaches that combine commercial and philanthropic elements (Subba Rao and Srinivasulu, 2013).</p> <p>The small and medium scale businesses’ contributions to economic growth and development have been recognized globally, Nigeria inclusive. Ofoegbu, Akanbi and Joseph (2013) agree that SMEs are the panacea for the economic development of many developing countries including Nigeria. They believe that interest on SMEs would contribute to creation of jobs, reduction in income disparity, production of goods and services in the economy, as well as providing a fertile ground for skill development and acquisition, serve as a mechanism for backward integration and a vehicle for technological innovation and development especially in modifying and perfecting emerging technological breakthroughs. SMEs contribute to improved living standards bring about substantial local capital formation and achieve high level of productivity and capability. SMEs are recognized as the principal means of achieving equitable and sustainable industrial diversification and dispersal.</p> <p>Previous studies (Ogujiuba, Fadila and Stiegher, 2013; and Musa and Aisha, 2012) agree that SMEs account for well over half of the total share of employment sales and value added SMEs constitute the most viable and veritable vehicle for self -sustaining industrial development, as they possess the capability to grow an indigenous enterprise culture more than any other strategy. SMEs represent the sub sector of special focus in any meaningful economic restructuring program that targets employment generation, poverty alleviation, food security, rapid industrialization and reversing rural urban migration.</p> <p>Micro-insurance for instance, covers a broad range of financial services including loans, deposits and payment services and insurance to the poor and low-income households and their micro enterprises. Insurance institutions have shown a significant contribution towards the poor in rural, semi urban or urban areas for enabling them to raise their income level and living standards in various countries (Sunitha, 2010).</p> <p>In summary, extending accessible insurance products to facilitate the growth of small and medium scale businesses should be a core part of the agenda of democratizing access to financial assets. When successful programs are taken to scale, it will not only add measurably to social welfare but also hold the promise of generating a more productive and higher growth mix of activities and investments – with a payoff perhaps greater than micro-credit.</p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>In Nigeria, one of the greatest obstacles that Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have to grapple with is access to funds. This is further compounded by the fact that even where credit facilities are available, most SMEs may not be able to muster the required collateral to access such. This situation has led invariably to many of them closing shop, resulting in the loss of thousands of unskilled, semi and skilled jobs across the country.</p> <p>The presence of insurance companies is noted as a noble substitute for informal credit and an effective and powerful instrument for supporting SMEs entrepreneurs, who are economically active, but financially constrained and vulnerable in various countries.</p> <p>Realizing the important role of insurance industry in supporting the growth of small and medium scale businesses, which is also seen as the engine of growth in the Nigerian economy, the government took some steps towards addressing the conditions that hinder their growth and survival. However, as argued by Ojo (2003), all these SME assistance programmes, whether in terms of insurance services have failed to promote the development of SMEs. This was echoed by Yumkella (2003) who observes that all these programmes could not achieve their expected goals due largely to abuses, poor project evaluation and monitoring as well as moral hazards involved in using public funds for the purpose of promoting private sector enterprises. Thus, when compared with other developing countries, Variyam and Kraybill (1994) observed that many programmes for assisting small businesses implemented in many Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries through cooperative services, mutual aid groups, business planning, product and market development, and the adoption of technology, failed to realize sustained growth and development in these small enterprises. Among the reasons given were that the small-sized enterprises are quite vulnerable to economic failures arising from problems related to business and managerial skills, access to finance and macroeconomic policy.</p> <p>Many of the studies on the contribution of insurance companies to business growth were done outside Nigeria. These studies particularly focus on large corporate entities. Research on contribution of insurance companies to the growth of small and medium scale businesses are very few. In Nigeria, most of the available studies on insurance and SMEs such as Terungwa (2012),Ofoegbu, Akanbi and Joseph (2013), Ogujiuba, Fadila and Stiegher, (2013), Musa and Aisha (2012) investigated both variables separately without linking them together. These researches were also theoretical studies whose findings were subjectively based on researchers’ personal opinions. It is noted that the past studies did not give attention to the link between insurance companies and growth of small and medium scale businesses in Nigeria, as well as highlighting effective policy recommendations that can stimulate the SMEs sector. Hence, the undertaking of this research work will fill in the gap by critically exploring the contributions of insurance companies to the growth of small and medium scale business in Nigeria with a special reference to small and medium scale businesses (SMEs) in Ojo Local Government Area of Lagos state.</p> <p><strong>1.3       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The major objective of this study is to examine the contributions of insurance companies to the growth of small and medium scale business in Nigeria.

They do this through underwriting of risks inherent in most sectors of the economy and provide a sense of peace to most economic entities. Consequently, the financial performance of insurers is of major importance to various stakeholders such as shareholders, policyholders, agents and policymakers (Charumathi, 2012).</p> <p>Due to globalization and intense competition, risks are increasing and risk management is becoming an integral part for the success of almost every organization, especially for the insurance sector because of their high-risk businesses, as the risks are associated with every client in the business and their own risk. Insurance companies are in the core business of managing risk (Gupta, 2011). The companies manage the risks of both their clients and their own risks. This requires an integration of risk management into the companies’ systems, processes and culture (Eric, 2005).</p> <p>The risk management process consists of a series of steps, which are establishing the context, identifying, analyzing, assessing, treating, monitoring and communicating risks, which allow continuous improvement of decision making (Ross et al., 2009). By implementing risk management insurance organization can reduce unexpected and costly surprises and effective allocation of resources could be more effective. It improves communication and provides senior management a concise summary of threats, which can be faced by the organization, thus ultimately helping them in better decision making.</p> <p>Financial performance is a measure of a firm’s overall financial health over a given period of time. It can be measured from various perspectives including: solvency, profitability, and liquidity. Solvency measures the amount of borrowed capital used by the business relative to the amount of owner’ equity capital invested in the business. For insurers, profitability is the excess of revenues from underwriting activities over the costs incurred in generating them (Almajali et al., 2012).</p> <p>The financial performance of an insurance company depends on many other factors, some of which are difficult to quantify, including the quality of its management, organizational structure and systems and controls in place. An assessment of financial soundness thus needs to take into account both quantitative and qualitative indicators to achieve an acceptable degree of reliability (Udaibir et al., 2003).</p> <p>According to Njogo (2012) risk management is the identification, assessment and prioritization of risks followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events. Risks can come from uncertainty in financial markets, project failures, legal liabilities, credit risk, accidents, natural causes and disasters as well as deliberate attacks from an adversary. Risk management ensures that an organization identifies and understands the risks to which it is exposed. Effective risk management seeks to maximize the benefits of a risk while minimizing the risk itself.</p> <p>Various authors have asserted that risk management (RM) often leads to enhanced organisational performance. Proper and efficient RM by insurance firms is essential to the survival of most organizations and will generally influence their financial performance. A structured RM approach is therefore essential for achievement of better organizational results (Ashby <em>et </em>al, 2013; Banks, 2004). Thus, this study explores the impact of risk management on the performance of insurance companies in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Whether in the insurance industry or any other sector of the financial system, a company’s risk management procedure is widely believed to be crucial to the success of the enterprise as it acts as a powerful brake on the possible deviations from the predetermined objectives and policies. This means that an insurance firm that lacks adequate risk management technique is prone to fraud, bankrupt, static, experience retardation of growth or even die a natural death a result of sub-optimal performance.</p> <p>Insurance firms in Nigeria over time have shown an irregular trend in performance; ranging from some recording financial losses to some being pushed out of business. This may not be unconnected to inadequate liquidity management, underpricing, management issues and high tolerance to investment risks.</p> <p>While much empirical works have given diverse reasons for the poor financial performance of insurance companies, research evidence on the effects of risk management on the corporate performance of insurance firms in the Nigerian context is scanty. Thus inadequate risk management could be negatively affecting the financial performance of insurance companies in Nigeria. Although prior research studies such as Hermanson and Rittenberg (2013); Kiragu (2014) suggest a link between risk management and organisational performance, majority of these studies have concentrated mostly in banks and other financial institutions and the available studies so far have dealt exclusively with large financial institutions in advanced countries. Little is known, at present, about the influences of risk management on the corporate performance of insurance companies in Nigeria. It is in an attempt to fill this gap that this study seeks to assess the effect of risk management on the performance of insurance companies in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The primary purpose of this study is to examine the impact of risk management on the performance of insurance companies in Nigeria. Other specific objectives are:</p> <p>(i)     To examine the impact of risk management on the performance of insurance companies in Nigeria.</p> <p>(ii)   To find out the relationship between risk selection and financial performance of insurance companies in Nigeria.</p> <p>(iii) To measure the impact of risk management on demand for insurance in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The study is being guided by the following research questions:</p> <p>(i)     Will there be a relationship between risk transfer and performance of insurance companies in Nigeria?</p> <p>(ii)   Will risk retention have a significant impact on financial performance of insurance companies in Nigeria?</p> <p>(iii) Will there be a relationship between risk management and demand of insurance in Nigeria?</p> <p><strong>1.5   RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>1.      Ho:    There is no significant relationship between risk transfer                     and   performance of insurance companies in Nigeria.</p> <p>          Hi:     There is a significant relationship between relationship between risk transfer and performance of insurance companies in                           Nigeria.</p> <p>2.      Ho:    Risk retention has no significant impact on financial                      performance of    insurance companies in Nigeria.</p> <p>          Hi:     Risk retention has a significant impact on financial        performance  of insurance companies in Nigeria</p>                                                          \n\nEFFECTS OF RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON THE PERFORMANCE OF INSURANCE COMPANIES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON THE PERFORMANCE OF INSURANCE COMPANIES IN NIGERIA", "id": 59}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Economists often emphasize that demand should not be confused with need, desire or want. The need, want, or desire for a good or service that is backed-up with the willingness and ability to pay is what is termed as demand. Obviously, in a country like Nigeria where poverty is still a major problem and diseases are enormous, the need or want for health care would be high but the demand may not be as high due to the willingness and ability to pay (Vonke and Sunday, 2014).</p> <p>The success of health insurance depends first and foremost on the effective and sustained demand for the insurance scheme. The growing literature on Willingness to Pay (WTP) for health insurance attempts to address this question. In the absence of real world experience, economists gauge WTP for health insurance by means of the so-called contingent valuation approach. This approach elicits directly what an individual would be willing to pay for a potential non-market or public good (AIID, 2013).</p> <p>Health shocks have non-trivial negative effects on the financial conditions of uninsured informal sector practitioners and their ability to smoothen consumption (Gertler and Gruber, 2002; Wagstaff, 2007). Yet many poor informal consumers in developing countries lack access to mechanisms for pooling risks and suffer health-related poverty in the wake of adverse health shocks. In the absence of insurance, a high fraction of medical expenses are borne by households in the form of out-of-pocket payments, and financial constraints are significant barriers to access to healthcare in many low-income countries (Xu et al, 2003).</p> <p>Despite potential out-of- pocket expenditures, many consumers remain uninsured. One possible explanation for the lack of insurance coverage observed in many countries among informal sector practitioners is that information asymmetries result in insurance market failure, while another possible explanation is that insurance is unaffordable given current conditions (Shemeles, 2012 and Mbengue, 2011).</p> <p>Government and health officials have employed, or are contemplating the employment of numerous policies, such as compulsory insurance for public sector employees and subsidized voluntary insurance cover for the informal sector. These policies are generally meant to ensure formal sector employees, although the inclusion of informal sector employees in these schemes is likely to be an important feature in less developed countries (LDCs), given the size of the informal sector (Nigeria for an example) (Acharya, 2012).</p> <p>However, the primary benefit of compulsory health insurance is the inclusion of all consumers both from the formal and informal sectors within the same pool, resulting in cross-subsidization. By treating everyone equally, compulsory health insurance reduces the pay-off associated with assortative matching, and, thus, alleviates adverse selection, while simultaneously reducing the cost of insurance for high-risk consumers.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>    Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Majority of Nigerians in the informal sector cannot afford and access health care services because it is beyond their reach (Ataguba, 2007). Statistics reveals that 70.2% of Nigerians are living below the poverty line of USD 1.00 per day which encourages the vicious cycle of poverty, ignorance and disease (Usman, 2013). There is high dependence and pressure on government for funding of health services, a situation which the government has objectively not lived up to in recent years. A brief look at government expenditure of USD 3.40 per capita on health as opposed to the World Developmental Report recommendation of USD 34 per capita reveals the obvious gap (WHO, 2007).</p> <p>The continued stagnating healthcare system in Nigeria is of great social and economic consequence, as the deregulation of healthcare financing and supply in Nigeria has further shifted the healthcare system towards competitive market ideals (World Development Report, 2005). Thus an urgent need for a sustainable and equitable strategy to eliminate physical and financial barriers to health care is highly desired.</p> <p>In Nigeria today, old age is not synonymous with disease. The changing lifestyles, high level of competition and environmental pollution have resulted in various health related problems. One of the major concerns facing families drawn from the informal sector thus relates to health care. Health care it is not only expensive but is also time consuming and physically demanding for family care givers (Babatunde, Akande, Salaudeen and Aderibigbe, 2012).</p> <p>Moreover, Nigeria is faced with continued severe economic and social crises; many poor households in Nigeria can no longer afford the basic necessities of life for their members not to talk more of a health care insurance plan that is largely seen among informal sector practitioners as luxury and waste of money. The ability of households to cope with adverse economic conditions has been strained. Difficult trade-offs continue to be made in an attempt to keep households afloat.</p> <p>Many of the studies on the willingness to pay for health insurance were done outside Nigeria. These studies particularly focus on workers in the formal sectors. Researches on the willingness to pay for health insurance among informal practitioners are very few. In Nigeria, most of the available studies about consumers’ willingness to pay for health insurance such as Adinna and Adinna (2010), Oriakhi and Onemolease (2010), Saanni (2010) and Usman (2013) were too brief and lacking depths. Moreover, these researches were also theoretical studies whose findings were subjectively based on researchers’ personal opinions. It is noted that the past studies did not give adequate attention to the willingness to pay for health insurance among informal practitioners, as well as highlighting plausible strategy that can stimulate better patronage of health care insurance in Lagos State. It is against this backdrop that this study seeks to evaluate the willingness to pay for health insurance among informal sector practitioners in Lagos State with a special reference to Cornerstone Insurance Plc.</p> <p><strong>1.3      Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study is being conducted with the following objectives:</p> <p><strong>1.</strong>To examine the effect of household income on willingness to pay for health insurance among informal practitioners.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong>To find out the extend at which consumers’ ignorance is influencing the demand for health insurance in the informal sector.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong>To find out the link between standard of living and willingness to buy health insurance by self employed workers</p> <p><strong>4.</strong>To identify current challenges confronting the willingness to pay for health insurance among informal practitioners.</p> <p><strong>1.4      Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The undertaking of this research project will beam a searchlight on the following research questions;</p> <p><strong>1.</strong>What is the effect of household income on willingness to pay for health insurance among informal practitioners?</p> <p><strong>2.</strong>Will consumers’ ignorance influence the demand for health insurance in the informal sector?</p> <p><strong>3.</strong>What is the link between standard of living and willingness to buy health insurance by self employed workers?</p> <p><strong>1.5     Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The following research hypotheses will be tested in the course of the study:</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis One:</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho:     </strong>There is no significant relationship between household income and willingness  to pay for health insurance among informal practitioners.</p> <p><strong>Hi: </strong>     There is a significant relationship between household income and willingness to   pay for health insurance among informal practitioners.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis Two:</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho:     </strong>Consumers’ ignorance does not have any impact on demand for health insurance in the informal sector.</p> <p><strong>Hi: </strong>     Consumers’ ignorance has an impact on demand for health insurance in the           informal sector.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis Three:</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho:     </strong>There is no significant relationship between standard of living and willingness to  buy health insurance by self employed workers.</p> <p><strong>Hi: </strong>     There is a significant relationship between standard of living and willingness to    buy health insurance by self employed workers.</p>                                                          \n\nWILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR HEALTH INSURANCE AMONG INFORMAL SECTOR PRACTITIONERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR HEALTH INSURANCE AMONG INFORMAL SECTOR PRACTITIONERS", "id": 60}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    INTRODUCTION:</strong></p> <p>Every day consumers buy things. Consumers exchange their money for goods and services, for their own use and for the use of their families: Consumers choose things they think will meet their needs on a day-to-day basis, and they occasionally make buying decisions which will affect their lives for years to come. At the same time, consumers make decisions about disposing of worn-out or used-up possessions. All these decisions and exchanges have implications for ourselves, our families, our friends, the environment, and the businesses we buy from, the employees of those businesses, and so on. And that is why Blackwell et al. (2001) asserts that consumer behaviour is the activities people undertake when obtaining, consuming and disposing of productsand services.</p> <p>While lamenting the critical state of insurance marketing in Nigeria, Osoka (1992) highlights the prevalence of confusion among insurance marketers between selling and marketing. According to the author, while selling is concerned with creating demand for the products that have already been decided, marketing is directed towards identifying the needs and wants of consumers and planning to satisfy those needs. Hence, in this context, the necessity of understanding consumer behavior and how it shaped needs and wants of consumers in purchasing insurance products could be liken to the bone, the tendon, and the ligament of businesses without which no articulation can take place (Gbadamosi, 2000). Accordingly, insurance marketers need to understand the attitudes of customers and prospects to their offerings in order to be able to take informed marketing-related decisions.</p> <p>According to Bennett (1995) consumer behavior is essentially a dynamic interaction of affect and cognition, behaviour, and environmental events by which human beings conduct the exchange aspects of their lives. Now, this position has the advantage that it regards consumer behaviour as dynamic, and emphasises the interaction of many different elements in determining consumer behaviour. This is the main reason why strategy for improving consumer purchase of insurance products needs constant review: a strategy that worked well in the past may not work nearly as well as in the present and future, because the forces that shape behaviour may have changed out of all recognition.</p> <p>One of the present fundamental presumptions for the consumer behavior is the fact, that people often buy products not because of their main function but for their main subjectively perceived value. It does not mean that product’s basic functions is not important, but that’s the today’s role of products exceeds its service limits (Salomon 2004). Notwithstanding the fact that, individuals and groups determines the pattern of consumption, in trying to satisfy customers it involves in itself marketing, some creativity, offering and exchanging products or value that will appeal to the individuals and groups. Trommsdorff (2002) however opine that, there are no activities more important for the consumer behavior other than connected with consumption, Consumer behavior, attitudes enables better understanding and forecasting, not only of the subject of purchasing an insurance product but also of purchasing motives and purchasing frequency (Schiffman and Kanuk 2004).</p> <p>Purely monetary decision making means that insurance consumers expect to obtain some financial return which is a stronger stimulus than the overall goal of protection. Con­sumers (tend to) expect a “dividend stream” from insurance (Krantz, Kunreuther, 2007). From these consumers’ point of view, they waste insurance premiums if they do not collect coverage on their policies for a certain period. Such behaviour indicates that consumers feel the need for justifying their actions to both themselves and others (Kunreuther, Pauly, 2005). Moreover, this suggests that they do not realise that “the best return on an insurance policy is no return at all” (Krantz, Kunreuther, 2007). Therefore, the undertaking of this research study will beam a search light on the Effect of Consumer Buying Behaviour on the Purchase of Insurance Products.</p> <p><strong>1.2      STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM:</strong></p> <p>Research shows that many potential consumers of insurance products in Nigeria perceive insurance as an unnecessary expense, on the contrary, it is a form of investment in the protection of assets, whereas being uninsured is in the long-term the most costly option for an individual, the economy, and society.</p> <p>Now, the wasted time in decision making by individuals and groups and their willingness to part with their money resources is a big setback on sales and performance of insurance companies. The major decision a buyer makes in a group and how his or her choice influences others is a problem in consumer behavior. To undertake and investigate a study of how purchase decisions are taken in individuals and group structure or settings and how this affects volume of sales and profits of the insurance company is still a major problem to researchers. And at the same time, lack of information devices by the insurer in reaching the individuals and groups at the right time and place, to fasten purchase of insurance products is an issue in ascertaining the behaviour of consumers.</p> <p>Despite the growing population and economy, Nigeria is still lagging seriously behind in the African insurance market consumption ranking. The performance of Nigerian insurance industry has been one of sub-optimal. Recently NAICOM data shows that more than three millions Nigerians have some form of insurance, from less than 1million in 2007. However, the coverage rate varies into higher level for property and auto mobile insurance and low take up personal policies such as life or health.  With greater acceptance of insurance products premiums and assets have soared over the 8 years. Gross premiums rose to from less than N100 billion ($502m) in 2007 to N320 billion naira ($1.51b) at the end of 2014 , while assets values more over same period, from N347.1 billion  ($1.74b) to N711.4b ($3.57b).</p> <p>A further look at the insurance penetration ratios in Africa as shown by Oyetunji (2015) for the first half of 2015 reveals that, South Africa leads the continent with a 15.4% penetration ratio, Namibia is having 7.7%, Kenya is 3.4%, Morocco is 3% while Nigeria being the most populous and richest in the continent is sitting at the bottom with just 0.6% at the same level with Egypt a country presently undergoing socio-economic cum political uprising. This indicates that the insurance industry in Nigeria remains largely underdeveloped. Given the existence of untapped potential in the Nigerian insurance market, this consumption level is worrying. The consumption level has been attributed to a number of factors among them are consumers perceptions, attitudes and financial illiteracy (Omar, 2005). It is against this backdrop that this research is being carried out to examine the Effect of Consumer Buying Behaviour on the Purchase of Insurance Products with a special reference to Alimosho Local Government Area (LGA) in Lagos State.         </p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>The major objective of this study is to examine the Effect of Consumer Buying Behaviour on the Purchase of Insurance Products.

In this process life insurance companies act as a vehicle for the mobilization of savings for long term investment purpose, leading to economic growth and development. Through financial intermediation, life insurance product has become a key source of long term finance, encouraging the development of the global capital markets (Catalan et al., 2000; Impavido and Musalem, 2000).</p> <p>Insurance itself is a risk transfer mechanism whereby the individual or the business enterprise can shift some of the uncertainties of life on the shoulder of another (liquat, 2006).</p> <p>Life insurance is a policy that replaces a lost stream of income that results from the death of an individual (Todd, 2004). Life insurance is undertaken to provide protection to the insured's family, creditors, or others against the loss of earning capability of the insured in the event of his death or serious injury. According to Oke et al (2010) life insurance is a protection of an economic value of an asset.</p> <p>Laying affirmation to the inevitability of the occurrence of death someday Liquat (2006) submits that, there is a general agreement as to the fact that risk is present in all human endeavours as there is uncertainty as to what will be the likely outcome about a person’s action, and there is no certainty however about the exact time, date, year or place when such event like death will occur to anyone.</p> <p>Hence, for the human life, there is uncertainty about when death will occur, but there is the certainty that death must occur.  The need therefore to provide for the needs of one’s dependants after life necessitate the need for life assurance. In addition, life assurance the endowment type may be taken out to provide for specific expenditure in the future and the categories for which life assurance will provide for include the risks of premature death, death, longevity, disability and sickness (Oyetayo, 2006; Vaughan and Vaughan, 2002).</p> <p>Understanding the consumer’s perception and attitude towards insurance and creating a demand for life insurance is essential in facilitating the success of insurance services. Perception is the method by which organism deduce and categorize sensation to fabricate a significant experience of the world (Razak and Kasim, 2014).</p> <p>Baker (2003) assert that perception can also be described as one’s (consumer’s) ultimate experience of the world and typically involves further processing of sensory input. In practice, sensation and perception are virtually impossible to separate, because they are part of one (consumer) continuous process. Thus, perception in humans describes the process whereby sensory stimulation is translated into organized experience or percept. Other than that, the processes of perception routinely alter what humans see (Razak and Kasim, 2014).</p> <p>When people view something with a preconceived concept about it, they tend to take those concepts and see them whether or not they are there. This problem stems from the fact that humans are unable to understand new information, without the inherent bias of their previous knowledge (Jessica, Devin and Brandy, 2009). A person’s knowledge creates his or her reality as much as the truth, because the human mind can only contemplate that to which it has been exposed. When objects are viewed without understanding, the mind will try to reach for something that it already recognizes, in order to process what it is viewing (Razak and Kasim, 2014).</p> <p>In other word, perception on the workability and effectiveness of life insurance product may be an important factor that may affect how the policies will be demanded by prospective customers. Hence, this research study will examine the “effects of consumer perception on the demand for life insurance products with a special reference to staff of Lagos State University, Ojo.</p> <p><strong>1.1   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM:</strong></p> <p>Demand for any product may be affected by a number of factors depending on the nature of the product and the considered utility derivable from it. And for a product like life assurance, the demand for insurance arises from the satisfaction that a consumer gains from the increase in financial security achieved by transferring the risk of loss to an insurer such factors as the country’s level of development, in terms of standard of living and availability of medical infrastructures, life expectancy, level of dependency of the old on their children and government as well as the number of educated people in that country will be important influences on the demand for life insurance product.</p> <p>Researches linking consumers’ perception with demand for life insurance products in developing countries with Nigeria inclusive have shown that insurance services seem not to have been so accepted enthusiastically in developing countries. The abysmal level of consumers’ perception and ultimate demand for life insurance products in developing economies has attracted relative interests among researchers and practitioners alike.</p> <p>Risk has been identified as a central fact of life in most cities in Nigeria. For example, Omar (2005) assesses consumers’ perception towards life insurance patronage in Nigeria and found out that there is lack of trust and confidence in the insurance companies. Other major reason for this attitude is lack of knowledge about life insurance product, owing to lack of marketing communication strategy that is based on re-orientating and informing the consumers of the benefits inherent in life insurance so as to reinforce the purchasing decision. Some of the problems associated with this perceptual error have been one of improper marketing strategy.</p> <p>The role of culture in Nigeria is all pervasive that demand for life insurance is grossly affected to the extent that it defines consumers risk aversion. Now, religion is another drawback since it provides an insight into the individual’s behaviour; and understanding religion is an important component of understanding a nation’s unique culture. Religion historically has provided a strong source of cultural opposition to life insurance as many religious people believe that a reliance on life insurance results from a distrust of God’s protecting care. Until the nineteenth century, European nations condemned and banned life insurance on religious grounds. Even until now religious antagonism to life insurance still remains in several Islamic countries.</p> <p>According to Ifejionu and Emmanuel (2013) there are four main attitudes which religious opinion may adopt towards social institutions and economic relations and these are:</p> <p>§  Standing on one side in ascetic aloofness</p> <p>§  Taking for granted and ignoring them</p> <p>§  Throwing itself into an agitation for some particular reform</p> <p>§  Asking for amendment to what is on offer.</p> <p>The Lagos State University is currently having a life insurance scheme that provides cover for its teaching and non teaching staff. But the effectiveness of this policy has often led to some serious debate among the different stakeholders calling for its improvement. Their bitterness is the fact that families and relatives of the deceased go through struggles and prolonged waiting before receiving the entitlement of those who had meritorious served the institution. For example, in the recent time of the twenty (20) staff members of the Lagos state university who died in the past five (5) years, families of two (2) staffs are yet to be paid.</p> <p>It is against this backdrop that the researcher is inspired to assess the effect of consumer perception on the demand for life insurance products with a special reference to staff of Lagos State University, Ojo.</p> <p><strong>1.2   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>The major objective of this study is to determine the effect of consumer perception on the demand for life insurance products.

Insurance companies are important for both businesses and individuals as they indemnify the losses and put them in the same positions as they were before the occurrence of the loss. Insurers also provide economic and social benefits in the society i.e. prevention of losses, reduction in anxiety fear and increasing employment (Omoke, 2012).</p> <p>Underwriting and financial performance are considered as the two most important aspects in the functioning of insurance company. In the present highly competitive and economically challenging environment, Underwriting can serve as a market differentiator and put insurance companies at the fore front of industry leadership and innovation (The Actuary 2014). The way and manner in which claims are managed by insurance companies determine their level of profitability. Hence insurance company needs to employ the service of highly skilled underwriters who can select good risk as against bad risk (anti-selection) and therefore grow the profitability of the company. This therefore indicates that claims must be properly managed so that profit made by insurance companies will be maximized, therefore, maximizing the wealth and profitability which will in turn enhance the public confidence in insurance industry. Insurance companies need to be profitable in order to be solvent enough so as to make other industries in the economy as they were before even after risk occurred (Yuvaraj, 2013).</p> <p>According to Iqbal (2005) underwriting can be defined as a financial professional that evaluates the risks of insuring a particular person or asset and uses that information to set premium pricing for insurance policies. Insurance underwriters are employed by insurance companies to help price life insurance, health insurance, property/casualty insurance and homeowners insurance, among others. Underwriters use computer programs and actuarial data to determine the likelihood and magnitude of a payout over the life of the policy. Higher risk individuals and assets will have to pay more in premiums to receive the same level of protection as a (perceived) lower-risk person or asset(Treischmann, Hoyt, and Sommer, 2005).</p> <p>An underwriter is a professional that has the ability to understand the risks to which the underwritten object is exposed to. This ability is gained not only through theoretical study, but also through the result of years of experience dealing with similar risks and setting claims on these risks (Akinlo, 2013).</p> <p>Treischmann et al. (2005) assert that the purpose of any risk-selection or underwriting process is to place applicants into distinct groups that have similar expectations of life or risk of death at any time interval. They further mention that each group is charged a premium sufficient to cover costs associated with its expected rate of death. Insured’s in each group have the same expectation of life (risk of death), pay equally, and are self-supporting (Teale, 2008). He further states that no group or person unfairly subsidizes any other group.</p> <p>The performance of an insurance company depends to some extent on the sort of underwriting services provided. The performance of insurance companies in financial terms is normally expressed in net premium earned, profitability from underwriting activities, annual turnover, return on investment, return on equity (William, 2004). Over-pricing of risk may lead to fewer customers joining the insurer for insurance cover, while under-pricing of risk on the other hand may result to loss or low performance for the insurance industry (Dorfman, 2005; Teale, 2008).</p> <p>Hence the undertaking of this research study will critically assess the Nexus between Underwriting Operation and Financial Performance of Non-life Insurance Companies in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM:</strong></p> <p>The goal of an insurance company is to be profitable in order to be solvent enough to pay claims when the events insured against occur. This is achieved by using efficient underwriting and effective claims management administration which contributes to the performance of insurance companies.</p> <p>The role of the underwriter in selecting and accepting risks that behave similarly or assessing the necessary acceptance conditions to those risks that differ to maintain the homogeneity of the portfolio has been called for proper scrutiny, since the financial performance of any insurance entity depends on the same.</p> <p>The failure of many insurance companies in Nigeria has been a result of  the underwriter being unable to properly assessed risks and therefore resulting to early claim to the insurance company. As an example, the motor insurance premium varies according to the risk characteristics of the driver and the car. Continuing education is necessary for advancement and independent- study programs for underwriters must be made available. Underwriters must equally analyze information on insurance applications to determine whether a risk is acceptable and will probably not result in an early claim to the insurance company.</p> <p>In order to manage risks efficiently and effectively, underwriters may face the following obstacles:</p> <p>·         Poor evaluation of risks</p> <p>·         Inefficient and ineffective claims management procedures which have adverse effect on the financial turnover of insurance companies.</p> <p>·         Inability of insurance companies to remain solvent in order to settle claims as at when dues.</p> <p>·         Uneducated people in the society due to the high illiteracy in our society make the insurance companies to have difficult problem enlightening them.</p> <p>·         Government not looking into insurance company problems and providing them with adequate facilities for the detecting of fraud.</p> <p>·         The insurance officials refuse to give enough information due to bias mind to defraud the insurance company.</p> <p>It is against this backdrop that the researcher was inspired to examine the “Nexus between Underwriting Operation and Financial Performance of Non-life Insurance Companies in Nigeria” with a special reference to Niger Insurance Plc.</p> <p><strong>1.3       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is to determine the Nexus between Underwriting Operation and Financial Performance of Non-life Insurance Companies in Nigeria.Other specific objectives include:</p> <p>        i.            To examine the nexus between underwriting operation and financial performance of non-life insurance companies in Nigeria.</p> <p>      ii.            To determine how risk selection by underwriters affect insurance companies profitability.</p> <p>    iii.            To investigate the effect of risk selection mechanism on prompt settlement of claims.</p> <p>    iv.            To find out to what extent profitability might influence underwriting.</p> <p>      v.            To suggest plausible recommendations on how to improve the financial performance of the insurance industry in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS:</strong></p> <p><strong>a.</strong>Is there any effect of underwriting operations on claims management of non-life insurance companies in Nigeria?</p> <p><strong>b.</strong>Does proper underwriting and prompt settlement of claims has an impact on insurance companies profitability?</p> <p><strong>c.</strong>There is no effect of risk selection mechanism on prompt settlement of claims?</p> <p><strong>1.5       RESEARCH HYPOTHESES:</strong></p> <p>The study will test the following hypotheses at 0.5 level of significance.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis One</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>:</strong>       There is no positive relationship between underwriting operations and loss ratio in non-life insurance companies in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>:</strong>       There is a positive relationship between underwriting operations and loss ratio in non-life insurance companies in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis Two</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>:</strong>       There is no relationship between premium growth rate and return on investment in non-life insurance companies in Nigeria<strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>:</strong>       There is a relationship between premium growth rate and return on investment in non-life insurance companies in Nigeria.</p>                                                          \n\nNEXUS BETWEEN UNDERWRITING OPERATION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " NEXUS BETWEEN UNDERWRITING OPERATION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES IN NIGERIA", "id": 63}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Background of the study</p> <p>This study examines the factors that influence the techniques of credit risk modeling for life insurers in Nigeria – a major developing economy of sub-Sahara Africa. Credit risk is the risk of default on a debt that may arise from a borrower failing to make required payments.In the first resort, the risk is that of the lender and includes lost principal and interest, disruption to cash flows, and increased collection costs. The loss may be complete or partial and can arise in a number of circumstances</p> <p>Life insurance provides risk protection for low income earners and is part of the growing international micro-finance industry that emerged in the 1970s (Churchill, 2006, 2007; Roth, McCord and Liber, 2007; Matul, McCord, Phily and Harms, 2010). Approximately, 135 million people worldwide currently hold life-insurance policies with annual rates of growth in some emerging markets estimated to be up to 10% per annum (Lloyd’s of London, 2009). However, this number of life-insurance policies represents only about 2% to 3% of the potential market (Swiss Re, 2010 p.9). By protecting low income groups from the vulnerability of loss and shocks, life-insurance is increasingly being spouted as a formalized risk management solution to world poverty and a key driver of economic growth and entrepreneurial development in low income countries such as those of west Africa (Churchill, Phillips and Reinhard, 2011).</p> <p>Over the last decade, a number of the world’s major banks have developed sophisticated systems to quantify and aggregate credit risk across geographical and product lines. The initial interest in credit risk models stemmed from the desire to develop more rigorous quantitative estimates of the amount of economic capital needed to support a bank’s risktaking activities. As the outputs of credit risk models have assumed an increasingly large role in the risk management processes of large banking institutions, the issue of their potential applicability for supervisory and regulatory purposes has also gained prominence. This review highlighted the wide range of practices both in the methodology used to develop the models and in the internal applications of the models’ output.</p> <p>This exercise also underscored a number of challenges and limitations to current modeling practices. From a supervisory perspective, the development of modeling methodology and the consequent improvements in the rigor and consistency of credit risk measurement hold significant appeal. These improvements in risk management may, according to national discretion, be acknowledged in supervisors’ assessment of banks’ internal controls and risk management practices. From a regulatory perspective, the flexibility of models in responding to changes in the economic environment and innovations in financial products may reduce the incentive for banks to engage in regulatory capital arbitrage. Furthermore, a models-based approach may also bring capital requirements into closer alignment with the perceived riskiness of underlying assets, and may produce estimates of credit risk that better reflect the composition of each bank’s portfolio. However, before a portfolio modeling approach could be used in the formal process of setting regulatory capital requirements, regulators would have to beconfident that models are not only well integrated with banks’ day-to-day credit risk management, but are also conceptually sound, empirically validated, and produce capital requirements that are comparable across institutions.</p> <p>Statement of the general problem</p> <p>Credit risk for life insurers in Nigeria has generated a lot of misconceptions and misinterpretations as regards its importance, the best techniques in its modeling, its benefits to life insurers and most importantly in the socio economic development of Nigeria.The confusion of methods to employ in reducing the risk involved with credits to life insurers both on the part of the insurers and the financial institution in question</p> <p>Credit availability to insurers have also been a very controversial issues as most insurers complain of not been assisted with credits.</p> <p>Objectives of the study</p> <p>The following are the aims and objectives of the study</p> <p>1. To know the best techniques of credit risk modeling for life insurers.</p> <p>2. To examine the impact of credit risks on life insurers.</p> <p>3. To examine the benefits of credit to life insurer.</p> <p>4. To examine the relationship between credit and performance of insurers.</p> <p>5. To know if credit facilities are readily made available to insurers.</p> <p>Significance of the study</p> <p>This study will be important to insurance companies in the management of credit risks when it comes to life insurers. This study also will be of importance to Nigerians in unraveling the importance of credit to their profitability. The study will be important to the government and insurance stakeholders on the best method of credit risk modeling techniques for life insurers. This study will be important to insurers in knowing the best method of repaying their loans or credits.</p> <p>Scope and limitation of the study</p> <p>This study is on the techniques of credit risk modeling for life insurers with the Nigerian insurance company serving as its case study.</p> <p>Limitation of the study</p> <p>Financial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).</p> <p>Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

In this regard, not much has been written about new product development in insurance.</p> <p>According to medium, new product development in the insurance industry are not subject to copy right they still represent an important method of stimulating growth of the industry. Insurance products determine the competitive behaviour of the insurance companies and the structure of insurance market. The main focus of marketing activities of most insurance of customer needs.</p> <p>Insurance policies or products have been categorized into two broad groups.</p> <p>1.    Those products/policies which provide protection;</p> <p>2.    Policies which provide protections and investment.</p> <p>These two types of major conventional product are fund in life assurance policy.</p> <p>In products/policies which provide protection the policy holder is given protection for a limited period of 10 – 15 years. Convertible term is a variation where the policy holder is given the option to convert to another type of policy at any time during the policy terms even if his death deteriorates.</p> <p>Policies which provide a mixture of protection and investment include profit participating endowment and whole life policies. To remain competitive, insurance companies have developed a large number of products. Product development means modifying the existing products or developing new ones to suit the need of the insuring public.</p> <p><strong>1.2  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The problems which are intended to be solved in this research work include the followings:</p> <p>1.    Development of new products has taken sometimes in the insurance industry without much results;</p> <p>2.    To determine the reason fro the slowness of the modification of existing products and innovation;</p> <p>3.    To know the reason for the aggressive competitiveness the insurance industry.</p> <p><strong>1.3  OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Based on the identical problems as eh insurance industry increase, new products insurance the study to designed to:</p> <p>1.    To ascertain whether new products differ from old products;</p> <p>2.    To ascertain the level of efficiency of new insurance products;</p> <p>3.    To find out the major problems in the marketing of new products in the insurance industry;</p> <p>4.    To find out the effects of new products on the insurance industry.</p> <p><strong>1.4  RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The research questions which are pertinent to this project research include:</p> <p>·         Are there any need for the development of new product in insurance?</p> <p>·         Do the existing products satisfy the buying needs of the people?</p> <p>·         Are there products which need modification or outright rejection?</p> <p>·         Who are responsible for the modification or development of new products in the insurance company?</p> <p>·         Does the re-packing of new insurance products affect the existing ones?</p> <p><strong>1.5  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The research work will of immense benefits to the following persons:-</p> <p>The research work will provide a source of reference for current and future insurance. Statistician or historians who would wish to use volume of published data in insurance industry.</p> <p>The insurance public will find this research work useful as it highlights the effect of introducing new insurance products into the insurance market.</p> <p>Furthermore, this study will widen the knowledge of students who may embark on future research on product development.</p> <p>Finally, this research work will create awareness to the general public (country) and educate them on the use of new insurance products.</p> <p><strong>1.6  THE SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>Scope</strong></p> <p>The study focused attention on the new product development in three insurance companies based in Enugu selected randomly.</p> <p>Limitation</p> <p>In het course of this study the researcher encountered many obstacles among which are time, lack of fund and so on. The time allows to write this report was too short and it cut in time for other academic activities. Lack of fund prevent the author from traveling to many places to source for materials. Research materials were other problems. Poor response from the respondents is another problem. Many of the staff met feared that if hey give full information their employer might victimize them.</p> <p><strong>1.7  DEFINITION OF OPERATIONAL TERMS</strong></p> <p>1.    <strong>Claims:</strong> This is the demand made by the insured for payment of benefits following a loss.</p> <p>2.    <strong>Fraud:</strong> An unlawful means of acquiring financial advantage of the expense of others.</p> <p>3.    <strong>Insured:</strong> A person or persons named under an existing policy as being covered by an insurance.</p> <p>4.    <strong>Under Writing: </strong>This is assessment of a risk to know whether it will be acceptable or not.</p> <p>5.    <strong>Moral Hazard:</strong> The bad moral behaviour of an individual.</p> <p>6.    <strong>Policy:</strong> An evidence of insurance contract.</p> <p>7.    <strong>Premium:</strong> The consideration which the policy holder pays fro being covered under an insurance contract.</p> <p>8.    <strong>Double Insurance:</strong> Where two or more policies are affected by or on behalf of the insured on some adventure.</p> <p>9.    <strong>Liability:</strong> A situation under which a person is made to pay for certain thing whether voluntarily or by the force of low.</p> <p>10.  <strong>Warranty: </strong>A condition in a policy that states expressly or impliedly the circumstances under which an insured can be compensated under a policy.</p>                                                           \n\nDEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCT IN NIGERIA INSURANCE INDUSTRY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCT IN NIGERIA INSURANCE INDUSTRY", "id": 65}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The aim of this project is to review and evaluate both physical, social and economic effect of the acturist analysis of Nigeria Reinsurance management in development of an economy. This points out how reinsurance policy govern and speculate all over the world and for back as 1324 by the merchant. It as well weight the possibilities of limiting some basic problem and difficulties encountered by a state or firm during a re-insurance policy making. It as well contribute towards the up-brining of re-insurance policy within Nigeria. It also connect so many question and answer which includes the effect which re-insurance policy plays within an open market and some other recapitalization exercise. It as well weights both the merit and demerit of insurance exercise within an open market. So the methodology applied here consists of several outfits such as the primary and secondary data collection mechanics. It ensures mot proper lasting formulae hypothesis.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Insurance can simply be defined as a means of spreading risk. This idea started as far back as 1324 by the merchant who are prepared to share their risks of voyage in return for the premium paid. Firstly, it started with cargo owners arrive safely there will be no payment but if not, the insurer will pay double the amount of the premium to the cargo owner.</p> <p>The development of the idea brought about on increase in the volume of the business which make individual insurer unable to be insured. Then the idea of reinsurance. However, it should be noted that insurance started on an individual basis, but the increasing volume of business in the seventieths century quickly brought about the specialization of some merchant who become the first professional insurer.RE-INSURANCE MANAGEMENT</p> <p>The bedrock of this study is the mathematical analysis and management of reinsurance in the development of the economy. The risk retention levels within a particular economy will depend on the size and structure of the reinsurance market.

The objectives of the study are to enumerate the expected impact of bank consolidation on insurance industry, to appraise the impact of bank consolidation in the rural sector of Nigeria economy. The significance of the study will reveal the reasons and importance of bank consolidation on the growth and development of insurance business in the economy, it will serve as a data for researchers that will carryout related research studies in the future. The researcher used both the primary and secondary data in gathering information for the study. In conclusion bank consolidation has significantly affected insurance business in Nigeria due to the recapitalization exercise that warranted the life assurance business to pay a minimum capital based of N25billion, while general insurance was N3billion. Thus the recapitalization exercise reduced insurance business in Nigeria into a total of 49 insurance companies.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The consolidation experience of the Nigeria banking sector commended as a result of the monumental reform of the banking system which started on July 6, 2004 at the 23rd meeting of the Nigerian bankers committee meeting held at the Central Bank of Nigeria shared his preliminary though concerning the reform of the Nigerian banking sector (Ogowewo and Uche, 2006). The ostentations reasons for the reform according to Soludo (2005) were to consolidate, deepen and enhance financial sector stability and competitiveness. To end a 13 point reform agenda for the banking sector was rolled out on July 6, 2004 with a terminal data of December 31, 2005 barely 18 months. The consolidation exercise having been completed with twenty five (25) banks emerging/form seventy five banks consolidating and thirteen (13) banks are not being able to survive the exercise (CBN 2006) This resulted to the mergence of the much taunted mega bank that are suppose to help facilitate economic growth in Nigeria.</p> <p>The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) increased the minimum capital base for all universal bank to N25 billion in July 2004. This was an effort to strategically place the nation banking system in regional international convex and provide soundness, stability and enhance efficiency of the system. This led to merges and acquisition. Within the banking industry and thereby restructuring the entire system. The aim of the consolidation exercise among others was to groom and transform the bank into institution that investors can rely on, and depositors can trust, play development roles in the nations economy, to eliminate corruption and enhance transparency. It is also expected that the reform will overtime, down size the cost structure of the banks and guarantee higher returns to the shareholder and stakeholders of the banking industry. The consolidation banking system no doubt poses some challenges to both the banking institution as well as the regulatory authorities. This is because the banking industry becomes more concentrated as a result of consolidation and larger institutions also are more complex and tend to deal in sophisticated financial products. This makes them pose greater challenges in case of any failure.</p> <p>However, banks ability to engender economic growth and development depends on the health, soundness and stability of the system, the need for a strong reliable and viable banking system is under scored by the fact that the industry is one of the few sectors in which the shareholders fund is only a small portion of the liabilities surprising that the banking industry is one of the most regulated sectors in any economy.</p> <p>It is against this background that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in the maiden address of its current Governor Professor Chukwuma Soludo outlined the first phase of its banking sector reforms designed to ensure a diversified, strong and reliable banking industry.  Thus, the reforms were to ensure the safety of depositors money, position banks to play active development roles is the Nigeria economy and become major player in the sub-regional, regional and financial markets. The N25 billion minimum requirement of the banks announced by the CNB are to benefits banks that survive it, in a way of holding huge public sector deposit and may be permitted to hold some foreign reserve deposits. Having the target of competing globally but also embraced innovation in their intermediation functions. The surviving banks are molding hope that national economy hang to on them would provide a final solution to funding for the productive sectors of the economy. Arrangement is said to be on that there will be automation process rendition of returns by banks and other through electronic financing surveillance system.</p> <p>The post consolidation era in the sector no doubt has witnessed the emergence of the middle class in Nigeria and significant growth in the retail/consumer end of banking. The consolidation exercise in the country is also to tackle the need for customer derived banking. It is also going to change the shape of banking in the country. They are being tested and equipped to compete with the international banking sectors. It will build confidence on the mergers, in that banks focus will be on electronic banking and eradication of counter banking consolidation of the banking sector in Nigeria is to enable banks to compete globally and embrace innovation in their inter medication functions.</p> <p><strong>1.2  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>The Nigerian banking system has undergo remarkable change over the years, in terms of number of institution ownership structure, as well as the scale of operation driven largely, by the deregulation of the financial sector in the line with the global trend. With the introduction of the consolidation exercise in the banking industry, it was pertinent that to other institutions such as the insurance industry to address the problem currently facing the industry they are low capital base, lack of confidence by the insured and so on. It is also to this end that this stud was carried out to evaluate how the banking industry consolidation could affect the growth of insurance business in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3  OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objective of the study include the following:</p> <p>·         To appraise the role of bank consolidation in real sector of Nigerian economy.</p> <p>·         To examine the purpose of banking consolidation.</p> <p>·         To know the effect of banking consolidation on economic development of insurance industry.</p> <p>·         To enumerate the expected role of bank consolidation on insurance industry.</p> <p><strong>1.4  RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>·         Do you think that there will be some changes in banking industry after the consolidation exercise?</p> <p>·         Does bank consolidation affect insurance business in Nigeria?</p> <p>·         Do you think that bank consolidation will bring positive change in insurance business?</p> <p><strong>1.5  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>·         This significance of the study will reveal the reason and important of bank consolidation on the growth and development of insurance business in the economy.</p> <p>·         It will help individual to know about the consolidation exercise and its effect on the operation.</p> <p>·         It will serve as a data for researchers that will carryout related research studies in the future.</p> <p>·         It will make individual have confidence in the banking institution.</p> <p><strong>1.6  SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The researchers have chosen United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc and Niger Insurance Plc in Enugu metropolis because the researcher cannot study all the insurance and banking industries.</p> <p><strong>1.7  DEFINITION OF OPERATIONAL TERMS</strong></p> <p>1.     <strong>Consolidation:</strong> It is term used by CBN to describe the coming together of some banks within, to become one bank and be able to meet CNB’s requirement for capitalization to minimum base.</p> <p>2.     <strong>Merger:</strong> It is the coming of two or more entities into one through a purchase acquisition or a pooling of interest.</p> <p>3.     <strong>Acquisition:</strong> This is the act of acquiring the effective control by one company over assets or management of another company without any combination of companies.</p>                                                           \n\nTHE EFFECT OF BANKING CONSOLIDATION ON THE ACTIVITIES OF INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN NIGERIA <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF BANKING CONSOLIDATION ON THE ACTIVITIES OF INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN NIGERIA ", "id": 67}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>A close look at the Nigeria insurance market indicate that the sale and purchase of term, assurance policy is declining.  And this decline was assumed an unpro-portinate dimension since the Nigerian’s independence in 1969, hence it calls for urgent attention.</p> <p>This research therefore is intended to provide empirically both the conceptual and operational views of what term assurance means to the insurers, insurance intermediaries and the insuring public.

I looked into the problem that often associates with ownership structure of insurance companies in Nigeria like lack of fund for expansion in order to carryout its day to day activities, bad records of some past insurance companies in Nigeria, the background of the company and lack of governments total supervision over the companies. I equally looked into the objectives of the study which include identifying the effect of each ownership structure and its implication on the policyholder and also identifying the possible solution in tackling the effects of policyholder’s patronage to private indigenous companies. Through the literature review, it should be noticed that work has been done on the classification of insurance business in Nigeria, the development of insurance industry, indigenization policy, decrees, basic principles of insurance and their effects on the insurance industry. prospects of adequate management of insurance companies is also highlighted. The research so far done which relates to this work has been carried out without consideration for the understanding of ordinary investors who have no knowledge of the legal aspect of ownership in an insurance industry. I equally looked into the research methodology which includes sources of data collection. The sources include primary sources and oral interview. It further looked at research instrument used and validity of the instrument. I also looked at summary of findings which include findings and discussion of findings. furthermore, I looked at the conclusions, recommendations and suggestion for further studies. This project tends to review the structure of ownership of insurance companies in the country and analyze its implications on policyholder – (customers) patronage, this will centre on the attitude of owners towards maintaining good insurance customer’s relationship, and how the policy holder claims and pays premiums.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Insurance plays a vital and important role in the economic development of the society. It pools funds for economic losses of the society from where It can indemnify the policyholders should the claim arise at any time.</p> <p>The wide spread of insurance industry in Nigeria was traditionally based on the mutual solidarity that made up the insurance business structure.</p> <p>This work captioned “the implication of ownership structure of insurance companies on policyholder patronage” is trying to pin point the reaction of policyholders over the ownership of insurance companies throughout the federation.</p> <p>It is basical to know if consumers of insurance product, actually prefer individuals managing insurance companies other than government and what benefit they derive from one particular insurance company over others may be due to its structure, activities, good will, aims and objectives.</p> <p>The conglomeration of different insurance companies in Nigeria made the citizens who are well vast in insurance business apply to be shareholders in the various companies which they felt have solid asset base. This is because they fear that some insurance companies do not settle claims as at when due or at all.</p> <p>During the era of Llyods where the insurance business started, people never thought of the structure or the ownership of the business, they are only after their goods, business which should be adequately insured and protected. These problems were obstacles to insurance growth and needed  drastic solutions to combat them.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>Ownership of insurance companies in the federation are faced with the following problems and prospects amongst which are:</p> <p>·         Lack of fund.</p> <p>·         Bad records of some part insurance companies in Nigeria.</p> <p>·         The background of the company.</p> <p><strong>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>(i)     Identifying how lack of fund posses as a problem to ownership of insurance companies.</p> <p>(ii)    Ascertaining if bad records of some past insurance companies stand as a problem to ownership structure of insurance in Nigeria.</p> <p>(iii)   Identifying how the background of a company stands as a problem to ownership of insurance companies.</p> <p>·         Ascertaining how lack of government supervision posses as a problem to the ownership structure of insurance companies in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>(i)  Does lack of fund act as a problem to the ownership structure of insurance companies in Nigeria?</p> <p>(ii)    Does bad record of some past insurance companies stand as a problem to the ownership of insurance companies in Nigeria?</p> <p>(iii)   Does the background of a company stand as a problem to ownership of insurance companies in Nigeria?</p> <p>(iv)   Does lack of government supervision stand as a problem to ownership structure of insurance companies in Nigeria?</p> <p><strong>1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>(a)    It enabled the students to be more careful in obeying the ethics of their profession.</p> <p>(b)    It also directed the investors on the possible areas to invest, and enabled those that have already invested to have the edge to understand themselves better.</p> <p>(c)    It enabled the general public to know the importance of insurance products and how best to obtain policy covers.</p> <p>(d)    It directed the insurance company on how to improve the economy of the insurance business.</p> <p>(e)    It gave the government the possible solutions on how to tighten their belt if there is any loophole in their control.</p> <p><strong>1.6   SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>SCOPE:  </strong>In the course of carrying out this research      work, I went to some insurance companies like IGI, NICON, and STANDARD ALLIANCE, to make inquiries.

Though some employers have established occupational pension scheme while other have not a predicated the value of pension scheme.</p> <p>Those that have not appreciated the value of pension scheme should be encourage ed to do so immediately while the efforts of the  progressive employers that provide adequately for the needy should be emulated. While introducing this subject matter of this project, it is necessary that a brief definition of pension be given. Pension is defined as a series of regular payments by an employer or the government to former employee who has reached his normal working life.</p> <p>This pension payment is due when an employee attains the age of 65 years for all government establishment or at the point of disability or death.</p> <p>According to the law of diminishing return, a stage is reached when the employees output is below the employers input on him. At such a stage it becomes absolutely necessary for the employee to stop working as his efforts are more or less being wasted from the employers point of view. Such an employee security is provided during retirement since there is pension scheme arrangement.</p> <p>Apart from basic importance of providing pension, there are others and they include the purpose of pension scheme which make individual have a sense of belonging, strengthens, and create foundation for industrial peace. Thus, any pension scheme which provides for periodic payment to retired employees with the facility of extending the benefits to eligible survivors of usually acceptable to workers.</p> <p>Now that the policy of setting up pension scheme in any part of the country whether private administered (trust) or insured scheme has been established, the problems which the researcher wants to work on is the management of pension scheme in Nigeria.</p> <p>The problems encountered by retired civil servants because of the use of term in funding method, the effect of inflation in pension fund and many other problems have been taken care by the pension reform Act 2004.</p> <p>1.2  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>The following are problems formulated for the study of the research work.</p> <p>Failure of the public to understand the potentials of the contribution of pension scheme towards economic security.</p> <p>Unawareness of the existence of contributory pension scheme in private sectors establishment.</p> <p>Poor knowledge of the public on how pension scheme are managed.</p> <p>1.3  THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The objective of this research work includes:</p> <p>To examine the workability of the management of pension scheme in Nigeria.</p> <p>To evaluate how pension scheme has helped to reduce the level of economic insecurity at old age.</p> <p>To explain how pension scheme works and different types of retirement benefit schemes approved by pension reforms Act 2004.</p> <p>To ascertain the pension scheme contributions towards economic growth and development of the country.</p> <p>1.4  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This study will be of benefits to the following:</p> <p>This study will be useful for students academic purpose and it will serve as a database for students academic carrying and future research in the related topic in future.</p> <p>PENSION MANAGERS</p> <p>The study will be of immense relevant to pension managers, administrators and customers of pension fund.</p> <p>STAKEHOLDERS</p> <p>The study will educate and as well serve as a means of creating more awareness on the importance/benefit of pension scheme.</p> <p>RESEARCHERS</p>

Similarly, NICON insurance company was the focus as a case study.The most important among the research findings include the lack of awareness oninsurance issues by the teaming Nigerian populations, minimal coverage of theindustry’s activities in such important sector as health and agriculture, lack ofadequate government as well as private sector participation in insurancebusiness, death of professionally qualified staff operating with the industry toboost the confidence of patronizers; vague and intricate operational mechanismand of course public suspicion about the sincerity of purpose with which theinsurance business is dispended, the researcher, hence, proffered such remedialrecommendations as infusion of deep sense of professionalism by practitioners inthe industry with a view to fostering public confidence, inclusion of insurancetraining in schools curriculum right from secondary to post secondary institutionsas mandatory especially for science students, sponsored programmes on pointand electronic media outfits on insurance matters, increased governmentparticipation and deregulation of stringent rules barring the engagement of privatesector into insurance business and up-front settlement of genuine claims as theyfall due.7TABLE OF CONTENTSTitle iDeclaration iiCertification iiiAcknowledgement ivAbstract viTable of contents viiCHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION1.1 Background of the study 11.2 Statement of the problem 21.3 Assumption of the study 31.4 Objective of the study 41.5 Significance of the study 51.6 Hypothesis of the study 61.7 Scope of the study 61.8 Limitation of the study 61.9 Plan of the study 7-8Reference 9CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW2.1 Introduction 102.2 Insurance Companies and their Impact on theEconomic Development of Nigeria. 102.3 Function of Insurance Companies. 1282.4 The Risk that can be insured 142.5 Types of Insurance 172.6 The Nigerian Insurance Market 222.7 How Modern Insurance Works 272.8 Fundamental Principles of Insurance Lawand Practice 282.9 Importance of Insurance Companies in theNational Economy. 322.10 Summary 34Reference 36CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3.1 Introduction 373.2 Research Design 373.3 Method of Data Collection 383.4 Documentary 383.5 Procedure for Data Collection 393.6 Population of the Study 393.7 Method used in Analysing Data Collected 403.8 Summary 41Reference 42CHAPTER FOUR: DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS4.1 Introduction 434.2 Hypothesis Testing 534.3 Five-Year Analysis of the Performance9of the Insurance Industry. 60Reference 63CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION5.1 Introduction 645.2 Summary 645.3 Conclusion 655.4 Recommendation 675.5 Suggestion for Further Studies 70Reference 73BibliographyQuestionnaire10CHAPTER ONEBACKGROUND OF THE STUDYThe developments in our society have made living complex and risky to lifeand properties. This has become so great that the traditional methods ofassisting those affected by misfortunes in our societies are no longeradequate. Therefore, societies call for a more reliable and adequate meansby which risk or any misfortunes can be covered in the future, and here liesthe importance of insurance which safeguard against risks or lossesincurred by clients.Majority of the people in our society today are either ignorant or have amisconception of what insurance entails, what role it plays or its usefulnessin the promotion of trade and commerce. As a service industry insuranceplays a very important role in the economic and social development of anation. In appreciation of this, the government has continued to take stepsto regulate the activities of the insurance business in order to crate a soundand efficient insurance market.Insurance business is one of the subjects that have been securing thepublic in this country. Many people outside the periphery of the businesshave looked at the institution with disdain and they are simply suspicious of11the insurer and their styles of business. They claimed that insurer are onlyinterested in collecting premium and hardly settle claims, whenever theyarise.1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMThe insurance industry is one of the misrepresented or misunderstoodbusinesses in the world. This is mainly due to lack of knowledge on the partof the public concerning their activities. The degree of knowledge variesfrom century to century and is relative to the state of socio-economydevelopment in each individual country concerned, which may in turn begoverned by the level of the literacy component of each community. In adeveloping economy, problems associated with the misconception of theimpact of insurance are not as pronounced as in under developedcountries, including Nigeria.All attempts in developing a sound insurance industry have beenconfronted by market distortions, high rate of inflation, variousgovernmental regulations, unethical practices and fraudulent tendencies ofthe insuring public there are overwhelming. There are a few behaviors,which indicate that the Nigerian public, literate or otherwise, know little ornothing about the operation of the insurance business.12Consequently, many questions have been asked. Should insurancecompanies/brokers continue to exploit the general public as a result of theirignorance about the industry? Is there any need to control the business atall? What are the control measures? These are the questions, which shallbe address my self within the essay together with same brief suggestions,and methods by which the loopholes discovered could be corrected.Therefore, this research work aims at highlighting the various function orimportance of insurance industry to individuals and whole society ofNigeria.1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDYOn a cursory look at the insurance mechanism, it would be seen thatinsurance is a service rendering business. There are special socialcharacteristics of insurance that set it apart from tangible goods industries.Being mostly a contract of indemnity and more so that insurance is acommodity, which people pay for in advance and whose benefits arereaped in the future.Furthermore, the objective of the study is to throw more light on theactivities of the insurance with the view to arousing the awareness of thepolicyholders and prospective ones. This will be achieved by highlighting13the insurance mechanism, discovering the weak areas that need to bestrengthened and recommendations will be proffered for further study.Also the study is to highlight the fundamental principles of insurance, whichthe society has not been able to recognize. This work is made in such wayas to highlight the need for insurance in our society. Taking all these intoconsideration, the following are the objectives of this study:The main objective of this study is to outline the functions, roles andcontribution of insurance companies to the development of thenational economy.To identify if insurance companies are useful to our day-to-dayactivities.To ascertain if insurance companies actually perform their financialroles diligently.To suggest ways of improving the functions of the insurancecompanies.</p>\n\nINSURANCE COMPANIES AND THEIR IMPACT ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THEIR IMPACT ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF NIGERIA", "id": 75}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ANALYTICAL STUDY OF MERGER AND ACQUISITION IN THE NIGERIA INSURANCE INDUSTRY<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Merger and acquisitions continues to enjoy importance as strategies among insurance companies for achieving firm growth, improve efficiency and profitability are among the key benefit sought for mergers and acquisition.<br/>The objective of this research project is to establish the effect of merger and acquisition on the firm performance of insurance firms in Nigeria, the study was limited to a sample of pair insurance companies that merged/ acquired between the year 2012 – 2016. The data required was drawn from association of Nigeria Insurers database, public disclosure and annual report of the respective companies, comparisons were made between the mean of two (2) years pre- merger and acquisition and two years post – merger and acquisition financial ratios. The study use financial ration analysis and paired t- test study. The financial ratio analysis/ t-testing review the dwindling profitability after the merger for all the firm with the t-test showing significantdifferent in profitability before and after the merger. And this indicate that merger and acquisition had has significant negative effect on the profitability of the firm. It is therefore imperative that, merger and acquisition are properly planed, executed and evaluated. Specifically, effort should be made to attract and retain key personnel of the merged firms through performance contract or bonuses. Proper conflict resolution measures should be put in place and conscious effort made to reap the expected benefit of the merger, this is because gains from merger and acquisition do not just occur.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY    -    -    <br/>1.1     MERGERS AND ACQUISITION    <br/>1.2     FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE    -    -    -    -    -<br/>1.3        EFFECTS OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS ON FINANCIAL <br/>PERFORMANCE    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>1.4     STATEMENT OF PROBLEM    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>1.5     OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY-    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>1.6     RESEARCH QUESTIONS    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>1.7     STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS    -    -    -    -    -<br/>1.8     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY    -    -    -    -<br/>1.9     DEFINITION OF TERMS    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>2.0     INTRODUCTION    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>2.1     THEORITICAL REVIEW    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -        -    -<br/>2.2     DIFFERENTIAL EFFICIENCY THEORY    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>2.3     SYNERGISTIC MERGERS THEORY-    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/> 2.4.    FREE CASH FLOW THEORY    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/> 2.5     OLIGOPOLY THEORY    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>2.6     DETERMINANTS OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE    -    -    -    -<br/>2.7     WHY MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>2.8    METHOD OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/> 2.9     TYPES OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>2.10     STATUTORY PROVISION FOR MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS    -<br/>2.11    INSURANCE DECREE OF 1991 ( NO. 58, SECTION 21-27)    -    -    -<br/>2.12     IMPACT AND ROLE OF GOVERNMENT BODIES <br/>    ON MERGER AND ACQUISITIONS    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>2.13    BENEFITS OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>2.14     EMPIRICAL REVIEW    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>2.15    THE GAP IN KNOWLEDGE    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>2.16     SUMMARY OF LITERATURE REVIEW    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>3.1    INTRODUCTION    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>3.2     RESEARCH DESIGN    -    -    -    -    -    -    -        -    -    -    -    -<br/>3.3     POPULATION SIZE    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>3.4    SAMPLE DESIGN    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>3.5     DATA COLLECTION    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>3.6     DATA ANALYSIS    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>3.7     RATIO ANALYSIS APPROACH    -    -    -    -    -    -        -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>DATA ANALYSIS, RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br/>4.1        INTRODUCTION    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>4.2        DATA ANALYSIS    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>4.3     RELATIONSHIP AMONG STUDY VARIABLES    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>4.4     CORRELATION ANALYSIS    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>4.5     DISCUSSION OF RESEARCH FINDINGS    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/> 4.6     CORRELATION ANALYSIS    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS<br/>5.1        INTRODUCTION    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>5.2     SUMMARY OF FINDINGS    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>5.3     CONCLUSION    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -        -    -    -    -    -<br/>5.4     RECOMMENDATIONS    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>5.5     LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY    -    -    -    -    -    -        -    -    -<br/>5.6     RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH    -    -    -    -    -<br/>REFERENCES    -    -<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY    <br/>Mergers and acquisitions have acquired increasing societal importance in recent years owing to the presence of well-developed financial markets; mergers are a common occurrence in the advanced economics of the world, with a particularly high level of activity in the United States. Usually mergers and acquisitions are procedures conducted in order to maximize returns of the firm's or generally enhance their operations.<br/>The rise of merger activity worldwide has been eminent in that with increased competition, technological advances together with increased globalization, businesses are looking for ways to remain competitive as well as achieve non-organic growth (Radovic,2008) organizations are striving for strategies that are not too costly, risky and technologically advanced in order to become reputable along with a vision to maximize market share and future growth (Christensen,2013) growing business confidence, consumer demand and improving economic conditions in the region have whetted business executives appetite for firms in the technology,mining,and financial services sector.<br/>The Nigerian insurance industry is a vital part of the entire financial system. Apart from commercial banks, insurance companies contribute significantly to financial intermediation of the economy.as such their success means the success of the economy, their failure means failure to the economy (Ansa-Adu,Andoh,and Abor,2012; and Agiobenebo and Ezim,2002). Mergers and Acquisitions are continuously being adopted for progressive company competitiveness by expanding market share and also to diversify the company's portfolio as a risk management strategy.<br/>Additionally to enable companies penetrate to new geographical markets to support growth by capitalizing on economics of scale and increase on customer base among other reasons (kemel,2011).The logic behind any corporate merger is the synergy effect two is better than one.Martynova and oosting (2007) state that the overarching reason for combining with another organization is that the union will provide the attainment of strategic goals in a cheaper and quicker way rather than on its own. Organizations are able to merge stand in a better position to flexibility, leverage competencies,share resources and create opportunities that otherwise will be inconceivable. Companies believe that by either merging or acquiring another company,the performance would be better than a single entity. This is attributed by the fact that shareholders, value would effectively be maximized (Sharma,2009).<br/>Acquisitions bring operational efficiencies which may arise from economics of scale, production economics of scope, consumption economics of scope,improve the resource allocation like moving to an alternatively less costly production technology,improved use of information and expertise,a more effective combination of assets and improvements in the use of brand name capital (Piaskoki,2004).<br/>Over the last decade, the insurance industry worldwide experienced a large number of merger and Acquisitions transactions. The economic rationales for these operations include the insurer's will to increase their geographical reach, their products range and benefit from scale and scope economics (Cummins, Tennyson and Weiss,1999).<br/>Furthermore, insurers could have initiated these transactions in order to benefit from financial synergies according to Tennyson and Chamberlain (1998) or reduce the riskiness and/or improve the amount/timing of their cash flow streams (Cummins, Weiss, and zi, 2003).<br/>1.1     MERGERS AND ACQUISITION<br/>A merger is a combination of two or more companies in which the resulting firm maintains the identity of the acquiring company. In a consolidation,two or more companies are combined to form an entirely new entity. A consolidation might be utilized when the firms are of equal size and market power. Companies may seek external growth through mergers in order to achieve risk reduction, improve access to the financial markets through increased size or obtain tax carry-forward benefits.<br/>According to Horne (1991), a merger is a combination of two corporations in which only one survives. The merged corporation goes out of existence, leaving its assets and liabilities to the acquiring corporation.<br/>Kovacich and Halibozek (2005) describe an acquisition also known as a takeover or buy-out or a purchase business combination as a situation where one company known a predator or acquirer takes over another company known as the target firm cease to exist.A firm that seems to acquire another firm is known as the acquiring firm and the one that it seeks to acquire is known as the target company.<br/>Lole (2012) states that in most acquisitions,one firm simply decides to buy another company negotiate a price with the management of the target firm,and then acquire the target company.Nakamura (2005) asserts that an acquisition takes place when a company attains all or part of the target company's assets and the target remains as a legal entity after the transaction where as in a share acquisition a company buys a certain share of stocks in the target company in order to influence the management of the target company. In acquisitions one firm proposes the purchase of another firm in the same industry,where if it accepts,it becomes subject to the acquirers management (McLaughlin,2010).<br/>There are many motives behind merger and Acquisitions in line with achieving organizational strategy. According to Myers and Marcus (2002), managers believe their firm will have a competitive edge by being bigger and through economics of scale,an organization is able to lower cost per unit of output. Mergers and acquisitions are intended to add shareholder value through economics of scale. The combined company can often reduce duplicate departments or operations hence lowering the costs of the company relative to theoretically the same revenue stream,thus increasing profit (Boff and Herman,2001). Another motivation for merger and Acquisition is synergy. synergies can be operational, financial or managerial.<br/>        Karenfort (2011) argues that company will have synergy benefits when the value of the combined firm is greater than the stand alone valuation of the individual firm and acquisitions produce synergy,hence better use of complementary resources leading to geographical or other diversification.This smoothens the earning of a company, which over the long term smoothens its stock price, giving conservative investors more confidence in investing in the company (Marks and Marvis,2011). Other motivation's to merge include increase customer base,gain access to funds,tax advantages,and growth.The study seeks to situate mergers and acquisitions in Nigeria insurance industry. Inorder to achieve this effectively,the study also seeks to uncover the relationship that exist between mergers or acquisitions and the financial performance of the resulting merged firm. In examining mergers and acquisitions and in revealing these relationships, the study draws on financial data gained from audited books of accounts of merged insurance companies.<br/>        The study will enable a better understanding of whether a firm's current approach to management of its operating arrangement is sufficient in aiding it success in its current operating environment.<br/>1.2     FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE<br/>Healy and Ruback (1992) define financial performance as a measure of how well a firm can use assets from its primary mode of business and generate revenues. In addition financial performance is essentially a measure of an organizational financial health over a given period of time,used to compare similar firm's across the same industry or to compare industries or sectors in aggregation. Lole (2011) states that the fundamental aim of merger and acquisition is the generation of synergies that can,in turn,foster corporate growth, increase market power, improve production efficiencies, boost profitability and improve shareholders wealth. There are many different ways to measure a company's financial performance,for example, cash flow based measures,stock based measures and accounting based measures. Companies’ performance can be evaluated by way of performing analytical reviews. Ratio is the simple mathematical statement of the relationship between two items listed in financial statements (Akgue,1995). Through ratios,it is possible to measure the power of the company's liquidity, solvency and its profitability. Profitability reflects a company's ability to manage their economic exposure to unexpected losses. The ratio represents the potential impact on capital and surplus of deficiencies in reserves due to financial claims (Adams and Buckle, 2000). Three measures of profitability are employed which include; return on asset,gross profit margin and earning before tax. Liquidity refers to the degree to which debt obligations coming due in the next twelve months can be paid from cash or assets that will be turned into cash (Mwangi and Murigu,2015).The rise of merger activity worldwide has been eminent and continues to increase at a phenomenal rate climbing from 1.9 trillion dollars in 2004. (Susan catwright and Schoenberg, 2006)<br/>1.3 EFFECTS OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE<br/>Mergers and acquisitions are used in improving company's competitiveness and gaining competitive advantage over other firms through gaining greater market share,broadening the portfolio to reduce business risk, entering new markets and geographic and capitalizing an economics of scale (Saboo and Gopi,2009). The success of any mergers is defined by the core competencies generated to create value or enhance value. It is measured using the parameters such as market attractiveness, competitive positioning because of cost leadership and product differentiation. This results in the long-term profit sustainability and the creation of shareholders wealth (Huderbrandt, 2005).A long term decline in shareholders wealth after a merger and acquisition can term the combination process to be a failure (Straub,2007). Managers of firm's undertaking mergers and acquisitions offer anticipate an improvement in production efficiency. However, profitability still remains the most influential variable in determining growth of firm's through merger and acquisition in Nigeria.The main motive behind merger and acquisition is to improve revenues and profitability (Gachanja, 2013).<br/>1.4 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>The world is in a state of regression being influenced by the forces of globalization and fast technological changes and as a result firms are facing intense competition.Merger and Acquisition to firm's performance has been little developed. Hence how mergers influence firm's performance lacks empirical backing as the few studies that have been conducted on the same provide mixed results, mergers are on an increasing trend in the Nigeria insurance industry. As per republic of Nigeria budget statement for the fiscal year 2012/2013,the trend globally is towards converging of financial services where banking, insurance and stock brokerages are being offered under one roof.In addition, insurance companies to have consolidated supervision to enhance oversight in this part of the financial system and itsplayers.<br/>1.5     OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>To analyze the effects of mergers and acquisitions on the financial performance of insurance companies.<br/>This analysis will therefore give an insight into mergers and acquisitions in insurance Companies on the financial performance.<br/>It is also the objective of this research work to show the recapitalization and profitability of insurance companies in Nigeria.<br/>1.6     RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>Do mergers and acquisitions contribute positively towards the financial performance of insurance companies?<br/>What are the relationship between mergers and acquisitions in insurance companies?<br/>Are the effects of mergers and acquisitions on financial performance of insurance companies made it to be unprofitable?<br/>1.7     STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS<br/>Neeka igbara (2004), posit that it is a statement of the expected relationship between independent dependent variables. In light of the above, the findings May be true and accepted or not true and rejected. The null hypothesis is denoted by Ho, while the alternative is denoted by  <br/>The hypothesis of the study will therefore read as follows<br/>Ho: mergers and acquisitions does not contribute positive towards the financial performance of insurance companies.<br/>H1: mergers and acquisitions contribute positively towards the financial performance of insurance companies.<br/>Ho: There is no relationship between mergers and acquisitions in insurance Companies?<br/>H1: There is a relationship between mergers and acquisitions in insurance companies.<br/>Ho: The effects of mergers and acquisitions on financial performance of insurance companies made it not to be unprofitable.<br/>H1: The effects of mergers and acquisitions on financial performance of insurance companies made it to be unprofitable.<br/>1.8     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>Very few studies have been conducted on mergers and acquisitions besides the same having generated inconclusive and mixed results. This study would therefore be of interest to scholars, customers (policy holders), shareholders, employees, managers, the regulator, reinsurers and government.<br/>To the scholar the study would be a source of empirical reference and literature review;it will provide a ground of further research to the scholar.<br/>To the policy holder, mergers can create monopolies and affect customer welfare through reduction of competition and hence unfair prices to the policy holder. Thus the study will bring out the positives and negatives and enable policy holder’s welfare union e.g. the policy holder compensation fund for insurance companies to air their views when faced with a merger.<br/>To the regulator, the study will help theInsurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) understand how better to mitigate the risks that engrosses the insurance industry in Nigeria.<br/>To the shareholders the study will help to widen their knowledge when faced with decision on mergers and acquisitions.<br/>To the employees the study will enable will enable them to assess the stability of the firm and hence their job security. To the managers the study will enable them understand the importance of engaging in joint operations which will put the merged entity in a competitive position not only in Nigeria but also across borders, covering the Wider region which no will in turn enable that company effectively mitigate risk (especially political risk) and boost profitability. <br/>To the reinsurer the study will enable them understand the need of increased underwriting capacity, treaty and facultative as a result of increased capacity of its underlying underwriter as a consequence of the merger.<br/>1.9     DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>MERGER: A merger connotes the combination of two companies into one larger company for some economic or other strategic reasons.it is defined as a transaction in which corporation of relatively equal size combine. Sherman and Hart describe a merger as a combination of two or more companies in which the assets and liabilities of the selling firms are absorbed by the buying firm.<br/>ACQUISITION: the term acquisition has been described to mean a transaction in which a large corporation purchases a small corporation.it could be the purchase of an asset such as a plant,a division or even an entire company.<br/>MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS: it has been referred to as the aspect of corporate strategy, corporate finance and management dealing with the buying, selling,and combining of different companies that can aid,or finance,or help a growing company in a given industry grow rapidly without having to create another business entity.<br/>INSURANCE: insurance can be defined as a system of to make large financial losses more affordable by pooling the risks of many individuals and business entities and transferring them to an insurance company or other large groups in return for a premium.<br/><br/>\n\nANALYTICAL STUDY OF MERGER AND ACQUISITION IN THE NIGERIA INSURANCE INDUSTRY <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANALYTICAL STUDY OF MERGER AND ACQUISITION IN THE NIGERIA INSURANCE INDUSTRY ", "id": 76}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE ROLE OF INSURANCE COMPANY IN NIGERIA AS NON-BANKING FINANCIAL INSTITUTION: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS: <br/>A CASE STUDY OF LIMITED NIGERIA INSURANCE COMPANY (UNIC)  <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This study attempt to provide a general information and knowledge about the impact of insurance companies in the business world. A case study of business organization in Benin City. The scope of the research is based on principally on their (insurers) impact o businessmen, individual and business world. There are set down objectives for this study, and to achieve those, set down objectives questionnaires and oral interview and retrieving of some secondary data from books, journals, newspapers, to collect useful information was undertaken. The data were analyzed and findings were made which revealed that the Nigeria insurance company has failed the Nigeria populace in terms of the provision of the insurance services. Some of such failures are non-payment or settlement of claims by capitalizing on the ignorance of their legal right and genuine development and expansion of business forms. Also from the findings, policy recommendations were made to insurance companies so as to regain their public fast fading confidence on them.     <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE   <br/>Introduction<br/>Background of the study<br/>Statement of the problems<br/>Purpose of the study<br/>Significance of the study<br/>Research questions<br/>Scope of the study<br/>Limitation of the study<br/>CHAPTER TWO <br/>Literature review<br/>CHAPTER THREE         <br/>Methodology<br/>Research design<br/>Population of the study<br/>Sample of the study<br/>Instrumentation<br/>Validation of instrument<br/>Method of data collection<br/>Method of data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR <br/>Discussion of results<br/>CHAPTER FIVE  <br/>Summary and conclusions<br/>Recommendation<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY          <br/>QUESTIONNAIRE<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1    INTRODUCTION<br/>        Insurance in its modern form was first introduced into Nigeria by the British long before the arrival of the British a lot of organized trading activities was going on in the Nigeria territory, but there was no organized insurance business, as we know it today. The first insurance company to have a full branch office in Nigeria was the Royal Exchange Assurance. It opened its first office in Lagos in 1921 and until 1949 it practically dominated insurance business in the country. Therefore, there was high degrees of awareness of the importance of insurance services to the economic growth and business world particularly in Edo State and Nigeria in general. At the end of 1989 to 1998, insurance companies were operating as registered companies in Nigeria and most are indigenous. The leading indigenes insurance company in Nigeria is the National Insurance Cooperation of Nigeria (NICON) which is fully owned by the Federal Government of Nigeria which underwrites about 25% of the total insurance business in Nigeria.<br/>        Some of the objectives of the company is to encourage commercial houses, cooperation’s and companies to go into ventures by giving them cover against possible losses. It also encourages the spirit of savings by way of life assurance which provides benefits for the dependent, in case of untimely death of the assured. The board is run by experienced men and a set of businessmen and it headed by a chairman. The management of the company is completely Nigerianised (i.e. Nigerians) as mentioned before. The chief executive is the general manager who directly responsible to the board of directors. He supervised day-to-day running of the company and he is assisted by experienced and able senior management staffs who are in charge of finance, administration, life and pension and technical department. This was however, attributed to government stringent economic measure and poor economic situations of the country.

This awareness brought a boom to the insurance industry. It was during this period of boom in the insurance company that UNIC insurance company limited came into existence in Benin City. One of the main objective of the UNIC insurance company is to increase investment and better public awareness of the benefit of insurance to society at large. In the first two years of its inception the UNIC insurance company incurred net losses of N10, 000 and N54, 000 respectively of course, this was the formative years, then followed a period of modest growth and success during which profit were recorded. But between 1989 and 1991, there was a succession of high loss margin. This was however attributed to government stringent economic measures and poor economic situation of the country. However, UNIC insurance company offers all types of insurance protection. Some of the demerit of the UNIC insurance company is that poor public awareness regarding the principle of insurance has not helped, and even among those Nigerians that do know the benefits of insurance cover, there remains a widespread perception that Nigerian insurance are reluctant to settle claims.   <br/>1.3    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM  <br/>          The Nigeria insurance company has been described as undeveloped when compare with those in the developed countries. For some time now. Nigeria insurance company has be subjected to explosive criticism from economic, commercial educationist, even professionals in insurance field etc. so, many accusation have been levied against the insurance companies. The most common of such criticism is the one which relates to settlement of claims majority of the insurance companies customers and non-customers alike have been feeling dissatisfied about settlement of claims as many of them would say. When it comes to their (insurer) turn to pay claims, they will flimsy excuses.<br/>1.4    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY     <br/>          The fundamental and cardinal objectives of this study are to critically examine and determine the impact of insurance companies in the business world.

Among income earners, only a few have small proportion of their disposable income as savings. This small amount which cannot be used for any meaningful investment project, can be saved through insurance contract or policy. This small amount of money from many insurance policy holders are pooled together which form a pool of investment loan.<br/>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY    <br/>        The scope of the study is limited to the role of insurance companies in the business world especially in Edo State. Also, since Edo State is a very large state with local government areas, the researcher confined herself to Benin City, being the capital and a true representation of the whole state. Furthermore, since there is a large number of insurance companies in Benin City, a sample number of two insurance companies operating in the state capital we be chosen for source of data collection.<br/>1.8    DEFINITION OF TERMS     <br/>        This sub-section becomes imperative due to usage of technical terms or words that are either unfamiliar or are capable of having more than one meaning.

Research has shown that there is a significant relationship between the extent to which one understands and the importance one attaches to insurance. The more clear and understandable one finds insurance to be and the more likely it is that the insurance intermediaries will be know the importance of insurance before the facilitators can be recognized. This shows that low level of literacy constitutes to the problems encountered by the insurance intermediaries. Because the intermediaries work for the insurance company, any problem that affects the company affects them.<br/>            The experience of some people who had be dealings with insurance over the years ha snot be very cordial such unfavourable relationship had been publicize over the years that it has created a poor perception of insurance intermediaries and the insurance companies to the general public. Insurance have not help issues by their reticent in publishing their activities. One has to be aware of insurance before one makes a conscious effort to understand what it is all about.  The insurance industry has the duty to create awareness of the existences of their intermediaries and their industry in the minds of the public.<br/>            Individual insurance companies have the responsibility of letting the public know that its intermediaries exist and what functions they perform. Literature such as one of the roles of insurance companies and intermediaries to individuals and the society in general should be widely circulated.<br/>            Handling of insurance claim is another area were insurance intermediaries encounter problem. This is obvious because when an insurance company could not settle her claim with the insured (policyholder) the impact fall on the intermediaries that facilitate contractual relationship between the insured and the insurance company. This makes the general public to call both the intermediaries and insurance companies fraudsters. A good insurance transaction lies essentially on the ease with which are insurer claim cheque is received. Claims handling is one area were an effective communication is necessary, as well as reaching prompt decision immediately all facts are known. The inability of the insurance companies to do this makes it difficult for an intermediary to help his clients in sorting out their claim with the company.<br/>Location of the insurance company also is one of the problems encountered by intermediaries because they find it difficult to transact business in rural area. There is no comparison between an insurance company situated in the city and that of rural area. Insurance company situated in a rural area might not be progressing because of the low level of literacy of people in the area. <br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>The image of insurance industry and their intermediaries is noting to write home about. This is to those who do not know what insurance is all about. Having complied with the rules and regulations of the insurance supervisory authorities in which they operate, though there are still problems in the insurance companies and the among them are as follows.<br/>(a)                Ineffective publicity, lack of information about different classes of insurance and benefits behinds each classes of insurance to the policyholder is acting as one of the problems being encountered by the insurance companies and their intermediaries.<br/>(b)               Public unawareness of the essence of insurance takes time for the brokers and agents to be known in the public. Many of our people today are still ignorance of what insurance is all about and this is really telling on the insurance companies.<br/>(c)                Location of the insurance company is one of the problems being encountered by insurance intermediaries.<br/>(d)               The find it difficult to transact business in a small area. Take for instance, an insurance company whose Head office is at Ngwo will be loosing a lot while other competitors situated in the city such as Lagos are progressing.<br/>(e)                Competition among the brokers and agents by using unorthodox method which is due to variation in rates. There has been always difficult among these intermediaries. Another problem is what affects the insurance companies also affect them.<br/>1.3       OBJECTIVE OF STUDY<br/>This study is aimed at achieving the following objectives.<br/>1.                  To find out the causes of the problem that  the intermediaries encounter.<br/>2.                  The important of intermediaries in the insurance industry.<br/>3.                  Who are insurance intermediaries.<br/>4.                  To make suggestion on how to eradicate the problem.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY <br/>The study will be of immense value to brokerage firm, the insurance companies, the general public and to student of insurance and other related fields. <br/>The work will be of immense help to future researchers who will make their own investigation into this subject area.<br/>The study will reveal the important of these intermediaries to the insurance company. Having mentioned some of the  jobs done by the intermediaries, there are other areas by which they are useful to the company.<br/>1.5              SCOPE  <br/>The area of this thesis is Nigeria. The research is to find out the problems encountered by intermediaries and the causes. <br/>1.6       DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Brokers:         Person who buys and sells for others. And regarded as professional expert. The gives advice and recommends to people.<br/>Agent: Person who acts for or who manages the business affairs of other.<br/>Premium:                   A little consideration which the insured pays to the insurer in view of the risk insured so that if loss occur the insurer will put the insured in the same financial position he was before the loss.<br/>Insured:          The party entitled to receive money under an assurance contract on the happening of a stated contingency.<br/>Liability:         State of being liable or responsibility for an act. <br/><br/>\n\nTHE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY INTERMEDIARIES IN THE NIGERIA INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND THE FUTURE PROSPECTS.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY INTERMEDIARIES IN THE NIGERIA INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND THE FUTURE PROSPECTS.", "id": 78}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>MANAGEMENT OF INSURANCE COMPANIES IN NIGERIA A CASE STUDY OF UNIC INSURANCE PLC<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This research work was aimed at determining the impact on management of insurance companies in Nigeria with particular reference to UNIC INSURANCE PLC <br/>            A structured questionnaire made up of a little combination of some dictatorship and open ended questions was developed and distributed to a total of 80 male and female employees of UNIC INSURANCE PLC.<br/>            The data collected were analyzed using percentages, mean   and rank order.

The insurance company undertake numerous activities in their operation usually assessing the extent to which the risk presented in any respect departs from normal and if so, to what extent additional hazard can be mitigated at what rating consideration.  A process known as premium rating is used to decide vohat price you should change to. The premium price should reflect the claims list and expenses associated with the contract but also include an allowance for the insurer profit margin, this allowance depends on the level of competition in the relevant insurance market.  <br/>Like every other business if the insurance companies want to increase the amount of business they undertake (at the right price) and attempt to do this involves different system since company differ in their degree of reliance on a direct sales force rather than using brokers and also in the amount they spend on advertising.  Also insurance company cannot pay all claims out of revenuer received for premium and investment income, because the timing of these payments and receipts cannot be co-coordinated, they must therefore maintain a fund that can be used to pay claims, such funds are also necessary in the case claims are unexpectedly large.  In many classes of insurance fund are accumulated carefully investment of these funds will allow insurers to earn interest income and make capital again.<br/>    More so, the insurers may be aware that certain potential claims payment may exceed his financial resources.  He will therefore wish to pass on some of the liabilities for the claims to another insurer by buying insurance like other enterprise, insurers make payment to creditors (claims to insure commission agents) and receive money from debtor (such as premiums) They ought then compile accounts for internal management, shareholders and the taxation and supervisory authorities. A major problem with these is that insurers liabilities that the potential claims payments may not be know and must therefore be estimated.  Insurance companies must pay co-corporate with tax value added tax and capital gain tax.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>    i       Based on the fact that every successful company      weather profit or non-profit oriented in Nigeria lies on its management.<br/>ii.         Secondly goes majority of Nigerians do not appreciate         the       role insurance industry pay in the economic         development of this country.<br/>            iii.        Another striking factor that off this research work is                                     the fact that our people appear not to understand the              impact insurance could have in national development.<br/>            v.         There is also the problem of non-challant attitude of                         most    Nigerians in embracing the idea of insurance                                 coverage as one of the veritable instrument for the                            national development in developing countries. It is                             therefore on the foregoing premise that this research                         work is necessary in the first instance.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>1.                  To what extent does insurance in Nigeria helps in solving economic problems in building of the nation<br/>2.                  To what extent does the non-challant attitudes of some people affect nation development.<br/>3.                  To what extent does is the usefulness of insurance of the manage management; serve as a reference point for the self-help and self-reliance. <br/>4.                  To what extent has Government gone to curb the problems associated with insurance management as regards development?

This reinforcement became imperative given the up surge in the member of licensed bank following the adoption in addition to this, there  was also the long term need to create and sustain an enabling environment that will engender sate and sound banking practices by protecting the banking system against destruction runs, protecting bank deposit (especially those of small savers) and ensuring fair play amongst the competing banks. These cardinal consider actions were rein formed by the lesson of history of bank features in Nigeria, the experience of other countries where deposit insurance scheme are being operated and there alive of the prevailing distressed financial condition of the bank in particular and other financial intermediaries in the financial sector in general.<br/>          A collaborative study of distress in the Nigeria financial sector was conducted by the corporation and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and its finding corroborated the earlier held view that distress among the Nigeria Banks was precipitated by a complex set of interrelated problems that had for long afflicted the industry. These include poor management, capital inadequacy, poor lending etc.<br/>         Ever since its establishment the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) has consistent with its mandate as provided in NDIC decree. Continued to ensure safe and sound banking system. The sanitization of the banking sector has remained the primary focus of the corporation’s activities through the adoption of appropriate failure resolution options and effective implement action of various laws. Promulgate by the government to stem the hide of distress in the system. This understandably, was because might from its inception the corporation has had to contend with insuring insolvent banks. <br/>            The corporations effort and out standing challenges in this regard are reviewed in this term paper and organized as follows after this introduction. Chapter 1, 1.1 talks about background of the study, 1.2statement of the problem, 1.3 purpose/objective of the study,1.4 significance of the stubby.1.5 limitation of the study. Chapter2 presents the review of related literature. Chapter 3, 3.0 Research design and methodology 3.1 sources of data (secondary sources only, 3.2 location of data, 3.3 method  of data collection (literature work only) Chapter 4, 4.0 findings.<br/>               Conclusively, there are chapter  5, which is the last chapter of the term paper. It talks summary while 5.1 is the recommendations and lastly 5.2 which presents conclusion before the bibliography.<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF NIGERIANS DEPOSIT INSTURANCE CORPORATION<br/>            The Federal Military Government Decree No. 22 the 15th June 1988. “There is hereby established a body to be known as the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (hereinafter in this Decree referred to as “the corporation”).  This corporation is out to insure bank deposits thereby helping to promote safe and sound banking system in Nigeria, protect depositors interest and further inculcate banking habit amongst Nigerians.<br/>            NDIC in an autonomous supervisory body with powers among others, to examine the books and affairs of insured banks and other deposit taking financial institutions operating n Nigeria, to insure their total deposit liabilities with NDIC with the exception of insider deposits, ie deposits belonging to the Board members and staff of the insured bank, deposits used as collateral and such other deposits Borad of NDIC may exempt from time to time.<br/>            Deposit insurance is financial guarantee instituted as a measure of safety for the banking system to protect depositors.  Deposit insurance promotes the stability of the banking system.  It assures the saver that his funds are safe, and that the failure of one bank does not mean that all banks are in danger of failing.  The authorized capital of the corporation is N1000M (One thousand million Naira) out of which N50m (fifty million naira) has already been called and paid up by the federal government of Nigeria to establish the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC).<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>            In light of the vital role which the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) play in developing the national economy in their capacity as vector of revamping distress banks, investment and employment opportunities it will be expedient to point out that the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) in all its advancement and sophistication has not succeeded yet in effectively achieving this mission.  The reason is not just one of the fact some banks have failed, but that same.<br/>            Factors have continued to mediate against the successful performance of the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation.  The problem of economic under-development in Nigeria can arguably traced to the fact that NDIC have not been as efficient as they ought to be.  But then a number of factors have been responsible for the conditions in which NDIC have found themselves today.<br/>            The causes of inefficient of the Nigeria deposit insurance corporation (NDIC) are:<br/>Incompetent management (both shareholders and Management Executive), capital inadequacy, poor internal control, poor asset quality competition and such factors as economic environment, socio-political environment.<br/> 1.3       PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>            It must at outset be acknowledge that the sanitation of the banking system has been collaboratively carried out by a lost of regulatory authorities namely CBN&lt; NDIC and the Federal Ministry of finance, among others.  However, distress resolution which is the care of the revamping exercise i.e. legally a primary responsibility of the NDIC going by the amendments to its decree.  The corporation has therefore taken a number of initiatives in this regard leading to the evolution of a co-ordinated approach for distress resolution.<br/>            In this term paper of the role of NDIC in the revamping efforts, it is noteworthy to distinguish between some normal or ordinary supervisory actions of the corporation that however, impact on the sanitization effort and those more or less one of actions taken to sanitize the system.  The first set of actions refers to the normal onsite examination and off-set supervisory activities of the corporation.  These actions provide the diagnosis for updating the trend in distress as well as indicating the next possible line of actions in the sanitization drive.  However, these normal supervisory activities will not be elaborated upon here to minimize digression from the focus of the presentation.<br/>            The second set of actions conceptualize and implemented to senitize the banking system are expectedly corrective as well as preventive of further deterioration in the financial condition of the distressed banks.  These measures include moral suasion imposition of holding actions, financial assistance.  These are explained briefly.<br/>MORAL SUASION<br/>            As a first step in distress management, the CBN and the NDIC would hold regular discussions and consultations with the owners and management of the affected banks with a view to making them embrace healthy practices that would enhances their performance as well as take prompt and decisive actions to revitalize their banks.  Although this approach had helped in making the owners and management of most problem banks to focus greater attention on certain areas of operational problems, not much had been achieved in addressing the fundamental problems of under capitalization and debt recovery.<br/>IMPOSITION OF HOLDING ACTIONS:<br/>            Banks that were identified to be distressed after a special examination, were placed under a close supervision and restrictions though the imposition of holding actions.  The aims of the holding action were to allow the troubled banks to under take self salvaging action and to arrest further deterioration in their financial condition.  This approach was anchored on the belief that given determined management and boards, the declining fortunes of the problem banks guide be reversed.  Holding actions imposed on distressed banks required than to do the following:<br/>i.              Stop further advertisement for deposits without prior consent of the CBN.<br/>ii.            Not grant further loans and advances until the regulatory authorities were satisfied with the banks liquidity position.<br/>iii.           Take necessary steps to ensure adequate internal control measures to safeguard its books, record and assets.<br/>iv.           Inject further capital funds<br/>v.            Engage in aggressive debt recovery derive<br/>vi.           Embark upon possible rationalization of staff and branches as a measure of cost reduction.<br/>In addition, each distressed bank on which the holding actions were imposed, was required to furnish the CBN and the NDIC within 30 days of being served the holding actions, details of its strategic plan for the revitalization and effective management of the bank.  Such a term around plan was expected to be creditable and to include proposals for debt recover, rationalization of costs and staff, injection of additional capital, training et cetera.<br/>FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE<br/>            NDIC in collaboration with the CBN extended accommodation facilities to help ten banks out of their liquidity problems in 1989.  This measure recorded some success as confidence was restored within a reasonable period of time.  In recent years, the corporation was received and appraised application for liquidity support from some banks.  Though few application of these were approved, it was later found that the problem of the bank transcended liquidity to include insolvency, and hence could not be adequately resolved by the mere provision of liquidity support.  The regulatory authorities, therefore, needed to directly intervene by taking over the domically distressed banks.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            NDIC has a very important role it is playing with banking sector, NDIC insures Bank deposits thereby helping to promote stability, safely confidence and sound banking system in Nigeria, protect depositors interest and further inculcate healthy banking habits.  Through the instrumentally of special promulgations by government and the collaborative efforts of CBN, the Federal Ministry of finance and the federal ministry of justice, the corporation has been able to recover debts otherwise classified as uncollectible.  As at August 1999, about N7.6 billion has been recovered by distressed banks under the control and management of the regulatory/supervisory authorities, while N35 billion has been recovered from debtors of the 31 banks in liquidation.<br/>            In addition, the NDIC has since its establishment, been providing financial information on insured banks to the general public.  Such information has enable the public to know the financial conditions of the Nigeria banking industry.  The dissemination of financial information is done through the corporations publications seminars workshops and symposia.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>            The following definitions are presented to enable the readers and the time used in the write-up.<br/> 1.            NDIC:  It is a body set up by the federal government of Nigeria to insure bank deposits promote safe and sound

Nigeria, coupled with the increasing number of business concerns employing many hands, the importance of an insurance scheme can hardly be underestimate. We can also note that every aspect of human life in any dimension one can think of is subject to one risk or the other. <br/>The risk involved many be against human life or material possession. Insurance is one of the social science which essentially is designed for risk taking. This process of risk taking entails the pooling together of the resources of many individuals in order word, insurance is the management of a pool of risk whereby, the fortunate members of a group assist the unfortunate few who suffer losses. <br/> Adeyemo (1999:12) defined insurance as a social and economic device which provides financial compensation against the effects of any misfortune. This compensation is made from the accumulated contributions of all parties taking part in the insurance scheme. Apart from covering industrials insurance also protects corporate bodies and other business organization from varieties of hazards like burglary, workman compensation ideminity, goods – in – transit, public liability  etc. <br/>Investment refers to that part of a person’s income or firm’s income that is immediately put to use for a certain return of additional income. <br/>The investment of insurance funds in Nigeria is regulated by the insurance decree of 1976 under section 18. the substantial funds held by insures are invested as a funds held by insueres are invested as to earn interest on capital gains. Insurance companies provide funds for investment through the premium they collect from their numerous policy holder. Life insurance companies for instance, invest funds that flow to them from many policy holders thus, becoming important sourc of capital funds for the Nigerian economy. Insurance companies help to provide the state with a steady flow of investment funds which are essential to the community. <br/>The investment of insurance funds helps to contribute profits to the national purse and also provide labour for the working population in a given area. In the investment of insurance funds, the overall aim is to be able to meet liabilities when they fall due, while earning to the highest possible yield without incurring great risk too. In non-life insurance, the major problem for an insurer is the unexpectedly large claims which might force him to sell its investment at long notice, possibly at a loss. As a result of this, insurers therefore, concentrate on investment which can be sold at short notice, such include shares and stocks and avoid those that cannot be sold at short notice. <br/>In life assurance, the safety of the funds as well as very high yields, are of paramount importance because of long-term nature of their liabilities. Long-term investment are useful to life assures. <br/>1.0              BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>Hallmark Assurance Nigeria company started business as one of the insurance companies on 15th July 1969.The company has since been rendering excellent services to the nation and to the world a large.       <br/>During their Annual general meeting which was held in 1993, Hallmark was merged with a sister company, it now become a composite company and transacts both classes of insurance namely: life and non-life. <br/>The company had earlier become a public liability company following its admission into the Nigeria stock exchange. This was as a result of completion of the privation exercie carries out in the company by the east while Technical committee on privatization and commercialization (TCPC) now Bureau for public Enterprises (BPE). <br/>The authorized share cap-ital is N400 million while the issued and fully paid up capital is N337 million, making Hallmark as one of the highest capitalized companies in Nigeria. <br/>With a total base of N1.5 billion, gross premium income of N1.02 billion, claims settled N346.2 milion for the past four years.

In other words, insurance is the system where an insurance company upon the receipt of a certain amount of money from a person, agrees to pay compensation or render certain services, to the person, if, and whenever that person suffers the kind of loss that was specified in the insurance agreement.  What this means is that insurance is the means by which people can save money to take care of unforeseen dangers and accidents.  When a person agrees to take insurance, policy to protect himself against certain accidents, he will pay a sum of money (which is called premium) to the insurance company.  Once the insurance company (who is called the insurer) accepts that premium from the person who intends to take insurance cover (such a person is called the insured) the insurer has thus agreed to pay an amount of money (called claims or compensation) to the insured whenever the insured loss occurs.  This agreement is usually contained in a document called a policy.<br/>Premiums, that is the cost of purchasing an insurance, are not fixed arbitrarily.  They are usually calculated by insurance experts, mathematicians called actuaries.  High risks usually attract high premiums.  For instance, if a 20-year old man is taking a life insurance policy, his premium will be much less than that of an 80-year old man who insists on taking a life insurance policy.<br/>Since insurance contract as may other commercial, activity.  It is these principles that make for its validity, insurance contract is subject to the general principles of Nigerian Law not only does it affect insurance, but it operates in every other commercial aspect of life.  They are as follows:  offer and acceptance, consideration, capacity to contract, legality, consensus ad idem (parties should be of one mind) and intention to create legal obligation/ relations.<br/> 1.2        BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY:<br/>Insurance did not emerge completely and perfectly, which in every detail, but, it developed slowly over the centuries in order to satisfy the needs of those concerned with the protection of individuals, business, other organisation and governments.<br/>Insurance which is believed to have originated from the ancient practices of the inhabitants of the valleys of Rivers Tigris and Euphrates in present day Iraq in about 400 BC rose to the earliest trace of interest in modern insurance in England, dates to 1666AD.  Up to the Lloyd’s of London which occupies the central position in today’s global insurance market, started as a small coffee house which was patronized by merchants, bankers and insurance underwriters.  Originally, Llyods was the world’s dominant insurer of marine risks.<br/>Although modern insurance started in Nigeria in the early part of the 20th century, historians and sociologists argue that what is today known as insurance was totally alien to indigenous Nigerian culture.<br/>Presently, insurance has grown to meet the increasing demands being made on the practicing insurers.  Following the historical development of insurance, it should be observed that covers those risk affecting, individuals, business organization and government as an insight into the protection of risk and form of savings to the insured.<br/>However, insurance has extended far beyond the actual protection of risk, but is concerned with the development of Nigeria economy at this particular time.<br/> 1.3        OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY:<br/>The broad objective of this study is to know the roles of insurance companies in the development of Nigerian economy.  Bit it individuals or corporate bodies, or government, the objectives of this study will help the nation at large in knowing the roles all insurance companies play in the country.<br/>So also is the government who needs a good balance, of payment in the country, in this process, the insurance companies plays a great roles in their own part.  By this process, the insurance companies are able to do as long as they are able to utilize and carries the risks well and also utilizes their financial resources properly.  For them to do this, is specifically for the objectives of the study which includes:<br/>(a)        The role of insurance companies in Nigeria<br/>(b)        The services of insurance companies to Nigeria<br/>(c)         The advantages of insurance companies<br/>(d)

Brettl. J. the subject matter of insurance is money and money only.  They act as mobilizers of funds from surplus units and channel them to deficit units. <br/>        This channeling can be refered to as indemnity. <br/>        This can be put in another way, that the primary purpose traditionally of insurance to spread the financial losses of insured members over the whole of the insuring uncertainty by compensating the unfortunate few from the contributions of all members. <br/>        Premium changed by the insurance company is its primary sources of manning income, therefore the insurance companies help on premium for its insured or person, financial rights or liability to mention but a few. <br/>        However, the financial compensation promised by the insurer is what is called the subject matter of the contract. <br/>        Insurance contract is subject to the general Principles of Nigerian Law of Contract as in any other commercial activity.  It these principles that makes for its validity.  Not only does it affect insurance but it operates in every other commercial aspect of life.<br/> 1.1    BACKGROUND OF STUDY <br/>        The role of insurance as one of the major economic activities of a nation has long received would acclamation.  It is not a dispute that insurance has attained a high degree of commercial sophistication. <br/>        Insurance business plays a major role in shaping the economic furtunes of the business enterprise institutions and individuals. <br/>        The economic profits of any country usually has an impact on both cost and benefits of insurance.  Thus one should consider the examination of the subject of insurance regulation timely in view of current economic climate.      <br/> 1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS <br/>        It has been a concern within the insurance industry on the introduction of the prudential guidelines, as it affects the performance appraisal of the insurance companies. <br/>        This research work is geared towards investigating the impact of this guideline as it affects the insurance industry in Nigerian. <br/>        In 1979 there was an act guiding the operations of insurance and ie- insurance business in Nigeria.<br/>        This act stipulated that minimum of 25 percent of the total assets of the insurance companies should be held by government and semi-government securities. <br/>        Non life insurance companies should invest not less than 10 percent of their total assets in real estate,  while the minimum proportion for life insurance companies was fixed at 25 percent.<br/>        However, in recognition of the financial intimidation role of insurance companies by government the lending operation of the companies were brought under the control of the C.B.N with effect from April 1978.  From then an insurance companies required to render monthly returns of their operation to the bank within 30 days from the end of each month. <br/> 1.3    OBJECTIVES OF STUDY <br/>a.           To ascertain the impact of the prudential guidelines on insurance companies. <br/>b.           To examine the facts contained in the prudential guidelines issues. <br/>c.           To examine the performance of insurance companies with regards to premium income and profit since the introduction of the prudential guidelines. <br/>d.           To identify the problems insurance companies face as a result of the introduction of prudential guidelines. <br/>e.           To know whether insurance companies now send monthly report to regulatory bodies. <br/>f.            Recommendations on the researcher’s findings. <br/> 1.4    SI9GNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>a.           INSURANCE COMPANIES <br/>This licensed companies will, through this research, work improve on their performance since the researcher will let the public know all that is required of the insurance companies as contained in the prudential guidelines issued on licensed insurance companies.<br/> b.     THE GOVERNMENT <br/>        Since the government though it regulatory bodies like NISB, C.B.N, etc issued the prudential guidelines this research will help the government know whether to let the prudential guideline continue or to withdraw it from being used by insurance companies. <br/> C      THE PUBLIC <br/>        The public here includes, the “insured” and the intending ones.  This research work will help particularly the intending policy buyers to be aware of the new insurance policy on the insured. <br/> 1.5        SCOPE LIMITATION AND DELIMITATION                  <br/>SCOPE <br/>        This research work covers the facts of the guidelines, premium income and profits position of insurance companies before and after the prudential guidelines, how the insurance companies welcome this new guidelines the impact the guidelines have made so far and the problems facing insurance companies as a result of the guidelines. <br/> LIMITATION<br/>        In Nigeria researchers are most of the time, regarded as tax collectors  and they face many problems in the society.  The researcher are not exempted and so, had a share of problems. <br/>i.      Finance and Time wasted   <br/>        The research had to call on C.B.N, NDIC and some insurance companies within Enugu before obtaining the required information.  <br/>        There was a huge transportation cost because of the researcher’s regular visits to the insurance companies and NDIC and much time was wasted which could have been employed in accomplishing some other things. <br/>ii.      Secrecy and lack of Statistics <br/>        To obtain the required information from the CBN, NDIC and others insurance companies was difficult because every information they considered confidential and so not information needed by the researcher was made available to him. <br/>DELIMITATION <br/>        Due to the above limitation, the researcher purposely did not write out names of distressed insurance companies as a result of guidelines issued and detailed of their transactions. <br/>1.6    RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS<br/>1.6.1         H0    The prudential guidelines has not made any impact on licensed insurance companies.

They offer this benefit in exchange for payment of a predetermined amount of money called premium. By pulling similar risks together insurance companies transform the unpredictability of the occurrence of an event to an individual into expected events affecting any one of the insured participants. In underwriting insured risks, insurance companies do accepts risks that have different risk profile but the acceptance of those risks are under different conditions, like charging an extra premium, applying exclusions or waiting periods to restore the necessary risk homogeneity in the portfolio. There are also problems in carryout these activities because of low modern technology and facilities in place to enhance underwriting process, lack of professionals in underwriting department of insurance industry which brought to foe low confidence on investors who want to invest. This study therefore is exploratory study to determine the impact of proper underwriting in promoting insurance image in Nigeria. <br/>However, Niger insurance underwriters have developed a sense to assess the anti-section effect in the process of assessing the risk they use two important considerations when assessing a risk, the physical risk is related to the physical characteristics of the insured object that may increase the possibility of a claim. On the other hand, the moral risk is related to the applicants’ reputation, financial position or criminal record. When underwriters evaluate applications for insurance they follow a very thorough thought process to identify the moral and the physical risk. In promoting insurance image in Nigeria, the insured will always know more than anyone else about the perils to which their own goods, business or health are exposed to. This underwriting is performed each time an insurance application is taken. Its purpose is to determine if application represent risks acceptable to the insurer to determine whether or not the insurer will issue a policy to proposer. The central impact of the underwriting is to help the insurance company in creating homogeneous portfolio by evaluating the risks and accepting them under conditions that make them behave similarly which is geared towards promoting good insurance image.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>        The following are my statement of the problems:<br/>Poor insurance image due to lack of improper underwriting as a result of low modern technology and facilities in place to enhance underwriting process. Inadequate assessment of risk due to lack of professionals which brought to foe low confidence on the insured. Inability to provide best advice with respect to risk protection for the individual and companies looking for protection<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>        The researcher tends to achieve the following:<br/>i.                    To promote insurance image and assess the factor that will enhance proper underwriting process.<br/>ii.                  To describe the implication of non-professionals and to promote insured’s confidence towards insurance.<br/>iii.                To ascertain whether underwriters advice their clients looking for protection.<br/> 1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>a.   What factor enhances proper underwriting process?<br/>b.   What implication do non-professionals exhibit in the expectation of the insured?<br/>c.   What form of advice do underwriters give to their client?<br/> 1.5    RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS<br/>H0:    Proper underwriting does not promote insurance image.       <br/>H1: Proper underwriting  promote insurance image<br/>       1.6    SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY<br/>       This work will benefit the underwriters in the sense that it would help them to assess risk in order to understand the major loopholes and challenges they will face in underwriting of risk in the service to their client.<br/>It will also benefit the general public in order to help them to know the various risk exposure to embark upon and how to insure them effectively and efficiently.<br/>It will also aid the candidate or student having HND in insurance who will carryout further research on the related topic in the future.<br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF PROPER UNDERWRITING IN PROMOTING INSURANCE IMAGE IN NIGERIA (A STUDY OF NIGER INSURANCE PLC)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF PROPER UNDERWRITING IN PROMOTING INSURANCE IMAGE IN NIGERIA (A STUDY OF NIGER INSURANCE PLC)", "id": 84}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>MARKETING OF LIFE ASSURANCE POLICIES IN NIGERIA<br/>(A STUDY OF LEADWAY ASSURANCE PLC ENUGU)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>In Nigeria the issue of taking life assurance policy has been neglected in the sense that at this presence time, it is estimated that not up to two percent (2%) of Nigerians own life assurance policies due to poor education and inappropriate marketing strategies for this fact, the benefits and role life assurance plays in this country is being viewed from a very crooked point thereby making it slightly visible.This study therefore focuses on marketing of life assurance policies in Nigeria.

For this fact, the benefits and roles life assurance plays in this country is being viewed from a very crooked point thereby making it slightly visible.<br/>        Moreover, the life assurance industry has entered on era of accelerated change as a result of increased competition in the products and pricing within all the insurance sectors. Hence professional marketing management is now a prerequisite, if a company is to return or advance its position in the competitive hierarchy they must follow suit.     <br/>However, before choosing the kind of cover to take, the intending assured should first of all sit down and analyzed his need. Life assurance has been said to be for those who live too long and those who die too soon. The needs of people in both these categories can be met.  Most salary earners and wage earners have other people depending on them, it could be parents, a wife, children or even brothers and sister. In life assurance programs, funds are accumulated  through payments made by the assured person called premium so that, should death occur, prior to a specified date or upon survival at an agreed period funds would be made available from the scheme to pay whatever benefits that are due.<br/>        The idea of assistance and association is not new to the Nigerian society. Various town and clan unions and social dubs, have various ways of showing benevolence to their bereaved members as discussed earlier. It is customary for people to pay condolence visit and present a sympathy purse. These practices are similar to mutual life assurance.<br/>        However, life assurance as practiced today is part of the nation’s colonial heritage. Obviously, the British introduced life assurance into Nigeria, hence the practice closely follows, the British pattern.      The earliest colonial insurance interest in Nigeria was directed to the general insurance of goods and cargo.<br/>Few life businesses which tricked in were referred to British Home Officers in London for processing. Only the affluent could afford it then because it was considered as enormous risk to insure person living in the tropics and the cost of providing such life cover was very expensive and uneconomical.<br/>With independent in 1960, life assurance started to change. Lead way Assurance Company was incorporated between Nigerians and expatriates. It therefore became the life specialist’s underwriter. Within the same period, the Nigerian life and pension consultants together with the Nigeria universities management consultant indicated the development of group life and pensions scheme in Nigeria. Before 1960, many Nigerians shunned the idea of effecting life assurance cover. They felt generally that the insurance agents were wishing them bad-luck, premature death and therefore would never have anything to do with the insurance and their agents.<br/> 1.2         Statement of the Problem<br/>a)   Lack of statistics which result to problem in payment of benefits.<br/>b)   Inability by insurance marketer to design policies which will meet the current change in the society.<br/>c)   The effect of insurance image in Nigeria due to tribalism, religions strife etc.<br/>d)   The low demand for life assurance policy which could be attributed to lack or poor education and inappropriate marketing strategies.<br/>All have contributed to the problem which tends to impede development of life assurance in the Nigeria society.<br/>1.3    Objective of the Study<br/>        Having been exposed to the problems, we have to look into what the researcher intend to achieve which is as follows;<br/>a)   To provide a new statistical method that will enhance payment of benefit<br/>b)   To identify those policies that suits the current demand in the society<br/>c)   To promote insurance image and enhance inhabitance co-existence in the society<br/>d)   To provide a strategic method in marketing life assurance polices and promotes public awareness.<br/> 1.4    Research Questions <br/>1.   Are there any method used in valuing payment of benefit?<br/>2.   Does the organization carry out marketing research to know the current trends of an event in the society?<br/>3.   Does socio-cultural beliefs of the society affect the operation of life assurance policy?<br/>4.   Does lack of public awareness hinder the activities of life assurance?<br/> 1.5    Research Hypothesis<br/>Ho:  Insurance companies have no strategic method in <br/>marketing life assurance policy.<br/>H1:  insurance companies have strategic method in <br/>marketing life assurance policy.<br/>1.6    Significance of Study<br/>        The study of the problems facing marketing of life assurance companies is significant in many ways, especially to the insurers, the life assurance intermediary and the insuring public.<br/>        Hence at the end of this study, the insurers and the life assurance intermediaries will be able to identify the problem militating against the effective marketing of life policy in the society. The study is also meant to highlight the need for adequate sales promotion methods, advertising principles and understanding of the life assurance policy.<br/>        Finally, it points out the need for marketers in the life assurance industry to appreciate the concepts, strategies and application of marketing as a spring board for growth and also the need for them to work with the actuaries of the life policies to specific target markets.<br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\n MARKETING OF LIFE ASSURANCE POLICIES IN NIGERIA (A STUDY OF LEADWAY ASSURANCE)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  MARKETING OF LIFE ASSURANCE POLICIES IN NIGERIA (A STUDY OF LEADWAY ASSURANCE)", "id": 85}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>MARKETING CONCEPTS A SURE WAY OF ENHANCING GROWTH IN THE SALE OF INSURANCE SERVICES.<br/> ABSTRACT </b><br/>This project aims to apprise the Marketing Concepts a Sure Way of Enhancing Growth in the Sale of Insurance Services.

Insurance allows the individual insure to substitute a small cost (i.e. premium) for so large but uncertain loss (not to Exceed the amount of insurance under an arrangement whereby the fortunate many who escape loss will helps to compensate the unfortunate few who suffer loss. The aim of insurance contract is to provide indemnity, ie compensation for injuring or loss sustained. Insurance has two broad classes which include life and non-life insurance. Life insurance comprise of whole life assurance, term assurance, endowment assurance and Annuity while Non-life insurance consist of fire insurance, marine insurance, motor vehicle insurance, contractors “all risk” and engineering risk insurance occupy a strategic position in on economy because it is the only business which exists for the survival of other business. Moreover, for these insurance product and service which is available to consumers to reach target market (that is desire people), adequate sensitization and awareness should be create in order to reach out to all the consumers. One of these is the adoption of selling concept. An organization produces a product and then uses various methods of selling to persuade a customer to buy their product. Their aim is to sell what they product and not to satisfying what the customers wants and need. Selling concept which include product, place, price and marketing which include product, place price and promotion have a long way in satisfying potential consumers and encourage others towards insurance products.  The focus of marketing mix remain how to make people embrace insurance product, use the products and enjoy the varieties of services offered by the insurance company and in turn make profit. <br/>        The marketing concept is a philosophy of the business which states that the customer wants satisfaction is the economic and social justification of their wants at a profitable volume in an integrated business operation. The marketing concept can also be said to be the philosophy that recognizes that the consumers is at the centre of everything we do in business. Its concept believes that without consumers there on be no marketing and based on this it should be aimed at satisfying the need of the consumer. <br/>        The marketing concept is based on three fundament beliefs: <br/>1.     Marketing orientation:      The insurance company should try to research and find out how best to create awareness or orientate the customers. <br/>2.     Profitable sale volume: Target customers should be examined by the company to find out whether their product, customers, sale men and territories are profitable. <br/>3.     Co-ordination of marketing activities: This measure as used to determine the extent of the implementation of the marketing concept. Here, the organizational status of the chief marketing executives and the extent of integration of marketing functions under the chief marketing functions is the main concern. <br/>Therefore, the major problems facing the marketing concepts in Nigeria is implementation that is why strategies are being mapped out by most companies to meet the demand of the customers by applying marketing concept to its business.<br/>Problems of the insurance services in Nigeria are as follows:<br/>Delayed settlement of genuine claims; low level of regulatory compliance; absence of new products; delayed remittance of premium by intermediaries; inroad of banks into the industry; moral hazards and sharp practices; government’s policy inconsistency; weak regulatory measures; illegal commissions and rebates; and poor image of the industry. This last problem has made for shallowness of the market for insurance.<br/>Considering that so much have changed between the socio-economic environment of your days in insurance business and now – The average Nigerian is considering the pressing needs of food and shelter, before giving any thought to insurance (Man never chop to keep money for insurance). Without even taking cognizance of prevalent general insufficiency of income among Nigerians to patronize insurance, what about the well-known conception that a typical Nigerian insurance company is never ready to pay in any event of sad occurrence? When compulsory, many Nigerians now prefer cheaper premium ‘to fulfill all righteousness’. Some are of the view that even with the government (the biggest consumer of insurance in the land), incidents of debts remain very high. It is alleged that government officials often prefer to divert funds meant for insurance to other uses. In a nutshell, there is high apathy towards insurance in Nigeria.<br/>While researching for this piece, an insurance expert summarized the following as other problems of insurance in Nigeria:<br/>- The industries which feed the short term insurance underwriting business are affected by adverse market situation (e.g. manufacturers).<br/>- Long term insurance contracts, which are more rewarding are not really there. The industry is merely making do with short term insurance market (e.g. property insurance; compulsory life insurance; individual and other life insurance). These come at a time when even many marginally insured refrain from paying premium.<br/>- Those long term business which typical insurance companies should rely upon (e.g. group life insurance, annuity insurance, investment related insurance) are farfetched. Who does not know that the rates of returns on short term insurance (often affected by commercial rate inflation index) are not quite profitable?<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>                Inspire of the growing number of insurance companies in Nigeria, its growth is still being hindered because the insurance sector still witness a low level confidence in the insuring public, the general patronage is still at lowest. Internal problems among the executives in an organization hinder the smooth implementation of marketing concept to insurance activities this is due to inability of the management of various insurance companies to engage the services of qualified marketers. Finally, these and other numerous problems; both internal and external environment still hinder the operations of the insurance sectors of the economy. In view of these problems stated that necessitate this research work.

Almost always, the failure or success of a business can be attributed to its management. When a business is mismanaged, it will lead to liquidation the company will not meet their solvency margin thereby running away from their obligation as to settle claims which in turn portray ugly insurance image. However, it will also have a drastic effect on the Nigeria economy when it failed. In order to nurture the interaction, this research focus on insurance industries and how they managed life assurance premium, to know if the premium are invested as stipulated by law, how they handle claims and the beneficiaries and also how life assurance fund help in the economic development of Nigeria.<br/>Moreover, management of life assurance fund in insurance industry relates primarily to the way the industry managed life assurance premium in order to achieve organizational goals and objectives using available fund efficiently and effectively.<br/>However, in context to management, union assurance company limited is an associate of union Bank of Nigeria plc.the company was registered as an insurer on November 18, 1993 and actually commences business in 1998. At the time, it was the first attempt by any bank to venture into universal banking. It therefore became the life assurance specialist’s underwriter with in the same period. Recently, Union assurance is redefining those strong potentials to challenge industry management with the top five brackets. Apart from restructuring its operations, the company is diversifying and expanding at a period where competitors are contracting due to uncertain economic conditions. A new management driving change and excellence is in place and venturing into new frontiers that were uncultivated. The change in management has also brought to bear on the company’s operations, innovations which are impacting positively on the work culture in Union assurance.  Union assurance also has a robust investment portfolio cutting across assets in the equity, money bond and property markets totaling over N5 Billion, they also employs a conservative but dynamic investment strategy geared towards increasing the company’s income and profitability.<br/>More so, in managing life assurance funds money is pooled together with that of other investors to create a single strong fund that provide significant investors benefits which includes an instant increase in buying strength, thereby contributing towards economic development in Nigeria. However, life assurance fund are funds accumulated through payment made by the assured person called premium so that should death occur, prior to a specified date or upon survival at an agreed period funds would be made available from the scheme to pay whatever benefits that are due. The idea for assistance and association is not new to the Nigeria society various town and clan unions and social clubs have various ways of showing benevolence to their bereaved. It is customary for people to pay condolence visit and present a sympathy purse. These practices are similar to mutual life assurance.<br/>In addition to this, there are also the long-term needs to create and sustain an enabling environment that will engender safe practice against destructive runs in managing life assurance funds, protecting and ensuring fair play among insures in the industry.<br/> 1.2       Statement of Problems<br/>Complex set of interrelated problems are identify as follows:<br/>i.    Mismanagement of life assurance premium which lead to liquidation.<br/>ii.  Inability to invest life assurance funds in varieties of security due to lack of experts.<br/>iii.Ineffective investment management of life assurance fund which affect expectations of the insuring public and the growth of the industry.<br/>1.3       Objectives of the Study<br/>Having been exposed to the problems the researcher tends to achieve the following:<br/>i.             To described the implication and suggest possible ways of managing life assurance fund.<br/>a.   To assess the factors that determines the area of investments of life assurance fund.<br/>b.   To ascertain whether life assurance funds are invested more on short-term investment than on long-term investment instruments or vice versa.<br/>c.   To promote investors’ confidence towards life assurance<br/>1.4       Research Questions<br/>1.   What appropriate strategies can be put in place to ensure effective management of life assurance funds?<br/>2.   What factors determine the areas of investment of life assurance funds?<br/>3.   What forms of investments is life assurance funds put into most, (long-term or short-term investment instruments)?<br/>4.   What are the trend expectations of the insuring public?<br/> 1.5        Research Hypothesis<br/>The research work tends to test the following hypothesis listed below:<br/>H0:    Management of life assurance fund has no positive effect on the economic growth and development of Nigeria.<br/>H1:    Management of life assurance fund has positive effect on the economic growth and development of Nigeria.<br/> 1.6       Significance of the Study<br/>It is aimed that this study will help the insurance industry to plan, organize and control life assurance fund in order to maintain proficiency and standard in insurance practice, thereby investing life assurance fund in varieties of investments, in turn have adequate fund to settle claims which will portray good insurance image and brings development in Nigeria economy.<br/>It will also aid the candidate or student having HND in insurance to know the various areas where insurance can invest.<br/> <br/><br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nMANAGEMENT OF LIFE ASSURANCE FUND IN NIGERIA INSURANCE INDUSTRY (A STUDY OF UNION ASSURANCE COMPANY)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MANAGEMENT OF LIFE ASSURANCE FUND IN NIGERIA INSURANCE INDUSTRY (A STUDY OF UNION ASSURANCE COMPANY)", "id": 87}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>A CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE IMPACT OF GOOD ACCOUNTING SYSTEM IN THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF   INSURANCE INDUSTRY(A CASE STUDY OF IGI, LEADWAY AND NICON INSURANCE COMPANIES)<br/>ABSTRACT </b><br/>This study survey critical review of the impact of good accounting system in the growth and development of insurance industry.

This study will make affair contribution towards the understanding of the treatment of various items by insurance companies and their accounting department .Sources of data, data was sources from primary and secondary data, the primary data use are questionnaire the conduct of interview and observation to the accounting staff of IGI leadway and Nicon, while secondary data are annual reports accounts, journals insurance year book etc.<br/>Method of data presentation, tabular method will be used in data presentation and analysis, it assembles information on the attributes under study in such a way that the relationship between all the information that can be observed and clearly understood at a glance.      Finally, on the findings, when Its seems that good accounting system has not been adequately carried out in insurance, inadequate accounting management in insurance industry causes fraud and financial statement misinterpretation also causes a problem are due to not shaving qualified accounting staff, inadequate training of accounting staff and lack of interest in this accounting department of insurance industry.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>Insurance accounting as related to insurance company is a district and specialized account that is always referred to as ‘specialized account” just like taxation is a specialized area. Though it employs the general accounting principles, concepts and conventions, there are needs for a clear understanding of its preparations.<br/>        In the days of T-form presentation of financial statement an insurance company account could be easily recognized from the sides of the “T” to which income and expenditure items are posted, they are not in conventional form. The convention was placing revenue to the right of the “T” insurance company revenue items to the left of the “T’ and expenditure items to the right.<br/>        Nowadays, there are other features that distinguish accounting system in insurance industry or company or company’s from their accounting system, they are:<br/>i.             Requirement by law for remitting of quarterly and annual returns to central bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Nigerian Insurance supervisory bank (NISB).<br/>ii.             Prescription by law of the type and level of investment of insurance<br/>iii.          Requirement by law for condition of returns to the Nigerian Insurance supervision board (NISB) with stated deadline.<br/>iv.          Requirement by law of the maintenance reserves known as “TECHNICAL RESEARVES” comprising of insurance funds, reserves for outstanding losses reserves for incurred but not reported and contingency reserves. <br/>All these are in addition to rendition of the required returns to the corporate affairs commission (CAC) being and incorporated company under in pursuant to the companies and allied matters decree (CAMD) 1991.<br/>    From the above, it can therefore be seen that without a proper understanding of intricacies involved in both the interpretation of the decree as well as items that makes up insurance accounts and right treatment is afforded to the financial statement as narrated wil not give a true and fair view of the statement of affairs and of profit and loss for the period.<br/>    Having read and studied the above insurance industry, the researcher felt it work bring out a detailed research work in order to benefit the students in higher institutions and readers alike.<br/> 1.2  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>    Some of the problems facing accounting system in insurance industry includes:<br/>1.   Good accounting system has not been adequately carried out in insurance.<br/>2.   Inadequate accounting management in insurance industry causes fraud.<br/>3.     financial statement mis-interpretation also causes a problem.<br/>1.3       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The objectives of this research work is to find solution to the above mentioned problems and at the same time explain and illustrate some of the items so as to practically assist staff of the account department of the insurance industry as follows:<br/>1.   To examine why good accounting system has not been adequately carried in insurance.<br/>2.   To evaluate how inadequate accounting management in insurance industry can cause fraud.<br/>3.   To explain how financial statement misinterpretation can cause problem.<br/> 1.4  RESEARCH QUESTIONS.<br/>Some of the research questions are:<br/>1.   Why is good accounting system has not been adequately carried out in insurance?<br/>2.   How is inadequate accounting management in insurance industry caused fraud?<br/>3.    Explain how financial statement mis- interpretation also caused a problem?<br/> 1.5       RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS<br/> In this research work, Null Hypothesis (Ho) and alternative hypothesis (Hi) will be used, Null hypothesis (Ho) will use for rejection while alternative hypothesis (Hi) will be used for acceptance.<br/>1.   Ho: Good accounting system has not been adequately carried out in insurance.<br/>Hi: Good accounting system has been adequately carried out in insurance.<br/>2.   Ho: Inadequate accounting management in insurance industry causes fraud.<br/>Hi: Inadequate accounting management in insurance industry does not  causes fraud.<br/>3.   Ho: Financial statement mis-interpretation also causes a problem.<br/>Hi: Financial statement mis-interpretation does not causes a problem.<br/>1.6       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>Industry keeps growing which shows an increase in the public funds placed in another person’s hand in form of premium. There is the need for proper and adequate reporting so that confidence in the industry can be established. Capital market internalization distress in the economy and subsequent need for merger and acquisition as a means of survival calls for proper understanding as well as to treatment is based, which will be used for all these.<br/>The following are the significance of the study<br/>1.   It is important to me in partial fulfillment of HND degree.<br/>2.   It is important to the insurance industry to their accounting section.<br/>3.   It is important to the financial industry on their accounting management.<br/>4.   It is important to the society on their day to day transactions.<br/>5.   It is also very important to the economy special in oil and gas sector.<br/> <br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nA CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE IMPACT OF GOOD ACCOUNTING SYSTEM IN THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF INSURANCE INDUSTRY (A CASE STUDY OF IGI, LEADWAY AND NICON INSURANCE COMPANIES)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE IMPACT OF GOOD ACCOUNTING SYSTEM IN THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF INSURANCE INDUSTRY (A CASE STUDY OF IGI, LEADWAY AND NICON INSURANCE COMPANIES)", "id": 88}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE IMPACT OF INSURANCE IN THE GROWTH OF THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY IN NIGERIA<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF LEADY WAY ASSURANCE AND I.G.I)<br/> ABSTRACT</b><br/>The impact of insurance in the growth of petroleum industry in Nigeria, insurance plays a vital role in the petroleum sector from the mining of petroleum products to its final use.

The oil boom in the 70’s led to the Nigeria economy becoming an oil economy with a resultant neglect of the agricultural sector.<br/>The boom, attracted many oil producing company to Nigeria, exploration and production of crude oil started on both onshore and coasts of Nigeria. Among the early oil production companies to insight crude oil in Nigeria are: The British Petroleum Company (now shell), Agip, Mobil, Total and most recent. Unipetrol, chevron, to mention but a few, the most recent development in the petroleum industry in Nigeria is the establishment of the petrochemical companies by the federal government.<br/>It is a common knowledge that the sector is currently dominated by the international companies, which has the financial muscles and technical expertise to invest in this highly capital incentive, highly risk and technologically driven sector. It is unfortunate to note that after over five decades of oil exploration and production, Nigeria could only boast of less than 20% local input in the industry, that is generating over 90% of Gross National Product. On the other hands, countries like Brazil, Malaysia and Norway has grown their local content to enviable levels.<br/>The poor participation of Nigerians in the oil industry led the federal government to initiate the “Nigerian content” development policy in 2001 by selling up the national committee on Nigerians contents (Adepoyigy 2006).<br/>The committee has defined “Nigerian content as “the quantum of composite values added to, or created, the Nigerian economy through a deliberate utilization of Nigerian human and material resources and services in the exploration, development, exploration, transportation, and sales of Nigerian crude oil and gas resources, without compromising quality, health, safety and environment.<br/>Petroleum products is used in all major aspect of human endeavors, this include household, manufacturing, transportation and communication. The petroleum industry has become an important ingredient in the modernization process and industrial growth of all nations. In addition, for developing countries, petroleum is a source of revenue generation, foreign exchange earner and a high contributor to the National Gross Domestic Product. Little wonder therefore that our age has being described as the “age of petroleum”. In their publication on “petrochemical and the Nigerian economy”, NNPC defined petrochemical as the product base on chemicals derived from oil and natural gas”.<br/>As the country’s economy depend solely on oil, product chemical derived from oil and natural gas, then one wonders various types of risk that the petroleum industry are exposed to. The insurance industry ensures that oil companies which have enormous risk are insured. The insurance industry advice on.<br/> 1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>1.     The impact of the insurance services is not adequately felt in the oil and gas industry    <br/>2.     Petroleum industry do not know how to handle their various insurance policy document.<br/>3.     Nigerian insurance industry are not actually practicing local content policy to its fullest.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY         <br/>i.      To examine the impact of insurance services in oil and gas industry.<br/>ii.      To educate workers in petroleum industries on how to handle various insurance policy documents.<br/>iii.     To make sure that Nigerian insurance industry actually participate fully in the development of the local content initiative.<br/>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.     Do you know why insurance services are not adequately felt by oil and gas workers?<br/>2.     Why is it that oil and gas workers does not known how to handle various insurance policy document?<br/>3.     Nigerian insurance industry are not adequately participating in local content policy, what are the reasons for this?<br/> 1.5    RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS<br/>Ho:   Nigerian insurance services are not felt by the oil and gad workers.<br/>Hi:    Nigerian insurance services are felt by the oil and gas workers.<br/>Ho:   Nigerian oil and gas workers do not known how to handle insurance policy documents properly<br/>Hi:    Nigerian oil and gas workers know how to handle insurance policy documents properly<br/>Ho:   Nigerian insurance industry do not actually practicing local content policy to its fullest<br/>Hi:    Nigerian insurance industry do  actually practicing local content policy to its fullest<br/> 1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY     <br/>i.         To reveal the risk exposure units in the petroleum industry, to enable them make decision on which one to recommend for insurance protection.<br/>ii.        The study will show the level of development achieved in the industry by the implementation of the local content policy.<br/>iii.      This study will act as a means of creating more awareness on the importance of insurance to the petroleum industry as well as the general public.<br/>iv.      This study will serve as a foundation for further study         <br/>v.       The recommendations made at the end of this study will be a great importance to the insurance industry, graduates, the government as well as general public.<br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/>\n\n THE IMPACT OF INSURANCE IN THE GROWTH OF THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY IN NIGERIA (A CASE STUDY OF LEADY WAY ASSURANCE AND I.G.I)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  THE IMPACT OF INSURANCE IN THE GROWTH OF THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY IN NIGERIA (A CASE STUDY OF LEADY WAY ASSURANCE AND I.G.I)", "id": 89}]
