In other words the expression of time in language is universal, whereas the means of expressing time is language specifics. Hence each language employs different linguistic means to express time. <br/>    Generally, the writer or speaker of a language may apply lexical means to express time, he or she may apply temporal adverbs, adjectives, substantive preposition, conjunctions, particles and adverbs or grammatical three and aspect and other syntactical means. <br/>    According to Syons (1968), the term tense has its origin in Latin. The Latin word for tense is tempus, while the term aspect is a dramatic of the Russian word “vid” though he did not give the meaning of vid in English. He explains that vid” was used for first time to refer to the difference between perfective and imperfective. In he changes of the verbs form a Russia and other Slavonic languages. The goes further to say that the perfective is completion, while imperfective means to be in progress. Aspect and tense are both seen as formal property of the verb. Tense refers to the absolute location of an event or action in time, either the present or t the past. In most  languages, it is marked by inflection of the verb. Aspect on the other hand refers to how an event or action is to be viewed with respect to time. Tense and aspect are properties of the verb. It is in view of this that most scholar hold the view that aspect always include tense. Most literature limit the interpretation of aspect of the basic distinction between events that are yet to be concluded at speech time and those that have come to a close at the time of speaking. <br/>    Carric (1976), posits that aspect is conceptually and morphologically more varied across different languages. The grammatical aspect of a verbs always, define the temporal flow in the described events or data. Huddleston and Pullum (2002: 117) succinctly state that “the term aspect applies to a system where the basic meanings, have to do with the internal temporal constituent of the situation. “Aspect has to do with a kind of perspectivizing of the internal temporal structure of the situation described by the verb relation to the point of initiation of speech. Bull (1968) uses terms like the beginning, middle and the good of an event to describe such internal, temporal structure. He calls it aspect of any event. According to Dr. Yuka “Tense and aspect are two important constitutions of the inflectional mode of any natural language. Vater (1994: 18-28) “psychologically time is a crucial concept of humans, since everything we often experience is in some way related to time even though we do not often perceive time intentionally. We measure everything we do in temporal units such as years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds and so on. He further adds that the perception of certain phases of time depends on a reference point. That is something happened in the past requires a definition of the present moment without which no past would exist. <br/>    Jeseperson (1970) states that it is of vital importance to make a distinction between “time” and event”. According to him, time is common to all mankind and it is independent of language. He is of the opinion  that tense varies from language to language and it is the linguistic expression of time relation. He explains that this may be marked morphologically. Although the words so used may also be used to perform other grammatical functions in some other circumstances. <br/>    In this study, an attempt is made to show the grammatical means by which tense and aspect are expressed in Ilaje-dialect as well as the relationship between them. The markers of tense and aspect in the language will also be identified. <br/>YORUBA SOUND SYSTEM<br/>    Yoruba has eighteen consonants, seven oral vowels and it also has five nasal vowels. (Bamgbose, 1991) the Ilaje dialect in addition to having these eighteen consonants also has the sound “gwa”. “A     mi     gwa     gari” (we are eating gari)<br/>    Ilaje makes use of the standard Yoruba orthography. <br/>    Even when it is asserted that Ilaje uses the Standard Yoruba orthography, the way in which they speak and write differ from the standard Yoruba. Though, there is a great interference of lexical item, the sentence below show this in detail Ilaje.   <br/>   Another similarity in the sound system of the standard Yoruba and Ilaje, perhaps a justification of Ilaje as a dialect of the former is t he fact the latter uses the same number vowels, both oral and nasal vowels.  <br/>TONE SYSTEM<br/>    Yoruba is a tonal language with three tones high, mid, low. The high tone is indicated by an acute accent. The mid tone is not marked and the low tone is marked with a grave tone. These three tones also featured in Ilaje distinctively. Every syllable must have at least one tone. A syllable containing long vowel can have two tones. <br/>Every syllable must have at least one tone, a syllable containing a long vowel can have tones. These three level of tones also features distinctively in Ilaje dialect. <br/><br/>1.1    ILAJE PEOPLE AND THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION <br/>    Ilaje dialect is one of the dialects of Yoruba The Ilaje local government was created out of the defunct Ilaje.Ese-Odo local government area on October 1996, by the federal government. According to Ayelagba (1986), the Ilaje local government consists of over hundred towns and villages covering an area of 3,000 square kilometers. It shares boundary, the south by Atlantic Ocean and in the west by Ogun state in the East by Delta state. The people’s main occupation is fishing.<br/>1.2    ORTHOGRAPHIC SYSTEM OF ILAJE<br/>    The Ilaje dialect lacks any standard orthographic system. Words are only written with the assumption of the standard Yoruba and the observance of the necessary sound added to the standard Yoruba word. For example, the Yoruba word for eat “mu” as in mu gari – eat gari, the ilaje form will be “gwa” gari. <br/>    The speakers are conscious of this variation in speaking and in writing. There are no number of sounds documented for construction.  However, they do have a considerable number of sounds when placed against Standard Yoruba. For example the dialect lacks the following sounds, [v], [z], [x], They maintain the number of consonant sound in Standard Yoruba. It also shares the same number of vowels, both oral and nasalized vowels. They have a rich borrowing system from the standard Yoruba language. The Ilaje are proficient in the way and manner in which they form words based on the situation. <br/>    In writing the Ilaje people basically make use of Standard Yoruba. It should however be noted that although the Ilaje dialect differ slightly from the standard Yoruba, they are both mutually intelligible.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF STUDY<br/>    This work is devoted to examining a number of things. They include, <br/>1)    The examination of tense and aspect system in Ilaje dialect. <br/>2)    The examination of the internal structure of the verb. <br/>3)    How tense and aspect are generated in Ilaje dialect. <br/>4)    The forms of the occurrence of these phenomena – tense and aspect <br/>5)    Tense category that will be treated in this work include. <br/>i.    Past  tense <br/>ii.    Present tense <br/>iii.    Future tense <br/>In expressing aspect, the forms to be examined will include, <br/>i.    Perfect aspect <br/>ii.    Imperfective aspect <br/>1.4    METHOD OF DATA COLLECTION<br/>    The source of data for this study was majorly provided by my father, Rev. Caleb Oke, a native speaker of the dialect. I also employed the competence of my friend in the dialect for this study. These two informants have good command of the dialect. <br/>    The data was supplemented by published materials on tense and aspect in Yoruba and dialects especially the Kwa languages. <br/><br/>\n\nEXAMINE THE PHENOMENA OF TENSE AND ASPECT IN ILAJE DIALECT OF YORUBA <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EXAMINE THE PHENOMENA OF TENSE AND ASPECT IN ILAJE DIALECT OF YORUBA ", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IN FOSTERING PEACE AND SECURITY AMONG MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) 1993-2016<br/>CHAPTER ONE </b><br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION <br/>Background to the Study<br/>    This essay examines the contributions of the European Union in fostering peace and security among member states of the European Union. It also investigates the impact of the organization in promoting the economic well-being of member states. It also discusses the implication of security development for not only the region directly, but for the international community. <br/>The European Union (EU), as it stands to day, is a regional organization unlike any other in the world. It has for better or worse, been able to provide its citizens with economic and security stability for over half a century1. At the heart of this union lies an alliance between France and Germany, which many would have deemed impossible not long ago. The past 50 years, however, have transferred the union into a more integrated region whose goal has become that of furthering stability and democracy within the European continent. <br/>    The fall of the Berlin War in 1981 and the reunification of Germany started the ball rolling for a new series of Eastern European countries to join the union. Current members of the union welcomed the fall of communion with great enthusiasm and looked forward to a larger re-unification of Europe. The initial enthusiasm, however, was slowly tamed by institutional and security concern that reflected both fear that activities of  other continents at once would threaten so significantly disrupt the economic integration of the European Union any the fear that the Eastern European economics were developing the slowly to integrate smoothly into the larger European society. The adoption of the single currency and the growth and stability pact has created a new challenge for future securities, making the preparation process more wearisome and inevitably longer. <br/>    Europe has never been so prosperous, so secure nor so free. The violence of the first half of the 20th century has given way to a period of peace and security stability unprecedented in European history. The creation to this development. It has transformed the relations between European states and her citizens. European countries are committed to dealing peacefully with disputes and to cooperating through common institutions. Over this period, the progressive spread of the rule of law and democracy has been authoritarian regimes change into secure, stable and dynamic democracies. Successive enlargements are making a reality of the vision of a united and peaceful continent. No single country has is able to tackle today’s complex problems on its own. The United States has played a critical role in European integration and European security, in particular through NATO.<br/>Europe still faces security threats and challenges. The outbreak of conflict in the Balkans was a reminder that war has not disappeared from the European continent, and as such, the need for security becomes pertinent among the European states to units for collective security through the European Union. <br/>    Over the east decade, no region of the world has been untouched by armed conflict. Most of these conflicts have been within rather than between states, and most of the victims have been civilians. As a union of 28 states, with over 500 million people producing a quarter of the world’s Gross National Product (GNP), and with a wide ranges of instruments a global player2. In the last decade, European forces have been deployed abroad to places as distant as Afghanistan, East Timor and the DRC. The increasing convergence of European interests any the strengthening of mutual solidarity of the EU makes Europeans more effective actors in the world security. <br/>Aims and Objective of the Study<br/>    This research analyses: <br/>1.    The organizational structure of the European Union. <br/>2.    The role of the European Union in providing international peace and security. <br/>3.    To examine the economic integration of the union. <br/>4.    To afford a proper assessment of the international economic and security system of the European and.<br/>5.    To examine the implications of the economic and security developments on European neighbouring countries, and measure taken and put in place to contain them amidst problems and challenges. <br/>Scope of the Study<br/>    The scope of the study shall cover the periods between 1993, that is, when the European Union (EU) was established, and presently 2016. It shall attempt to tough in passing relevant events that have occurred between 1993 to date. On the whole, it is the intention here to take bearing from the internal security activities of the EU member states and the international securities of its neighbouring states. In similar lane, this study shall touch on the implications and or the relationship between the European Union’s activities and the NATO, since its emergence. This will be in a passive sense since European Union, as a regional organization, has virtually its members as members of the United Nations.<br/>Methodology<br/>    This study utilizes the historical framework of scholars of international relations. Part of this work is written in narrative form to accord a deeper understanding of the historical implications of the topic or study. Otherwise, the study is analytical and draws materials from library sources, as well as secondary sources, such as comments, newspapers, magazines, books by different authors from journals, articles and online materials. <br/>In all, this research is limited mostly by online materials because the European Union (EU) as a regional organization, is in Europe and most of its activities which this study covers are updates from online.<br/>Literature Review <br/>    According to Anca Pussa in his book “European Union: Challenges and promises of a new enlargement3, regional organization are often hampered by international unwillingness to take charge, furthermore, they attempt to structure external stimuli in a way to making them compatible with their own international reasoning. Yet, challenges to security and economic policy alike, such as state fragility, natural disasters and post-conflict reconstruction, are likely to respect any institutional boundary or delimitation of competences. Thus, actors in international relations and global developments in general and the European Union (EU) in particular are constantly compelled to find new ways in order to increase inter-institutional, as well as infra-institutional collaboration and to provide effective policy responses.<br/>    In the words of Snokpeka S.A.4.. The European Union developed out of the initial step taken by six West European countries, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxemburg and the Netherlands is establishing three communities with the aim of gradually integrating their economies and moving towards political unity. These three communities were the European coal and steel community (ECSC) the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC OR EURATIOM). On July 1st 1967, these three communities, though legally separated under their constituent treaties merged their three executives and councils in one commission of the European Community (EC) under a single treaty. <br/>    The economic integration of Europe which was the objective of the founding six nations of the above communities were reflected in the emergence of EC in July 1967. From the very onset also the founding six also had the aim of develop the European community into a political nation. The intention was transformed to action in February 7, 1992, when the treaty on European Union (the Maastricht Treaty) was signed and when it came into force on November 1, 1993. This political union was discernable from its provisions which called for monetary integration, the co-ordination of social policies and other steps to increase economic integration. <br/>    Economy and security are intrinsically linked and mutually reinforcing. The economic securities bridge has two dimensions: First, a politico-legal one as its suggests that there is need for sustained efforts to further improve coordinating coherence between distinct, but inter-locking policy areas. Second, it exposes a time dimension for there is need to marshal instruments that build bridges between securities or humanitarian interventions and long-term economic programmes. By all means, current debates on the new interfaces between security and economy have for more strongly emphasized “convergence in conceptual and practical policy terms. <br/>    According to Kuijper P.J., in his book titled “The law of EU external relations”, the European Union has positioned itself as a proponent of the “bridges” rather than the “gap” approach to foreign and developmental policies on security3. Being associated to the EU’s common foreign  and security policy (CFSP) ever since the Maastricht Treaty, the European commission, for instance, has been constantly pressing for an improved coordination between external relations. The commission has made an effort to frame the EC instrument for stability (IFS), or alternatively, the “security instrument” as the community’s flag-ship-like instrument whose main purpose is to address the internal and external security activities. Since January 2007, the IFS has been providing financial assistance to countries in situations of emerging crisis. consequently, it also is the key instrument for sustaining economy and security development. In terms of its objectives, the IFS is three pronged and distinguishes between a short term from a long term component. First, I situation of (emerging) crisis, it seeks to help to stability by providing an effective response to help preserve, establish or reestablish the conditions essential to the proper implementation of the community’s development and cooperation policies. <br/>    According to Gangle Stefan, in his book titled: Coping with the security-development; the European Union aims, in the context of stable conditions for the implementation of community cooperation policies in partner countries to contribute towards building the capacity to address specific global and trans-regional threats with a view of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and trafficking, terrorism and organized crime. <br/>    According to Goldstein S. Joshua, in his book titled “International Relations”, security has been constructed in terms of an intergovernmental paradigm and firmly anchored in the field of European political cooperation (EPC) since the early 1970, economic policy in term, has evolved as a shared competence of both the EU institutions and its member states and thus, patterns of mix governance involving supranational and intergovernmental features6.<br/>    In order to better understand the mixed governance, it is worthwhile to look at the place of security and economic  policy within the history of European integration. <br/> Endnotes<br/>1.    Goldstein, S.

Hence, Benin history is an elusive story, being an amalgam of travelers, account, oral tradition, art history and archeology. <br/>It is imperative to note that the heartlands of Edo revolves around Benin City, on which the famous old Benin Empire held sway for over two thousand years and contrary to the beliefs of what the earlier writer have written about the history of Benin, modern historians are now beginning to accept the fact that earlier beliefs as to the origin of Benin are neither supported by archeologitycal or ethological facts.7 <br/>The origin of Benin, revolves around two hypothesis, the dramatic hypothesis by Jacob Egharevba, who suggested that the people of Benin migrated from Egypt, many, many years ago in order to find a secured shelter in the part of the world, and after a short stay in Sudan and Ile-Ife, which the Binis called Ube. <br/>While the other, is the Snail Shell Hypothesis, which said that the Benin Empire was founded by the youngest son of God (Osanobua), who was sent to live in the world with his elder brothers including the fist king of Ife. Osanobua asked them, (his sons) to chose one thing that was dearest to them, other choose wealth, magical skills, but the youngest son choose a snail shell, which contained sand and with that sand he created the Benin Empire.8 <br/>An insight about the Benin Kingdom will not be complete without looking at the political and economic aspects of the Benin Kingdom. <br/>The Political Aspects: The political aspect of the Benin Kingdom is centered around the Oba. The Oba is seen as the Supreme Being, a god, as he was called by his people, and the Oba was believed to have come from the sky (heaven). The Oba is an embodiment of he culture of the Benin people, everything revolves around the Oba, for example, a matured man is referred to as “Okpioba” meaning (Oba’s man) while a matured woman will be referred to as “Okhuoba” meaning (Oba’s woman), even in their salutations, the Benin people did not fail to reverence their oba, their good morning is “Obowie” (meaning king of the morning) while their good afternoon is “Obavan (meaning – king of the noon) and their good evening is “obaota” (meaning king of the evening). The Oba’s political power is highly respected and feared by the people. The Oba’s decision in any matter was unalterable, and the Oba was able to govern the people with the help of the chiefs. The government of the Benin Empire was administered in the name of the Oba.9<br/>The Economic Aspects: The main occupation of the Benin people was agriculture although certain crops and livestock featured prominently in some areas than others. The Benin people cultivated a number of crops such as; yam, maize, melon, plantain, groundnut, etc. They also engaged in hunting games, using dogs and locally made guns, although they were a number of prominent rivers in the areas, the people were not good at fishing and so they depended on their neighbor for fish.10 <br/>They made trade exchange with their neighbors and Europeans. Though these exchange the Oba and some prominent chiefs was able to require horses and some other items. The Benin people produced iron work and wood carving. According to Igbafe, <br/>The common people of Benin were organized into occupational groups of craftsmen and professional, who supplied the Oba’s specific need in return for monopoly rights from the obtain their various trade.11 <br/>The Benin territory took a great boost through their trade exchange with Europeans, especially with Portugal, as Igbafe pointed out: <br/>European trade with Benin stimulated the growth of trade between Benin and the hinterland as a result of the new and heavy demand for certain products, most notable of which was cotton. The trade also increased the general level of production for most Benin indigenous weaving industry experience a book period during, which demands constantly outstripped supply, Benin traders therefore took towards the hinterland for additional supply.12 <br/>In a way of conclusion, the Benin Empire, although without no exact history, still has an history and it is among one of the greatest empire of all time.<br/> Statement of Research Problem<br/>The British invasion has been a topic of much speculation among writers and historians and a lot of books have been written about it, but what previous historians an writers refused to write about the impact of the British invasion on the Benin Kingdom, and this will be my major concern for this topic. <br/>Aims and Objectives<br/>The aim of this work is to examine the British invasion of the Benin kingdom in 1897, or analyze the invasion while the objective of this work is to undertake an analysis<br/>of the positive and negative impact and to attend an appraisal of the impact of the British invasion in subsequent Benin history. <br/>Methodology <br/>In order to carry out this work, relevance will be placed on primary and secondary materials. Primary materials will include oral interviews conducted in Benin of Benin traditional historians, while secondary materials will include articles, journals and textbooks. <br/>Literature Review<br/>In order for this work to be carried out effectively, literature’s are relevant to this<br/>work.          <br/>Among them is the work of E.B. Eweka “evolution of Benin Chieftaincy Titles, in which he discussed the origin of the Benin people, but the book failed to give us a more detailed and prescribed history of the origin of the Benin people, although the book is still of great importance to this topic.1 <br/>Jacob Egharevba, work, “A short history of Benin, this work, have as more detailed and prescribed explanation of the origin of he Benin people and it also gave us an insight about the British invasion of Benin empire, but the book did not provide us with a more detailed account about the British invasion, which is where the topic will be based on, but this book is still of great importance to this work.2 <br/>While Joseph I. Osagie, ITAN,: Journal of Department of History and International Studies, Vol. 3, No. 2003, talks about the economic activities of the Benin kingdom and other communities before British invasion, although this journal did not talk about the<br/>political and social activities of the Benin Kingdom before the British invasion, it is still of great importance to this topic. <br/>Daniel .N. Oronsaye, in his work titled, “The history of ancient Benin Kingdom and Empire,” gives us a more detailed description about the origin and history of the Benin Kingdom, how the Oba dynasty came about and also described he power of the Oba, although this book did not talk about the British invasion, it is still of great importance to this topic.3 <br/>Leo .E. Otoide, article, titled, “prelude to the British punitive expedition” to Benin: An Analysis of the Gallway Treaty of 1892,” this article have a detailed description of what led to the British invasion of the Benin Empire, starting with the misunderstanding about the Gallway treaty, that lead to the Benin massacre which led to the British invasion. This work is of immense importance to this topic.4   The other category of works include, Osariemen B.

The present scheme of things and prevalent dispensation can be traced to certain events that occurred within Ukraine herself, which by extension, held strategic significance to Russia of which she was demographically linked in the past, and whose influence still held much sway within the sovereign region in both political and cultural terms. The immediate roots of the present scuffle can be traced to events such as the Orange Revolution and the Euromaidan crisis that engulfed Ukraine sometime in 2004 and 2013 respectively.<br/>The Orange Revolution began with non-violent protests on the eve of November 22, 2004 as millions of Ukrainians thronged the Independence Square in Kiev to protest strong anomalies in the election results that favoured the Russian backed presidential candidate, Yanukovych against the pro-Western candidate, Yushchenko. Apart from the immediate reasons for the protests, it also signified a strong disaffection with the prevailing political atmosphere riddled with the dominance of corrupt political elites favoured by Kremlin’s power base (Karatnycky, 2005). The protests signaled the rise of an emerging civil society consciousness and a formidable middle class who were committed to the transformation of the status quo and were ready to seize their destinies in their hands, propelling the fate of the country towards a noble and dignifying image among the committee of nations. Europe and the entire world were bemused at the will of the people to alter the image of a country that had been largely warped and disillusioned by the hierarchy of corrupt leadership that held sway in the country (Karatnycky, 2005). The triumph of Yushchenko implied a fundamental shift in the post-communist history of Eastern Europe, it heralded seismic shift towards the West as never envisaged.<br/>Another crucial event was the Euromaidan crisis of 2013 that finally forged a definite crescendo in the graph of diplomatic relations between Russia and Ukraine. The Euromaidan crisis of that particular year was more of a continuation of the leftover of the Orange Revolution because its immediate roots were not far-fetched from those that provoked the Orange Revolution. The Maidan protests were also concerned with the demand for alignment with the more prosperous West rather than the Russian fixation perpetuated by the Eastern parts of Ukraine, and a definite annihilation of the rampart corruption that had become the trademark of the Ukrainian polity (Van Metre, et. al. 2015). The protests had linkages with the decision of the then incumbent, Viktor Yanukovych, who on the 21st of November, 2013 decided to postpone the association agreement between Ukraine and European Union. This decision proceeded to have a long term effect, degenerating from peaceful protests at the Maidan square in Kiev into vicious confrontations that divided families, communities and the whole Ukrainian nation at large (Pikulicka-Wilczewska, 2015). <br/>It is the view of some scholars that these events created an opening; a vantage opportunity for Russia to seize control of the situation and re-assert herself as a major regional and global power. it is alleged that the incursion of Russia into Ukrainian territories such as Crimea and Eastern Ukraine were deliberate moves by the power center in Kremlin to initiate indigenous instability that would facilitate the attainment and consolidation of the hitherto highlighted goals of Russian foreign policy under Putin’s watch (Van Metre, et. al., 2015). More pronounced have been the Western reactions to the perceived intentions of Russia through the auspices of the European Union and NATO. <br/>The Western bloc responded to this perceived threat induced by Russia by initiating a torrent of responses in the form of diplomatic condemnations, economic sanctions, non-lethal military assistance to Ukrainian forces and the increase of NATO forces in the Eastern flank of the European regions. Russia on the other hand initiated counter responses by increasing the presence of Russian forces in disputed areas of the Ukrainian border, and the transportation of equipment and personnel into Ukrainian territories. Even the global shock necessitated by the sudden drop of oil prices across the globe was not enough to deter Russian military action despite the adverse effect of the oil price depreciation on Russian economy (Van Metre, et. al. 2015). Many scholars have interpreted Putin’s move in Ukraine to be as a result of piled up resentment and a disposition of vendetta for the political turmoil of 2004 that saw to the victory of Yushchenko, and more importantly that saw a shift of Ukrainian allegiance which tilted towards the West. Many have also interpreted the Russian maneuvering in Ukraine as the achievement of short term goals by maintaining constant conflict in Ukraine, keeping the country internally off balance, making Ukraine to continuously remain undesirable to the West and most of all, flexing Russian might in a calculated U.S./E.U. response in pursuit of long term fulfillment (Van Metre, et. al. 2015). <br/>These prevailing circumstances both within and without Ukraine and the whole of Eastern Europe play a fundamental role in the understanding and analysis of the current Russo-Ukrainian relations that has been bedeviled by constant crisis, clashes of interest and a general atmosphere characterized by mutual distrust and suspicion. Apart from the above, there have been general pointers to the expansionist and imperialist intentions of Russia under the Putin administration as some scholars assert. These shall be discussed under the next sub topic by extension.<br/>1.2    Statement of Problem<br/>The world was grossly ill prepared for the sudden twist of events and the reconfiguration of the international system that occurred towards the end of the eighties and the beginning of the nineties. The first was the significant dismantling of the Berlin Wall in 1989 which once separated West Germany from its Eastern counterpart as a result of the romantic exploits of the latter with Communism. The second which was more startling and mesmerizing was the sudden concession of one of the power blocs that maintained the balance of the bipolar system of global politics as at that point in time. The event which took the vast majority of international relations scholars, politicians, diplomats, journalists and the world at large by surprise was the sudden decision of the Russian controlled U.S.S.R. to disintegrate and put a stop to its patronage of its satellite countries which spread across Europe, Asia and Africa (Aspaturian, 1992). The likes of Realism, the dominant International Relations theory as at then, embarked on an ambitious prediction of the global system to continue on the path of bipolarity for a long while to come. The works of Kenneth Waltz, who was the most significant figure in the Realist school by the wake of early seventies, saw a world system that would be determined by a balance of power among the bipolar blocs for a long time to come (Reus-Smith, 2005). He vigorously pursued this line of thought in one of his most influential works titled Theory of International Politics (1979).<br/>Communist ideology was speedily eroded in countries that constituted the Warsaw alliance which served as a checkmate on NATO ambition for a long while. Countries such as Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia replaced their Communist regimes with anti-Communist governments, while some other countries such as Romania, Bulgaria and Albania adopted some kind of ‘reformed socialism’. In Russia herself, the country quickly dismantled the state apparatus based on Communist ideals and rather favoured a presidential system that placed maximum power at the center under the Mikhail Gorbachev administration. There were mixed reactions to the decision of Gorbachev as some Soviet scholars who saw the vast U.S.S.R Empire as a burden that had to be dispensed with were somewhat pleased. On the other hand, there were strong resentments from the domestic clime as the KGB and professional military officers saw the Gorbachev policy decisions as gravely detrimental to Russian security concerns (Aspaturian, 1992). Gorbachev on the other hand claimed the legitimacy of his actions by pointing to the socio-economic degeneration of the Soviet empire all in a quest to pursue and maintain ‘global power’ status through ostentatious and irrelevant military expenditure that occurred during the Brezhnev government. As a result, Gorbachev postulated a refinement in foreign policy and a ‘new political thinking’ that took into consideration the economic and political renaissance of the country without undermining her military prowess and her position as a global power in world affairs (Gorbachev, 1988). It was this mantra of a new political thinking that resulted in the famous Glasnosts and Perestroika policy of the Gorbachev regime.The turnout of events virtually left the United States of America as the unchallenged super power and the only authentic claimant to global hegemony. It also initiated an era of impunity buoyed by the illusion of U.S.A. that no country was powerful enough to challenge her dominance. This impunity and arrogance manifested itself in the anarchical system the world was almost plunged into through American involvement in issues such as the Gulf crisis that ensued in the Iraqi/Kuwait crisis, Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries.   <br/>The West on the other hand, especially the United States of America, got carried away with the possibility of a unipolar system dominated by Capitalist ideology and the consolidation of democracy as the only genuine form of government across the globe. This superfluous and arrogant presumption reflected in the works of many American scholars of that period, but none was more pronounced than the classic work of F. Fukuyama who declared that liberal democracy has emerged victorious and it was in fact the end of human history because this for him marked the end of contending ideologies and the dominance of liberal democracy (Fukuyama, 1992: xv). No such scholarly work was as arrogantly presumptuous as this particular work of Fukuyama, and it went further to reveal the possible mindset of many American scholars and diplomats at that time. The unfolding events of contemporary times have, however, proceeded to disgrace the arrogant presumption of the West.<br/>In recent times, the diplomatic moves and body language of Russia under Putin has signaled an era where American dominance has faced serious compromise and challenges unprecedented. In fact, some see the presumed dominance of America as a fluke and an illusion. Russia’s role in fostering a multipolar system cannot be over-looked, so also her increased counteractive measures in prohibiting American/Western influence on the global scale by making effective use of her veto powers as a permanent member of the United Nations. More controversial is the true intentions behind Russian occupation of erstwhile Communist countries such as Ukraine. As a result of this recent upsurge in Russian aggression and expansionist tendencies, some scholars have come to the conclusion that the Cold War is far from over. In fact, it has assumed a novel dimension which is deeper and more intensifying than the Cold War we were quite used to before its collapse (Shearman, 2010: 12). In one’s opinion, the precariousness of the subtle re-emergence of a Cold War is because it is no longer basically between two power centers, but many other power centers have emerged since the end of the Cold War. Inclusive of the increasing multi-polar structure of international system are the new power centers that have evolved in the Asian bloc, especially in countries such as China and India. Hence, if a Cold War was to resurface, it would no longer be an Euro-American affair, but would incorporate the new power centers. This in itself has immense implications for the structure of global politics in itself. <br/>1.3    Objective of Study<br/>This essay is aimed at achieving the following objectives as regards the subject matter under analysis. These are as follows:<br/>1)    To examine the nature of Russia’s involvement in Ukraine.<br/>2)    To ascertain the significance of Russia’s involvement in Ukraine.<br/>3)    To determine the validity of Russia’s claims over some Ukrainian territories.<br/>4)    To identify and analyze the measures and strategies adopted by Russia in consolidating her claims over some Ukrainian territories.<br/>5)    To highlight the territorial and global implications of Russian involvement in Ukraine.<br/>6)    To examine the reactions of Ukraine as the country directly involved in the Post-Cold War politics.<br/>7)    To ascertain the interests and counter reactions of the United States and the European Community at large.<br/>1.4    Research Questions<br/>The following questions shall be addressed during the course of this study. They are as follows:<br/>1)    What is the nature of Russia’s involvement in Ukraine?<br/>2)    Why is Ukraine so significant to Russian interests in recent times?<br/>3)    How legitimate and valid are the claims of Russia over Ukrainian territory?<br/>4)    What are the measures and strategies adopted by Russia to maintain its claims over some Ukrainian territories?<br/>5)    What are the implications of Russia’s involvement in Ukraine on a territorial or global level?<br/>6)    What is Ukraine’s stand and reaction to Russia’s belligerent occupation of her sovereign territories?<br/>7)    What are the counter-measures adopted by other actors whose interests are involved, such as the United Nations, United States and the European Community?<br/>1.5    Significance of Study<br/>Many scholars and diplomats have undoubtedly produced elaborate literature concerning Russian involvement in Ukraine since 2014. These literature and research work continue to hold relevance in the respective angles they attempt to view the issue from. This work, however, seeks to contribute to the existing literature by viewing the issue from its inter-connectivity with the Soviet precedents of the two countries involved, especially their location within the Cold War era, and to see if in reality, the issue has a great significance as regards a potential Cold War resurgence.<br/>Many scholars have alluded to different reasons and explanations for Russian incursion into Ukrainian territory. Some see it as closely associated with Russia’s aspiration for some kind of Eurasia (Eastern Europe and Asia) collaboration in terms of a security network, bereft of Western influence which is jointly endorsed by the Putin/Medvedev regimes (Kanet, 2010: 2); some others see Russia’s move as a reaction to the US supported coup in Ukrainian territory that occurred in 2014 which overthrew a legitimately elected government under Ukrainian law and has nothing to do with the expansionist propaganda perpetuated by the West (Blum, 2016); some others have also seen Russia’s actions in the light of a head-on confrontation with the West by showing disregard for Western policies and also as a way of reacting to the West’s tendency to treat Russia as an inferior partner in the management of global affairs (Simes, 2007). The consequence of the latter in the order of different reasons that have been put forward is that the deliberate belligerence shown by the Russian federation is meant to signify her defiance for Western incursion into her sphere of influence and a re-assertion of the equal status Russia has in the international system as a Global Power, which is quite reminiscent of the balance of power structure that pervaded the Cold War era.<br/>Hence, by embarking on a thorough analysis of the above consequential subject matter and the related issues, the study intends to expand the frontiers of knowledge as regards the Russo-Ukrainian dispute and also create more room for further debates and research as regards this matter at hand because it is one of the fundamental features of knowledge pursuit and the beauty of international relations discipline. International relations deals with an ever evolving global community. Hence, no particular work of international relevance is self-explanatory or totally exhaustive of international issues under discuss. The work intends to be a beneficial and handy tool to scholars, researchers and policy makers in the field of international relations and other related disciplines.<br/>1.6    Scope and Limitation of Study<br/>As a result of demographic and resource constraints, the locus in quo (Russia and Ukraine) would quite be infeasible to reach. Hence,this work shall primarily source its data from secondary sources which are available and within one’s reach.<br/>As previously mentioned, there are numerous existing literature and write-ups on the subject matter, but this work is basically concerned with examining the issue basically from the relevance it bears to Russia’s foreign policy, role (imagined or actual) in global politics and her interests especially in relation to other global powers, especially from the West. This is also, closely tied to the significance of Russia’s actions in Ukraine to Russia herself and other global powers at large. The study does not embark on an ambitious or gargantuan endeavour of exposing all the related issues as regards Russia’s actions in Ukraine, or even within the other regions close by. It must be admitted that Russia’s actions are not limited to Ukraine alone as other literature have explained, there are other allusions to Russia’s activities in former Soviet territories and satellite states. However, this work is primarily concerned with the events occurring in Ukrainian territory, and it also analyzes it from within a specific perspective.<br/>1.7    Research Proposition<br/>The following propositions have been pushed forward during the course of this study. They are as follows:<br/>•    The most pertinent reason for Russia’s occupation of some Ukrainian territories is to counter Western expansionism especially through the auspices of NATO and E.U.<br/>•    Russia’s occupation of Ukraine has both manifest and latent significance which bears relevance to their geographical, economic and political interests.<br/>•    Russia has become more confrontational and is still evolving a more assertive posture and foreign policy since the advent of Putin administration.<br/>•    Russia’s actions and body language portend a re-institutionalization of a balance of power in the international system but in a multi-polar world unlike the erstwhile bi-polar world.<br/>1.8    Research Design<br/>Data Collection<br/>The study shall basically be sourced from secondary materials such as books, journals, newspapers and speeches. Other relevant secondary sources such as maps, graphs and statistical tables shall also be utilized to supplement and consolidate the textual evidence upon which the research rests.<br/>Research Design<br/>For the purpose of this study, the qualitative content analysis shall be employed. Qualitative research according to Williams (2007) involves the purposeful use of the analytic tools of description, explanation and interpretation in the collection and collation of data. He also adds that the qualitative research method enables the researcher to investigate the phenomenon from his or her view point. The content analysis aspect of qualitative research according to Leedy and Ormrod (2001) is “a detailed and systematic examination of the contents of a particular body of materials for the purpose of identifying patterns, themes, or biases”. It also involves identifying the body of material to be studied and defining the characteristics or qualities to be examined in the body of material. They acknowledge the relevance and appropriateness of the qualitative method in building theories. The aim of content analysis is to achieve the highest objective analysis possible. Qualitative content analysis employs a methodology whereby various forms of human communications such as newspapers, books and journals are reviewed within their contexts of communication in order to identify themes and patterns (Williams, 2007). This approach is quite relevant in the examination and analysis of socio-political issues.<br/>As distinct from its quantitative counterpart, qualitative content analysis does not require the collation of a representative sample unit. Hence, it fits more into the category of non-probability or non-random sampling.<br/>Data Analysis<br/>Analysis of the study shall basically be based on the relevant literature, while the maps, graphs and tables shall serve as necessary illustrations for the vivid understanding of the issue at stake. By embarking on the description and analysis of social phenomena, qualitative content analysis may validate existing themes and theories while it may as well create an avenue for the formulation of novel themes and theories, depending on the result of the analysis. Hence, according to Neuman (2003:185), qualitative researchers are more pre-occupied with the search for authenticity rather than validity.<br/>1.9    Conceptual Clarification<br/>We shall endeavour to examine some basic concepts and terminologies under this sub topic. This will enable us to have a vivid comprehension of the subject matter. The key terminologies are as follows:<br/>Cold War: The origins of the term ‘Cold War’ has been attributed to a number of scholars, politicians and journalists who had their roots in American history. The likes of Bernard Baruch, a politician, Walter Lippmann, a writer, and journalist, H.B. Swope have one time or the other been attributed with the title of authors of the term. However, the origins of the term date as far back as the fourteenth century in the work of one Spanish writer named Don Juan Manuel (Hough 2008:26). The writer used to term to mean a situation between countries where there is a state of hostility or tension, but not characterized by actual warfare. The writer, Don Joan Manuel used this term to refer to the scenario between Spain and the Muslim World as at then. However, the relations that ensued between the Capitalist United States and former Communist Soviet Empire after the Second World War accurately fitted the description (Hough, 2008). Flowing from the above, a Cold War, according to Shearman (2010:15) is therefore “based upon a level of tensions between actors in which, short of a hot shooting war, relations are tense and strained on all indicators ofstate power: military, cultural, economic, political, and diplomatic, ina zero-sum game in which one side’s gain is seen automatically as theother side’s loss.” <br/>The historical accounts of the bitter rivalry between the bi-polar powers (U.S.A. and U.S.S.R.) were characterized by an avoidance of outright military conflicts, but a prevalence of proxy wars. It was a situation where one side would fight an enemy sponsored by the other side, or both would take sides with and sponsor their own allies in a conflict while watching and cheering from the side lines (Hough, 2008). Some of the examples of the proxy wars included the U.S. invasion of Vietnam, the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, and the U.S.S.R. invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. One of the major reasons why a head-on confrontation between both powers was warily avoided and inconceivable was according to Hough (2008) the ‘balance of terror’ or what many scholars of international relations would refer to as ‘balance of power’ necessitated and made feasible by the possession of W.M.D. (Weapons of Mass Destruction). The possession of nuclear and military capability by both parties threatened not only the existence of the respective actors, but the entire global population, and this was a central concern for International Organizations such as the United Nations which championed a ‘nuclear disarmament’ initiative to deter an outright nuclear war. Various reasons have been alluded to for the emergence of Cold War, these shall, however, be discussed in the unfolding chapters.<br/>Russia: The Russian Federation is often disputed by many analysts to be located either in the Asia or Europe. As a result, the term ‘Eurasia’ has been used to refer to Russia’s peculiar situation. However, according to the Maps of World (2011), Russia should be regarded as more of an European country because of the following reasons: Russians are predominantly of the ethnic group called ‘East Slavs’ and these group of persons are often regarded as Europeans by most historians; Russia makes up of about 40% of the land mass of the whole European continent; about 78% of Russia’s population live in European part of Russia; The Russian language is written in the Cyrillic script, which is an evolved/derived form of an ancient Greek script. Most of the “sounds” in spoken Russian relate closely with other East European languages. The Cyrillic script and its first documented usage is credited to the First Bulgarian Empire (10th Century AD); and lastly, most of Russia practice Orthodox Christianity which was an offshoot of the ancient Byzantine Empire. The Russian Federation is the largest of the 21 republics that make up the Commonwealth of Independent States. It occupies most of Eastern Europe and North Asia, stretching from the Baltic Sea in the West to the Pacific Ocean in the East, and from the Arctic Ocean in the North to the Black Sea and the Caucasus in the South. It is bordered by Norway and Finland in the northwest; Estonia, Latvia, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, and Lithuania in the west; Georgia and Azerbaijan in the southwest; and Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China, and North Korea along the southern border.<br/>Russia can historically be traced to as far back as 862 A.D. when Rurik the Viking founded the Russian dynasty in Novgorod. However, Russia later fell under the influence of the Mongols until the advent of Ivan the Terrible (1533-1584) who suppressed Mongol influence, crushed the influence of rival princes and boyars, and established the Russian State. He is often regarded as the first Muscovite Czar of Russia (Infoplease, 2016). Russia continued to be under the influence of the Czars until the Bolshevik revolution that occurred in 1917 due to the rampart corruption and inefficiency of the Czarist regime. The Bolshevik Socialist Democratic Party placed Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trostky in power after Czar Nicholas II was killed with his family, and the provisional government of Alexander Kerensky was over-run. Russia did not; however totally fall under the control of Communism until 1920 due to a series of internal struggles. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was eventually formed on 20th Dec, 1922. Stalin eventually took over the reins of power after the death of Lenin in 1924 and the banishment of Trostky (Infoplease, 2016). <br/>Russia is richly blessed with oil reserves and is the second largest producer of oil in the world after Saudi Arabia and largest producer of natural gas, giving her a wide range of control over oil exportation and production in Asia and across Europe (British Petroleum, 2007).<br/>Ukraine: Ukraine is located in the Eastern part of Europe and is the second largest country in that region after Russia. The capital of the country is Kyiv, located on the Dnieper River in the north-central part of Ukraine. It is bordered by Belarus to the north, Russia to the East, Sea of Azov and the Black Sea to the South, Moldova and Romania to the South West, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia to the West. The country is characterized by fertile black soil steppes and mountainous areas such as the Carpathians in the South West and the Crimean chain in the South    (Zasensko, et al., 2016). Ukraine was formerly known as ‘KievanRus’ up till the 16th century, and Kiev, the major city in the KievanRus was the major political and cultural center in the whole of Eastern Europe by the 9th century. Kiev attained the heights of its power by the 10th century and declined by 1240 as a result of Mongol invasion. From 13th to 16th century, Kiev was under the dominion of Poland and Western Europe. As a result, the Ukrainians in 1654, asked for protection against Poland by the Czar of Moscovy and this culminated in the Treaty of Pereyasav. This treaty was interpreted by Moscow to be an invitation to take over Kiev. Thus, the Ukrainian state was eventually absorbed into the Russian Empire (Infoplease, 2016). Ukraine briefly gained independence from Russia in January 1918 during the Bolshevik Revolution. However, Kiev was once more over-run by the Communist Red Army in 1920, and in 1922, Ukraine became one of the founding countries of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Ukraine finally declared her independence on August 24th, 1991 under the leadership of President Leonid Kravchuk, after the fall of Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Empire. Together with Russian and Belorussian leaders, Ukraine formed the Commonwealth of Independent States (C.I.S.) in Dec. 1991. In Oct 1994, Crimea was annexed by Ukraine as part of her sovereign state and her constitution was revoked (Infoplease, 2016).<br/>Ukraine has been regarded as the second most important economic hub of the former Soviet Republics after Russia, producing about four times the output of the next ranking republic. Its major economic activities include the production and exportation of agricultural produce such as milk, meat, vegetable and grain. This is facilitated by the prevalence of its rich and fertile black soil unprecedented in the whole of the former Soviet Empire. She is also involved in the production and exportation of heavy industrial equipment such as large diameter pipes and vertical drilling apparatus. She also exports raw materials to industrial and mining sites within the former U.S.S.R. and the C.I.S. countries (World Fact Book: C.I.A. 2016).<br/>Below is a map illustration showing the proximity of the Russian and Ukrainian states, and also other bordering East European states. This would help us to understand issues surrounding the territorial conflicts that have ensued between the two states in recent times as they share a lot in common, especially in terms of culture, politics and history.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE RE-EMERGING COLD WAR: RELATIONS BETWEEN RUSSIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE RE-EMERGING COLD WAR: RELATIONS BETWEEN RUSSIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES ", "id": 4}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>NIGER DELTA CRISIS AND NATIONAL SECURITY IN NIGERIA: APPRAISAL OF THE AMNESTY PROGRAMME AS A PANACEA <br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Background of the Study<br/>Crude oil was discovered in the Niger Delta over fifty years ago, with the discovery of oil in Oloibiri in 1956 by Shell Petroleum Development Company (Aaron, 2010). Since oil has become the main stay of the Nigerian Economy, contributing over 90 percent of foreign exchange earnings of the government, it is surprising that the trajectory of constitutional development, socio-economic development and class formation have been massively influenced and dictated by the politics of oil (Owugah, 2010).Prior to the advent of commercial oil production in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria in 1958, the region was essentially a pristine environment which supported substantial subsistence resources for the mostly sedentary population. The region accounted for a large percentage of Nigeria’s commercial fisheries industry (Afinotan, 2009). For centuries therefore, the people of the Niger Delta were content to engage in farming, fishing and such other endeavours like pottery, mat-making and hunting, unaware that underneath their soil was one of nature’s most prized mineral resources.<br/>While the Nigerian State may see the availability of the crude resources as a ‘Blessing’ and a source of pre-eminence in the global market place, the communities where this crude resource is endowed with, see it as a ‘curse’. This is because the massive exploitation of crude oil creates serious developmental, social and environmental problems which the Nigerian state and the collaborative oil giants have neglected for a long time (Omotola, 2006). Lamenting about this state of affairs, Owugah (2010) observes that The oil which brought so much wealth to the nation and those in power brought much poverty, disease, death, loss of livelihood, to the people of the oil bearing areas. <br/>With the emergence of a pan-Niger Delta militia group, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) in 2006, the struggle for local control of Nigeria’s oil assumed a more violent dimension. Apart from MEND that appears to have clearly articulated grievances namely Environmental Insecurity and Socio-Economic Marginalization of the Niger Delta people, sundry groups emerged in the Niger Delta as well. Some of these groups, it would appear, were driven not by liberation ideology but crime and criminality. Independently the activities of these groups created a difficult security challenge in Nigeria’s oil belt (Aaron, 2010). Oil installations were attacked and oil workers particularly expatriate staffs, at any rate, initially, were taken hostage for ransom. All these were happening, in spite of the heavy presence of the Joint Task Force (JTF), comprising of the Navy, Army and Air force, who were sometimes over ran by the superior fire power of the militants (Aaron, 2010). The implications of this parlous security were grave. Oil production figures plummeted to all time low, as many TNCs announced production shut-ins. Specifically, average production figure for 2009 was Around 1.6million barrels per day (bpd), down from 2.7milllion bpd(NNPC,2009). <br/>The country lost an estimated $92 billion in oil export earnings to production shut-in and crude oil theft associated with the activities of militants (Davis, 2009). The cumulative effect of this was a drastic fall in the country’s oil exports. Consequently, public finance was subjected to one of the worst crises since independence.In what appears an admission of the futility of violent response, late President UmaruYar’Adua, on 25th June, 2009, announced an amnesty for militants who were willing to surrender their arms. The amnesty programme was in phases: Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) (Aaron, 2010). Disarmament of militants entailed the physical removal of the means of combat from ex belligerents (weapons, ammunition). Demobilization is the formal and controlled discharge of active combatants from armed groups, followed by processing of individual combatants in temporary centres with provision of support packages. Reintegration entails the process of reintegrating former combatants/militants into civil society ensuring against the possibility of a resurgence of armed conflict (Nwachukwu &amp; Pepple, 2011).The first phase lasted between 6th August and 4th October 2009 (Newswatch, November 9, 2009). The amnesty programme has been hailed by many as successful given the quantity of arms surrendered by the militants. Five years after the proclamation of the amnesty and implementation of the major components of the programme by Goodluck Jonathan’s administration following the demise of President Musa Yar’Adua.<br/>1.2 Statement of the Problem<br/>The deployment of the Joint Military Task Force (JTF) to restore order and create a conducive atmosphere to do business could not tame the militants. However, no State relies exclusively on the use of violence or force to ensure social order. It resorts to non-violent strategies as well, especially, when it comes under intense pressure from the people which threaten the interest of its survival. At such times, the state makes what Parent (1974) terms “symbolic concession” to pacify the people. Thus, confronted with persistently intense agitation from the communities, the Nigerian State, in response, adopted the strategy of symbolic concessions. The State, thus, raised the percentage on derivation of the oil producing states from 1.5% to 3% and later 13% (Owugah, 2010). It is also within this context that the setting up of series of development commissions for the Niger Delta should be understood. The commissions started with the Niger Delta Development Board (NDDB) in 1960 followed by the Niger Delta River Basin Development Authority (NDRBA) in 1976, then the Oil Producing Areas Development Commission (OMPADEC) in 1992. Ibeanu (2002) argues that “OMPADEC became, in the popular consciousness of people of Niger Delta, another ruse designed to enrich the families and friends of the military government while pretending to be investing in the Niger Delta”. The failure of OMPADEC to achieve its desired expectations coupled with the intensity of Ijaw ethnic struggles led to the establishment of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) in 2000. The NDDC, like its predecessors, failed to record significant improvement in the welfare of the Niger Delta people because it gave room to financial misappropriation and profligacy (Omotola, 2007). Owugah (2010) argues “Therefore, by establishing these agencies, it pacifies some members of the communities and also gains the support of others in the non-oil producing areas. Secondly, it provides an avenue for patronage to members of its hegemonic class with the awards of contracts, consultancies and supplies of materials for the projects. These projects became another money-making source for members of the ruling class. For one thing, they were fully paid for contracts, even though the projects were not undertaken, abandoned or uncompleted. The Niger Delta landscape is littered with such projects. Yet, no one has ever been asked to refund any amount or prosecuted in the law courts”. When Late Musa YarAdua assumed office as the nation’s president, he came up with his own idea of developing the Niger Delta, which he tagged “Niger Delta Development Plan”. Nothing has been done in this regard. He also set up the Ministry of Niger delta Affairs. Again, on 25 June 2009 he granted amnesty to the “militants” via Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) to turn in their weapons within sixty (60) days (Aaron, 2010). In addition, they militants were to renounce violence through the execution of renunciation of militancy form. The repentant militants were to be paid the sum of N65, 000(about $430) per month for 42 months that the rehabilitation programme would cover. This is addition to daily feeding allowance of N1500 (about $10). Beyond disarmament, repentant militants are to undergo some form of skills acquisition to enable them live economically productive lives (Aaron, 2010). <br/>The leaders of the militants, including Ekpemupolo(Tompolo), Henry Okah, Asari Dokubo, Fara Dagogo, Ebi Ben, Ateke Tom, Saboma Jackrich (alias Egberipapa), gave up theirweapons. Tompolo and his group gave “117 assorted rifles, 5,467 rounds of live ammunitions, 20 camouflage bullet jacket, 26 camouflage uniform and two helmets. By official account, about 26,356 militants surrendered their arms at various disarmament centres. On the whole the total of 26,760 guns of different types 287,445 rounds of ammunition, 18 gun boats and 1090 dynamites were surrendered” (Omadjohwoefe, 2011).<br/>The Amnesty programme granted to the militants of Niger Delta has drawn the attention of writers. Omadjohwoefe (2011), Ibaba (2011), and Egwemi (2010) argued that, the amnesty initiative, though a unique approach, does not have what it takes to answer the Niger Delta question. Olatoke and Olokooba (2012) argued that the amnesty programme is yet to be passed into law and as such unconstitutional. Smoke (2009) opined that managers of the Nigerian system should develop strategies to deal with the post amnesty challenges and that all stakeholders need to be involved in actualizing the implementation of the post amnesty programme. Aluede (2012) argued that the way the programme has been implemented to cost several billion naira to benefit a few people who have committed crimes against the state is wrong.<br/>The efforts of scholars thus, appear to neglect the effect of the disarmament of the militants on crude oil production in Nigeria. It is, therefore, this gap among others in the literature that this study is aimed at filling based on the following research questions:<br/>1.  Does the Disarmament of Niger Delta militants increase crude oil production in Nigeria?<br/>2. Does the Demobilization of Niger Delta militants reduce kidnapping in the Niger Delta region?<br/>3. Does the Reintegration of Niger Delta militants fail to reduce oil pipeline vandalization?<br/>4. Whethercrises in the Niger Delta region do significantly affect the nation’s economy?<br/>5. Is amnesty programme a panacea to Niger Delta crises?<br/>1.3 Objectives of the Study<br/>The broad objective of study is to evaluate the impact of the amnesty programme granted to the Niger Delta militants and effects on national security in Nigeria. <br/>However, the study is set to achieve the understated specific objectives:<br/>1. To determine whether the Disarmament of Niger Delta militants increased crude oil production in Nigeria.<br/>2. To determine whether the Demobilization of Niger Delta militants reduced kidnapping in the Niger Delta region.<br/>3. To ascertain whether the Reintegration of Niger Delta militants failed to reduce oil pipeline vandalization.<br/>4. To determine whethercrises in the Niger Delta region do significantly affect the nation’s economy.<br/>5. To ascertain whether amnesty programme is a panacea to Niger Delta crises.<br/>Research Hypotheses<br/>For the purpose of this study null hypotheses were formulated and adopted;<br/>The Disarmament of Niger Delta militant does not increase crude oil production in Nigeria.<br/>The Demobilisation of Niger Delta militants do not reduce kidnapping in the region.<br/>The Re-integration of Niger Delta does not fail to reduce oil pipe line vandalization.<br/>Crises in the Niger Delta region do not affect the nation’s economy.<br/>Amnesty is not a better option for the resolution of conflicts in the Niger Delta, rather than force.<br/>1.5 Significance of the Study<br/>The research has both Theoretical and Practical significance. Theoretically, this study will contribute to the scholarly debate on the amnesty programme granted to the Niger Delta militants and effects on national security in Nigeria. This study explores the amnesty programme whose dynamics either impacts or transforms the lives of the people of the Niger delta region in Nigeria. It will also investigate the amnesty programme as panaceas for peace in the Niger delta region.<br/>Practically, the outcome of this study will be instrumental to socio-economic and political development of the Niger Delta in particular and the Nigerian state in general, it will help the policy makers to reposition, complement or change the strategies and methods of intervention in the Niger Delta so as to achieve maximum results. Finally, if the study succeeds in clarifying issues and facilitating understanding, it will enrich the pool of literature on the Niger Delta to the benefit of researchers and students.<br/>1.6 Scope of the Study<br/>    This work focuses on the threat which the Niger Delta crises is posing to national security of Nigeria, and the solution Amnesty Programme of Niger Delta region seeks to provide. No aspect of national security question can be understood in isolation, this is because as earlier mentioned the concept of national security is a very fluid one and deeply rooted in the history of Nigeria, the nature and dynamics also change in accordance with the history of the national and that of Niger Delta crisis. It is against this background that the study carries out comparative analysis of how Niger Delta related crisis and other regional and non-regional crisis are affecting national security, comparative approach provides the necessary yardstick of measuring the vicissitude of our case study. Apart from enhancing our understanding of the vicissitudes of the Niger Delta crisis and national security, discourse of some related crisis will provide us with the necessary tool, concept, model and methodology of analysis. <br/>    One of the best ways of achieving the desired result in the discourse of Niger Delta crisis and national security is to look  at it from the history perspective hence history is prerequisite to a good understanding of contemporary phenomenon. The complexity of the Niger Delta crisis and national security will make its analysis from a purely contemporary perspective to be inadequate, it is in the light of this, that the Niger Delta is traced from the 19th century when numerous states in the region were at longer head with one another over the control of production and exchange of palm oil down to the period of British invasion, the contribution of colonial rule cannot be overemphasized, the changing dynamics in the ip between one Niger delta community and the other have to be understood within the framework  of pre-existing relations. The discovery of crude oil at the tail end of the colonial rule is absolutely central to the discourse because it was the crisis and compromise connected with the exploitation of crude oil that gave the region its current stigmatization as one of the most volatile regions of the world.     <br/>    The study focuses on amnesty given to the people of this region as a solution to the crises in the region.<br/>1.7 Limitations of the Study<br/>    The limitations of this study are the volatile nature of the subject. Materials used for academic research require cross-examination because they all have their limitations, the limitations of materials used for this work can be best appreciated against the stand point of the fact that subjects related to crisis most importantly in the Niger Delta is fluid, the fact that I address the aspect of national security as it relates to the crisis in Niger Delta makes our discourse the one which require expertise in the collection, selection, analysis and in fact, interpretation of materials. All the groups in Niger Delta who were interviewed sometimes provides doctored information related to the problems under examination, government officials , private workers , militants and anti-Niger Delta groups also presents issues the ways it best known to them. Similar trend could be noticed in several newspaper’s reports and even published works on Niger Delta crisis and national security. <br/>     This is why all materials for academic research have their own limitations and have to be subjected to critical evaluation and security. It is in the light of this that cross-examination of data ultimately brings about judicious interpretation of facts as it is since national security issues have propound influence in determining the future of the oneness of the country. This study adopts thematic and chronological approaches , chronologically, it is important that we understand how Niger Delta Crisis and national security has unfolded from one period to another and the numerous forms and dimensions which therefore , assist in providing  a one by one or step by step analysis of the problem, aspect of this work which will be thematically discussed, are the ones related to the ways crisis have been affecting national security some of which are basically exposition. <br/>1.8 Definition of Terms  <br/>NIGER DELTA:The Niger River Delta in the South-South geopolitical zone of Nigeria.

For a comprehensive knowledge of the factors that determined the relations of both ethnic groups; it is important to also know about the geographical location of the Itsekiri and Urhobo people and their origin.<br/>The Itsekiri inhabit the North-western extremity of the Niger Delta in an area bounded approximately by latitudes 50 20’ and 60 N and longitudes 50 5’ and 50 40’ East. Their neighbours are the Bini to the North, the Ijo to the South the Urhobo to the East and the Yoruba of Ondo province to the North-West1. While the Urhobo speaking people of Delta state inhabit the area lying roughly between longitude 50 30’ and 60 25’ East and latitude 60 and 50 15’ North in Delta State of Nigeria. Their immediate neighbours are the Bini to the North, the Ijo to the South, Ukwuani and Isoko to the East and Itsekiri to the West2. <br/>The Nigerian geographical environment has not been static, its continuous exploitation has engendered a lot of changes which have affected the patterns of inter-group relation. The Urhobo are united not only by ties of ethnicity and culture, but also by the salient geographical features of the territory they occupy as their home land. The whole of Urhobo land is a deltaic plain, generally under 30 meters above mean sea level, without prominent hills rising above the general land surface. The climate is also uniform, being humid subequatorial rainforest climate with a fairly marked seasonality in rainfall distribution3. While the Itsekiri live around the Benin, Forcados and Escravos rivers in the western Delta, which is an area of many mangrove swamps. However, the Itsekiri of Warri town, the capital of the kingdom, lives on drier agricultural land4. The geographical location is very significance in discussing the inter-group relationship of the Urhobo and Iteskiri; socially they have been interrelated and commercially interdependent; while the geographical location of the Itsekiri gave them access to the Niger; the centre of early European commercial activities; the geographical location of the Urhobo people however made them known as producers of palm oil and kernel5, which in turn consequently led to inter-group relations.<br/>It will be very wrong to speak of Urhobo-Itsekiri relations as involving all Uhrobo land and all Itsekiri land, because there had not come to be a Pan-Urhobo interest among the Urhobo people, but in the case of the Itsekiri people, they had a socio-political system which was centralized. <br/>Firstly the origin of the Itsekiri people are like the theories of origin of people across the earths which are generally rooted in Fables and Mythologies so also are the origin of the Itsekiri and the Urhobo; but like others in creation they have found themselves settled in their present location6. John Sayag in the Iwere club journal in 1982 says: the people who constitute the tribe called Itsekiri have diverse origin, one of such is the origin based on migration. The migration origin claims that the founders of the capital Ode-Itsekiri, were men from Igala, south of the Nupe country near the confluence of the Niger and Benue. According to this account the migration was part of the Yoruba travelled in the direction of Ife, but a small band followed the creeks and founded what later became the capital Ode-Itsekiri. This view of the migration is used to explain the similarities between Itsekiri and Yoruba languages7. The Itsekiri speak language that has been amply demonstrated to be closely related to the Yoruba. Linguistics generally refer to their language as Yoruboid. Some group of the Itsekiri people known as the Omadino, Ugborodo and Ureju three towns, claims that they came from Ode in Ijebu country. While another Itsekiri tradition claim that they came from Ugbo in Ilaje-Ese Odo local government Area of Ondo state in Yoruba land8.<br/>Another source of origin of the Itsekiri people is based on legend, this account is recorded in William Moore’s work titled History of the Itsekiri; the account says that Iginuwa migration meant on arrival certain mythical beings whom he called Umale. Most of these beings fled on Iginuwa’s leadership, but one of these being was Itsekiri he remained and was so hospitable to Iginuwa that Iginuwa choose to call the new kingdom after him9. This version has been dismissed by historians, but what the legend try to explain is that there were people already inhabiting the area into which a Bini Prince and his party later moved in to join; although some accepted him others who was not impressed moved away to new areas.<br/>Origin of the Urhobo People: The Urhobo people, consist of  twenty two polities namely: Agbarha-Ame (Agbassa), Agbarha-Otor,Agbarho, Agbon, Arhvwarien, Avwraka, Ephron-Otor, Eghwu, Evwreni, Idjerhe, Aghara, Ogor, Okere(Urhobo), Okparabe, Okpe, Olomu, Orogun, Udu, Ughelli, Ughievwen, Ughwerun and Uvwie10. These politics are known as clans; they all make up the Urhobo people. These clans traced their origin to different sources, while some claim Benin origin, others Ijo and Ibo origin. Urhobo belong to the group of people whose written history is largely undocumented; there is almost an absent of early European records on Urhobo people. The early Europeans were preoccupied with economic interest with the Coastal communities. However in 1505 Pereira observed that the hinterland beyond the Forcados River lived the Subou or Sobo a name that is corrected to mean the Urhobo11. <br/>It is significant to note that the traditions of origin of the various Uhrobo groups do not contain specific reference to one ancestor, according to Hubbard and R. E. Bradbury the Uhrobo people trace their origin to three sources Benin, Ijo and Ibo, there are those who traced their migratory history directly from Benin ; others claim they moved to their present sites from Ijo land and yet a third group traced their origin to Ibo land even among those who traced their origin from Ijo group was not a straight line movement as there is trace of early initial movement from Benin and sojourn in Ijo country before finally settling down in their present site12. The Benin account of Urhobo origin is based on migration according to Jacob Egharevba: the early peoples of the Ishan and Afenmai division, the Eka and Ibo speaking people of the West bank of the Niger, Abou, Urhobo, Isoko and peoples of Onitsha are all emigrants from Benin13. Urhobo left under separate leaders in different direction to found separate governmental territories.<br/>According to Obaro Ikime14, five Urhobo clans have traditions which link them with some of the Ijo. The Ughelli clan as it claims founded by Ogele, a son of the founder Tarakiri Ibe who moved farther afield as a consequence of pressure of population on the original settlement. With him went two brothers, Agbarha and Ogo, who founded settlements now named after them. Ogele, however was accepted by the other two as the senior. The three settlements where sometimes referred to as Owha-clan. Ughelli tradition today confirms this version of their origin and Tarakiri is still used at formalgatherings as a kind of salutation. The clan of Ughienvwe and Ewu are said to have been founded from Ogobiri. According to the traditions Ughienvwe and Ogobiri where brothers who lived first at Ogobiri before some disagreement with their kinsmen forced them to move out. They followed the creeks down the Bomadi area where they settled for a while before they moved unto found the two Urhobo clans which bears their names. The Uwherun tradition speaks of a Bini warriorwho was father to Uwherun the founder of the clan, Uwherun is said to have fled from Benin because his men had accidentally killed one of the Bini Prince during a war. Two of his brothers Utwo and Motolo where among those who joined him in flight. The tradition indicates the three brothers settled somewhere in the eastern Delta; while Utowo and Motolo stayed permanently in the Urhobo clan which bears his name. The Urhobo clan of Uvwie would appear to be found by mixed group, Ijo tradition claims that Evhro was founded by immigrants from Erohwa in Isoko country. The people speak a language that bears striking resemblance from the point of view of a lame man to be the Erohwa tongue, and the Evhro town shrine and festivals are also very closely related Erohwa’s. It may be that both Ijo and Erohwa element fused in Evhro.<br/>Of the remaining Urhobo clans, Abraka, Aghou, Orogun and Olomu claim to have been founded from Benin. It must be stated however that close questioning of the elders failed to produce any great details other than the general claim that the founding ancestors moved away from Benin on account of the Oba’s hostility or fear of punishment after some misdemeanour. The Olomu traditions also indicate that at some point Ibo elements moved into the area and where assimilated into the population15.   <br/>The origin of the peoples of Delta state particularly the Urhobo and Itsekiri people one cannot speak with exactitude even when it’s based on British intelligence report; as they found themselves that is colonial officials who wrote these intelligent reports, sometimes having to write what their senior officers would like to read rather than what really is the peoples history. According to Obaro Ikime16, he said that in virtually all tradition of origin of the Urhobo people there is some reference to Benin; clearly it was fashionable to claim Benin origin because of the reputation that Benin attained in early times. However linguistics evidence has called to question claims of Benin origin by Urhobo and Isoko. According to Ben Elugbe17, the Edo language of Benin proper and Urhobo language are amongst others which have been classified as Edoid  and are of about the same antiquity. Thatmeans Urhobo people could not have developed new languages after migration from Benin. Elugbe 18 therefore points that the Bini, Urhobo, Isoko and other Edoid groups had a common origin in the distance past and migrated to their present locations in different waves at different times. If this be so, then the reference to Benin in tradition of the Urhobo could well be referring to later (rather than founding) migrations into areas already inhabited by groups who spoke the Urhobo language. It can therefore be argued that since the Benin migration was the latest, they are the most remembered19. <br/>    Having discussed the origin of both ethnic groups, it is important to state that origin in themselves cannot be used as determinant for inter-group relations; but each migrant went up to develop their own patterns of political organization but as times went on and as they existed side by side as neighbours both groups developed a socio-economic relation which is the focus of this research work; the intergroup relation between the Urhobo and Itsekiri people from early time to 1800. <br/>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY   <br/>    The aims and objective of this study includes:-<br/>To examine the geographical location of both ethnic groups and their origin and its effect on the pattern of inter-group relations<br/>To show how inter-group relation influences the social organization of the Urhobo and Itsekiri and its consequent similarities in various social aspect of lives of the people, from early times to the period under consideration.<br/>To examine the various economic development and commercial relation between both groups.<br/>To explain the nature of their relation and its importance to their survival. Areas of success and failures, areas of advantage and disadvantage based on the geographical location of individual ethnic group.<br/>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>This research work will focus on the history of Itsekiri and Urhobo people from early times and terminate at 1800.<br/>This research work shall be limited to a critical and analytical method for a valid knowledge of the inter-group relations between the Itsekiri and the Urhobo people.<br/>The study will cover all aspect of the lives of Urhobo and Itsekiri people based on available sources, to place this research work on historical perspective.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The importance of this research work is to develop a valid knowledge based on available sources on how two different ethnic groups has existed side by side and also to know the nature of their relationship and how their interaction had been from early times to 1800.<br/>Through the result gotten from this research it will contribute greatly to a more comprehensive and broader knowledge of educating other students of history and non history students who want to have a knowledge about inter- group relation concerning the Urhobo and Itsekiri people of Delta state. <br/>METHODOLOGY <br/>In the course of this research, relevant data from two main sources will be utilized. These are Primary sources and Secondary sources. The Primary source which will be utilized in this research includes Archival materials, unpublished government records, Government publications, News Papers, Private papers, Dairies, minutes of co-operate organization, correspondence, Pamphlets, Oral tradition gotten from  interviews; these will be utilized for a careful examination of inter-group relations between the two ethnic groups under consideration.<br/>Secondary sources will also be utilized in the course of this research, the secondary sources includes books written by scholars in history; particularly authors who have done considerable research and published their works on Niger Delta People particularly the Urhobo and Itsekiri. Also; the secondary source will be text books, journals and periodicals gotten from libraries across the country; internet materials, monographs and theses. With the information gotten from both sources, it will give research work factual backing for a better historical interpretation of the inter-group relations between the Urhobo and Itsekiri people.<br/>LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>These are literatures which deal with relevant aspects of the Urhobo and Itsekiri peoples and their area of inter-group relations. Some of these literature includes:- Obaro Ikime20. “The peoples and kingdoms of Delta Province”, in Obaro Ikime ed, Groundwork of Nigeria History this work specifically treats “The peoples of the kingdoms of the Delta Province” The origin of the people of Delta state and their trade system, the rise of kingdoms and inter-group relation. The author further examine in chapter ten of the work Nigeria before 1800: aspects of economic development and inter-group relations. This scholarly work not only examines the economic development of both groups but also talks about their interactions.<br/>Another work that will also be relevant to this long essay is the work by William Moore, History of Itsekiri21, this book examines the origin of the Itsekiri people using both mythologies and migration theories, it also went further to discuss the socio-political system and organization of the Itsekiri people in early times; this work will assist in giving a foundational knowledge of who the Itsekiri people are and how they establish their socio-political organization.<br/>Another major work in regard to the Urhobo people that will aid this research is by Onigu Otite, “A Peep into the History of the Urhobo” in The Urhobo People22, ed. Onigu Otite this work takes a careful look at the geographical location of the Urhobo people and also discuss the origin of the various clans that make up the Urhobo people and their socio-political organization and economic lives.<br/>Moreso J.O.S Ayomike, A History of Warri23, the focus of this book is on the Itsekiri, it examines the origin of the Itsekiri people that is how they came to be and the origin of their monarch and the establishment of a centralized system; this work will assist this research in the political organization of the Itsekiri people.  <br/>Also serving as a secondary source of this research work is R.E Bradbury and P.C Lloyd, The Benin Kingdom and the Edo Speaking people of Southern Nigeria together with a section on the Itsekiri24 these book will aid this research work as it examines the various Edoid linguistic groups in terms of their origin, physical environment, demography, social and political organization and main features of their economy and a section of Itsekiri socio-political and economic system, which gives a complete information about the Urhobo and Itsekiri People.<br/>Further more Obaro Ikime The Niger Delta Rivalry25, this book examines the indigenous  antecedents, the work is also concerned with the study of the two peoples ( Urhobo and Itsekiri )  the Itsekiri as well known fisher folks and traders, who occupy the coastal belt, while the Urhobo a hinterland agricultural people known for their dynamic socio-political system which their respective geographical location have been a determinant of the nature of their relation during the period under consideration on this research. <br/>Another Literature is by Anthony I. Ogbemi Ifediora, “Fishing in the Economics of Pre-Colonial (Ale-Iwere) Itsekiri land” in Pre-colonial economic History of Nigerian26 (ed.) I.A Akinjogbin and S. Osaba this work focuses on the pre-colonial economic system of early Nigerian people and in particular the Itsekiri economic system in pre-colonial times, it high lights an aspect of the economic history of the Itsekiri people which is fishing.<br/>Furthermore assisting this research work is the literature by Obaro Ikime, 27History, The Historian and The Nation. The work is a collection of essay and seminar papers delivered at different fora by Professor Obaro Ikime,it discusses inter-group relations in our culturally diverse nation in pre-colonial times and the role of the historian in reconstructing the past.<br/> Also Peter P. Ekeh Urhobo Studies28. This literature by Professor Peter P. Ekeh talks about every facet of the Urhobo people, their origin, language, social organization, political organization and economic activities, this work will also assist in a better research based on vital sources such as this.<br/> Another secondary source that will aid this long essay is by HRH Onajite Igere Adjara III and Andy Omokri, Urhobo Kingdoms Political and Social Systems28. This literature specifically focuses on the social system of the Urhobo people in early times and until date and also in the political Organization. This work emphases on the peculiarity of the egalitarian and republicanism kind of political system as power was not so centralized in early Urhobo society, it also discusses other Urhobo Clans that have also succeeded in establishing a central system and the recent emergence of monarchical system in clans where it was previously absent, but this work will aid this research in the area of socio-political organization of the Urhobo people in early times. <br/>Justin Okoroji Itsekiri, traditional worship this literature will assist this project work in the social organization of the Itsekiri people, as its talks about the religious believe of the  Itsekiri people their festivals and also their culture.   <br/>ENDNOTE<br/>Obaro Ikime, Merchant Prince of Niger Delta (London: Heinemann, 1968) 1. <br/>Onajite I.

Indeed, certain parts of the Niger formed the boundary between it and Nupe. Around latitude 5oN, they spread Westwards cutting across the whole of Dahomey and reaching into the East of Togo. From the coast, the country rises gradually from low-lying swampy regions with thick undergrowth to forest belt and finally semi or derived Savannah, which in Port Novo (Ajase) reaches almost to the coast. The weather is fairly stable, with two clearly defined seasons in the year, the rainy season and the dry season. The Yoruba must be one of the largest homogenous groups among Africans. Those of them living in Nigeria are currently numbered around fifteen million, when those in Dahomey and Togo are added, they are more.1<br/>The Yorubas are composed of several clans of which the chief are the Oyos, the Egbas, the Ifes and the Ijebus, while others of less importance are the Owus, the Ijeshas, the Ekitis and the Ondos. The inhabitants of Lagos, the chief town of Nigeria are also of Yoruba origin.2<br/>As far as it is known, the Yoruba didn’t in the past come under one centralized political authority. Rather, they existed (and still exist) in different groups and organized themselves, in the pre-colonial period, in separate kingdoms of varying levels of centralization and degrees of autonomy. However, they were bound together as a people by a number of factors. Firstly, in their tradition of origin, common descent from Oduduwa, a mythical personage who they regarded as their eponymous ancestor, secondly the ruling dynasties of most of their kingdoms derive origin and the provenance of their beaded crown and symbol of authority from Ile-Ife popularly acclaimed as the citadel of Yoruba culture and civilization and also a centre of dispersal of the Yoruba race. Thirdly, they share a common language which is widely understood by the different groups of people and recognizably the same despite dialectical difference. The Yoruba share a common cultural trait which makes them form a distinct cultural group in Nigeria.3<br/>The Yoruba origin has two version, one tradition of origin is a mythical creation which intimates that the Yoruba were the original inhabitants of the Ife area. At the dawn of time, the whole world was a watery waste. On the orders of his father-the Supreme God, Olorun – Oduduwa climbed down a chain from the sky. He brought with him a handful of earth, a cockerel and a palm-nut. He scattered the earth upon the water and it formed the land at Ile-Ife. The cockerel dug a hole in which Oduduwa planted the palm nut, and up sprang a mighty tree with sixteen branches, each the ruling family of an early Yoruba state. To this day, Oduduwa’s chain is preserved among the sacred relics of the Yoruba.4<br/>Another tradition indicates that the Yoruba people were produced by inter-marriage between a small band of invaders from the Savanna and the indigenous inhabitants of the forest. The story is that Oduduwa was the son of Lamurudu, sometimes described as a ruler from the east, sometimes as a prince of Mecca. When Islam was introduced into his homeland, Oduduwa refused to forsake the religion of his ancestors and he and his supporters were expelled from their native land. After long wanderings, they settled among the forest people and founded the state of Ife. Oduduwa had seven close descendants. Some traditions say they were his sons; others call them grandsons. These seven young men moved out to found the ruling families of seven new Yoruba states.5<br/>The Yoruba were also expert in their art, as far back as the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, they were expert in the use of wood, ivory and terracotta or baked earth, and hundreds of thousands of their carvings and models are still extant in Yorubaland. The art of the Yoruba is closely connected with their religion, for most of their art pieces were produced for the temples. In the first place, like most African peoples, the Yoruba believe in the existence of an Almighty God whom they call Olorun and in a future state. Hence they worship the dead, believe in a future judgment and in the doctrine of the transmigration of the soul.6 The Yorubas were also known for their cloth weaving, dyeing, iron smelting and trading. “The Yoruba caravan system” shows that despite inter-state warfare and competition, Yorubaland was integrated through commerce and long distance trade was important to the economy of Yorubaland despite the pervasive insecurity in the region during the nineteenth century.7<br/>The Yoruba political system was a centralized one in which the headship was retained in the king. The government in each Yoruba city was an intricate system of power relations, a complex web of checks and balances. Although, the executive and judicial functions were often invested in the Oba and his council alternative. Institutions were often established to check the powers of the Oba and his council.8 By the end of the 16th century the political organizations of most of the Yoruba kingdoms were probably complete and broadly similar. Each kingdoms consisted of a capital town, a number of subordinate towns, villages, markets, and farmlands. Each of the major kingdoms whose rulers claimed descent from Oduduwa ruled a clearly recognized (probably not too well-defined) territory.9<br/>The nineteenth century Yorubaland witness protracted internecine wars. These wars were accompanied by monumental changes, first was the emergence of refuge towns and the second was related to the first, it was the evolution of new forms of government in these refugee towns. These demographic and political changes took place in the first half of the century, and were sequel to the fall of the Old Oyo Empire. The wars leading to the fall of Oyo brought about a large-scale migration of people from war-torn areas to relatively peaceful places. Consequently a number of towns in the south became hosts to these refugees who moved in large groups and carried with them their corporate identities. The refugees founded new settlements as well. Ibadan, Ijaye and Abeokuta were notable examples.10</p> <p>Aims and Objectives<br/>The aims and objectives of this research project include:<br/>To examine as starting point the origin of the Yoruba.<br/>To examine the growth and development of the Yoruba in the pre-colonial period.<br/>To examine the nature of relations among the Yoruba in the pre-colonial period.<br/>To look at the various Yoruba sub-groups and the basis of their relations.</p> <p>Scope<br/>This research study intends to give a detailed analysis of the pre-colonial relations among the Yoruba. Although, it is claimed that there existed a series of autonomous but independent mini-states in parts of Yorubaland before the coming of Oduduwa migrants.<br/>The origin of the Yoruba will mark the starting point of this research work. The work will terminate in the 19th century with the collapse of the Oyo Empire and the rise of new states.<br/>Also, this study will cover the political, social and economic relations of the Yoruba people. This will enable us to understand the relations among them.</p> <p>Methodology<br/>The method of research used in this study is based on relevant data and information obtained from one main source: The secondary sources. These secondary sources are consulted in universities and public libraries. They are textbooks and journals, they are used to obtain standard and accurate information for an analysis of the pre-colonial relations among the Yoruba.</p> <p>Literature Review<br/>There are several literatures that have tried to provide an understanding of the Yoruba people starting from their origin to the coming of the Europeans. These literatures deal on relevant aspects of the Yoruba. There are however, certain literatures that give account of the origin of the Yoruba. I.A. Akinjogbin and E.A. Anyadele, “Yorubaland up to 1800”.11 According to them, there are two traditions of origin, the migration version which says that the Yoruba originally came from the north-eastern area of Africa, variously supposed to be Egypt, Yemen, ancient Meroe and Arabia, and settled in Ile-Ife after a journey. The other version, which is increasingly becoming more known in scholarly circles, relates that Ile-Ife was the centre from which the world was created. Both stories have one point in common. Oduduwa is remembered in both as a leader.<br/>In the aspect of economic development of Yorubaland,.. Akinjogbin, “the economic foundations of the Oyo Empire,12 among the foremost industry of the Yoruba, was cloth weaving, which appeared to have reached a very high degree of craftsmanship by the beginning of the eighteenth century, possibly earlier. Also, dyeing and then carving which took the form of making drums, mortars, pestles, door post and panels, also carving of images. Also, there was the iron smelting and iron industry it was equally widespread and basic to most of the industries. There are a number of relevant literature on the Yoruba political system. These include, S.A. Akintoye, Revolution and Power Politics in Yorubaland 1840 – 189313 and Adu Boahen, Topics in West Africa History14. S.A. Akintoye asserts that the Yoruba political system varied from place to place. That it is expected that in a country as extensive as that of the Yoruba, differences in environment and historical experience would result in the political institutions varying from area to area. He also said that it is reasonable to suggest that political institutions varied from time to time in each place, both in their structures and relative importance in the whole system. Adu Boahen, in his book titled, Topics in West Africa History, examines the central administrative system of Oyo, the Alafin who was the ruler, ruled with the advice of a council of about seven notables known as the Oyomesi, led by the Bashorun or Prime Minister. The Ogboni controlled the Alafin and the Oyomesi. Also, Oyo had unwritten constitution and a system of checks and balances.<br/>Also, in the social system of the Yoruba, Adu Boahen, Topics in West Africa History,15 he stated that the art of the Yoruba is closely connected with their religion, for most of their art pieces were produced for the temples. The Yoruba believe in the existence of an Almighty God whom they call Olorun, and also in a future state. Hence they worship the dead, believe in future judgment. E.B. Idowu, Olodumare: God in Yoruba belief, 16 he stated also the fact that Yoruba art is dominated by music. The Yoruba are a singing people. In their singing, which comprises songs, lyrics, ballads and minstrelsy, they tell stories of their past, the circumstances of their present and their hopes and fears of the future.</p> <p>CHAPTERIZATION<br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION<br/>This chapter provides a brief overview of the Yoruba.

It has stoked ethnic clashes and simmering unrest in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. It is against this background that the ECOWAS Moratorium and subsequently the ECOWAS Convention on small arms and light weapons (SALW) was adopted by member states. Such as the Amnesty programme organized by the Yar’dua’s administration in Nigeria. The study has been designed to critically appraise the 2009 Amnesty programme in Nigeria as an arms control measure. To achieve this aim, the study was guided by two research questions and two hypotheses. To analyse the issues generated, we predicated analyses on the Relative Deprivation theory. The theory x-rays what has continuously fuelled armed struggle in the Niger Delta in spite of the Amnesty programme. Our research design was non experimental and we relied on primary and secondary sources of data. After a detailed analysis of relevant data, the study revealed that even though it is too early to appraise the Amnesty programme<br/>in Nigeria, recent armed occurrences in the region has not even given the programme a step in the right direction. The study therefore, concludes that addressing the general poverty of the region can stem the tide of armed conflict instead of a massive rehabilitation of militants that surrendered their arms.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>The crisis in the Niger Delta of Nigeria is increasingly attracting international attention due both to the growing security threat it portends for the Nigerian stateand, particularly, due to its impact on international oil prices. Although the Niger Delta problem has been around for several decades, the emergence of organized and militant pressure groups in the 1990s has added a new dimension to the crisis.<br/>Protests and the threat of outright rebellion against the state are now ubiquitous. Environmental activism and militancy are a direct response to the impunity, human rights violations, and perceived neglect of the region by the Nigerian state on the one hand and through sustained environmental hazards imposed on local Niger Delta communities as a result of the oil production activities of multinational oil companies on the other.<br/>From a contemporary global perspective, the dramatic upsurge in violent confrontation and protest against the state and oil multinationals in the 1990s coincided with the end of the Cold War. In essence, ‘soft’ issues such as the environment, gender equity and equality, human rights, democracy and good<br/>governance have attained primacy on the international agenda. International concern over the crisis in the Niger Delta, including its attendant social and humanitarian implications, should be viewed within the context of this global attitudinal shift (Ojakorotu, 2009).<br/>The internationalization of the Niger Delta crisis derives partly from the systematic publicity and struggle of the environmentalist, the late Ken Saro-Wiwa. Saro-Wiwa not only succeeded in directing the attention of the international community to the plight of the people of the Niger Delta but also – through his advocacy – paved the way for robust international/civil society engagement with the issues at the core of the crisis in the region (Ojakorotu, 2009).<br/>Armnesty International (2009), states that, Ken Saro-Wiwa was executed, along with eight other members of the Ogoni people, by the Nigerian State in 1995. The executions alerted the world to the devastating impact of the oil industry in the Niger Delta, including how the environmental damage caused by the oil industry was damaging the health and livelihoods of the Ogoni people. Ken Saro-Wiwa was a<br/>leading figure in the 500,000-strong Ogoni community in Rivers State and played a key role in drafting the 1990 Ogoni Bill of Rights, which highlighted the lack of political representation, pipe-borne water, electricity, job opportunities and federal development projects for communities in the area. He was a founder and president of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), which demanded that oil companies and the government clean up the environment and pay adequate compensation and royalties to the oil-producing regions.<br/>International Crisis Group, ICG, (2006: i) argued that a “potent cocktail of poverty, crime and corruption is fuelling a militant threat to Nigeria’s reliability as a major oil producer”, and one might add, the banality of state power in the country.<br/>Prior to the 1990s, Niger Delta communities articulated their grievances within the framework of a peaceful but assertive demand for greater political and administrative autonomy, devolution of power and state creation. They believed these to be the best routes to bringing government closer to the people and setting the stage for sustainable political, economic and social development. Although there is still a<br/>strong undercurrent of politically defined agitations, the tactic has changed to that of a vociferous demand for greater fiscal allocations based on a reworked revenue allocation formula granting oil communities larger shares of oil revenue, and to resource control, i.e. the right of communities to own oil wealth while paying rent and royalty to the state. There are, of course, some justifiable grounds for these<br/>increasingly assertive demands. For instance, Ukeje (nd:6-7) noted that:<br/>After almost five decades of oil exploration and production, the oil communities have become miserably impoverished far more than other parts of the federation. ….host oil communities have watched as huge revenues accruing from crude oil went disproportionately towards the physical development of other regions, and caused reckless squandering by other regional elites, and their own too.</p> <p>That years of unregulated and irresponsible oil production have left many communities in irreversible ruins, even as their access to basic subsistence opportunities is undermined. And that oil communities’ argued with justification that prior to the advent of crude oil, the different regions developed on the basis of generous annual fiscal allocations based on the principle of derivation. But with oil displacing other commodities, the revenue allocation formula has steadily nosedived: from 100% to 50% and presently, 13% (Ukeje, nd:6-7).<br/>It is a curious irony that communities hosting the oil and gas industry in many weak and developing countries often lived in abject poverty, unemployment, poor health, etc . Idemudia and Ite (2006: 402) believed that the paradox of oil wealth is the byproduct of structural deficiencies inherent in the Nigerian State.<br/>In Nigeria, the culture of impunity and the easy availability of small arms diminish people’s capacity to be open and be tolerant with each other. The possibility of conflict is intensified by the oil exploitation in Niger Delta region, where underdevelopment is caused by environmental damage and the inequitable sharing of petro-dollars. Not even the Federal Government that should mediate conflicts has<br/>demonstrated any neutrality. It dispenses more violence invoking the bogey of “national security”. This undermines humanitarian principles and poses a challenge  for governance, threatening the stability of the country. Peace and security is a sine qua non for sustainable development in any society. Thus in the Niger Delta region, where there is a large influx of small arms and where peace and security are noticeably absent, there is a need for concerted analysis and action.</p>\n\nECOWAS AND ARMS CONTROL IN WEST AFRICA; A FOCUS ON THE NIGER-DELTA AMNESTY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ECOWAS AND ARMS CONTROL IN WEST AFRICA; A FOCUS ON THE NIGER-DELTA AMNESTY", "id": 8}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE NIGER DELTA CRISIS: IT’S IMPACT ON NIGERIAN’S NATIONAL SECURITY</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In 2002, an international observation proclaimed the Niger Delta as one of the most volatile regions of the world. This observation came on the heels of incessant crisis which the region have been witnessing for decades but which took alarming dimension in loosing years of the 1990’s and the opening years of the new millennium. The region from one decade to another has witnessed unprecedented crisis which revolve round political and most importantly economic factors. Also from one decade to another the nature and dynamics of crisis in the region have changed, the transformations which the crisis took from the one period to another have paved way for its institutionalization in the history of the region and Nigeria in general.1 If the institutionalization in the history of the Niger Delta crisis in the politics and economy of the country is something to discuss, the threat which it has been posing and still posing to domestic and international security of the Nigerian nation state is an aspect which requires critical academic enquiry.</p> <p>A systematic analysis of the crisis is informed by my intention to identify the changing dynamics of what constitutes national security over the years and how the nation state of Nigeria have been contending with the threat which the Niger Delta crisis is posing to the so called national security. National security questions is a complex of political, legal, social, economic, ideological and military problems that arises in the course of a people struggling for political and economic independence and for the establishment of equal and friendly relations with other people in the bilateral and international affairs.</p> <p>It is imperative to see how regional based crisis affect the survival of the entire country and how the political entity called Nigeria have been dealing with the changing dynamics of the crisis, the current study therefore understands that the concept of national security is fluid and dynamic. All nations of the world contend and will continue to contend with the challenges arising from the national security. To Nigeria, the complicated nature of the Niger Delta crisis poses serious and enduring threat to the fragile nature of Nigerian democracy and the ever volatile national security.</p> <p>What this work explores is the complexity involved in the maintenance of national security which arose as a result of the crisis in the Niger Delta. For the purpose of this research, the concept of National Security questions and the contributions of Niger Delta crisis are both international and domestic in nature.</p> <p><strong>1.2       </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>In this work, I attempt to answer the entire questions of the place of crude oil in the escalation and the reduction of the Niger Delta crisis. The significance of the other exigencies or factors in the crisis? The contributions of the Multinational Corporation and different political ferments in the region? The Niger Delta crisis cannot be understood without a critical understanding of the relationship between individual communities on the one hand and with the federal government on the other hand which revolve round the control of resources and retarded infrastructural, economic and social development in the region.</p> <p>To what extents have the crisis constitutes threats to national security? Put differently, what is the threat which the crisis is posing to the Nigeria’s nascent democracy? How crisis have metamorphosed in the all-embracing concept of national security is also analyzed and the entire attempts made by the federal government to preserve legitimacy in the name of the fundamental national security are not left undiscussed.</p> <p>Niger Delta crisis at every point in time have threatened the primacy responsibility of the government in terms of security of lives and properties and the preservation of oneness of Nigeria as a single political entity.2 National security transcends the primary role of the government in the protection of lives and properties. It also involves the international security and sovereignty. The gagging question is: is the Niger Delta crisis posing any threat to the international security and sovereignty of the Nigerian nation?</p> <p><strong>1.3       </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>National security questions and the role played by the Niger Delta crisis is theme which requires adequate scholarly attention.</p> <p>The objective of this study therefore are</p> <p>1.   To look at how the Niger Delta crisis affects Nigerian national security.</p> <p>2.   To locate the impact of the Niger Delta crisis within the framework of its implication of national security.</p> <p>3.   To see how regional based crisis affect the survival of the entire country.</p> <p>4.   To identify the changing dynamics and what constitutes nationals security over the years and how the nation state of Nigeria has been contending with the crisis.</p> <p>5.   The place of rude oil in the escalation and in the reduction of the Niger Delta crisis.</p> <p>6.   The significance of the other exigencies or factors in the crisis.</p> <p>7.   The contribution of the multination corporation and different political ferments in the regions.</p> <p><strong>1.4       </strong><strong>JUSTIFICATION</strong></p> <p>The justification for this work can best be appreciated from two major perspectives namely, the need to carryout a critical academic analysis of he origin of the Nigeria Delta Crisis and an appraisal of the impact of the Niger Delta Crisis on national security, hence the changing dynamics of the crisis and the high degree of internationalization which its taken in recent years. The internationalization of the Niger Delta Crisis is as old as the history of the crisis itself; however, in recent years the concern of the international community is getting higher and higher.</p>\n\nTHE NIGER DELTA CRISIS: IT’S IMPACT ON NIGERIAN’S NATIONAL SECURITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE NIGER DELTA CRISIS: IT’S IMPACT ON NIGERIAN’S NATIONAL SECURITY", "id": 9}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CONFLICT AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</p> <p>A CASE STUDY OF THE BAKASSI PENINSULA</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS                             </p> <p>Title Page                                                          </p> <p>Table of Contents                               </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>Understanding Conflict and Conflict Resolution</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p>The Genesis of the Nigerian – Cameroon Boundary Dispute</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p> <p>The ICJ Judgment                                               </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></p> <p>Conclusion                                         </p> <p><strong>Bibliography                                           </strong></p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>UNDERSTANDING CONFLICT AND</strong></p> <p><strong>CONFLICT RESOLUTION</strong></p> <p>The focus of this work is on conflict and conflict resolution in international relations. It examines the Bakassi Peninsular disputes as a case study of supranational conflicts and conflict resolution in international system.  This chapter examines the concept of conflict, its various causes and what makes it a permanent feature of the human society and the international system. It defines supranational conflicts, its types and the various machineries that are in place in the international system for the resolution of international dispute. Lastly, the chapter identifies and explains the various methods of dispute resolution.</p> <p>Conflict is a state of discord caused by the actual or perceived opposition of needs, values and interests. It exist whenever incompatible activities occurs.1 An activity that is incompatible with another is one that prevents, blocks, or interferes with the occurrence or effectiveness of the second activity. Conflict has also be defined as “when two or more parties, with perceived incompatible goals seeks to undermine each other’s goal seeking capacity”.2Conflict is different from competition and co-operation because in competitive situations, the two or more individuals or parties have mutually inconsistent goals, as either party tries to reach it goals it undermine the attempt of the others to reach others. Therefore, competitive situations will, by their nature, caused conflict.3 Conflict can also occur in cooperative situations, in which two or more individuals or parties have consistent goals because the manner in which one party tries to reach its goal may undermine the other individual or party.</p> <p>A clash of interest, values, actions or directions often spark a conflict and conflict is also seen as the existence of the clash.4 Psychologically, a conflict exists when the reduction of one motivating stimulus involves an increase in another. The word ‘conflict’ is applicable from the instant the clash occurs. Even when it is described as a potential conflict, it is implying that there is already a conflict of direction even though a clash has not occurred.5 As a result conflict can occur whenever there is interaction. Leo Otoide describes this situation in the international system thus:</p> <p><em>…when states interact there is competition for power and prestige and in the process, the international system elicits a picture of perpetual conflict, of survival of the fittest, where the desire for power and influence determines the attitudes of states and the course of events.6</em></p> <p>Consequently, conflict can been seen as part of human society and the international system at large.</p> <p>Conflict is also the incompability of goals or values between two or more parties in a relationship, combined with the attempts to control each other and antagonistic feelings towards each other. The incompability or difference may exist in reality or may only be perceived by the parties involved. Nonetheless, the opposing actions and the hostile emotions are very real hallmarks of human conflict.7 Conflict occurs between people in all kind of human relationships and in all social settings. As a result of the wide range of potential differences between people, the absence of conflict usually signals the absence of meaningful interaction.8 A conflict can be as small as a perceived disagreement or as large as war. It can originate in the person, between two or more people, or between two or more groups. Conflict by itself it neither good nor bad but the manner in which conflict is handled determines whether it is constructive or destructive.</p> <p>There are many sources of conflict, the most common of these sources is the struggle for economic gains. This occurs in a situation where there are competing motive to attain scarce resources. Each party wants to get the most that it can and the behaviour and emotions of each party are directed towards maximizing its gain.9 The Nigerian-Cameroon boundary dispute where each party tries to gain the peninsular is an example of economic conflict. Another example is workers’ union and management conflict. Conflicts can also be caused by value when incompability in ways of life, ideologies – the preferences, principles and practices that people believe in. This was the case in the cold war which has a strong value component, wherein each side asserts the rightness and superiority of its way of life and its political economic system.</p> <p>Power conflict occurs when each party wishes to maintain or maximize the amount of influence that it exerts in the relationship and the social setting.10 It is impossible for one party to be stronger without the other being weaker in terms of influence over each other. Power conflict ensures which party usually end in a defeat. It can occur between individuals, between groups or nations, whenever one or both parties choose to take a power approach to the relationship. Power also enters into all conflict since the parties are attempting to control each other. Also, it must be noted that most conflicts are not of a pure type, but involve a mixture of sources. For example, union-management conflict often involves different ideologies or political values in addition to the economic competition at the background. The more sources that are involved, the more intense and intractable the conflict usually is.</p> <p>Miscommunication and misunderstanding can create conflict even when there are no basic incompabilities. In addition, parties may have different perceptions as to what the facts are in a situation and until they share information and clarify their perceptions, resolution is impossible. Self-conteredness, secretive perception, emotional, prejudices are all forces that lead one to perceived situations very differently from the other party. Lack of skill in communicating what we really in a clear and respective fashion often result in confusion, hurt and anger, all of which simply feed the conflict process by making it more complex.11</p> <p>Conflict have a definite tendency to escalate that is, to be come more intense and hostile and to develop more issues on what the parties say the conflict is about. Escalating conflicts becomes more difficult to manage. The process of escalation feed on fear and defensiveness. Threat leads to counter threat and the self-fulfilling prophecy comes into play:</p> <p><em>Each party believes in the evil intentions of the other and inevitability of disagreement, and therefore taken precautionary actions which signal mistrust and competitiveness. When the other party then responds with a counter action, this is perceived as justifying the initial precautionary measure, and a new spiral of action and counter-action begins through the norm of reciprocity, stronger attempts to control are met only with stronger resistance, but more contentious attempts to gain the upper hand.12 </em></p> <p>With each succeeding spiral of conflict, polarization grows and the parties becomes more adamant and intransigent in their approach to the situation. Even though the intensity of the conflict may moderate for the periods of time, the issues remain, and triggering events induces conflictual behaviour with negative consequences, and the conflicts make one more step up the escalation staircase.13 When party becomes locked in a conflict they are usually unable to get out by themselves, and the intervention of a third party to play the role of arbitrator, mediator or consultant may be required.</p> <p>Supranational conflicts are conflicts that involved states or in which one of the parties is a state. There are three common types of supranational disputes: disputes involving maritime boundaries, disputes involving land and investor-state dispute also known as investment treaty disputes.14 These disputes are different from commercial disputes in many ways.</p> <p>First, supranational disputes are likely to be death with by special tribunals that deal with international conflict resolution and settlement such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the Permanent Court of Arbitration (FCA), The International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) or the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).15 Pure Commercial dispute, on the other hand, are likely to be death with in national courts or by international commercial arbitral bodies such as the International Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSED) and the New York Convention on Commercial disputes.</p> <p>In resolving supranational conflicts, it is important to bear in mind that, unlike other conflicts, it is likely to arise out of a treaty. For example, a maritime delimitation disputes may be governed by the 1982 law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS III) or an investor-state dispute by the international settlement of investment dispute convention and the court is to apply international conventions, international customs and the general principles of laws recognized by the nations in question.</p> <p>Anthony Connerty summarized the special characteristics that make supranational dispute different from commercial dispute:</p> <p><em>…they are likely to be heard by one of the supranational dispute resolution bodies such as the ICJ: the issues may require to be decided in accordance with the provisions of a treaty; the principles of international law are likely to be applied, and, in the case of an ICSID award, the provision of the New York Convention are not relevant to enforcement.16</em></p> <p>There are various methods of dispute resolution. The most common among them is negotiation. Negotiation consist of discussion between officially designated representatives designed to achieved the formal agreement of other governments in an issues that is either shared concern or in dispute between them. Negotiation has been divided into three distinct stages: pre-negotiation, formal negotiation and agreement.17</p> <p>Good offices is another method of conflict resolution it involves the assistance of a third party or state not a party to the dispute. The third party in adhering strictly to the limits of good offices, may offer only a channel of communications or facilities for the use of parties but may not offer any suggestions for terms of settlements.18 It promotes a settlements without getting involved in the issues at stake.</p> <p>Inquiring is another methods of conflict resolution. It is the process of fact-finding by a neutral team of investigators. Often the fact underlying a particular conflict are in dispute among the parties and a clarification by an impartial commission will facilitate settlement.</p> <p>In mediation, the mediator is a third party and primarily a facilitator who seeks to established or restore communication between feuding parties. The mediator strives to bring the parties face to face to negotiate and this constitutes a vital objective of his endeavous, the mediator must have good influence, credibility and good standing with the parties. Above all, he must have good diplomatic skill.19</p> <p>Another method of conflict resolution is conciliation which is similar to mediation except for the legal distinction that the third party is a commission or an international body whose aid has been sought in finding a solution satisfactory to the disputants.</p> <p>Arbitration is a step further tan a fact finding mission since it involves the practical examination of the issues involved in a crisis and the decision is binding on the parties. Often a tribunal is set up to examine the issues and make recommendation to a superior body.20</p> <p>Adjudication or judicial settlement is a process of submitting to an international covert for decision. Unlike arbitration, the covert is subjected to no preliminary litigations upon its procedures, evidence to be considered or legal principles to be applied except those stated at the statute by which it was created.21</p>\n\nCONFLICT AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONFLICT AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS", "id": 10}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><b>Conflict management strategies and performance in Abi Local government area of Cross River state,</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>Chapter One</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>Introduction</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.0   </b><b>Background of the study   </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>       Understanding the right strategies Abi local government area of Cross River State will apply to manage intra and interstate conflict is very essential to its administrative responsibilities, because this is one sector any administration in the area will want to put more interest by deploying all available resources, in other to improve his performance towards socio-economic development. Applying the right strategies in conflict management is important because of the numerous challenges it brings to the growth and development of any society or organization (Olakunle, 2008).</p> <p>       According to Olakunle, (2008), with a basic understanding of the conflict management strategies, small organizations and societies can better deal with conflicts before they escalate beyond repair. Estes &amp; Wang,  (2008) further identified the following; accommodating, avoidance, Collaborating, compromising, and competing methods as the best strategies in managing conflicts in any organization or society. Management of conflict is very essential for development to prevail in an organization, but  considerations on the high costs of  managing conflict and the consequences it may bring to any organization or society cannot be pre-determine, hence the need for  adopting the above mentioned strategies becomes very imperative (Bartlett, 2010).</p> <p>       According to Cross River State report on conflict resolution in 2010, different categories of conflicts have been recorded in several communities of Abi local government area with their neighboring communities both within the state and neighboring Ebonyi  and Abia state respectively. Some of these conflicts include; the conflict between Igbo Imabana and Assiga community in Neighboring Yakurr L.G.A, the conflict between Anong and Ekori community in neighboring Yakurr local government Area, and other interstate cases of conflicts too numerous to mention. Other cases of conflicts that have been identified as interstate conflicts in Abi local government area of Cross River State which seem to be the most recent conflict is the conflict between Adadama community and Amagu communities in Ikwo local government area of Ebonyi.  Eyewitnesses said the crisis arose from a renewed land dispute between Adadama and Amagu communities. </p> <p>       The study on conflict management strategies and performance in Abi Local government area of Cross River state, indicates that how conflict is managed in the society  impacts the process and outcomes of conflict, both for individuals and for organizations. Poorly managed organizational conflicts affects the level and frequency of future conflicts and has a negative effect on learning, productivity, and job performance (Meyer, 2004).</p> <p><b>1.1 Statement of the Problem</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>       Applying the right strategies is a challenge towards effective Conflict management in most societies  and this trend has an adverse effect on the society or organization  not being enable  to achieve its set objectives in terms of socio-economic development, due to poor management of conflict thereby resulting to prolong stay of conflicts and also generating of more conflict . So many societies have broken down for their failure to adopt effective conflict management strategies, the entire globe is seriously threaten with different categories of conflicts which have been seen to be poorly managed due to their failure to adopt effective conflict management strategies (Paul &amp; Dean, 2002).  Africa in particular is facing very serious times in terms of different degree of unresolved conflicts for one reason or the other, hence the need for adoption of effective conflict management strategies becomes a challenge to every societies or organizations if they must improve in performance.   </p> <p>       The problem of differences in opinion is however prevalent in every society and this becomes an impeding factor towards adopting effective conflict management strategies which results to  stagnating  developmental activities in most societies .</p> <p><b>1.2     </b><b>Objectives of the study</b></p> <p>The main objective of this study is, to analyse the strategies of conflict management and  performance as relates to Abi local government area of Cross River State.

This local government area is chosen because of ease in accessibility and also being local government area with diverse goals. The limitation of the study is due to insufficient financial resources, time and materials that have hindered the researcher from travelling  to every part of Abi local Government Area in other to source for vital information from Areas that have experience one form of conflict or the other.</p> <p><b>1.6 Significance of the Study</b><b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study will be of value to organizations both public and private in order for them to identify some salient causes of conflicts and to be able to manage the situation judiciously using some of the conflict management strategies as mentioned above. The study will also arouse both states and federal government interest to see the need in providing adequate resources to local government areas and also speed up the process of local government autonomy in order to minimize the rate of conflicts in this third tier of government that is directly responsive to the grass root. The study will also provide a platform for management of organizations to direct resources appropriately in order to minimize conflicts situations in the workplace. The study is also expected to be of great value to academicians and practitioners in the field of conflict management, public relations and public administration. The study can also be useful to researchers for further studies.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>1.7 Historical Background Of The Study Area: Abi Local Government Area</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>       Abi local government area was first created in 1983 during the shagari’s administration and was later abolished due to the overthrow of that administration a in a coup de tat in December 1983.The present Abi local government area was recreated out of the defunct Ugep local government area in 1991 by the General Ibrahim Babangida  Administration.</p> <p>       People from Abi include Come from mainly Ethnicities such as the Agbo subgroup of Igboland  and the Bahumono (thisdayonline ,2004).</p> <p>       One of the largest tribes within Abi Local Government is Bahumono, which includes seven villages  namely : Ediba, Anong, Usumutong, Afafanyi, Igonigoni, Ebom, and Ebiriba. There are linguistic differences among the Bahumono people with the major variant being the Ohumono language. They are all historically known to have migrated from a place within the hills of Ruhura (ekpon a ruhura) called Hotumusa (old town) which lies in a region between the present day Ediba and Usumutong villages. The Ediba people at Hotumusa had hunters who found a riverine location where Ediba situates presently. The hunters related the news to her people and Ogbudene led the people in a siege against the locals of the river dwelling and drove them across the river. Four of Five of the Ediba families namely: Henugwehuma, Henusokwe, Enihom and Henuowom  quickly left and colonised the river area. The Ezono clan made up of Bazorang, Batonene and Fonahini, the last family, decided to stay back at Hotumusa, where they had always been the head land owners and leading family among the other five. This small clan has had its own dynastic legacy, festivals, deities and new yam celebrations to this day.</p> <p>Lying midway on the Cross River , Abi local government area  stretches between longitude 8.00 to 8.100 E and latitude 5.000 to 6.300 N. It is bounded on the north and west by Abia and Ebonyi states respectively and on the east and south by Yakurr and Biase Local Government Areas. It has an estimated population of about 112,941 people And a land mass of approximately 334.5316sqkm, the occupation of the people is predominantly farming activities such as livestock, fishing and cash crops.</p> <p><b>1.8 Definition of terms</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b> Strategy:-</b> is a high level method put in place to achieve one or more goals under conditions of uncertainty.

According to the Central Bank of Nigeria (2000) a precursor of such change capable of fostering development is the ability of policy makers to induce desirable changes in the economic structure of any nation. Such polices must induce a wide range of changes in the entire social system, tuned to the diverse basic needs and desires of individuals and social groups within the system. Also, it should move away from a condition of life that is widely perceived as sub-standard as experienced in the rural areas and towards condition of life regarded as materially and spiritually better1.</p> <p>Rural development, is a process of  not only increasing the level of per capita income in the rural areas but also of the standard of living of the rural population, where the standard of living depends on such factors as food,  nutrition level, health, education, housing, recreation and security2. On the other hand, rural development is seen in terms of the condition and percentage of the labor force in the agricultural sector, although it is argued that a program of rural development should go beyond agriculture to include the country's total economic development in rural areas because about 70 percent of Nigeria's labor force is employed in the agricultural sector, which is characterized by a predominance of small-scale production using mostly local inputs3. </p> <p>Globally, women’s influence and contribution in the developmental process  has become very significant to the extent of drawing the attention of most authorities to a point of consideration and need to create equal opportunities between women and their male counterpart. Nigerian women has a recognized place in society which makes it possible for gifted ones among them to rise to positions of political, economic and social eminence from which they led and dominated not only their fellow  women but men as well. Some schools of thought believe that women all over the world have contributed immensely to the development of nations while other school of thought believe that women have contributed nothing rather than their domestic affairs such as family welfare, of which in the case of Nigeria women has contributed a lot towards to national development, hence this goes to show that the role of women in society cannot be over emphasized in the functions they perform both at the state and federal level4.</p> <p> In the past women have been described as mothers of the nation, it is believed that many society hardly develop without women, generally, in Nigeria, there has been great apathy on the past of women and especially those from Abiriba community. </p> <p>However, Nigeria women have involved themselves in developmental activities like politics economy and social  development since the independence. Notable women activist during pre-independence like late Mrs.  F. Ransome Kuti, and of recent chief Mrs. Bola Balatope, Mrs. Margaret Ekpo, Late Mrs. Kudurat Abiola, Dr. Mrs. Jokumba. Dosuma, Chief Mrs. Bosede Oslin have distinguished themselves due to the roles they played in the emancipation of Nigeria women and the society at large5.  </p> <p>The role of the rural women in the development of their society overtime has be a contending issue among people of various fields of study especially scholars of development. Therefore, this study examines the role of women in rural development  with particular attention on Abriba Local Government Area of Abia State in Nigeria as case study. </p> <p><b>1.1 Statement of problem</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Despite significant improvements since attainment of independence in Nigeria like many nations in the developing world, extreme poverty remains widespread. The Nigerian economy began to experience recession from the early 1980 and as a result, she moved from middle level income and a developing industrial nation to become one of the poorest nations in the world (Central Bank of Nigeria, 2002-2003). Specifically, the incidence of poverty has been high and upward swinging since 1980. Data from the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) on the poverty profile of Nigeria (1999) showed that the incidence of poverty rose from 28.1 percent in 1980 to 46.3 percent in 1985 but dropped slightly to 42.7 percent in 1992 before rising to 65.6 percent in 1996.</p> <p>The rural areas in most parts of Nigeria exhibit great poverty, poor health condition and ignorance as a result of varying degree of geographical, social and political isolation. In Nigeria, more than 75% of the population live and work in rural areas though the emphasis of spatial planning has for a long time been on urban areas rather than regional problems whereby the rural areas would have benefited. This has led to the relegation of the rural areas to the background in the spatial economy of the country resulting in a wide spread of rural-urban migration of able women. This problem has been compounded by unattractive opportunities of generating income from agriculture.</p> <p>Women rarely have access to the resources that would make their work more productive and ease their heavy workload. Ultimately, it is not just women who are held back, but also their families, their communities and local economies. Despite their many responsibilities, women have significantly less access to the resources and services they need to increase their productivity and their income and ease their burden of household duties. Women are held back by lack of education, unequal property rights and limited control over resources. It is on this backdrop that this research will examine the role of women in rural development with particular attention to Abriba Local Government Area of Abia State.</p> <p><b>1.2</b><b> Aim and objectives of Study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p> Having observed the various problem militating against women participation in the attainment of development in areas as policy making, implementation and involvement in the program and projects for development it is therefore needful to point it out here that we communities should make use of it’s human (non-power) resource available for the attainments of development.</p> <p>          The purpose for this study is aimed at encouraging women at the rural communities that they have to rise up to the challenge of emancipating themselves from the old views held about them in the society. the research work aimed at informing agents of government responsible for positive growth and development to give adequate support to women so that they can appreciate their roles and play it better than before.</p> <p>          To examine the involvement of Abiriba women in the development of the community starting from the pre-colonial period and extend to the contemporary time and to educate the men folks on the needs to accommodate the women properly in all issues relating to the society, although right from the creation of the world the women are regarded as helpmate.</p> <p><b>1.3     Scope of the study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study is intended to address various issues as it affect the role women play in community development using Abiriba as a case in point. All these include position of women in the decision making process of the community, the examination of the level of women participation in political social  development in Abiriba in particular. The study will examine some of the obnoxious culture and tradition of the people that end anger or limit the economic contribution by women in community development.</p> <p><b>1.4      Research methodology </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This research project made use of two (2) major source which are primary and secondary sources. The primary sources used for this study are oral interviews conducted within the area covered by the research.</p> <p>          The secondary sources were gotten from published works among which are: text books journals internet publication.</p> <p><b>1.5     Literature review</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>There is need for a review of the work and opinions of some scholars on the role of women in rural development. To this end a couple of review have been presented below;</p> <p>          According to C.B Nwahukwu in his book “Development and administration in New and emergent states”, he defines development as an integral process of indenting opportunities for individual social groups and territorially organized communities at small and intermediate scale and mobilizing the full rang of their capacities and resources for the common benefit in social, economic and political terms. He further argued that the specific type of development initiated by the politico-administrative elites is the most suitable one for all the other members of society and should therefore replace other existing notions of development.</p> <p>          However, C.B Nwachukwu saw women as a catalyst in the developments process. He argued that women occupied a very important social, economic political position in pre-colonial Nigeria. It is said that in all the main areas of economic activity agricultures, trade and manufactures, women played outstanding roles. They were major sources of labour in agricultures.</p> <p>          Anikpo, M.O.C. in his book titled “Foundation for Social Science Research”  argued that the western type of education sets new set of social values and legal systems act as some of the reason for women, inferiority. Yet for Nigeria; at least the Federal Office of Statistical (FOS) estimated the rural women population of Nigeria to be 51.6% in 1985. The 1991 provisional census figure shows the women constitute 49.6% of Nigeria’s population. In this study area used here, women constitute of 50.48% which is very close to national figure. Two inferences can be made from the above statistics. The first is that it will be sheer planning and executive development efforts. Secondly, women are likely to be the best contributors and the most affected by the consequence development efforts in any community. Thus women constitute a critical proportion of the productive population of Nigeria. “Africa politics” by Emezi, C.E and Ndoh C.A said that women contribution to environmental development are many. The role of women in the environmental education start from home with the different vigorous domestic work chores. Children are taught, which ranges from sweeping to cleaning and washing both plates and their body. In doing so they don’t only learn to keep the environment clean. By so doing the women train their children on the basic environmental ethics ranging from body clearing to general house cleaning. They are indeed the first known environment educators.</p> <p>          O Moachu cited in Ndoh’s book on “African Politics” revealed that women play a decisive part when it comes to fighting poverty. In Nigeria women are exposed to considerable discrimination even though they assume a particular important key role in this country’ process of development inspite of relatives  improvement, politic. This ugly situation had negative effect not only on their effective participation in development programmes but also on their development programmes but also on their capability to attain self realization and fulfillment.</p> <p>          Lai Oturode in “women and social changes in Nigeria” he agrees that he traditionally and historically, women occupied various positions in various societies. In ancient Rome Althens and Egypt for instance women occupied various position which were defined by the cultural norms and values of these societies rather than what they would get for them. Dr. Sophic B. Olurode agreed the traditional African societies would reserve remarkable power for women but inspite of this, they were not allowed to use their power. The issue remains that going by the functionalist approach, women are a part of the society and have certain functions that they exhibit.</p> <p>          According to Afigbe, A. E in his book title “Women as a factor in Development”, agreed that to the extend mankind needed all it’s physical and mental energy to achieve the much longed for transformation of their environment and social condition of existence, women regarded as units of physical energy came to be seen in new height as very  important factors for success in development. He went further to argued that essentially preoccupied with the orthodox volition of domestic roles and achievement finely did not see it fit to consider that it was possible that it was the secure home and domestic happiness place which the silent women of Rome provided for their men folk that made them to venture out and perform the brave deed.</p> <p>          As pointed by Okojie M. I. “Women in Management”, paper presented at the new conference on contribution of women to national development; agrees that women not only work hard whether in the formal or informal sector of the economy, but it would be noted that women are good managers. Women are managers of situations whether in the home at the far. A places of worship, mosque, at work setting etc. these women manage people, challenges changes etc. and adopt to circumstance of scarcity and certainties in the economy. Yet in Nigeria today less than five (15) percents of managers in strategic sectors are women. The traits which haves often been seen in successful managers are masculinity, aggressiveness, competitiveness, firmness and justice and these qualities have been traditionally viewed as being absent among Nigeria women”.</p> <p>          Walter Rodney, in his book “How Europe underdeveloped African” maintains that the role of women dependent on pre-colonial Africans show that two contracting but combined tendencies. In the first place women were exploited by men through polygamous arrangements designed to capture the labour power of women. In his view exploitation was accompanied by oppression, which at most always reduces women boast of burden. He however, emphasized mother right as a means of escape for women to attaining their right. However, Rodney by his use of the independent pre-colonial African as his reference for the assessment  of women’s role had understand the role of exploitation women were undergoing since independent in the society”.</p> <p>          Pauline D., in his book “women of tropical Africa” defined the role of women in political organization in term of their participation direct or indirect in the activities of groups of sub-group, which exercise authority. To facilitate analysis the very large number of African political system has been assigned to this category of societies in which organized stat with centralized authority and administrative machinery and in which an economy based on the profit motive has created social classed between which there is unequal contribution of wealth and differences in status on the other societies in which the political structures is more or less fused with kinship organization kinship ties being the basic of social relation according to Catherine Acholonu there can be not true development nation or environmental without the full participation of women at the grass roots. There must be full participation of women leader and administration in her book title “Matherison of Afrocentrics Alternative to feminism” conclusively the emphasis of mothers right by the various writes as a means of ameliorating and restorations of women due privileges in the society was rather insufficiently treated, this was women’s African countries, even were the case of Abiriba which is our case study was not considered in the above literature. </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.6 Characterization </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This work is divided into (5) five chapters.

The study appraises the structural nature of Un Peacekeeping in Africa.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.1   </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</b> </p> <p>The UN Security Council authorizes peace operations by an affirmative vote of nine of the fifteen members without a veto from the five permanent members: the United States, China, France, Russia, the UK. The Security Council has authorized more than fifty peace operations in the years since the Cold War.</p> <p>The UN deploys peacekeeping forces to prevent or contain fighting; stabilize post-conflict zones; help implement peace accords; and assist democratic transitions. To achieve those goals, the UN outlines the following peace-building activities:</p> <ul><li>Disarmament,      demobilization, and reintegration of ex-combatants;</li> <li>Landmine      removal and associated activities;</li> <li>Rule-of-law      related activities;</li> <li>Human      rights protection and promotion;</li> <li>Electoral      assistance;</li> <li>Support      for the restoration of state authority; and</li> <li>Promotion      of social and economic recovery and development.</li> </ul> <p>The UN generally follows three principles for deploying peacekeepers:</p> <ul><li>Main      parties to the conflict must consent;</li> <li>Peacekeepers      should remain impartial but not neutral; and</li> <li>Peacekeepers      cannot use force except in self-defense and defense of the mandate.</li> </ul> <p>However, UN peacekeepers are increasingly deployed to war zones when not all the main parties have consented, such as in Mali and eastern DRC. There is also mounting international pressure for peacekeepers to play a more robust role in protecting civilians. Despite the principle of impartiality, UN peacekeepers have been tasked with offensive operations against designated enemy combatants, as in Mali and the DRC. “Contemporary mandates have often blurred the lines separating peacekeeping, stabilization, counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, atrocity prevention, and state-building,” George Washington University’s Paul D. Williams writes in a new CFR report.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>CHAPTER 1</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Determining the effectiveness of UN mission demands investigating the structure and how are peace operations are staffed and funded?Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan send the most troops to UN peacekeeping missions, while the United States, Japan, and France are the top funders. The top troop contributors to AMISOM are Uganda, Burundi, Ethiopia, and Kenya, and funding comes largely from the UN and the European Union. They disconnect between those nations that send troops and those that fund missions is often a source of conflict. Wealthy nations spend the most on peacekeeping, yet they send relatively few troops; meanwhile, countries that either sends troops or whose citizens are directly affected by peacekeeping missions often have less say in how they are designed and mandated. </p> <p>A 2014 internal review of peacekeeping practices related to civilian protection exposed some of these tensions. Researchers found that peacekeepers failed to protect civilians on several occasions. Countries that fund the annual UN peacekeeping budget of nearly $8 billion were angered by the findings, while troop Contributing Countries (TCCs) demanded raises to the reimbursement rates their soldiers receive for serving in UN missions, rates which had not increased in more than a decade. (The UN reimburses countries that contribute troops a little more than $1,000 per soldier per month, and AMISOM troops now earn roughly the same allowances as UN peacekeepers.)Both India and Brazil have cited their countries’ personnel contributions to UN peacekeeping in their bids to become permanent members of the Security Council, and several African governments have complained about having little say in the design and mandating of UN operations on the continent. “They would like to escape the tutelage of the UN in future crises,” says says Richard Gowan, an expert on multilateral security institutions at the European Council on Foreign Relations. </p> <p>Leaders in Africa and within the UN have called for African forces to play a larger role in securing peace and stability on the continent, but budget constraints persist. While the UN has a regular peacekeeping budget, the AU must continually seek out donors, such as the UN, the EU, and the United States, to fund its missions. Only 2.3 percent of the AU’s budget comes from AU member states.“Countries with more developed military capabilities—countries from the OECD—need to come back into peacekeeping in a way they haven’t been in recent years” —Bruce Jones, Brookings Institution “When the AU deploys a mission, it always needs to find external assistance,” says GWU’s Williams. As a result, the AU cannot quickly deploy or sustain troops in the field. “The lack of indigenous sources of finance also undermines the AU's credibility as a leading player in peace and security issues on the continent and reduces its ability to exercise ownership of particular initiatives,” he says. </p> <p>Peace operations in Africa are increasingly collaborations between the UN and AU. For example, in Somalia, AMISOM member states provide troops while the UN provides funding, training, logistics, and planning support. UNAMID, a UN-AU hybrid mission in Darfur, absorbed and expanded a mission initially led solely by the AU. </p> <p>The research intends to investigate UN Peacekeeping in Africa; its effectiveness and problems</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2      </b><b>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p>The problem confronting this research is to appraise Un Peacekeeping in Africa; its effectiveness and problem.

It is ranked as the 21st largest economy in the world in terms of nominal GDP, and the 20th largest in terms of Purchasing Power Parity. It is the largest economy in Africa; its re-emergent, though currently underperforming, manufacturing sector is the third-largest on the continent, and produces a large proportion of goods and services for the West African sub-region. Nigeria recently changed its economic analysis to account for rapidly growing contributors to its GDP, such as telecommunications, banking, and its film industry (Adeleyo, 2002).</p> <p>Nigeria's trade relations revolve around the oil and natural gas sectors. After the economic reforms of 2005, the government is making efforts to diversify its export profile beyond the oil sector, such as minerals and agricultural products. Oil and natural gas are the most important export products for Nigerian trade. The country exports approximately 2.327 million barrels per day, according to the 2007 figures. In terms of total oil exports, Nigeria ranks 8th in the world. As of 2009, Nigeria has approximately 36.2 billion barrel oil reserves. Prior to oil production, which surged after the 1970s, agricultural production was the largest export sector for Nigeria. After the country became a largely oil-intensive economy, the agriculture sector took a back seat. However, it still provides employment to almost 70% of the total working population.</p> <p>Due to high international oil prices, Nigeria’s import trade is able to balance export revenue. According to the 2009 figures, the country's imports grossed over US$42.1 billion. Machinery, heavy equipments, consumer goods and food products are the major imports. A large portion of the imports arrive from the EU, particularly the Netherlands, the UK, France and Germany. China, the US and South Korea are also major import trade partners.</p> <p>The abolition/review of many restrictive businesses and financial regulations and the Nigeria’s membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO) have enhanced the Nigeria’s position in multilateral trade system. The World Trade Organization (WTO) deals with the rules of trade between nations at a global or near-global level. There are a number of ways of looking at the WTO. It’s an organization for liberalizing trade (Weldon, 1999). It’s a forum for governments to negotiate trade agreements. It’s a place for them to settle trade disputes. It operates a system of trade rules (Hart, 1997). Essentially, the WTO is a place where member governments go, to try to sort out the trade problems they face with each other. The first step is to talk. The WTO was born out of negotiations, and everything the WTO does is the result of negotiations. The bulk of the WTO’s current work comes from the 1986–94 negotiations called the Uruguay Round and earlier negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The WTO is currently the host to new negotiations, under the “Doha Development Agenda” launched in 2001. Where countries have faced trade barriers and wanted them lowered, the negotiations have helped to liberalize trade (santos, 2009). But the WTO is not just about liberalizing trade, and in some circumstances its rules support maintaining trade barriers — for example to protect consumers or prevent the spread of disease.however, all these calls for need for the assessment of the World Trade Organization rules and implications on Nigerian trade.</p> <p>The WTO agreements are lengthy and complex because they are legal texts covering a wide range of activities. They deal with: agriculture, textiles and clothing, banking, telecommunications, government purchases, industrial standards and product safety, food sanitation regulations, intellectual property, and much more. But a number of simple, fundamental principles run throughout all of these documents. These principles are the foundation of the multilateral trading system (Adeyemi, 1999).</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Lowering trade barriers is one of the most obvious means of encouraging trade. The barriers concerned include customs duties (or tariffs) and measures such as import bans or quotas that restrict quantities selectively. </p> <p>Since, Nigeria registered the world trade organization treaty in December 1994, there has been occasional focus on the economic implication of this treaty for the Nigerian economy. Nigeria registered the WTO treaty in December 1994 and thus became a funding member of the organization in January 1995. The researcher is seeking to assess how Nigerian external trade fared since she became a signatory to the W. T. O. in 1995 and how the adherence to the provisions of the organization affected non-oil exports and trade liberalization in Nigeria. Although, WTO agreements allow countries to introduce changes gradually through progressive liberalization. Developing countries like Nigeria are usually given longer period to fulfill their obligations.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the rule of the World Trade Organization.</p> <p>2.  To examine the Implication of World Trade Organization rules on Nigerian trade.</p> <p>3.  To examine the effect of trade liberalization on Nigerian trade.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What are the rules of the World Trade Organization?</p> <p>2.  What are the Implication of World Trade Organization rules on Nigerian trade?</p> <p>3.  What is the effect of trade liberalization on Nigerian trade?</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The outcome of this study will further draw the attention of the government, managers of the economy as well as the general public to the problems associated with the full liberalization of trade.

It will further enhance the available literatures on the trade dynamics between developed and developing countries or between centre states and peripheral states. Finally, it is our hope that the findings of the study will stimulate further researches in this field which will further expand the understanding of the position of third world economies in the global trade system.</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study will cover the rules of the World Trade Organization and its implication on both internal and external trade.</p> <p><b>LIMITATION OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>Financial constraint</b>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p> <b>Time constraint</b>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

As a result of this, there are gender imbalance that tends to take place among both sexes. There are various gender inequalities that preoccupies the system which ranges from violence to abuses, discriminations as well as denial to political offices. Even though the attainment of gender equality is not only seen as an end in itself, it is equally an end in ingredients to and a product for the achievement of sustainable development of countries.<br/>The method of the research work is based on the secondary source of analysis which is done through the use of journals, internet materials and other archival sources of information which is going to be relevant. Though Nigeria as a country with the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation and Nigeria has been a signatory to various international treaties and policies as well.<br/>Various discoveries has revealed that gender inequality is a great challenge to Nigeria even as a developing country, such as discriminations that women are faced with including abuses. Although, the UN been an International Organization having established various policies such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) etc. Despite all these policies that have been established for the purpose of nullifying the distinction, exclusion made on the basis of sex, UN itself still encounters various problems, such is the fact that women work more than women but are still been paid low. With this policies, UN still have its challenges such that lack of women to improper education, cultural and social beliefs of the women, poor recognition of women issues etc are still some of the challenges the United Nations is facing.<br/>In conclusion, if all the policies that the United Nation has established coupled with the treaties that Nigeria has signed are put into effect, it will thus increase the knowledge of women as well as curb barriers that are been placed against women, such as vying for political positions, for instance, in Brazil and Germany; they have females as their Presidents known as Chancellor, Nigeria also can get to that position.</p>\n\nUNITED NATIONS AND THECHALLENGES OF PROMOTING GENDER EQUALITY IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " UNITED NATIONS AND THECHALLENGES OF PROMOTING GENDER EQUALITY IN NIGERIA", "id": 16}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT AND UNITED STATES </strong><br/><strong>GEO-STRATEGIC AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS </strong><br/><strong>IN THE MIDDLE-EAST</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Conflict is an inescapable phenomenon of human life both at the interpersonal or international level.1 The prevalence of conflict, its management and prevention are therefore critical areas of international relations.  Conflict comes in varied forms.  They could be interstate, arising from perennial disagreements between States; intra-state civil conflicts which may come in varying degrees such as inter-ethnic conflicts; religious conflicts induced by ecclesiastical rivalries; conflict due to ideological incompatibilities amongst others.  Some notable crises in human history includes those between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland, the Croats and Serbs in former Yugoslavia, the African National Congress and the Apartheid regime in South Africa, Rwandan crisis between the Hutus and Tutsis; the Biafran Separatist Movement in Nigeria, Israeli – Palestinian Conflict which is the focus of this research, to mention a few. </p> <p>            The allusion of the English Philosopher – Thomas Hobbes (1588 – 1679) in his work “Leviathan” to an anarchic state of nature where the dominant individual interest is self-preservation, is an apt description of the international system.2</p> <p>            Extrapolating to the international domain, Hobbessian theorizing is accentuated by the very absence of a hierarchical structure of government in the international arena to check the eccentricity of States whose actions in the guise of national interest replicates a state of nature.  This is in contrast with what obtains in the domestic arena where Municipal law is invoked in case of an infraction.     Hobbessian prescriptions that, “power be centrally and absolutely controlled, that is, a “unitary state” is however inconceivable in the international system.</p> <p>            Scholars of international relations are of the opinion that the Concept of State Sovereignty which is an outcrop of the idealism orchestrated by the Westphalian Settlement, promotes the culture of anarchism in the international system.  This is against the backdrop of the “free-wheeling irresponsibility” of Sovereign States.  Many writers are of the view that Sovereignty in contemporary international relations is an anachronism, as it is akin to absolutism.</p> <p>            However, the broadening focus of international law which re-conceptualizes the notion of sovereignty, now exerts a restraining influence on Sovereign States by making them answerable in relation to acts bordering on crimes against humanity and international humanitarian law.  This has advanced the frontiers of international relations.</p> <p>            Perhaps, before an examination is made into the Arab – Israeli Conflict, it is pertinent to peruse some of the probable causes of conflict and at the same time provide an analytical assessment of the dispute.  Conflicts are manifestations of an underlying and sustained disagreement between groups that have not shown enough commitment to lasting peace.</p> <p>            Fundamentally, the perenniality of an un-resolved societal gap or problem could be an incentive for conflict.  The roots of the Israeli – Palestinian Conflict which has assumed a broader dimension, that is, the Arab – Israeli Conflict, could be traced primarily to the rivalry between the Jewish Israelis and the Muslim Palestinians over primordial claims to the same territory.  It could be encapsulated as “One Land, Two Peoples”.</p> <p>             Some probable causes of conflict among other things are:</p> <ol><li>Incompatibilities of objectives and actions among interacting groups or policy in the case of states, could be an inducement for conflicts.</li> <li>Conflicts could arise as a result of a demand for a piece of territory for example, the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait and Saddam Hussein’s intention to subvert the Sovereign prerogatives of the Kuwaiti government which attracted international condemnation and allied response led by the United States to defeat Iraq’s aggression.</li> <li>Economic hegemony of a particular group over the resources of another could ignite conflicts.  For example, the Northern control of the resources of the Niger Delta in Nigeria which led to increased militarization of the region before the Amnesty Programme introduced by the Federal Authorities, which has now doused tensions.</li> <li>Religious and ideological diversities or incompatibilities which may translate into ecclesiastical claims of superiority of one religion over another, often times have given rise to national rivalries between groups.</li> <li>Domestic rebellion which attracts international sympathy, for example the Arab Spring in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria in recent times, could be a source of international conflict.</li> <li>Liberation struggles, such as those between the African National Congress (ANC) and the White Supremacist regime of Apartheid South Africa; the Angolan Crisis in 1975 after the exit of the Portuguese Administrators, which signaled an end to Portuguese imperialism in Angola.  The forces of liberation cut across three ethnic based nationalistic and belligerent movements enmeshed in a deep-seated fratricidal struggle for political authority.  They are, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA), and the National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).  There was also the fourth – FLEC – Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave.  This was a Separatist Movement for economic hegemony.</li> </ol> <p>Conflict by its very nature is inevitable.  Although not all conflicts result in armed force, this paper discusses armed or violent conflict which has for long dominated relations between the Arabs and Israelis.</p> <p>David Francis of the Department of Basic Studies of the University of Bradford in his work, <em>“Peace and Conflict Studies: An African Overview of Basic Concept”</em> defines conflict “as an intrinsic and inevitable part of human existence.  However, violent conflict is inevitable and as such, is an anomaly.  Conflict is defined as the pursuit of incompatible interests and goals by different individuals and groups.  Armed conflict is the resort to the use of force and armed violence in the pursuit of incompatible and particular interest and goal”.</p> <p>The International Criminal Tribunal in Yugoslavia states that “armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State”.</p> <p><strong>METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>Understanding the theoretical perspectives of international relations provides an analytical framework with which we mirror events in the international political system.  To serve the purpose of this research, therefore, our methodological approach shall first and foremost, entail a comprehensive examination of the contending theoretical groundwork that are seminal to international relations.  These are the theories of liberalism, realism and Marxism.</p> <p>Theories of liberalism emphasize man as a rational being able to weigh the Strengths and Weaknesses of available options and their outcomes3.  The unique preference of liberal theorists for democratic liberalism which is the very essence of America’s democracy, and Laissez faire which connotes economic liberalism equips individuals with the freedom to discover their potentials in order to improve on their well-being.  This is the conceptual basis for capitalism.  Neo-liberal institutionalism - a modern variant of liberalism posits that in an anarchic international environment, there is the tendency for States to cooperate with each other because it is in their best interest to do so.  The game theory highlighting the Prisoners’ dilemma in evaluating the possible options open to them and their probable outcomes explains the imperatives for international cooperation4.</p> <p> The realist theoretical view point which sees realism as one of the dominant Schools of thought in international relations posits that States behave in a particular manner out of considerations for national interest.  Realism emerged as a profound reaction to the idealism that heralded the formation of the League of Nations, espousing a more normatively driven approach; the structural outlines of which were transmitted to the United Nations.  The father of realism – Thucydides reputed to be an exemplar of the realist tradition, in his work, “<em>The Peloponnesian War”</em>, examined the display of power by strong states over the weak. </p> <p> Thurcydides’ analysis of the Melian Dialogue involved Athens and Sparta – both Greek City States that exercised hegemonic authority at about the 5th century B.C.  Each of these States feared the other.  This struggle for hegemony by Athens and Sparta became worrisome for the smaller State of Melos that was desirous of maintaining her neutrality.  Athens desired to bring Melos under subjugation, opting to attack Melos if she declined to submit to Athens’ authority.  Melos indeed called the bluff of Athens.  Consequently Melos was un-provokingly attacked and defeated by Athens.  Against this background, Thucydides concluded that justice is as defined by the victor which is a common feature of international relations.</p> <p>Morgenthau in his work, “Politics among Nations” also elaborated on the realist perspectives of international relations.  For Morgenthau, international politics is a struggle for power whether at the individual, state, or international level.</p> <p>The exercise of power involves an attempt by one party to get an individual or state to act in a manner contrary to pre-conceived wishes or interests.</p> <p>Karl Marx’s (1818 – 1883) radical concept – Marxism is a historical analysis which centred on class struggle.  He stratified society in two basic social groups, that is the ruling class and a subject class.  He theorized that the ruling class owns and controls the means of production and therefore derived its power through this process, which it perpetually exercises over the subject class.5  Marx alluded to the evolution of Western Society through four stages.  These are the phase of:</p> <ul><li>primitive communism,</li> <li>ancient society,</li> <li>feudal society, and</li> <li>capitalist society.</li> </ul> <p>            Pre-historic society epitomizes primitive communism which basically was a classless society.  From here society evolved into the master and slaves in ancient society, lords and serfs in feudal society, and capitalist society which involves the bourgeoisie and the wage earners – the labourers6.</p> <p>            In the Communist Manifesto jointly co-authored with his bosom friend and confidant – Friedrich Engels in 1848, Marx stated that his taxonomy of society is not a functional class in terms of income, but an economic class in terms of its economic interests.7  He maintained that such economic classes are not fixed in society but that, they are the result of the production relations that society has adopted.  He was of the view that capitalism as an economic system is exploitative and that an enduring capitalist formation will perpetually keep the working class subjugated to the whims and caprices of the bourgeoisie. His theoretical advocacy was to have a revolutionary reconstruction of society through the incentivization of the proletariat to seize the ownership and means of production from the State in order to enhance their well-being by replacing capitalism with socialism.8  In the Marxist normative and activist thinking, this would help to ameliorate inequalities and reduce dependency relationship that exists in class rule.  In the course of this work we shall highlight the Leninist variant of Marxism, and how the various theories enumerated above played out in the Middle-East crisis.</p> <p>            Secondly, our methodology shall also examine the events of Post World War II which heralded the emergence of two Super-powers – the United States of America and the Soviet Union as “primary actors in the international system”9.  The Cold-War imperatives occasioned by Soviet Marxist political expansionism (Sovietization) orchestrated to bring countries of Eastern Europe – Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and parts of Eastern Germany into Soviet Orbit (as they were farcically referred to as “Peoples Democracies”) and  also the Subterranean designs to extend same to parts of Western Europe, accounted for United States inexorable commitment to the Truman Doctrine of 1947 which came up with the policy framework of <strong>containment</strong> to check Soviet Communist aggression in any part of the world.10</p> <p>            In President Truman’s declaration, he asserted “I believe it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.  I believe that we must assist free peoples to work their own destinies in their own way”.  This policy thrust based on United States geostrategic interest became the fundamental doctrine of American foreign policy during the bi-polar years which played out in a series of proxy confrontations as a Balance of Power mechanism between the superpowers in the Middle-East.  The United States traditional support for Israel and Soviet’s backing for moderate Arab States such as Egypt, Syria and Iraq became visible in the numerous wars fought in that region.11  This will be expatiated upon in the course of this work.</p> <p>            Thirdly, the divisiveness within the Arab community has also exacerbated hostilities in the Middle-East.  Then, finally, Arab response or revisionist movements against the State of Israel and her imperial collaborators, as well as the preponderance of bilateral or multilateral diplomacy at resolving the conflict shall form the concluding portion of this work.</p> <p><strong>END NOTES</strong></p> <ol><li>Charles Hauss, International Conflict Resolution, Continuum (London, 2001), p. 7.</li> <li>Karen Mingst, Essentials of International Relations, W.W.

Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Terrorism is defined as calculated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience.</p> <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also defines terrorism as “the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.”</p> <p>The problem of terrorism and global security has become substantial points of contention in putting in place foreign policy of nations across the globe. Recent researches have revealed that such challenges as, social, economic, political and technological factors that spin around the hub ofglobal security matters have been seriously undermined by dangerous acts of terrorism. Thisis because terrorism in which ever from poses an alarming kind of violence and threat in thecontemporary world, which constitutes great hindrance to free flow relationship that existamongst nations. In Nigeria for instance the cause of terrorism ranges from religiousextremism, perceived oppression and nationalist separatist or ethnic considerations that nodoubt have greatly impacted on the Nigerian foreign policy. The secure position of a state with oil Niger Delta, theimpact of terrorism and global security on Nigerian foreign policy measures to combatterrorism and enhance global security.</p> <p>The rise of terrorism in Nigeria owing to the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Northern Nigeria has greatly washed out the country’s foreign policy drive. The activitiesBoko Haram in Nigeria have led to negative reactions from groups and nations that have been affected by its activities in the country thereby leading to deterioration of foreign relations of these countries with Nigeria.</p> <p>Terrorist acts in Nigeria by Boko Haram and other groups have generated so much interest from the international community raising questions as to the potency of government’s strategy to deal with the menace. This is because the audacity of the group has continued unabated amidst government claims of winning the war, every day casualty’s increase at alarming rates after each attack making the general public to lose confidence in the system.</p> <p><strong>1.2. Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>Nigeria has been caught in the web as terrorist acts are now a regular attribute which has affected its image abroad. This has led to capital flight as many nations have withdrawn their presence in the country making government to lose revenue at an alarming rate. Incidences of abduction and bombings in Nigeria have made the country lose its 6th position as a leading oil exporting country to Angola in 2011. (Ojukwu, 2011).</p> <p>Enshrined in the foreign policy objective of Nigeria is Economic Diplomacy which is one of the pivots of the Transformation Agenda under the Jonathan Administration (Okoro, 2013). Economic diplomacy is aimed at wooing investors from other countries to invest in Nigeria. The recent security problem in the country has frustrated this goal because instability and violence has led to balance of trade deficits especially in Northern Nigeria</p> <p>One of the glaring effects of terrorism on foreign policy is that most countries do not look at Nigeria as a serious minded nation to establish an economic agreement with. Hence most acts of terrorism have often times been politicized and facts distorted by government officials for personal gains.</p> <p>Apart from the economic effects of terrorism, the psyche of Nigerians has also been affected in their everyday life as visiting public places have become dreadful. The productivity ratio of the citizenry has also been reduced which has limited the country’s growth and development, many Nigerians are now suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders as a result of terrorist acts that have affected them psychologically.</p> <p>Abduction and kidnapping which is one of the tactics of terrorist groups in Nigeria has made foreign country’s to issue travel advice to their citizens against traveling to Nigeria. The tourism industry is the worse hit as it has lost some of its foreign exchange earnings due to a high drop in the patronage of its activities.  International organizations such as DFID, USAID, and UNICEF etc have withdrawn support from troubled spots in the country thereby making it difficult for the locals to access essential health and educational programmes which they benefited from in no small measure.</p> <p><strong>1.3.

BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Aristotle many years ago asserted that it is the nature of man to know: in other words, every man seeks to know. In fact, philosophical activity started out of the spirit of wonder when men were no longer satisfied with the mythological explanation of reality. It was their curiosity that sparked off this enormous discipline man is awed by the stand back of mystery of the universe. Man stand back and ask himself question in order to understand the universe.  Man has ever been in search of the knowledge of the world. What is knowledge, what is its nature and scope, are questions that have attracted philosophers from various orientation or schools of thought.</p> <p>The western philosophical tradition has been divided sharply on what constitutes the source of knowledge namely: Rationalism and Empiricism. Unfortunately, this controversy has led to dualism in knowledge and consequence a bi-fraction of man should be considered as a metaphysical unit. Against this extremism in knowledge, African proposes another criterion of acquiring knowledge. Anyanwu has correctly observed that:</p> <p><em>……any appeal to empirical and rational methods has no meaning and relevance unless we know the basic assumption about the African cultural reality we want to know1</em></p> <p>The Africans as human being following the metaphysical imperative of human nature equally want to know, what is the nature of this knowledge? How do we come to know the things we claim to know? Does consciousness constitute a philosophical data, without which his life cannot begin in the first place?</p> <p>It is in light of the above question that we have decided to carry out a research titled “knowledge in Traditional African Perspective”.</p> <p><strong>1.2. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>From time immemorial, knowledge and what ever constitutes its nature have been a topical issue and a problematic one in philosophical circle. The problem of knowledge arose in the past, more often than not, as a result of philosophers. Inability to seek for the unity of experience. This in no doubt led to the unfortunate controversy between Empiricism and Rationalism.</p> <p>Since the advent of African professional mode of philosophizing. The African philosopher must get ready to examine the old controversy of epistemology. Rationalism  and Empirical; one of the most recent problems that seem to be militating against  progress  in African philosophy today is the ontological status of African Epistemology. K.C. Anyanwu has argued that “the basic problem of any philosophy is epistemology or the theory of knowledge, that is the method which the mind must follow in order to arrive at the trust worthy knowledge of reality. Epistemology provides the basic premises with which other problems, namely metaphysics, religion, moral political and aesthetic doctrines can be approached”.2 Anyanwu therefore places knowledge as prior to being.</p> <p>This is however a centesian way of philosophizing which has randomly been condemned by Ukagba in his unpublished doctoral dissertation (1993)3.  For Ukagba, being is always  prior to knowledge or else we fall into Reductio Absandum, knowledge is the knowledge of somebody, a being. The being who must cognize must exist first before the act of cognition and this is why Ukagba asserts that ontology  or metaphysics comes before Epistemology. We shall examine the premises of these different positions in this research in order to find where the truth lies.</p> <p><strong>1.3 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In the scope of this study, we shall seek to limit ourselves to those areas, which will enable ‘en bloc’ give the research a justifiable treatment. Since the research concerns Africans, it should be limited to how the African conceives the nature of his knowledge, his community knowledge and in the last analysis the ultimate knowledge. However, when necessary reference can also be made to western knowledge as ways of comparing and contrasting</p> <p><strong>1.4   PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The first purpose here is to bring stability in the various conceptions and notion about how the African knows the things he clams to know.</p> <p>Secondly, it is also our intention to show that any attempt to approach African theory of knowledge from the ambit of western Rationalism and Emperialism, will be a fruitless exercise.</p> <p>Finally, it is also our intention to emphasis once again the relevance of metaphysics albeit African ontology as the only condition sine quo non for African Epistemology. With these three purposes in mind, it will become easier to focus properly on the nature of African theory of knowledge.</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong>   <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The importance of this research centers on the present need to put the perception of the African man in proper perspective. Having been beaten out of ontological psychological and economic shapes, due to centuries of colonialism, exploitation and humiliation. It becomes necessary to recover the authentic African, the basis of his knowledge.4 The inter­­-relatedness and limit of this knowledge will go a long way towards understanding the ‘being’ of the African.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong>   <strong>METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>Our methodology  shall follow a gradually  unfolding of ‘being’ through exposing, analyzing  classifying, synthesizing and evaluating its part in its entire ramification  since the nature of African epistemology is not yet clear to all and sundry. It therefore becomes imperative that it should be exposed first before analyzing. The analytical method will enable us to clarify the various concepts like truth. We shall be making us of such concepts truth, wisdom, e.t.c in this research essay.</p> <p>Equally through the synthetic method, we shall seek together the various views expressed so far with regards to the nature of African Epistemology. In the last analysis, we shall evaluate the nature of African Epistemology and other theories. These various methodologies will help in presenting our research in scientific light.</p> <p><strong>1.7. LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The researchers’ scope is going to be African conception of knowledge. We will however, limit ourselves to the conception of truth, wisdom, what is knowable and that which is not knowable, amongst others in the African context. One major limitation of this essay is the non-viability of recent literature on the issue under discourse.</p> <p><strong>REFERENCES AND NOTES</strong></p> <ol><li>E.A. Ruch and K.C.

This research also examine the Nigeria’s interest in ECOWAS and the successes/challenges of the regional organization. Data was obtained from the secondary sources like Journals, textbooks, internet and all other secondary sources. More data were also gathered through interviews. The data obtained was analyzed using thematic format and a descriptive essay and the result revealed that Nigeria played a major role in the formation of ECOWAS because their special interest is in regional and borderless organization uniting the West African countries to improve trade and transportation with an introduction of common currency. Nigeria has played a leading role in funding the organization. However, the organization has not been able to achieve many of the goals in the mission system due to several challenges and the non supportive nature of some member countries. This study concludes that Nigeria should continue playing the big brother role to ensure the success of the regional organization. It however recommends that other west African countries should come together in cooperation to ensure the success of the organization.</p>\n\nNIGERIA’S ROLE IN THE FORMATION OF A REGIONAL ORGANIZATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " NIGERIA’S ROLE IN THE FORMATION OF A REGIONAL ORGANIZATION", "id": 20}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p> HISTORY OF MILITARY INTERVENTION AND ADMINISTRATION IN NIGERIA (1984-1998) </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The bedrock for military coups and leadership in Nigeria and many other countries slowly corroded as a result of the pressure mounted on political belief that people of different social classes, religions, races, etc should live together in a society like Nigeria, Africa, Asia and Latin America, etc, Dudely 1982. The strength of the procedures of the development of an increasingly integrated global economy, a multiple-dimensional interesting capitalist, led to the victory of the forces of capital over the limiting forces of the state. For this reason, the economic consequences for political firmness in such regions of the globe unavoidably led to pressures for political transformation or change. Military era, like the civilian-led autocratic regimes, got to an increasing degree on the movement by soldiers away from their enemies either because the enemies are winning, due to agitations from within and the international community, Alaba 1978.</p> <p>It became a continuous incident five years after independence, not too long after, military era become an institution or fixed. Since 1966, when the military took over power, it has subdued, changing form and time, therefore becoming a standard rather than a place where a rule does not apply. As a system that was meant to correct every problem, military governments are the same, but in method of operation, they differ significantly, Alaba 1987. Especially, some are gracious, favorable, others are draconic and some fall in-between. On intervals, and for twenty-eight years, the military called the shots in Nigeria's political history; and as a result, professionalism was sent into exile, coups gained ground, careers and lives were destroyed. Importantly, they became part of the trouble and challenge; thirty -four years ago, that is, in 1966, some army majors and other officers slaughtered some civilian politicians and senior military officers in a coup. In that coup, Sir Abubakar Tafawa-Balewa, the first Prime Minister; Sir Ahmadu Bello, Sardaunan Sokoto and Northern Premier; Chief Festus Okotie Eboh, the Federal Minister of Finance, and Chief Samuel Akintola, the Premier of Western Region, were bitterly and roughly slaughtered. To add to this, Brigadier, Zakari Maimalari, Colonels Kur Mohammed and Abogo Lagema gave up the ghost. Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu led the coup, and in his address to the Nation, he stated why they struck. According to him, they interposed to completely delete out corruption, unfair practices by powerful people and to lift Nigeria to the next level.</p> <p>Though, the first Prime Minister, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and other leading officials were slaughtered, the coup was not successful. In Lagos, General Aguiyi Ironsi, the then highest-ranking military officer, ended the protest. With some officers and Men that showed constant support, Ironsi uncovered the coupists, and in Kaduna, Nzeogwu was on one limb. With little or no logistics, a fresh supply was stopped, as both Kano and Lagos, where the coup did not survive denied his orders. After several representations and assurances, Nzeogwu surrendered his arms, went to Lagos and was nabbed and detained. After that, Honourable Nwafor Orizu, the Senate president, got in touch with some Ministers and handed power to General Ironsi. Many Months later, there was a opposing -coup, and in that opposing- coup, General Ironsi together with and LT-Colonel was slayed. Yakubu Gowon, the highest-ranking Northerner, took over Ironsi. He ruled for nine years, through the civil war and the oil boom, and overthrown in 1975.</p> <p>Gowon who was way young and lacked experience depended on the civil servants, and they became very strong and powerful. Permanent secretaries pointed out the harmony while ministers and political appointees watched. With the defeat, Murtala carried outmovement, listed out his top priorities and assured a hand over date of 1st October 1979. Though, Murtala was murdered in a coup. The leader of the group was Lt. Colonel Bukar sukar Dimka.  On October 1,1979, power was taken to an appointed president, Alhaji Shehu Aliyu Usman Shagari. By December, 31, 1983, the second Republic was floored, as a coup organized by some senior officers was relatively peaceful, and successful. In a year and eight months’ time, in 1985 precisely, they were impeached by their colleagues. Again, Abacha brought the bad news, referencing lack of consultation and insensitivity as reasons why they struck.</p> <p>The last military regime (1998-1999) arranged a brief movement programme that reached the end of the final result in the emergence of an appointed civilian government under Olusegun Obasanjo, a retired general and one-time military head of state. The process also attested the participation of a good number of retired military officers who had engaged offices in the recent military eras. The administration completed its two tenors of four years each and handed over power to another civilian government in May 2007. This is known to be the longest duration that a civilian era has attained so far since 1960, Udogu 2002. Years back, arms of the broken civilian elite, retired and serving military officers secretly planned in December 1983 to remove a civilian government in Nigeria from power. In the democratic regime, a new kind of civil-military relations was birthed. The military has stood in the barracks and a civilian-led allotment endures within a more or less democratic structure.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE GENERAL PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The research problem, emanates from the statement and view of the previous Nigerian President that the days of “Military coup d’etat’ were gone forever in Nigeria, that democracy has come to stay…it is now clear to all Nigerians that there is no substitute for democracy” said Obasanjo (2007). The nine years of democratic practice in Nigeria has been faced with considerable problems, reminiscences of militarism. We had witnessed incidences such as the order by President ‘Yar Adua’ to close Channels Television for allegedly informing the public that he was likely to resign on account of poor health, forceful closure of the previous Vice President (‘Atiku Abubakar’s)’ office by former President ‘Obasanjo’ and the Gestapo removal of the Mr. ‘Audu Ogbe’ as the Chairman of the ruling party all within a democratic setting. It is very instructive to state, that good governance is the only panacea against military intervention at the level of supplantment (complete substitution of civil authority by military rule and law) while bad governance is an invitation to it. The fact remains that militarized psyche is a problem to democracy, more disturbing is the fact that other African countries such as Ghana had their share of militarism yet has become the democratic college for West Africans. This would guide the discourse herein. Social environment has been known to condition the behavioral dispositions of the individuals. The social environment, which has had considerable impact on the psyche of Nigerians, has seen the long years of military rule, herein referred to as militarism. The militarized social culture being displayed in the democratic dispensation is not unconnected with this. The political behaviors currently displayed in the democratic space, is the dialectical phase of militarism.

In 1981 the two countries went to the brink of war over Bakassi and another area around Lake Chad, at the other end of the two countries common border. More armed clashes broke out in the early 1999s. In response, Cameroon took the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on 29th March 1994.<br/>On 6th June, 1994, Cameroon filed an additional application “for the purpose of extending the subject of the dispute “to a further dispute described as “relating essentially to the question of sovereignty over the territory of Cameroon in the area of lake Chad” and requested the court to join the two applications and to examine the whole as a single case.<br/>On 30th June, 1999, the republic of Equatorial Guinea field an application for permission to intervene in the case stating that the object of the intervention was to protect the legal rights of the Rep. in the Gulf of Guinea by all legal means available and to inform the court of the nation of the legal rights and interests of Equatorial Guinea that could be affected by the court’s decision in the light of the maritime boundary claims advanced by the parties to the case before the court. The application was granted. Historical background shows that the dispute between the parties as regards their land boundary falls within an historical framework marked initially in the 19th or early 20th centuries by the actions of the European powers with a view to the partitioning of Africa. The history is reflected in a number of conventions and treaties, diplomatic acts, maps of the period and documents which were supplied to the court by parties.<br/>Nigeria’s claim on its presence in certain areas of Lake Chad rested on three bases:<br/>long occupation by Nigeria and by Nigerian nationals constituting a historical consolidation of title.<br/>effective administration by Nigeria acting as sovereign and an absence of protect; </p><p>and manifestation of sovereignty by Nigeria together with acquiescence by Cameroon in Nigeria sovereignty over Darak and associated Lake Chad villages.<br/>Cameroon contended that, as a holder of conventional territorial title to the disputed area, it does not have to demonstrate the effective exercise of its sovereignty over those areas, since a valid conventional title prevails over any effectiveness to the country.<br/>The court pointed out that the theory of historical consolidation is highly controversial and cannot replace the established modes of acquisition of title under int’l law. Moreover, the facts and circumstances put forward by Nigeria concerned a period of over 20 years which is in any event for too short even according to the theory relies on by it. The court observed that some of Nigeria’s activities-the organization of public health and education facilities, policing, administration of justice could as agreed by it, normally be considered to be acts of sovereignty. However, as there was a pre-existing title held by Cameroon in this area of the lake, the pertinent legal test is whether there was thus evidence of acquiescence’s by Cameroon in the passing of title to Nigeria. The court further observed that “where the act of affectivities does not correspond to the law, where the territory which is the subject of the dispute is effectively administrated by a state other than the one possessing legal title, preference should be given to the holder of the title. Thus, Cameroon hold the legal title to the territory in question. The court further found that the evidence presented to it as reflected in the case file shows that there was no acquiescence by Cameroon in the abandonment of its title in the area in favour of Nigeria. Therefore, these affectivities adduced by Nigeria did not correspond to the law. Accordingly, sovereignty lies with Cameroon.<br/>The ICJ delivered its judgment on 10th October 2002, finding (based principally on the Anglo-agreements) that sovereignty over Bakassi did indeed rest with Cameroon. It instructed Nigeria to transfer possession of the peninsula, but did not require the inhabitants to move or to change their nationality. Cameroon was thus given a substantial Nigeria population and was required to protect their rights, infrastructure and welfare.<br/>The verdict caused consternation in Nigeria. It aroused vitriolic comments from Nigeria officials and the Nigerian media alike. Chief Richard Akinjide, a former Nigerian Attorney-General and Minister of Justice who had been a leading member of Nigeria’s legal team, describes the decision as “50% international law and 50% international politics”, “blatantly biased and unfair”, “a total disaster”, and a “complete fraud”. The Nigerian newspaper The Guardian went further, declaring that the judgment was “a rape and unforeseen potential international conspiracy against Nigerian territorial integrity and sovereignty” and “part of a Western ploy to foment and perpetuate trouble n Africa”. The outcome of the controversy was a de facto Nigerian refusal to withdraw its troops from Bakassi and transfer sovereignty. The Nigerian government did not, however, openly reject the judgment but instead called for an agreement that would provide “peace with honour, with the interest and welfare of our people”.<br/>The ICJ judgment was backed up by the United Nations, whose charter potentially allowed sanctions on the use of force to enforce the court’s ruling. Secretary-General Kofi Annan stepped in as a mediator and chaired a tripartite with the two countries’ presidents on 15th November 2002, which established a commission to facilities the peaceful implementation of the ICJ’s judgment. A further summit was held on 31st January 2004. This made significant progress, but the process had been complicated by the opposition of Bakassi’ inhabitants to being transferred to Cameroon.<br/>Baskassi leaders threatened to seek independence if Nigeria renounced sovereignty. This secession was announced on 9th July 2006, as the “Democratic Republic of Bakassi”. The decision was reportedly made at a meeting on 2nd July 2006 and The Vanguard newspaper of Nigeria reported the decision to secede. The decision was reportedly made by groups of militants including Southern Cameroon under the aegis of Southern Cameroon Peoples Organization (SCAPO), Bakassi Movement for Self-Determination (BAMOSD), and the Movement for the Emancipation of the Nigeria Delta (MEND).<br/>On 13th June 2006, President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and President Paul Biya of Cameroon resolved the dispute in talks led by the UN Secretary General Kofi Anna in New York City. Obasanjo agreed to withdraw Nigeria troops within 60 days and to leave the territory completely in Cameroonian control within the next two years. Annan said, “With today’s agreement on the Bakassi peninsula, a comprehensive resolution of the dispute in within our grasp. The momentum achieved must be sustained”.<br/>Nigeria began to withdraw its forces, comprising some, 3,000 troops, beginning 1st August 2006, and a ceremony on 14th August marked the formal handover of the northern part of the peninsula. The remainder stayed under Nigeria civil authority for two more years.<br/>However, based on Nigeria’s image as a regional power and its precedents as peacekeeper in Africa, Nigeria decided to abide by the rule of law and thus to the ruling of the ICJ demanding the unconditional and immediate handover of Bakassi to the Cameroonians. This was evidently a difficult decision for the Nigeria people based on the national interest as regards the lucrative crude oil reserves in the peninsula and national allegiance of a large proportion of the Bakassi populace that still relate to Nigeria. Irrespective of competing state interests between Nigeria and Cameroon, a peaceful resolution was still found for the Bakassi peninsula<br/>dispute between both nations. Nigeria obedience to constitutionalism and the rule of law prevented which could lead to the catastrophic war that would<br/>have affected not only the sub-region but Africa.<br/> It is  against this  backdrop that we  examine  the  provision of international law as regard to ICJ (International Court of Justice) settlement of dispute strictly adhered to in resolution of Nigeria Cameroon boundary conflict?<br/>1.2    Statement of the Problem<br/>It is pertinent to note that inter-state boundary disputes such as the one<br/>between Cameroon and Nigeria, endangers global peace and security, and are therefore, taken more seriously by the international community (Goldstein and Pevehouse, 2011: 181-182). The world, perhaps in realization of this fact after the devastating 1st and 2nd World Wars; through the Charter of the United Nations in Article I and the statute of the World Court;…obliges state party in such disputes to bring by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and inter-national law, adjustment or settlement of disputes or situation, (which) might lead to the breach of the (world) peace”.<br/>The fact is incontrovertible that Nigeria and Cameroon were in dispute over ownership of certain land and maritime area of their common border, especially, that of the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsular. At the instance of the border dispute, Cameroon resorted to the World Court to seek justice under the principles of international law, probably, with the aim to reach peaceful settlement of the dispute between the two countries The World Court was able to reach a judgment on the dispute, and perhaps, the goal of peace was achieved. However, the attainment of perpetual peace in the region, and the world; largely depends on the consent of Nigeria towards full implementation of the Court’s judgment which particularly bordered on her communities in which their ancestral homes were adjudged to be in Cameroon territory but which are expected to maintain cultural and religious ties or affiliations with the kith and kin in Nigeria, and on the other hand, she being the defendant or debtor state in the dispute. But Nigerian soon after the World Court judgment, issued an official statement which appeared to accept parts of the decision it considered fair or favourable, and rejected other parts she found unfavourable, (Vanguard [Lagos] 30 October, 2002). The reasons given for the non-compliance was that her constitution’s principles of federation requires that “all land territory comprising the nations of Nigeria is specified in the constitution’, the Federal Government could not give up Bakassi until the requisite National and State Assemblies amend the Constitution” (Weekly Trust [Kaduna] 13 December, 2002). Former President Olusegun Obasanjo explained this position more explicitly in these words; “we want peace, but the interest of Nigeria will not be scarified…” [what] may be legally right may not be politically expedient,” (Vanguard [Lagos] 30 October, 2002). Nigeria’s position seems to agree with what Rosenne, (1997:249) asserted as follows:<br/>[That]… non-compliance may give rise to new political tensions suggested that [since] the efficacy of the post-adjudicatory phase [can] not [be] determined by another judicial examination…it [has] to be [settled] by immediate political action…<br/>The international community became very disturbed especially, when both countries have earlier agreed to respect whatever decision that would emanate from the Court. Thus it became interested in ensuring that Nigeria complies with the Court’s judgment in order to ensure peace and stability in the region. And in line with Article 94 (1) of the United Nations Charter to enforce the Court’s decisions: three members of the Security Council, namely; the United State. France and United Kingdom put substantial diplomatic pressure on Nigeria to accept the ruling. The United Kingdom  took the lead to convince Nigeria through the British High Commission to Nigeria as aptly captured in the Statement; “[the] World Court judgments are binding and not subject to appeal, Nigerian has an obligation under the United Nations Charter to comply with the judgment”, (Paulson, Agence France-Presses, Doc. FBIS-AFR-2002-1025,25 October, 2002).<br/>It is on the basis of the above implication that the study become imperative to assess the provision of international law as regards to ICJ settlement of dispute strictly adhered to in resolution of Nigeria Cameroon boundary conflict in the case whose issues involved the rights over the oil rich land and sea reserves and the fate of local populations and other factors of any. The study is therefore design to inquires into the under listed research questions that would come thereafter as thus.<br/>Was the provision of international law as regards International Court of Justice (ICJ) settlement of dispute strictly adhered to in the resolution of Nigeria-Cameroon boundary conflict?<br/>Did the doctrine of sate sovereignty account for the cession of Bakassi peninsula for Cameroon by Nigeria?<br/>Were the interests of the people of Bakassi peninsula taken into consideration in the resolution of Nigeria Cameroon boundary dispute?<br/>Hypotheses<br/>The provision of international law as regards International Court of Justice (ICJ) settlement of disputes was not strictly adhered to in the resolution of Nigeria-Cameroon boundary dispute.<br/>The doctrine of state sovereignty did not account for the cession of Bakassi peninsula to Cameroon by Nigeria.<br/>The interests of the people of Bakassi peninsula were not taken into consideration in the resolution of Nigeria-Cameroon boundary dispute.<br/>1.3    Objectives of the Study<br/>Broadly, the study aims at discovery the effect of the application of international law state sovereignty on the resolution of the Nigeria Cameroon boundary dispute.<br/>Specifically, the study sets to:<br/>Ascertain whether the provision of international law as regards ICJ (International Court of Justice) settlement of disputes was strictly adhered to in the resolution of Nigeria Cameroon boundary dispute.<br/>Determine whether the doctrine of state sovereignty accounted for the cession of Bakassi peninsula to Cameroon by Nigeria.<br/>Determine whether the interests of the people of Bakassi peninsula were taken into consideration in the resolution on Nigeria Cameroon boundary dispute.<br/>1.4 Significance of the Study<br/>Nigeria, being member of the United Nation is bound by the judgment of the International Court of Justice. In view of the substantial compliance with the judgment of the ICJ, it has become necessary that this study be made. The significance of this work will therefore be theoretical and practical.<br/>Theoretically, this study will make its contribution to the growth of scholarship, especially whether the judgment of the ICJ is the best option for the people of Bakassi regions who are left no option but to comply with the judgment of the Court. Emphasis will be on the effects of International Law and State sovereignty on resolution of Nigeria Cameroon boundary dispute.<br/>However, on the practical side, this study will let the people of Bakassi region know that in spite of the said judgment, they have rights to be protected by parties to the dispute and that such rights should be safeguarded. This work will also let the international community as well as the governments of Nigerian and Cameroon know that the infringement of such rights will militate against human well-being and the overall development of the society. Also, this study will make the security organs and law enforcement agencies of the contending state to know that the judgment of the ICJ can be enforced without tampering with justice since “justice was the basis of rights, formulated by authority. (Onyeocha, 1994. 41).<br/>This study will overlap the development of system theory which is applied in this work to further elucidate the effects of International Law and state sovereignty on the resolution of the Nigeria-Cameroon boundary.<br/>1.5    Scope of the Study<br/>This work is not meant to grapple with the whole issue of the effects of international law and state sovereignty on the resolution of the Nigeria-Cameroon boundary dispute.<br/>It is however limited to the immediate effects on the displaced people of Bakassi region. Views of right thinkers and international law and politics experts will ideally be discussed especially the significance of international law and state sovereignty on Nigeria polity.<br/><br/></p> \n\nEFFECTS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND STATE’S SOVEREIGNTY ON THE RESOLUTION OF THE NIGERIA CAMEROUN BOUNDARY DISPUTE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND STATE’S SOVEREIGNTY ON THE RESOLUTION OF THE NIGERIA CAMEROUN BOUNDARY DISPUTE", "id": 23}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT  The discovery of oil reserves in the water surrounding Bakassi peninsula subjected it to claims and counter-claims for sovereignty, military occupation and recourse to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on March 1999.

This study, therefore, set out to evaluate the effects of the political economy of fuel importation on the development of refineries in Nigeria between 1999 and 2013. It set as its objectives the task of interrogating the nexus between allocation of fuel import licenses to independent marketers and investors in the development of new refineries in Nigeria; the connections between fuel importation probes and the challenges hindering the development of new refineries in Nigeria; and the relationship between expatriates’ dominance of fuel importation and distribution, and the integration of Research and Development (R&amp;D) in Nigeria’s petroleum technology development. The study adopted the political economy theoretical framework of analysis </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Nigeria’s last two decades produced the template that leads to its fuel import-dependent and single-resource economy in the midst of abundant oil endowments. Nigeria depends 85 per cent and above on the importation of petroleum products (Chikwem, 2014; Nwachuku, 2012), with massive infusion of subsidies introduced in 1973 to stabilise the price of fuel and insulate Nigerians from the wild fluctuation of global market price. Ploch (2013, p. 9) observed that ‘Nigeria imports an estimated $10 billion of fuel annually for domestic consumption.’ In 2012, ‘Nigeria consumed 270,000bbl/d and in 2013, she imported slightly more than 84,000bbl/d of petroleum product’ (US Energy Information Administration, 2013, p. 13). Unfortunately, fuel importation/fuel import licences to independent marketers have been subjected to favouritism, prebendalism and clientelism, recycled among the dominant class, with the consequences of discouraging investors in the development of new refineries in the downstream oil sector of Nigeria. This throws up a fuel import ‘cabal’ that has a vice grip of fuel importation. Boyo (2015, p. 44) observed that this group of businessmen would do everything to ensure that refineries will never work, and that the subsidy regime would subsist, while fuel supply will continue to be carefully manipulated to regularly induce artificial scarcity so that bountiful profit can be harvested from the attendant sufferings and economic dislocation deliberately caused by the oil cabal. This ugly situation persisted for a long time and subsequently led to a public outcry that precipitated to the enactment of different fuel importation probes in the downstream oil and gas sector of Nigeria. These probes are the report of the audit of the importation of fuel commission by Nigeria National Petroleum Cooperation (NPPC) in 2008; the report of Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) 1999–2004, 2005, 2006–2008 and 2009–2011; the report of the audit of the NNPC by KPMG Professional Services which exposed fuel subsidy scam submitted to the presidency on 22 November 2010 and the report of the House of Representatives Ad-hoc Committee tagged Resolution No. (HR.1/2012) on fuel subsidy probe that exposed different subsidy scams. In fact, all these probes showed that Nigeria has subsidised fuel importation more between 1999 and 2013 than the past 35 years before 1999. Also, a parliamentary probe on 18 April 2012 found that ‘graft in the fuel subsidy scheme cost Nigeria $6.8 billion between 2009 and 2011’ (Agande, 2012, p. 5) Hence, these probes unravelled that Nigeria’s oil sector is utilized as a conduit for patronage and Cronyism, such that allocation of oil blocs and appointment as fuel importers/marketers are seen as spoils of office freely deployed by successive Nigerian governments to facilitate unbridled and mindless looting of the nation’s resources. (Oluwajuyitan, 2011, p. 2) In this light, this study investigates the political economy of fuel importation probes and the development of refineries in Nigeria between 1999 and May 2015. Following this introduction, the theorising Marxist political economy of the state, the nature and dimensions of fuel importation probes in Nigeria, the fuel importation probes and identified challenges in the development of refineries and  law enforcement agencies and the prosecution of oil marketers/companies on fuel fraud have been presented in sections two, three, four and five, respectively.  Oil has remained the major source of foreign exchange earning in Nigeria since its discovery in large scale in Oloibiri in 1958. It is imperative to state that agriculture which used to employ 75% of the Nigerian population and contribute over 80% to GDP, was later relegated for oil (Akov, 2015:395). Nigeria remains the world’s 14th largest producer of crude oil and 10th in gas. Nigeria has four petroleum refineries, two of which are located in Port Harcourt, one each in Kaduna and Warri with a combined installed capacity of 445,000 barrels per day including a large network of pipelines and depots strategically located (Onuegbu, 2015:2). Yet, these refineries are said to be operating about 26% capacity utilisation due largely to what Onuegbu (2015) described as political interference in the management of the nation’s refineries and the preposterous lack of crude to refine. The resultant effect, therefore, is that Nigeria now largely exports crude oil and gas through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Limited (NLNG) for her foreign exchange earnings and depends on importation of refined petroleum products for consumption by her teeming population. Nigeria’s daily consumption 40 million litres of petroleum products (premium motor spirit) far outweighs daily production of all the five refineries, resulting in over dependence on imported refined products. This has worsened and depleted Nigeria’s foreign reserves since the return of democracy in Nigeria in 1999. There is no doubt that despite the enormity of the country’s wealth in both crude oil and gas reserves, Nigerian citizens have continued to wallow not only in poverty but in perennial scarcity of petroleum products occasioned by arbitrary price increases by over ambitious petroleum marketers. These situations have persisted in the country over the years in spite of measures adopted by successive governments to cushion the effects by way of subsidy.</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong></p> <p>   Nigeria is the largest producer of crude oil in Africa and 10th largest in the world with 37.07 billion barrels of proven oil reserves (WorldAtlas, 2017). In 2015, crude oil production in the country reached a peak rate of 2.7 million barrels per day. For natural gas, Nigeria also has the largest reserve of natural gas in Africa and 7th largest in the world, estimated at 188 trillion cubic feet (The Guardian, 2017). The oil and gas industry is traditionally divided into 3 major sectors, namely: the upstream sector, the midstream sector, and the downstream sector. The upstream sector comprises of crude oil exploration and production into terminal tanks, the mid-stream sector handles the transportation of produced crude oil to refineries. It is in view of the above that the researcher intends to investigate the effect of political economy of fuel importation and fuel importation and development of refineries in Nigeria from 1999-2013.</p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is to investigate the role of political economy of fuel importation and development of refineries in Nigeria. But to aid the successful completion of the study the researcher intends to achieve the following specific objective</p> <p>i)             To ascertain the role of fuel importation on the economic growth of Nigeria</p> <p>ii)           To investigate the role of politics in development of indigenous refineries</p> <p>iii)          To ascertain the impact of subsidy on importation of PMS  and availability of the product</p> <p>iv)         To ascertain if there is any relationship between political economy and refineries development</p> <p><strong>1.4      </strong><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES </strong></p> <p>To aid the successful completion of the study the following research hypotheses were formulated by the researcher;</p> <p><strong>H0: </strong>the importation of fuel does not play any role on the economic growth of Nigeria’s economy </p> <p><strong>H1:</strong> the importation of fuel does play a role on the economic growth of Nigeria’s economy</p> <p><strong>H02: </strong>there is no significant relationship between political economy and development of refineries in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>H2: </strong>there is a significant relationship between political economy and development of refineries in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>1.5      </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is believed that at the completion of the study, the findings will be of great importance to the management of NNPC Nigerian national petroleum corporation on the management of fuel importation and it effect on economic growth in Nigeria, the study will also be of great importance to the Honorable minister of petroleum in formulating policies that will aid the development of indigenous refineries in Nigeria, the study will also be of importance to researchers who intend to embark on a study in a similar topic as the study will serve as a reference point for further research, the study will also be useful to students, teachers, lecturer and the general public as the study will add to the pool of knowledge.</p> <p><strong>1.6      </strong><strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY   </strong></p> <p>The scope of the study covers political economy of fuel importation and development of refineries in Nigeria from 1999-2013.</p> <p><strong>a) AVAILABILITY OF RESEARCH MATERIAL:</strong> The research material available to the researcher is insufficient, thereby limiting the study        </p> <p><strong>b) TIME:</strong> The time frame allocated to the study does not enhance wider coverage as the researcher has to combine other academic activities and examinations with the study.</p> <p><strong>c) Organizational privacy</strong>: Limited Access to the selected auditing firm makes it difficult to get all the necessary and required information concerning the activities.  </p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Politics </strong></p> <p>Politics is the process of making decisions that apply to members of a group.

We investigated the pervasive influence of United States on the Middle East in general and Iraq in particular and how this impacted on the United Nation Security Council’s role in conflict management. We raised tentative statements as follows:<br/> There is a positive link between invasions of Iraq by the U.S and its Middle East policy,  The interest of U.S and U.N appears to coincide on the need to institutionalize western-styled development model.  There is no positive link between the non-use of veto to stop the U.S invasion of Iraq and international conspiracy among members of Security Council.<br/>We anchored our analysis on the Marxist Political Economy paradigm and noted that protection of United States national interest in the Middle East exacerbated the conflict see the back page. At the end of our investigation, we arrived at the findings:<br/> The invasion of Iraq by U.S was in line with U.S – Middle East.<br/> The economic interest of U.S and U.N is to institutionalize western values in the Middle East.<br/> There is no positive link between the non-use of veto to stop U.S and its allies because they invaded Iraq without UN mandate.<br/>This study brings to the fore the hegemonic influence of U.S over the U.N and how it generate global insecurity, thereby opening new area of discussions and investigations on U.S – U.N roles in the resolution of Middle East crisis. It equally brings to the fore intellectual burner the hi-tech politics being played by the big powers, and indeed tends to question the veracity of the sovereign equality of member states. Finally, it questions the continued relevance of international law as regulatory global framework.<br/>We subdivided the study into five chapters as follows: Chapter one concentrated on largely  methodological issues. We concluded on extensive review of literature, established viable gap and dwelt essentially on theoretical matters.<br/>Chapter two examined U.S Middle East policy and invasion of Iraq. We attempted historical overview of Iraq conflict and equally interrogated U.S foreign policy in the Middle East. Chapter three dwelt basically on issues related to U.S – U.N Middle East policy while Chapter four considered veto and power politics in the Middle East.

The programme is anchored on the determination of Africans to extricate themselves and the continent from the malaise of underdevelopment and exclusion in a globalising world. However, the plethora of border disputes across the West African region over the years appears to have undermined attainment of the goals of good<br/>governance, poverty eradication sustainable economic and political development. This study, therefore, investigates boundary disputes and the implementation of NEPAD in West Africa between 2001 and 2014. The Ex- post facto design was used as the research design. Date from secondary sources such as books, journals and official document were qualitatively analysed. The findings show that before the adoption of NEPAD, various institutional framework for conflict resolution, including the international Court of Justice, UN Charter on Peaceful Resolution of conflicts failed to reduce high incidence of boundary disputes, such as Nigeria – Cameroun, Ivory coast Ghana, Mail – Burkian Faso, etc. In West Africa. It further shows that the African Peer Review Mechanism is an effective strategy for resolving<br/>boundary disputes in West Africa. The study therefore recommends the establishment of a permanent body or structure for the review of border issues in Africa. This will provide African States a venue to channel their grievances for mediation.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>Title Page …………………………………………………………………………………………………….. i<br/>Approval Page……………………………………………………………………………………………….. ii<br/>Dedication…………………………………………………………………………………………………….. iii<br/>Acknowledgements ………………………………………………………………………………………… iv<br/>Abstract ……………………………………………………………………………………………………….. vi<br/>Contents ………………………………………………………………………………………………………. vii<br/>Chapter One: Introduction<br/>1.1 Background Of The Study …………………………………………………………………….. 1<br/>1.2 Statement of the Problem………………………………………………………………………… 10<br/>1.3 Objectives of Study ……………………………………………………………………………… 13<br/>1.4 Significance of the Study………………………………………………………………………… 13<br/>1.5 Scope of the Study…………………………………………………………………………………. 13<br/>1.6 Operational Definitions ………………………………………………………………………….. 13<br/>Chapter Two: Literature Review<br/>2.0 Literature Review ……………………………………………………………………………….. 15<br/>2.1 Theoretical Literature ……………………………………………………………………………. 15<br/>2.1.1 African Boundaries……………………………………………………………………………….. 18<br/>2.1.2 Causes and Nature of Boundary Disputes in West Africa……………………………. 26<br/>2.2 Empirical Literature…………………………………………………………………………….. 42<br/>2.2.1 International Boundary Disputes…………………………………………………………….. 42<br/>2.2.2 Traditional, Geographic and Political Features of Bakassi Peninsular ………….49<br/>2.3 Historical Development of NEPAD………………………………………………………… 55<br/>2.4 Gaps in Literature………………………………………………………………………………… 55<br/>Chapter Three: Methodology<br/>3.1 Theoretical Framework……………………………………………………………………………. 69<br/>3.2 Hypotheses…………………………………………………………………………………………… 70<br/>3.3 Research Design……………………………………………………………………………………. 70<br/>3.4 Methods of Data Collection…………………………………………………………………….. 72<br/>3.5 Method of Data Analysis ………………………………………………………………………. 72<br/>Chapter Four: General Review of Boundary Disputes 2001 – 2014<br/>4.1 Nigeria-Cameroun Bakassi Dispute ………………………………………………………….. 76<br/>4.2 Niger – Burkina Faso Border Dispute ………………………………………………………. 89<br/>4.3 Ivory Coast – Ghana Border Dispute ………………………………………………………. 101<br/>4.4 Framework for Resolution of Border Disputes…………………………………………… 103<br/>Chapter Five: The Role of African Peer Review Mechanism in Resolving Border Disputes in West Africa<br/>5.1 The Nepad Vision …………………………………………………………………………………. 114<br/>5.2 The African Peer Review Mechanism……………………………………………………….. 121<br/>5.3 Aprm and Civil Society Participation………………………………………………………… 130<br/>5.4 Aprm and Regional Integration and Development ……………………………………….. 133<br/>5.5 Merits and Benefits of the Aprm Policies ………………………………………………….. 134<br/>5.6 Factors That Undermine Aprm’s Role in Border<br/>Conflicts Resolution ………………………………………………………………………………. 141<br/>Chapter Six: Summary, Conclusion and Recommendations<br/>6.1 Summary………………………………………………………………………………………………. 145<br/>6.2 Conclusion …………………………………………………………………………………………….. 151<br/>6.3 Recommendations ………………………………………………………………………………….. 151<br/>BIBLIOGRAPY</p>\n\nBOUNDARY DISPUTES AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEPAD IN WEST AFRICA: 2001-2014<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " BOUNDARY DISPUTES AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEPAD IN WEST AFRICA: 2001-2014", "id": 27}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>BOKO HARAM INSURGENCY AND NIGERIA’S RELATIONS WITH UNITED STATES, 2009 – 2014 </p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The persistence of Boko Haram insurgency impinges upon Nigeria’s relations with US, which have been cordial but restricted. Researchers have divergent opinion about the extent U.S. should be committed in assisting Nigeria in countering Boko Haram insurgency. Researches on the interconnectivity between Boko Haram insurgency and Nigeria’s-US military-security partnership, trade and aid are inadequate and do not reflect current developments. Consequently, the study set out to examine the effects of Boko Haram insurgency on Nigeria’s relations with US from 2009 to June 2014. It was guided by two research questions: first, does the persistence of Boko Haram insurgency results to changes in the content of Nigeria and US military-security partnership? Secondly, does the persistence of Boko Haram insurgency leads to a decline in US trade and aid to Nigeria? This study employs pre-test post-test research design, qualitative descriptive and quantitative method of data analysis. Linkage Politics was the theoretical framework applied to interrogate the issues under discuss. The research discovered that persistence in Boko Haram insurgency has resulted to changes in the content of Nigeria’s military-security partnership<br/>with US, as typified in unprecedented direct request by Nigeria and assistance from US, coupled with reactive change in policy of both nations. It was also ascertained that persistence of Boko Haram insurgency failed to cause a decline in U.S. trade and aid to Nigeria; in fact, U.S. trade and aid to Nigeria is increasing. The research recommends that, to engender cordiality and sustain the level of trade, US military-security partnership and aid to Nigeria should focus on total involvement of Nigeria military and citizens rather than penetrating Nigeria security system.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>Title page …………………………………………………………………………………………………i<br/>Approval Page ………………………………………………………………………………………….ii<br/>Dedication ……………………………………………………………………………………………….iii<br/>Acknowledgement …………………………………………………………………………………….iv<br/>Table of Contents ……………………………………………………………………………………..v<br/>List of Tables ……………………………………………………………………………………………vii<br/>List of Figures ………………………………………………………………………………………….viii<br/>Abbreviations …………………………………………………………………………………………..ix<br/>Abstract …………………………………………………………………………………………………..xi<br/>CHAPTER ONE: Introduction<br/>1.1 Background to the Study ……………………………………………………………………….1<br/>1.2 Statement of the Problem ………………………………………………………………………5<br/>1.3 Objectives of the Study …………………………………………………………………………9<br/>1.4 Significance of the Study ………………………………………………………………………10<br/>CHAPTER TWO: Literature Review<br/>21.

Ethnic nationalism in Niger Delta has been agitating for so long for self-determination and to control their God giving resources, in their quest to achieve their aims, their actions sometimes has generated a lot of tension to Niger Delta region. The study examined ethnic nationalism and internal security in Niger Delta region, Nigeria. The study examined the research questions. Has ethnic nationalism affect the internal security of Niger Delta region 1999-2014? Secondly has Nigerian governmentinstitutions curtailed violent Niger Delta ethnic nationalism 1999-2014?. Group theory was adopted as our theoretical framework. The study relied on secondary source of data and as such generated qualitative data. The study revealed that ethnic nationalism has affected the internal security of Niger Delta region, Nigeria 1999-2014. Secondly, Nigeria government institutions has not adequately curtailed violent Niger Delta ethnic nationalism in the region 1999-2014.Based on the findings, this study is of the view that government should promote peace as the foundation for development, improve and diversify the economy, promote environmental sustainability to preserve the means of people sustainable livelihood, build sustainable partnerships for the advancement of human development and Nigeria government institutions should cut off from the Nigeria syndrome.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1 Background to the Study<br/>The concept ethnic is derived from the Greek word “ethnos” meaning tribe or race. Niger Delta is blessed with numerous ethnic groups in Nigeria, which has also contributed to the sustainability of Nigeria state. The definition of the Niger Delta has elicited different views. The World Bank (1993) described it as one of the words larges wetlands and Africa’s largest delta covering some 70,000km, formed by the accumulation of sedimentary deposits transported by the Niger and Benue Rivers. A publication of the defunct Oil Minerals Producing Area Development Commission (OMPADEC) reads that:<br/>The River Niger disgorges its waters into the Atlantic Ocean through a large number of tributaries which form the Niger Delta. The area of the Delta is further enlarged by rivers other than tributaries of the Niger……….Calabar River, Cross River and Imo River to the East, and Siluko River, Benin River, Escravoss River and River Forcados, to the west (OMPADEC, 1993: 80).<br/>In the view of the OMPADEC, the River Niger, its tributaries and other rives which have enlarged the area of the Niger Delta; define the scope of the area. Following this, it posits that the Niger Delta is made up of at least seven states which are Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta, Akwa- Ibom, Cross-River, Ondo and Edo states. In like manner, the Willink Commission Report (1958) locates the Niger Delta within the Ibo Plateau and the Cross River valley. The Report describes it thus:<br/>To the east of Ibo Plateau lies the valley of Cross River, which is fed by streams from the<br/>Cameroons as well as form the Plateau. This forms a broad vertical strip containing people<br/>who are not Ibos. Across the south of the region from the Niger in the West to the mountains in<br/>the East, stretches a broad horizontal best of swamps and low-lying country. These two strips<br/>of the coastal belt and the Cross River valley together make together a piece of country, the shape of a rather sprawling reversal ‘L’ which encloses the Ibo Plateau. In the swamp and Greek country of the south west there is an area in which the predominant tribe group is that of the Ijaws ……..towards the mouth of the Cross River are the Efiks ……… and the Ibibio’s …….. Further north on the Cross River are<br/>many tribes inter mingled in a confusing multitude (Willink Commission Report 1958:34).<br/>The Niger Delta Ethnic communities have settled in the area for many millennia with the Ijaws ethnic group being the oldest group, having lived there for over 7,000 years, the other ethnic groups have been in the area for about 1,000 years (Ibaba, 2005). The widespread view, which accepts the definition of the Willink Commission, largely congruent with the position of OMPADEC, that sees the Niger Delta region as the south-south geopolitical zone, made up of Akwa-Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo and Rivers states (with Bayelsa, Delta and Rivers states classified as core Niger Delta states). The broader and<br/>widely refuted definition by the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) Act, which includes Abia, Imo and Ondo states, is wrong. The NDDC Act defines the Niger Delta as oil producing areas, which it is not. The scope of the region is defined by geography as highlighted by OMPADEC and the Willink Commission Report. The Ethnic groups in the Niger Delta includes the Itsekiri, Isoko, Urhobo, Ogoni, Ijaw, Ikwerre, Ika, Ibibio, Efiks, Ukwuani, Abua etc. The primary occupation of the people consists of fishing and farming. Niger Delta is the heart of Nigeria’s oil industry (with over 90 percent) share of production (Ibaba, 2005). Niger Delta region today has witnessed ethnic nationalist and also ethnic<br/>nationalism, however it is therefore imperative this study explained the concepts nationalism.<br/>Ethnic nationalism is a form of nationalism wherein the “Nation” is defined in terms of ethnicity whatever specific ethnicity is involved while Nationalism refers to the feeling of solidarity and loyalty by social classes towards the rules and institutions of the social formation in which they live (Ifesinachi, 2011). The active consciousness of being a different nation especially in relations with other nations or groups. The struggles by colonized nations or nationalities for collective or separate independent statehood or any other form of self determination (Igwe, 2007: 283). Subrat (2010) elaborated that nationalism is the sense of belonging to a particular state.</p>\n\nEFFECTS OF ETHNIC NATIONALISM ON INTERNAL SECURITY IN THE NIGER DELTA REGION (1999-2014)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF ETHNIC NATIONALISM ON INTERNAL SECURITY IN THE NIGER DELTA REGION (1999-2014)", "id": 29}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>GENDER SENSITIVITY IN NIGERIAN FEDERAL GOVERNANCE AND THE EFFECTS ON AFFIRMATIVE</p> <p>ACTION SINCE 1999</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Gender Sensitivity in Nigerian Federal Governance and the Effects on Affirmative Action since 1999 is a study set out to unravel how effective gender sensitivity has been in the Nigerian Federal Governance and the impacts of Affirmative Action since 1999. It examines Dimensions of heated Debates on Gender and Affirmative Action, especially as various controversial opinions rages over the introduction of Gender Based Affirmative Action. The study reviewed the major current Federal Affirmative Actions, and advocated for some Policy Alternatives for Women Equality and Progress in Nigeria. The study adopted Feminist Theory in the work. The study also utilized Secondary Source of Data Collection where we made<br/>use of books, journals, internet materials and so on. The study relied on Qualitative Research Techniques. This type of techniques is essentially the application of Qualitative Research Method in the thorough Examination and Interpretation of Research Data. We equally made use of One Group: Pre-Test, Post-Test type of Research Design. Our findings revealed that government is yet to commit itself toward redressing the issue of gender imbalances especially in the area of women’s representation in Federal Governance as none of the Federal Affirmative Actions introduced since 1999 has been able to cause any significant positive change. It therefore, concluded that promoting Gender Sensitivity and Affirmative Action in Federal Governance is a Recipe for a Sustainable National Development, National Security and Good Governance. Hence, the study finally recommended that federal government should stringently place Gender Affirmative Action at the fore front of its developmental policies by sincerely<br/>committing itself to the formulation and implementation of Gender Affirmative Actions, in order<br/>to achieve her set Millennium Development Goals.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1 Background to the Study<br/>According to Arowolo and Abe (2008:13-14), “the essence of political participation in any society, either civilized or primitive is to seek control of power, acquisition of power and dispensing power to organize society, harness and distribute resources and to influence decision making in line with organized or individual interest”. All groups including women seek to influence the dispensation of power in line with their articulated interests as a fundamental motive of political participation. Women, in their gradual consciousness of state of mind also, in recent times, increasingly seek power equation and distribution and redistribution of resources in their favour. Although, careful observations have indicated that the participation of women in Nigerian politics is hugely noticeable at the level of voting and latent support.<br/>As noted by Okolie (2004:53), views political participation as “freedom of expression, association, right to free flow of communication; right to influence decision process and the right to social justice, health services, better working conditions and opportunity for franchise”.<br/>Political participation is one of the key ingredients of democracy in its real sense, hence, taking the conceptualization of democracy by Diamond (1989: xvi) into cognizance, “democracy provides the equal opportunity platform for political participation and fairness in such competition, thus; a system of government that meets three essential conditions: meaningful and extensive competition among individuals and groups, especially political parties, for all effective positions of government power, at regular intervals and excluding the use of force; a highly inclusive level of political participation in the selection of leaders and policies, at least through regular and fair election, such that no major(adult) social group is excluded; and a level of civil and political liberties, freedom to form and join organizations sufficient to ensure the integrity of political competition and participation”.<br/>Similarly, Onyeoziri (1989:6) highlighted four domains of democracy which include: “the domain of individual and group rights and freedoms; the domain of popular and equal participation in collective decision; the domain of accountability of government to masses publics and constituent minorities; and the domain of the application of the principle of equal citizenship in all spheres of life-social, economic and political”.<br/>In view of this, gender equality promotion is presently accepted globally as a development strategy essential for reducing poverty levels among men and women, improve health and living standards, and also enhance efficiency of public investment. The attainment of gender equality is not only seen as an end in itself and human rights issues, but also a prerequisite for the development of sustainable development.<br/>The plight of Nigerian women, like their counterparts in other parts of developed countries have been characterized by lack of adequate representation, undue domination of men in the socio-political scheme of things; lopsided political appointments and the general imbalances associated with very unjust treatment of the female citizens in its entirety. Therefore, it common place to observe that, the womanhood is reduced to mere infidel and a second-class citizen, hence, there is the commonality of general belief system that the best place for women is the “kitchen”. This trend therefore has brought about tremendous misrepresentation of women right at the level of the family down to the circular society. Thus, the purported irrelevance associated with the status of women in society has merely reduced an average woman to an inferior commodity. The Nigerian woman is therefore, discriminated upon from, in most cases, acquiring formal education, mistreated and perpetually kept as house-help; the average Nigerian woman is seen as an object for prostitution, force marriage, street hawking, instrument<br/>of wide-range trafficking, a misfit in the society and these ill perceptions have no option than to deepen the level of marginalization of Nigerian women (Erunke, 2011).<br/>However, the status of women marginalization in Nigeria has varied from time to time and has taken different forms in different societies and historical epochs. In the pre-colonial society, women played vital roles in both social and economic activities. Division of labour was on gender lines. Power and privileges in the family were based on age and gender hence; it allowed elder women to have voice on many matters. That notwithstanding, beyond family level power was generally dominated by the male folk but women were not totally powerless given to the fact that some rose to prestigious chieftaincy title like Iyalode,<br/>some also became powerful queens as was obtainable in the Ondo and Daura histories. Women held high political offices like in the rein of Queen Amina of Zaria who conquered all the towns around Zamfara and Nupe, and dominated this region for 34years.Women were given freedom from male’s total domination, although men had upper hand in the system. The colonial era injected a contaminated practice of massive women marginalization in the society through the introduction of “European patriarchatism’’ which indeed shot the door against women freedom and political participation. The system restricted women to child rearing and domestic chores stating that women should be subordinate to men and if allowed to attain financial freedom would ameliorate their respects for their husbands. The colonial state displaced the place of Nigerian women, infusing European patriarchatism into the system which has contributed<br/>immensely to the modern (post colonial) huge disparity in gender equality. The effects cum operations of gender inequality transcended to the post colonial era which have been a radical inhibitor to true democracy and sustainable national development. These consequences drew both national and international concern hence; leading to various crucial clamours for gender equality and proper women representation in governance.</p>\n\nGENDER SENSITIVITY IN NIGERIAN FEDERAL GOVERNANCE AND THE EFFECTS ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION SINCE 1999<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " GENDER SENSITIVITY IN NIGERIAN FEDERAL GOVERNANCE AND THE EFFECTS ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION SINCE 1999", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>THE STRUGGLE FOR A PERMANENT SEAT AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL: A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE CONTESTANTS IN 2012</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This work set out to investigate the struggle for Permanent Seats At The Security Council: A Critical Assessment of the Contestants in 2012. While observing that there exists a fundamental need to reform and enlarge both the membership and voting pattern in the Security Council in order to reflect geopolitical realities of the 21st Century by making both the organisation and the Security Council in particular to appear democratic while at the same time enhancing its efficiency and legitimacy around the world. It is noted that while all member states of the organisation accept this need and exigency, they however, differed on the modalities, nature and extent of the reform. Moreover, each of the major contestants though enjoys the support of one or the other of the members of the P5, but they at the same time faces opposition from major powers in their respective regions; thereby making the struggle a serious and arduous task. We however, in this study vehemently believe that the structure and<br/>composition of the United Nations Security Council must definitely be reformed and reorganized to reflect the wide and varied membership of the organisation. The theory of national interest was used as our framework for analysing the quest and struggles for permanent seat in the Security Council. Data for the study was gathered through observation of the secondary sources like books, journals, Internet, official documents et cetera. Our method of data analysis which involved giving a qualitative description<br/>to quantitative information brings simplicity and coherence to our work. Our recommendations were also anchored on the findings of our research work which was clearly articulated in our conclusion.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>Title Page – – – – – – – – – i<br/>Approval Page – – – – – – – – ii<br/>Dedication – – – – – – – – – iii<br/>Acknowledgement – – – – – – – – iv<br/>List of Abbreviation – – – – – – – – v<br/>Abstract – – – – – – – – vi<br/>Table of Contents – – – – – – – – vii<br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.

The United Nations and other regional and sub-regional organizations have adopted these measures in their efforts to secure peace in the major conflict states of the world. The Liberian crisis which is the subject of this study was one of such cases in which the measures was applied to maintain peace by the Economic Community of West Africa State (ECOWAS). The Liberian crisis which started as an entirely ethnic conflict involving the<br/>indigenous ethnic Liberians who constitute the majority of the population and the Afro-America settlers who were settled in Liberia following the abolition of slave trade in America and who have dominated the political scene in the country since their arrival in 1821. The Liberians crisis escalated in 1980 when Samuel Doestaged a coup that brought the ethnic majority of the Liberian to power. The conflict assumed a wider dimension following the involvement of other extraneous forces around Liberians, a situation which the ECOWAS leaders thought would lead to the war spreading to other countries in the sub-region. This study examined the operations of the peacekeeping body- the ECOMOGwhich ECOWAS established for the purpose of securing peace in Liberia. For its explanatory tool, the study adopted the theory of collective Security. The choice of this theory is informed by the fact that it best<br/>explains the decision of ECOWAS as a sub-regional body to work for peace within the sub-region. The theory of collective security rest on the assumption that all nations share a primary interest in maintaining International Peace and Security. This work is basically an analytical survey study and in the case it precludes all forms of statistical process in both data collection and data analysis. In this regard, conflict analysis of the mass of data collection from library sources was adopted in the study. The major findings of the study include the fact that the domination of political power by the Afro-America<br/>Liberians is at the root of the conflict in the country. The study also discovered that poor funding and the colonial orientations of the various forces contributing states in ECOWAS adversely affected the<br/>operation of ECOMOG in Liberia. The study recommends that the Leaders of ECOWAS should establish more integrated peacekeeping forces with training in language and cultures of the Nations in the sub-region.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>Title page………………………………………………………………..i<br/>Certification…………………………………………………………….ii<br/>Approval page………………………………………………………….iii<br/>Dedication………………………………………………………………iv<br/>Acknowledgements…………………………………………………….v<br/>Abstract…………………………………………………………………vi<br/>Table of contents………………………………………………………ix<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1 Introduction…………………………………………………….1<br/>1.2 Statement of Problem………………………………………….5<br/>1.3 Research Question…………………………………………….8<br/>1.4 Objectives of the Study……………………………………….9<br/>1.5 Significant of the Study……………………………………… 9<br/>1.6 Literature Review……………………………………………10<br/>1.7 Theoretical Framework………………………………………17<br/>1.8 Research Hypotheses…………………………………………21<br/>1.9 Research Methodology……………………………………….22<br/>References……………………………………………………23<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Historical background to The Liberian Crisis<br/>2.1 The Liberian Crisis in Perspective………………………………28<br/>References……………………………………………………….37<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>Historical Development of Peacekeeping Operations…………………38<br/>3.1 Definition of Peacekeeping……………………………………..39<br/>3.2 Evolution of the Peacekeeping Operations……………………..48<br/>3.3 Creation of the United Nations Emergency Force……………..54<br/>References……………………………………………………. .67<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>Assessment of ECOMOG Peacekeeping Operations in Liberia………69<br/>4.1 Problems of ECOMOG…………………………………………74<br/>References………………………………………………………79<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/>5.1 Summary…………………………………………………………80<br/>5.2 Conclusion……………………………………………………….83<br/>5.3 Recommendations……………………………………………….85<br/>Bibliography ……………………………………………………87</p>\n\nPEACEKEEPING IN AFRICA: A CASE STUDY ECOMOG INTERVENTION IN LIBERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PEACEKEEPING IN AFRICA: A CASE STUDY ECOMOG INTERVENTION IN LIBERIA", "id": 32}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CLIMATE CHANGE AND POLITICAL CONFLICT IN AFRICA: FOCUS ON MIGRATION AND REFUGEES IN THE CONTINENT</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This study explores the nexus between climate change and political conflicts in Africa with focus on migration and refugees in the continent. The analysis of this study is anchored on system theory. Data for the study have been collected from secondary sources. Climate change, whether human induced or natural, precipitates environmental disasters like erosion, flood, typhoon, hurricane, drought, desertification, etc which can kill people, displace them or force them to migrate to other areas. Climate change has the potentials of engendering conflicts and snowball the existing staggering population of refugees in the African continent. Climate change will cause scarcity of the basic resources like food, fresh-water supplies, arable land for agricultural activities and habitations that sustain life for people<br/>around the world, especially in African countries which are already vulnerable to climate variability and have least capacity to respond. This study argues that severe climate change disasters can lead to migration of affected people to other areas and conflict could erupt in receiving areas as competition over scarce resources developed, particularly in Africa where there is low adaptation capacity to climate change hazards. It further argues that climate change could lead directly to conflict e.g. Durfur crisis. The study is an attempt to beam searchlight on the root cause of some conflicts in Africa. The empirical evidences gathered show that climate change has been implicated in some of the conflicts in the African<br/>continent. In recent past, climate change has become an international issue because of its security risk. This development had led to the Kyoto 1997 and Copenhagen 2009 summits on climate change of heads of states and governments and their representatives to discuss ways of tackling climate change. The study discovered that there is a link between climate change induced migration, conflict and refugees in the African continent. It also discovered that inability and negligence of governments of African states to manage impacts of climate change are often responsible for the out break of conflicts. The study draws conclusion and makes some recommendations.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>Title Page………………………………………………………………………………..i<br/>Approval Page…………………………………………………………………………..ii<br/>Dedication Page…………………………………………………………………………iii<br/>Acknowledgement……………………………………………………………………….iv<br/>Table of Contents…………………………………………………………………………v<br/>List of Abbreviation ……………………………………………………………………..vii<br/>List of Tables ……………………………………………………………………………..ix<br/>List of Figure……………………………………………………………………………….x<br/>Abstract….………………………………………………………………………………….xi<br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION……………………………………………………………1<br/>1.1 Background of Study…………………………………………………………….1<br/>2.2 Statement of Problem……………………………………………………………4<br/>3.3 Objective of Study………………………………………………………………..6<br/>4.4 Significance of Study…………………………………………………………….6<br/>5.5 Literature Review…………………………………………………………………7<br/>6.6 Theoretical Framework…………………………………………………………14<br/>7.7 Hypotheses………………………………………………………………………17<br/>8.8 Method of Data Collection……………………………………………………..17<br/>References……………………………………………………………23<br/>CHAPTER TWO: CLIMATE CHANGE – INDUCED MIGRATION AND CONFLICTS IN AFRICAN STATES…………………………………….27<br/>2.1 Causes of Climate Change……………………………………………………..29<br/>2.2 Climate Change – induced Migration in African States………………………34<br/>2.3 Conflicts Caused by Climate Change – induced Migration<br/>in African States…………………………………………………………………..42<br/>References……………………………………………………………..47<br/>CHAPTER THREE: IMPLICATIONS OF THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE FOR REFUGEES AND FOOD SHORTAGE CRISIS<br/>IN AFRICANSTATES………………………………………………………50<br/>3.1 Impacts of Climate Change on the Environment………………………………50<br/>3.2 Implications of the Impacts of Climate Change for Refugees<br/>and Food Shortage Crises in African States…………………………………..56<br/>3.2.1 Increased Refugees in African States………………………………………….56<br/>3.2.2 Increased Food Shortage Crises in African States……………………………60<br/>References……………………………………………………………..66<br/>CHAPTER FOUR: AFRICAN STATES’ INADEQUATE MITIGATION<br/>AND ADAPTATION MECHANISMS AGAINST<br/>EPISODIC ANDPERENNIAL DISASTERS……………………………….68<br/>4.1 Inadequate Early Warning Systems in African States for Episodic<br/>and Perennial Disasters………………………………………………………….68<br/>4.2 Poor Governance and Lack of Capacities to Mitigate and Adapt<br/>to Climate Change by African States……………………………………………79<br/>References………………………………………………………………85<br/>CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY OF RESEARCH FINDINGS, CONCLUSION<br/>AND RECOMMENDATIONS………………………………………………..87<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY………………………………………………………………………….94<br/>APPENDIX…………………………………………………………………………………100</p>\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE AND POLITICAL CONFLICT IN AFRICA: FOCUS ON MIGRATION AND REFUGEES IN THE CONTINENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CLIMATE CHANGE AND POLITICAL CONFLICT IN AFRICA: FOCUS ON MIGRATION AND REFUGEES IN THE CONTINENT", "id": 33}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CIVIL WAR AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO, 1996 -2003</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This study examined the relationship between the 1996 and 2003 civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, (DRC) and human rights violations in that country. The area of study was the African Great Lakes region, and the (DRC) was the unit of observation and analysis. The ex-post-facto design was adopted for the study. Data were collected from secondary sources. The secondary data were analyzed using the qualitative descriptive method, logical induction and content analysis. To enhance the quality of analysis, some inferential statistics, such as frequency distributions, simple percentages, diagrams and charts were also used. The theoretical framework was anchored on the radical (Marxist) constructivist approach to peace and conflict analysis. The analysis of both the qualitative and quantitative data of the effect of<br/>civil war on human rights violations in the DRC between 1996 and 2003 indicated that the civil war created many contradictions in the unequal struggle for economic and political power between contending groups. In our dis-aggregated study of the contemporary Congolese civil wars between (1996-1997, and 1998-2003), showed that about 5 million people died as a result of the conflict between August 1998, and April 2003 alone. Cross-national evidence revealed that parts of the DRC endowed with higher natural resource experienced more conflicts, violation of human rights and child soldiering, than others, in the process of the struggles for their accumulation. This indicated a positive relationship between the adversarial struggle for economic and political power amongst the contending groups, and violation of human rights in the DRC. The analysis further showed a positive relationship between renewed post-war<br/>contradictions, and continued new violations of socio-economic rights. Another key finding of the study was that many deaths were due to preventable causes, such as malnutrition and epidemic diseases and starvation which disproportionately affected young children. It was also revealed that the violations of social and economic rights created deep grievances after the war that promoted revenge issues and the resultant further violations of human rights. Based on these findings we recommended, among others, that the age-long practice of promoting ethnicity as the bases of legitimacy in the national politics of the DRC, should be discouraged, as this has not enhanced good governance and equity. Rather, it has fostered the breakdown of national unity, and facilitated human rights violations as evident in civil wars, child soldiering, widespread rapes, sexual violence, internally displaced persons, poverty and food insecurity and so on.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>Title Page- – – – – – – – – – i<br/>Approval Page- – – – – – – – – ii<br/>Dedication – – – – – – – – – –

<p><strong><br/></strong></p> <div> <p>vii</p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Since its (United Nations) establishment in 1945, the United Nations has been in a constant state of transition as various international stakeholders seek ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the U.N. system. Controversies, such as the unhealthy use of veto by the Permanent 5 (P5), lopsided composition of the Security Council, and instances of waste, fraud and abuse by U.N. staff, have focused renewed attention on the need for change and improvement of the United Nations. Many in the international community, including the African continent, have increased pressure on U.N. member states to implement substantive reforms. This study has been designed to critically appraise Africa and the UN millennium reforms. The objectives of the study are: First, to ascertain the role of the Permanent members of the UN and how it impinges on African chances at benefiting from the current UN reforms. Two, to examine if there is any relationship between the lack of consensus on what should be the goal of reform and the divergent views by members. Three, to ascertain weather the UN reform have consequences for the UN Charter and the Security Council. To achieve the above objectives of the study, we raised the following research questions: One, does the role of the Permanent members of the UN impinge on African chances at benefiting from the current UN reforms? Two, is there any relationship between the lack of consensus on what should be the goal of reform and the divergent views by members? Three, does the UN reforms have consequences for the UN Charter and the Security Council? To investigate the above research questions, the study anchored analysis on the Realist Theory. The framework helps us to understand why we still live with the prejudices and biases of the pre-UN era, many years after the establishment of the UN. It will also help us to explain why the Security Council remains the way it is with its anachronistic tendencies that are unreflective of today’s realities. The study is basically library research hence we relied on documentary method of data collection. We collected data from secondary sources. Such secondary sources are text books; journals; AU, NIIA and UN publications; seminar, conference and workshop papers; magazines, newspapers and internet materials. Descriptive and explanatory methods of analysis were adopted because the study is qualitative method. The study also applied statistical tools where necessary. After a critical analysis of available literature and data, the study revealed as follows: First, the position and activities of the Permanent members on the UN reform impinges on African chances at benefiting from the reform. Second, there is a relationship between the lack of consensus on what should be the goal of reform and the divergent views held by members and finally, the UN reforms have consequences for the UN Charter and the Security Council. Based on the foregoing, the study recommends that a holistic reform of the UN system with special focus on the Security Council must be brought to a conclusive end; and Africa must have at least one slot in the permanent seat of the Security Council. The members of the UN must of necessity find a middle ground on what should be the goal of the reform and re-create itself to assure that all states without any exception must adhere to the fundamental norms and values enshrined in its Charter. Further, to play an assertive and strategic role in the UN system, African states and leaders must take economic and political integration and demands on the UN beyond lip-service. Fundamentally, there must be a high level political action and commitment and</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>viii</p> <p>finally,  the  UN  P5  and  other  member  states  should  be  ready  to  accept  whatever</p> </div>\n\nAFRICA AND THE UNITED NATIONS MILLENNIUM REFORMS: A CRITICAL APPRAISAL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AFRICA AND THE UNITED NATIONS MILLENNIUM REFORMS: A CRITICAL APPRAISAL", "id": 35}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL AND INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT RESOLUTION:</p> <p>A CASE STUDY OF THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL WEAPON INSPECTION IN IRAQ</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This research effort grew out of concern for the increasing use of force in settlement of disputes by the United States which has the tendency to reduce the moral stature of the UN (above all, the security council) an organization committed to the maintenance of international peace and security. It seeks to analyse the role of the United Nations security council in international conflict resolution, using the UN Weapons inspection in Iraq as a case study. This research work sets itself to determining whether the Weapons Inpectors did indict Iraq of possessing WMD. The central focus of the study is to determine whether the UN Security Council authorized the war or whether the war was a pre-emptive action on the<br/>part of the U.S. and its allies. On the above premise, the theoretical framework of political Realism which holds that the overriding national interest of each State is its national Security and survival defined in terms of power. However, the study revealed that the U.S. invasion of Iraq was a clear-cut case of aggression and territorial annexation of another country and therefore a violation of State Sovereignty. The findings of this research are that the United Nations Security Council which is the only organ that can authorize war in modern International law did not authorize the war on Iraq. Consequently, in a bid to justify the war, the U.S and U.K anchored their action on UN Resolution 1441 which, however, never gave Member States an explicit permission to attack Iraq. The study also revealed that the U.S. led<br/>war on Iraq was pre-emptive. Most importantly, the work revealed that the war has a significant relationship with the U.S. foreign policy on the Gulf region. Based on these findings; the study concludes that for peaceful co-existence among Nations, all States should uphold the integrity and authority of the United Nations and of International Law.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.11 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>The United Nations Organization was formed in 1945; it was to be a universal single purpose organization that would promote world peace and security. In order to ensure prompt and effective action by the United Nations, its members confer on the Security Council the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and agree that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility the Security Council acts on their behalf.<br/>The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is the organ of the United Nations charged with maintaining international peace and security among nations. While other organs of UN only make recommendations to member governments, the Security Council has the power to make decisions which member governments must carry out under Article 25 of the United Nations Charter, which reads “the members of the United Nations agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council in accordance with the president charter. The decisions of the Council are known as UNSC Resolutions. The Council is made up of 15 Member States, consisting of five permanent seats and ten temporary seats. The five<br/>permanent seats are China, France, Russia, The United Kingdom and the United States. These big five hold veto power over substantive but not procedural resolutions. The ten temporary seats voted in by the UN General Assembly on a regional basis. The presidency of the Security Council is rotated alphabetically each month.<br/>The Security Council performs these functions on the basis of a universal phenomenon that has come to be known as collective security. This is a system in which aggression against a state is taken to be aggression against all that are parties to the treaty; consequently, a collective action is to be taken by other states to counter such an aggression. A good example was in 1991, when the United States led a coalition force of about 23 countries in a battle code- named “Operation Desert Storm” on Iraq for the formers invasion and annexation of Kuwait on August 2, 1990.<br/>Resolution 687, adopted in 3 April 1991 set out terms of cease fire which demanded respect of inviolability of Iraq- Kuwait border, as well as inspection and destruction of Iraq’s weapon which range greater than 150 kilometres, together with related items paragraph 9 of the Resolution provided for the creation of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) with the mandate to implement immediate on- site inspections of Iraq’s chemical, biological and missile Capabilities, on the basis both of Iraq’s own declarations and of the designation of the special Commission itself. Iraq was equally obliged to declare its nuclear material, equipment and sub-systems to the International Atomic Energy Agency<br/>(IAEA).<br/>A major reason given by the Bush administration for waging war on Iraq was that she possessed Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) as well as had links with al-Qaeda (Osama Bin laden and Saddam Hussein). This led to the adumbration of a doctrine of “pre-emption” by the Bush administration; in Blair’s words, “it is a matter of time unless we act and take a stand before terrorism and weapons of mass destruction come together, and I regard them as two sides of the same coin”.</p> <p>1.12 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>In the period before the war, when it became apparent that a specific UN Security Council authorization was unlikely, States and international lawyers criticized the proposed US-led military action in Iraq as unlawful since this action was not a case of self- defence. To the extent that the invasion was based on a claim of anticipatory self- defence, Article 51 has been stretched beyond endurance. Secondly, to the extent that the invasion was based on claims of threats to international peace and security sufficient under Chapter vii to justify Security Council authorization, but with those claims poorly argued and the council eventually by passed, the credibility of the whole Charter system has again been frontally<br/>challenged. And thirdly, to the extent that the invasion was based on Saddam Hussein’s record of tyranny over his people- but again, poorly and inconsistently argued, and with the council by passed – we have almost choked at birth what many were hoping was an emerging new norm justifying intervention on the basis of the principle of “responsibility to protect”.<br/>Finally, this work would analyse the war on Iraq and its implications for international law. The law is clear, no amount of weapons a state has whether chemical, biological, and nuclear, laser and blinding weapons can be conceived as an attack by the possessor state against another state. Such possession may however be styled by the UN as constituting a threat to peace. A threat to National Security is not a recognized basis for use of force. President Bush, in giving the President of Iraq Saddam Hussein, a 48 hours ultimatum to leave Baghdad said: “the United State of America has the Sovereign authority to use force in assuring its own national security”. It becomes the task of this thesis to ascertain whether every state can launch a pre-emptive war against any state, she regards as a threat to her national security, which implies that international law no longer exists for nations to obey or that international law only entitled the right of pre-emptive war on the United State of America. Nevertheless, the study will be guided by the following research questions.</p> <p>(1) Did the UN Security Council Support for the invasion of Iraq help eliminate the production of Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq?<br/>(2) Did the UN Security Council Sanctions on Iraq help minimize the Iraqis quest For Weapons of Mass Destruction?<br/>(3) Did the IAEA of the UN fail to discover Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq?</p> <p>1.13 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The broad objective of this study is to critically examine the UNSC and International Conflict Resolution. Whereas the specific objectives of the study are:<br/>(1) To determine whether the UN Security Council Support for the invasion of Iraq helped eliminate the production of Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq.<br/>(2) To determine whether the UN Security Council Sanctions on Iraq helped minimize the Iraqis quest for Weapon of Mass Destruction.<br/>(3) To determine whether the IAEA of the UN discover Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq.</p> <p>1.14 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study has both theoretical and practical significance. Theoretically, this research seeks to contribute and bring fresh insight to the understanding of the UN Security Council Weapon Inspection in Iraq. As a result it will reveal how America, invaded Iraq. Therefore, the significance of this thesis is predicated on the fact that it would re-echo, the need for nations to support the concept of collective security, a process in which all members of the international community join strengths to deter or punish those who resort to violence and aggression and discourage unilateral action on the part of powerful nations in pursuance of its national interest. The study will add to existing literature in this area and serve as a reference<br/>material for students and scholars with interest Weapon Inspection in Iraq. We hope that the study will stimulate further investigation in this area as little or no research has be done regarding Weapon Inspection in Iraq.<br/>At the Practical level, the findings of this study willhighlight the role the United Nations Security Council played in trying to discourage and prevent the United States from attacking Iraq. This work will help to reaffirm and increase the moral status of the UNSC among States especially third world States (the weaker and vulnerable members of the international system who depend upon these institutions to protect their sovereign status). This work hopes to make a modest contribution by way of addition to the extant literature on the US-led war on Iraq and its implication for international law by showing that, both the UN Charter and international law made adequate provisions for peaceful settlement of disputes among States.<br/>This work is equally important as it will act as a light and a guide on the paths of powerful States not to use their privileged positions in the UN to telescope and interfere with any UNSC weapons inspection activities in the future. Finally and most importantly, this work will show that, the United States and the United Kingdom stand accused of having waged an aggressive war against Iraq, exactly the same crime of which Iraq was accused in 1990 following the invasion and occupation of Kuwait. International law protects the sovereignty of disagreeable regimes, just as it did not matter in 1990 whether Kuwait was<br/>well governed, so it was irrelevant to this indictment that the governing regime in Iraq in 2003 was deeply unpleasant. Also, the findings of this study will help policy makers in Africa and Nigeria in particular to weigh options critically before acting especially, in international politics where betrayal has become almost a norm of statecraft.</p>\n\nTHE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL AND INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT RESOLUTION:<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL AND INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT RESOLUTION:", "id": 36}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>EUROPEAN UNION AND CHALLENGES OF AFRICA’S DEVELOPMENT: A CRITICAL APPRAISAL, 1999-2010</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This study examined the European Union, EU and challenges of African development. Specifically, the study ascertained if the increasing rate of EUAfrican relations has increased the volume of trade between EU and Africaand secondly, ascertained if the increasing rate of EU-African relations has increased the volume of foreign direct investment from EU states to Africa. The study interrogated the following research questions. First, has the increasing rate of EU-African relations increased the volume of trade<br/>between EU and Africa? Second, has the increasing rate of EU-African relations increased the volume of foreign direct investment (FDI) from EU states to Africa? The theory of complex interdependence was chosen as our theoretical framework. Our choice of the theory is because of its ability to highlight cooperative actions among states and facilitate deep understanding of global patterns of interrelationship. The study relied on secondary sources of data, and as such generated both qualitative and quantitative data. After a critical analysis of available data, the study revealed as follows: first, the increasing rate of EU-African relations has increased the volume of trade between EU and Africa. Second, the increasing rate of EU-African relations has increased the volume of foreign direct investment from EU states to Africa. Based on these findings, the study is of the view that Africa as a continent should deepen the rate of economic activities between her and EU in order to attract more FDI and trade deals. Further, Africa should cultivate, and compete for, foreign direct investment inflows to bridge their domestic saving-investment gap and therefore augment the available funds to finance development process through bilateral investment agreements like their developing countries counterpart in other regions.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>Title page —————————————————————————i<br/>Certification ————————————————————————-ii<br/>Dedication ————————————————————————–iii<br/>Acknowledgement —————————————————————–iv<br/>Table of Contents —————————————————————— v<br/>List of Tables and Diagrams —————————————————–vii<br/>List of Abbreviations —————————————————————ix<br/>Abstract ——————————————————————————-x<br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 Background to the Study —————————————————-1<br/>1.2 Statement of the Problem —————————————————-3<br/>1.3 Objectives of the Study ——————————————————-5<br/>1.4 Significance of the Study —————————————————–5<br/>1.5 Literature Review—————————————————————6<br/>1.6 Theoretical Framework——————————————————-21<br/>1.7 Hypotheses ——————————————————————–24<br/>1.8 Methods of Data Collection and Analysis———————————24<br/>CHAPTER TWO: THE EVOLUTION OF EU AND EU-AFRICAN RELATIONS<br/>2.1 History and Development of European Union—————————26<br/>2.2 Organs and Institutions of European Union—————————–42<br/>2.3 History and Development of European Union-African Relations——44<br/>CHAPTER THREE: EU STRATEGY AND TRADE INVESTMENT IN AFRICA<br/>3.1 EU Trade Policy Towards ACP Countries———————————54<br/>3.2 EU Trade in Goods and Services in Africa——————————–58<br/>CHAPTER FOUR: THE EU AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN<br/>AFRICA<br/>4.1 Rational for Foreign Direct Investment ———————————–68<br/>4.2 Why FDI is Important to Africa——————————————–70<br/>4.3 Initiatives taken by African countries to attract FDI——————–72<br/>4.4 Incidence of FDI Inflow from EU into Africa —————————–75<br/>CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION<br/>5.1 Summary and Conclusion ————————————————86<br/>Bibliography —————————————————————–89</p>\n\nEUROPEAN UNION AND CHALLENGES OF AFRICA’S DEVELOPMENT: A CRITICAL APPRAISAL, 1999-2010<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EUROPEAN UNION AND CHALLENGES OF AFRICA’S DEVELOPMENT: A CRITICAL APPRAISAL, 1999-2010", "id": 37}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE US SECURITY POLICY AND NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR PROGRAMME, 2000 – 2008</strong></p> <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p>This study examines the interface between the US security policy and North Korea nuclear programme. The thrust of the study however is to find out if the US government perceived North Korea nuclear programme as a threat to its national security on the one hand and part of its war on terror, between 2000 and 2008 on the other. The study also investigated whether the US government security policy on North Korea nuclear programme relegates multilateral intervention on nuclear weapon development within the same period. Relying on the realist approach which tackles politics for what it is without moralizing it, qualitative method and qualitative descriptive method of analysis, and relying on secondary sources, the study argues that the US government perceived North Korea nuclear programme as a threat to its national security as well part of its war on terror, between 2000 and 2008 and as such orient its security policy on North Korea nuclear programme to relegate multilateral intervention on nuclear weapon development. Accordingly, the study maintains that the US government should really curtail the rate at which it seeks, foster and protect what it regards as its national interests as this accounts for North Korea’s nuclear enrichment.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background Of study<br/></strong></p> <p>The posture of the US foreign and defense policies especially in the post-Cold War era of international politics has demonstrated blatantly and abundantly a tendency to seek power, increase power and to demonstrate power (Morganthau, 1973). More importantly, the 9/11 terrorist attack did transform the way America government think about their foreign and defense policies. In fact, there have been remarkable changes in U.S defense and nuclear weapons policy following the 9/11 terrorist attack. These changes in U.S nuclear weapon policy were announced in two official documents that were released by the Bush’s administration in 2002. Both documents, according to Intriligator (2003), were influenced, in part, by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S. The first of these documents is the U.S Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) issued by the U.S Department of Defense which expressively states that “A combination of offensive and defensive and nuclear and non-nuclear capabilities is essential to meet the deterrence requirements of the 21st century” (cited in Intriligator, 2003:2). The second of these documents is the National Security Strategy of the United States of America (NSS). Issued by the Office of the National Security Advisor to the President in September, 2000, the document reveals that there are plans to ensure that no nation could rival U.S military strength. It proclaims the doctrine of U.S preemption, where it “cannot let our enemies strike first” and gives arguments for preemption. It notes that for “centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves against forces that present an imminent danger of attack.” (Intriligator, nd: 2).</p> <p>Thus, influenced mostly by the latter document, President George W. Bush, on June 1st, 2002, at West Point, set forth a new doctrine for U.S security policy. According to him,</p> <p>The successful strategies of the cold war era are ill-suited to national defense in the 21st century. Deterrence means nothing against terrorist networks; containment will not thwart unbalanced dictators possessing weapons of mass destruction. We cannot afford to wait until we are attacked. In today’s circumstances, Americans must be ready to take ‘preemptive action’ to defend our lives and liberties (Galston, 2002: np).</p> <p>With this, George W. Bush not only introduced what has since been widely known as “Bush Doctrine”, but has also made it an official part of U.S policy. Therefore, US defense/strategic policy under George W. Bush, as aptly described by Falk (2002) implies striking first, not in a crisis, but on the basis of shadowy intentions, alleged potentials links to terrorist groups, supposed plans and projects to acquire weapons of mass destruction, and anticipations of possible future dangers.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the US government, even before the 9/11, appeared to have been committed to unilateral military solution to the problems of terrorism and acquisition and possible use of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). Hence, in the aftermath of the 11 September terrorist attacks, the United States found justification to harass, intimidate, attack and dethrone regimes suspected of either harboring terrorists, amassing weapons of mass destruction or colluding with the known terrorist organizations. These states were variously labeled by the Bush administration as “terrorist states”, “axis of evil”, “rogue states”, among others and therefore proclaimed its determination to attack “foes in anticipation of hostile acts” and to carry out these attacks “unilaterally, presumably without prior authorization from the United Nations Security Council” (cited in Wirtz and Russel, 2003: 117). True to its threat, the administration of Bush preemptively and unilaterally attacked Iraq in 2003, dethroning its leader- Saddam Hussein and installing another government which is believed to be pliable to the government on the United States. However, despite the avalanche of criticisms and condemnations that have trailed the US unilateralism and hegemonism in the aftermath of the Cold war, the US government, particularly the administration of George Bush, did maintain unequivocally that the menace of terrorism as well as the potential dangers posed by the accumulation and the possible use of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) by the “rogue states” has made the resort to preemption unquestionably desirable.</p> <p>As for the North Korea, various diplomatic efforts have been underway, in the last 25 years, to grapple with the North Korean nuclear issue in terms of whether to prevent North Korea from acquiring nuclear weapons or to disarm its assumed nuclear weapons capability. At different times, the instruments to achieve these objectives have included an international treaty (the NPT), a regional nuclear-free zone (the NSDD) and a bilateral agreement between the US and North Korea. In the end, none of these diplomatic efforts and agreements has been fully successful, although, in different degrees, they have helped to delay or constrain – sometimes very significantly – North Korea’s nuclear weapons efforts (Niksch, 2002). The current diplomatic effort involves a fourth variation – a Six Party multilateral agreement or perhaps a package of bilateral agreements stitched together in an overall multilateral framework. As with previous efforts, the future success or failure of the Six Party Talks is uncertain.</p> <p>In crafting their approaches to the nuclear issue, the US and other powers have struggled to come to grips with Pyongyang’s ultimate intentions. For years, North Korea watchers have debated whether Pyongyang views nuclear weapons as indispensable to the regime’s survival and therefore non-negotiable, or whether it sees its nuclear assets as a bargaining chip to be traded away for political and economic benefits necessary to sustaining the regime. The historical record suggests that the answer is both, and the emphasis that Pyongyang places on one or the other varies with domestic conditions and external circumstances (Henneka, 2006). On the one hand, the time and energy that North Korea has invested in developing its nuclear weapons capability, allied to its willingness to repeatedly violate nuclear agreements, strongly suggests that North Korean leaders deeply believe that some kind of nuclear hedge – or at least the appearance of a credible nuclear hedge – is essential to regime survival. Pyongyang sees itself as a besieged and beleaguered state, surrounded by more powerful enemies, untrustworthy allies, and a successful southern competitor. To this end, as articulated by Henneka (2006), if North Korea is ever going to reform itself and survive in the long run, it must find respite from external pressures and perceived threats in which case, nuclear weapons are the ultimate defence. Therefore, as long as outside powers believe that it has a nuclear deterrent they are – in Pyongyang’s view – more likely to leave North Korea alone and less likely to pursue hostile policies that could provoke a confrontation in which such weapons are used. On the other hand, North Korea has demonstrated that it does respond to international inducements and pressures to limit its nuclear programme. In the past, Soviet diplomacy, backed by promises of nuclear power assistance, persuaded North Korea to join the NPT, and US diplomatic efforts convinced North Korea to implement IAEA inspections. Later, Washington and Pyongyang negotiated a complex bilateral agreement that froze North Korea’s plutonium production facilities and established a process for the eventual elimination of these facilities. With a combination of carrots and sticks, Washington has been making enormous diplomatic efforts to convince Pyongyang to open up a secret underground facility and to accept a moratorium on long-range missile tests (Niksch, 2002). Be that as it may, diplomatic efforts in the past have constrained, but not eliminated North Korea’s nuclear capabilities.</p> <p>Against the background of the foregoing, the study critically assesses the US security policy and North Korean nuclear programme, between 2000 and 2008. The study also examines the US defense policy in terms of the North Korean nuclear programme jeopardizes US national security as well as her crusade against international terrorism with the same period.</p> <p><strong>1.2 </strong><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Diplomatic efforts oriented towards grappling with the attempts by North Korean government to acquire nuclear weapons and develop its ballistic missile capabilities have witnessed both success and failure. During this period, four different approaches have been variously tried. First, beginning in the 1980s, the US-led efforts to use pressures and inducements to convince North Korea to adhere to the 1968 Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons on the one hand, and accept International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection of its nuclear facilities and materials, on the other. In December 1985, North Korea acceded to the NPT and, after significant prevarication, accepted international inspections in April 1992. The implementation of the inspection agreement however collapsed following North Korean government refusal to cooperate with the IAEA to verify plutonium production prior to 1992, a situation compounded when Pyongyang threatened to withdraw from the NPT in March 1993.</p> <p>Second, in December 1991, North and South Korea entered into a bilateral agreement on ‘denuclearisation’ which included restrictions on nuclear activities beyond those specified in the NPT. Unfortunately, this agreement was not implemented as a result of disagreements between Seoul and Pyongyang over the number and type of bilateral inspections necessary to verify it.</p> <p>Third, consequent upon threat by North Korean government to pull out from the NPT in March 1993, the US and North Korea in October 1994 concluded a bilateral agreement: the Agreed Framework. The Agreed Framework called for an ambitious undertaking to freeze and eventually dismantle North Korea’s plutonium production facilities and account for its plutonium stocks in exchange for interim supplies of heavy fuel oil and an alternative nuclear energy project, as well as improved bilateral relations with Washington. For nearly a decade, the Agreed Framework halted North Korean production of additional plutonium, but it did not end North Korea’s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, the Agreed Framework collapsed amid diplomatic acrimony arising from public revelations in October 2002 that North Korea was pursuing a secret programme to produce weapons grade uranium. North Korea however revived its plutonium production facilities in December 2002 and withdrew from the NPT in January 2003, arguing that it had already given the requisite 90-day notice when it announced its original intent to withdraw in March 1993.</p> <p>Finally, the US has, since the collapse of the Agreed Framework,  promoted a fourth effort to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue – through Six Party Talks between the US, Russia, China, Japan, and North and South Korea. These are intended to secure a multilateral agreement for North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons programme in exchange for security assurances and political and economic benefits. This is in line with the present US national security strategy which states that “the US may not deter the types of threats that are emerging today, such as those created by rogue nations or terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction” (Woolf, 2008: 9-10). Consequently, the US government has sought to preempt these threats through persuasive diplomacy, and attacking the adversaries before they can attack the US, its allies and interests.</p> <p>The link between the US national security policy and North Korean nuclear programmes has been a subject of intellectual discourse and considerable efforts have been made by scholars such as Niksch (2002), Henneka (2006), Boureston and Russell (2009), Niksch (2006), Chanlett-Avery (2012), Pritchard (2005), Ur-Reham (2010) and so on to examine the threats of North Korean nuclear programmes to the US national interests/security. Despite the forgoing inquiries, the extant literature has suffered from important shortcomings. This is because the existing research in this area has not satisfactorily explained whether the US government perceives North Korea Nuclear Programme as a threat to its national security. Of much importance, however, is the fact that the existing inquiries have failed short of evaluating adequately whether the US government perceive North Korea Nuclear Programme as part of its war on terror. Finally, adequate attempts have not been made to explore the link between the US government security policy on North Korea Nuclear Programme and multilateral intervention on nuclear weapon development.</p> <p>In the light of the above, attempt is made, therefore, to critically examine the US national security policy and North Korean nuclear programmes, between 2000 and 2008 in context of the understated research questions:</p> <ul><li>Did the US government perceive North Korea Nuclear Programme as a threat to its national security, between 2000 and 2008?</li> <li>Did the US government perceive North Korea Nuclear Programme as part of its war on terror, between 2000 and 2008?</li> <li>Did the US government security policy on North Korea nuclear programme relegate multilateral intervention on nuclear weapon development, between 2000 and 2008?</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.3 Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The broad objective of this study is to critically examine the interface between the US security policy and North Korea nuclear programme. However, the study is set to achieve the following specific objectives:</p> <ul><li>To examine whether the US government perceives North Korea nuclear programme as a threat to its national security, between 2000 and 2008.</li> <li>To ascertain whether the US government perceives North Korea nuclear programme as part of its war on terror, between 2000 and 2008.</li> <li>To investigate if the US government security policy on North Korea nuclear programme relegates multilateral intervention on nuclear weapon development, between 2000 and 2008.</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.4 Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This research work has both theoretical and practical significance. Theoretically, the study interrogates the link between the North Korea nuclear programme and threat to the national security; between the North Korea nuclear programme and the US government war on terror; and between the US government security policy on North Korea nuclear programme and multilateral intervention on nuclear weapon development.</p> <p>Practically, the study will be of interest and immense importance to the Nigerian government, the organs of the United Nations and other people, groups and organizations interested in American hegemony and unilateralism in this 21stcentury. The issues will not only help to enhance understanding of American defense and foreign policy in the 21st century, but will also provide valuable information/data that will assist global actors in articulating potent policies that will help to address the US government -North Korean government face-off over nuclear programme.</p> <p>Again, by examining, in its entirety, the North Korea nuclear programme, the study will constructively highlight how it poses a threat to the US government national security on the one hand and how the US government security policy on North Korea nuclear programme relegates multilateral intervention on nuclear weapon development on the other.</p> <p>Finally, the study by addressing the research questions, clarifying issues, facilitating understanding and stimulating enlightened intellectual discourse will not only be a further contribution to knowledge and a source for further research but will equally chart a new intellectual course in the study of US hegemony and unilateralism in this 21st century.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Literature Review</strong></p> <p>The thrust of this review is to ascertain how writers have tried to explain the link between the following: North Korea nuclear programme and threat to the US national security; North Korea nuclear programme and the US government war on terror; and US government security policy on North Korea nuclear programme and multilateral intervention on nuclear weapon development. This is with a view to locating the gaps in the literature. The implication of this, therefore, is that our research questions will generally guide the review.</p> <p><strong>Did the US government perceive North Korea nuclear programme as a threat to its national security, between 2000 and 2008?</strong></p> <p>There is no doubt that scholars have oriented their intellectual energies towards explaining the US national security and the North Korean nuclear programme. To this end, Intriligator (2003) maintained that the national Security Strategy of the United States (NSS) places major emphasis on preemption and calls for it rather than deterrence as the fundamental basis of national security, such policy, of course, is a violation of the UN system that was set up in large part to prevent precisely such preemption. According to the writer, the United Nations forbids a member state from taking military action against another member state unless it has itself been attacked or it has the sanctions of the Security Council. To this end, the writer contends that the US violation of international law in its attack on Iraq was as much a violation as Saddam Hussein was in his attack on Kuwait. Again, the writer fails to provide specific sections of international law or UN Charter that uphold that preemption amounts to violation of law.</p> <p>In the view of Niksch (2002), North Korea’s nuclear weapons program has been an immediate foreign policy issue facing the United States because of North Korea’s refusal to carry out its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and other nuclear accords it had signed. According to the writer, North Korea has constructed nuclear reactors and a plutonium reprocessing plant at a site called Yongbyon. U.S. and other foreign intelligence assessments have concluded that North Korea probably has acquired enough weapons-grade plutonium for the manufacture of at least one nuclear weapon. The United States and North Korea signed an agreement on October 21, 1994, that offers North Korea a package of benefits in return for a freeze of North Korea’s nuclear program. Benefits to North Korea include: light water nuclear reactors totaling 2,000 electric megawatts; shipments of “heavy oil” to North Korea.  However, the pace of implementation of the Agreed Framework has been very slow, according to the writer, and instead of the original target date of 2003, it is estimated that completion of the light water reactors will not take place until well beyond 2010. The United States has faced several policy problems since the signing of the Agreed Framework, including securing money annually to finance heavy oil shipments to North Korea, suspicions of clandestine North Korean nuclear activities, and North Korea’s development of long range missiles.</p> <p>Similarly, Wirtz and Russel (2003) have noted that the Bush administration developed new guidelines to govern the use of force in combating emerging terrorist adversaries or “terrorist states.” The writers maintained that by advocating preventive war and preemption, especially as a possible response to Iraq’s failure to fulfill its obligations under UN Security Council resolutions to eliminate its nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and associated infrastructure following the Gulf War, the Bush administration is generally depicted if not being on the wrong side of international law, then pushing the limits of what is generally considered to be constructive international behavior. To the duo, the apparent effort to legitimize preventive war and preemption is often depicted as creating an intolerable precedent when it comes to other enduring conflicts. They, therefore, concluded by wondering whether the Bush administration decision to undertake preventive war would shape the overall tenor of international relations. That is, whether it would signal a new respect for international law, or just a growing reliance on the use of force in world politics.</p> <p>In a similar vein, Thomas (2004) criticizes America for preferring “to conduct massive bombing campaigns against other states without much fear of casualties to American forces.” He therefore, contends that the United States has done this time and time again, despite the necessity of it, the justness of the cause, or the civilian casualties incurred. He states that “Washington wants other states to trust its noble intentions, but the record of U.S. military interventions in Vietnam, Iraq, Panama, Afghanistan, and other places would give rise to doubts.” In addition to the suspicions many in the global theater have developed concerning America’s benevolent intentions, the writer also believes that there is also a growing awareness of its  insensitivity to other cultures and values.                                                                                                     In line with the foregoing contention, Galston (2002) upholds that the invasion of Iraq based on the new Bush doctrine of preemption meant not only the most fateful deployments of American power since World War II, but also an end to the system of international institutions, laws and norms that Americans have worked to build for more than half a century. To this effect, the writer believes that this revolution in international doctrine is justified and wise.  For the writer, rather than continuing to serve as first among equals in the postwar international system, the United States has acted as a law unto itself, creating new rules of international engagement without the consent of other nations. In his judgment therefore, this new stance would ill serve the long-term interests of the United States. In the first place, the United States is a signatory to (indeed, the principal drafter of) the United Nations Charter, which explicitly reserves to sovereign nations the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense, but only in the event of armed attack. Unless the administration establishes Iraqi complicity in the terrorism of 9-11, it cannot invoke self-defense, as defined by the charter, as the justification for attacking Iraq. Furthermore, the writer insists that the broader structure of international law creates additional obstacles to an invasion of Iraq. Though such law contains a doctrine of “anticipatory self-defense,” there must be shown a necessity of self-defense, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation. In this regard, the concept of anticipatory self-defense was too narrow to support an attack on Iraq: The threat to the United States from Iraq is not sufficiently specific, clearly enough established or shown to be imminent, the writer contends. In sum, he avers that with preemptive war in Iraq, the Bush administration has shifted its focus from stateless foes to state-based adversaries, and from terrorism in the precise sense to the possession of weapons of mass destruction. Each constitutes a threat. But they are not the same threat and do not warrant the same response. It serves no useful purpose to pretend that they are seamlessly connected, let alone one and the same, be believes.                                                                                                                                                             In another development, Niksch (2006) maintained that North Korea’s decisions at the end of 2002 to restart nuclear installations at Yongbyon that were shut down under the U.S.-North Korean Agreed Framework of 1994 and to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and its multiple missile tests of July 4, 2006, create a foreign policy problem for the United States. Restarting the Yongbyon facilities opens up a possible North Korean intent to stage a “nuclear breakout” of its nuclear program and openly produce nuclear weapons. North Korea has also threatened to test a nuclear weapon. North Korea’s actions follow the disclosure in October 2002 that it is operating a secret nuclear program based on uranium enrichment and the decision by the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) in November 2002 to suspend shipments of heavy oil to North Korea. North Korea claims that it has nuclear weapons and that it has completed reprocessing of over 8,000 nuclear fuel rods. To this the U.S. officials and other experts state that North Korea probably had reprocessed most or all of the fuel rods and may have produced enough plutonium for 6-10 atomic bombs. The main objective of the Bush Administration, according to the writer, was to secure the dismantling of North Korea’s plutonium and uranium-based nuclear programs. Its strategy included :(1) terminating the Agreed Framework; (2) withholding U.S. reciprocal measures until North Korea takes steps to dismantle its nuclear programs; (3) assembling an international coalition, through six party negotiations, to apply diplomatic and economic pressure on North Korea; and (4) imposing financial sanctions on foreign banks that facilitate North Korea’s illegal counterfeiting activities. China, South Korea, and Russia criticized the Bush Administration for not negotiating directly with North Korea, and they also voiced opposition to economic sanctions and to the potential use of force against Pyongyang. China, Russia, and South Korea increasingly have expressed support for North Korea’s position in six-party talks. The talks have made little progress. As also articulated by the writer, North Korea, in the six party meetings of July- September 2005, widened the gap between the U.S. and North Korean positions when it asserted that it would not dismantle or even disclose its nuclear programs until light water reactors were physically constructed in North Korea. The widening gap was not narrowed by a statement of the six parties on September 19, 2005, in which North Korea agreed to rejoin the NPT and its 1992 safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency “at an early date” but which also contained a reference to North Korea’s right to have a light water reactor, the writer concluded.</p> <p>Again, Finstad (nd) contends that it makes more sense to define preemption as striking a potential adversary before it can become a nuclear power, rather than striking an enemy before it can strike you. According to him, China and Russia are more threatening to the US than the entire “axis of evil” combined, but, as nuclear powers, it would be unthinkable for the US to launch a first strike (or preemption) on either nation the way it did to Iraq. Furthermore, the writer insists that the re-definition of the preemption doctrine is most significant in the way that it impacts the incentive structure of nations at odds with US foreign policy. For him, analysis of actions and statements made by Iran and North Korea show that these countries are acting rationally from within this structure: Having already developed atomic bombs and viable delivery systems, North Korea believes that bold statements of its willingness to use these weapons will deter an American attack. Conversely, Iran realizes that it must not make its ongoing pursuit of nukes public, but believes it is not only essential to Iran’s security to continue developing its nuclear program, but the programme will also serves sound deterrent against American invasion. In sum the writer argues that these recent actions by Iran and North Korea further demonstrate that the Bush administration’s preemption doctrine in Iraq was not a deterrent at all.  The implication is that countries that find themselves at odds with the interests of the United States feel threatened by the example of Iraq, and are encouraged to develop nukes by the example of North Korea. Smaller countries with fewer resources to foster nuclear research, such as Libya, may be intimidated into scrapping their programs. Larger, wealthier, more threatening nations, however, are simply encouraged to build nuclear bombs, and to make their willingness to use them known to the world.</p> <p>For Chanlett-Avery (2012), North Korea has been among the most vexing and persistent problems in U.S. foreign policy in the post-Cold War period. Negotiations over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program have consumed the past three U.S. administrations, even as some analysts anticipated a collapse of the isolated authoritarian regime. North Korea, according to the writer, has been the recipient of well over $1 billion in U.S. aid and the target of dozens of U.S. sanctions. As U.S. policy toward Pyongyang evolved through the George W. Bush presidency and into the Obama Administration, the negotiations moved from mostly bilateral to the multilateral Six-Party Talks (made up of China, Japan, Russia, North Korea, South Korea, and the United States). To this end, the writer maintained that although the negotiations have reached some key agreements that lay out deals for aid and recognition to North Korea in exchange for denuclearization, major problems with implementation have persisted. With talks suspended since 2009, concern about proliferation to other actors has grown. The Obama Administration, like its predecessors, faces fundamental decisions on how to approach North Korea.</p> <p><strong>Did the US government perceive North Korea Nuclear Programme as part of its war on terror, between 2000 and 2008?</strong></p> <p>Our major concern in this segment of the literature review is to find out whether the US government perceives North Korea Nuclear Programme as part of its war on terror. To this end, Ifesinachi (2006) sees the US-led war on terror in terms of unilateralism. According to him, the trajectories of the phenomenon of terror derive from political motivation. To this effect, he maintains that political terror has served the ends of political struggle and as such, sovereign recognition and intervention are products of political struggles which reflect the contradictions of material condition at every phase of human history. Berating America’s military crusade against terrorism, the writer rightly and logically argues that terrorism as a political problem will subsist (notwithstanding America’s seemingly efforts to stamp it) since the political problem that induces it persist. Accordingly, Ifesinachi writes:</p> <p>…terrorism as a political problem will persist as long as the political problem that induces it persists. The solution to terrorism is not just to punish terrorists but in seeking out common political solutions to the political malaise prompting terrorism. The rationalization of state terrorism in terms of the war on terror is seen to be sterile and redundant. It is in this context that the need for defining anti-terrorism campaigns as a global problem becomes contingent on the restructuring of the global order (Ifesinachi, 2006: 7).</p> <p>As for Gardner (nd), Al Quaida, instead of regressing during the fight on terrorism, is increasing its membership greatly worldwide. More alarming, according to the writer, is that it has decentralized even more after 9/11; it has more popular support among young Arabs and non-Arab Muslims and Osama is to many Muslims what “Che” was for many Latin Americans. Now many Muslims and non-Muslims alike see more clearly the comparison between Israel’s occupation and treatment of Palestinians and U.S. occupation and treatment of Iraq. This brings into question the limits of the military solution as the ultimate option, and the Bush administration’s failure to appreciate the complexity of terrorism as a manifestation of deeper societal problems combined with adamant opposition to western imperialism. More so, the writer insists that because terrorism has existed for centuries in one form or another, one would think that intelligent people working in Washington D.C. today would realize that the best method of containing it is to understand its root causes and then to provide a long-term political solution. This does not mean that armed forces should not be utilized, but if that is the only solution, it leads to more terrorism and an endless cycle of political violence that costs the status-quo state more than it costs the terrorists, he concludes</p> <p>Contributing, Marszka (2009) wondered whether the Bush Doctrine has increased asymmetric warfare in the form of terrorism or whether it has been an effective policy against it. He, therefore, insists that if the United States can justify preemption and unilateralism in defense of its national security with Security Council authorization, that would be catastrophic in most cases as other nations would equally be attempted to attack and justify their actions as preempting. The writer, therefore, bemoaned the Bush administration for favoring this seemingly counterproductive foreign policy strategy.</p> <p>In another development, Okolie (2005) investigates the changing pattern of terrorism and its implications for global security. To this effect, the writer avers that terrorism is escalating and posing threats to peace and security. Continuing, the writer maintains that  the September 11, 2001 incident compelled the then President of United States, George Bush to refocus US foreign and security policies on two distinct, if not cross-cutting missions: defeating ‘terrorism with a global reach’ and ‘keeping the worst weapons out of the hands of the worst people’. According to him, at the heart of the above policies is the policy of preemptive use of force. However, rather than American hegemony and unilateralism, the writer advocates for a new global security codes that would be ratified and agreed upon and enforcement done under the auspices of the United Nations.</p> <p>On the other hand, Mamdani (2004) avers that events after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Cold War suggest that America’s low intensity conflict against militant nationalist regimes continued thereafter, even up to 9/11. According to him, by 9/11, the methods changed drastically, from low-intensity proxy war to high intensity direct warfare; the shift which was made possible by a changed political climate in post 9/11. More so, the author insists that the trajectory of proxy war in the rough decade from the end of the Cold War to 9/11 is best illuminated on the ground of Iraq where the Bush administration saw a golden opportunity to shed the inhibitions of the Cold War and declare open season of militant nationalism. However, as the writer argues, whereas the Taliban had been pinpointed as hosts of al-Qaeda, there was little legitimate effort to connect the invasion of Iraq to the terror that was 9/11. For the author therefore the war on terror had moved on from addressing broadly shared security concerns to targeting militant nationalism, and the war against militant nationalism would conclude the unfinished business of the Cold  War. However, the author concludes that:</p> <p>…the two adversaries in the war on terror: the United States and al-Qaeda are both veterans of Cold War. Both see the through lenses of power….Caught in a situation where both adversaries in the war on terror claim to be fighting terror with weapons of terror, nothing less than a global movement for peace will save humanity. If we are to go by the lesson of the last global struggle for peace, that to end the war in Vietnam, this struggle, too, will have to be waged as a mass movement inside each country, particularly the democratic countries, and especially in the United States and Israel (Mamdani (2004: 257-258)</p> <p>Falode (2002), prior to the attack on America in 2001, the political interplay in the Middle-East and South-East Asia had been a very volatile one, speckled with distrust and suspicion as well as America’s passivity. Continuing, the writer stated that while factors of economy, territory, irredentism and religion essentially accounted for these volatile relationships, the coordinated terrorist attack on America on September 11, 2001 impacted profoundly on this fragile and political balance. The implication of this, according to the writer was the fact that America was forced to jettison the multinationalist and isolationalist approach for the more flexible, uncompromising unilateralist approach. And this meant that America would no longer seek the views of the allies before embarking on any political adventure or misadventure in the international environment.                                                                                                                              In a similar argument, Eliot (2003) insists that while concern about peaceful strategies for the 21st century is essential, it is more crucial to attempt stopping this very risky war and lowering the Bush administration’s bellicose rhetoric (and exorbitant military budget) that is escalating tensions and dangers across the globe. As for the writer, the Bush administration’s paranoia and militaristic belligerence has erased much of the sympathy people around the globe felt toward America after September 11th, and has escalated tensions and dangers throughout the planet. Furthermore, the writer avers that the terrible risks inherent in pre-emptive war-the potential deaths of thousands of innocent Iraqis, the danger to U.S. troops, the likely rise in terrorist recruitment, the long-term environmental degradation of the region through oil fires and depleted uranium, and the temptation to move on to the next war and the next generation of dangerous weaponry simply cannot be justified by any of the reasons offered by the Bush administration. Instead of brainstorming justifications and military strategies for a pre-emptive war, the writer believes that it would be nice if the Bush administration would devote its creativities to thinking about non-war alternatives.</p> <p><strong>Did the US government security policy on North Korea nuclear programme relegate multilateral intervention on nuclear weapon development</strong>, <strong>between 2000 and 2008?</strong></p> <p>In this final segment of the literature review, our concern is to find out whether the US government security policy on North Korea nuclear programme relegates multilateral intervention on nuclear weapon development. To this end, Pritchard (2005) averred that the lack of a permanent multilateral structure for security dialogue in North-East Asia and the lack of a successful precedent involving the DPRK in multilateral talks contribute to the likelihood that this iteration of multilateral talks may well fail. The period of time between sessions of the Six-Party Talks and the lack of progress suggest that there is insufficient common ground or commitment by the key participants (the United States and the DPRK) for resolution of the crisis in the foreseeable future. In the face of likely failure of the multilateral process currently underway, it would seem prudent for the participants to review the substantial track record of DPRK participation and accommodation in bilateral negotiations with both the United States and the Republic of Korea and modify the Six-Party Talks accordingly. One way to do this, according to the writer, would be for the United States to enter into a serious and sustained bilateral dialogue with Pyongyang as a complementary component of the six-party process. In this scenario, as the United States begins to shape what may ultimately result in a resolution to the crisis in its complementary negotiations with North Korea under the auspices of the six-party process, it would continue to consult with its close allies South Korea and Japan. Washington’s coordinated policy approach to North Korea would be enhanced by Tokyo and Seoul’s own bilateral meetings with Pyongyang.  This two-pronged approach has the best chance of forging a near-term negotiated settlement through an extensive and mutually supportive bilateral component and the best chance to ensure its implementation through a multilateral component of guarantees and monitoring. Given the track record of the past two years, the prognosis for successful resolution of the nuclear crisis through the current framework of multilateral talks is not very bright, the writer concluded.</p> <p>Ur-Reham (2010) reviewed the prospects for Korean reunification in view of the policies and actions of the governments of the two Koreas. The writer examined the roles played by china, Japan and Russia, as their policies directly affect any long term political solution and ongoing humanitarian concerns on the Korean Peninsula. The writer equally discussed President Kim Dae-jung’s ‘sunshine policy’ in the late 1990s, a policy of engagement which revived hopes for Korean reunification. Those hopes suffered serious setbacks following North Korea’s nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009. Also, in 1998, there was a radical shift in South Korea’s policy towards North Korea with the election of Lee Myung-bak’s conservative administration which tied aid to denuclearization. The renewed talk of contingencies’ and succession struggle’ in North Korea in the wake of Kim Jong-il’s reported stroke in August 2008 has also been vitiating inter-Korean relations. Conflicting US and China policies on North Korea is another factor that has bedeviled reunification. To this effect, the writer argued that Korean reunification could best take place through sustained engagement and peaceful means. An important facet is the creation of the right environment for achieving the goal of reunification and denuclearization, a daunting task, particularly before the implementation of at least one of the international commitments made, such as the 2000 and 2007 South-North Summit Declarations of the 1994 Agreed Framework between the US and North Korea; or the lifting of international sanctions on North Korea, the writer concluded.</p> <p>Contributing, Wampler (2003) maintained that North Korea’s nuclear weapons program has moved back to the front pages with the unprecedented acknowledgement by North Korea that it has developed nuclear weapons. According to the writer, news of this revelation came as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs James A. Kelly was preparing to leave Beijing for consultations in Seoul. To the writer, this was but the latest step in a simmering crisis that began with the admission by North Korea, after being confronted with hard evidence by Assistant Secretary Kelly in October 2002, that it has been pursuing in secret a nuclear weapons program in violation of the Agreed Framework of 1994 and its adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Pyongyang’s subsequent actions in asserting the right to possess nuclear weapons, breaking the seals on its nuclear reactor put there by the International Atomic Energy Agency, withdrawing from the NPT and the expulsion of IAEA inspectors from the Yongbyon nuclear facilities, have kept the crisis simmering, and laid the basis for reported splits within the Bush administration over the best strategy for dealing with Pyongyang. Seemingly replaying debates marking the lead-up to the war with Iraq, newspaper analyses portray the State Department under Secretary of State Colin Powell pressing for diplomacy and efforts to reassure the North Koreans that the U.S. was not seeking regime change.</p> <p>Richter (2003) remarked that international law has long held that the use of force between states is illegal except on two grounds- authorization by the Security Council, and that done in self-defense. Furthermore, the writer evaluates the notion of preemptive self-defense as well as the customary laws that give rise to it, and whether such can be extended to address the threats of terrorism and WMDs. In so doing so, the writer addresses the general laws relating to self-defense and the limits of the doctrine of preemption. It argues that aside the threat posed by terrorism and WMDs, the extended version of preemption is the US is not only potentially dangerous, but will be rejected by the international community.</p> <p>Again, Henneka (2006) maintained that nothing in the political behavior of Korean policy could be understood without reflecting upon the experience of the Korean Peninsula and its people under the policy of the Great Powers. Moreso, the writer contended that one of the main reasons of the radicalisation of the US – and North Korean – policy is the underestimation of the meaning of Korean history before and after its division. To this end, the writer pointed out that a peaceful solution for the North Korean problem would probably not be found by waiting for regime collapse, regime change, or by forcing North Korea to one-sided reforms. Instead the international community and especially the United States must accept that this policy would only lead to a further escalation of the situation and increase the possibility of military confrontation. The historical perspective shows that one-sided accusations for the situation, no matter in which direction, do not reflect the historical facts. The problem cannot be solved without a wide understanding of Korean history in general. For the future, it is important for the administration in Washington to realise that dealing with the Korean Peninsula in a responsible way means to consider the region’s wider historical dimensions, the writer concludes.</p> <p>Moreso, Boureston and Russell (2009) maintained that the proliferation activities of Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, and North Korea illustrate the problem faced today by the international community: procurement networks are staying ahead of export controls by altering their tactics, learning new and more evasive techniques and finding ways to exploit legitimate trade practices to acquire sensitive materials. According to the writers,  while control regimes may have successfully slowed the first and second tier of proliferation networks, there is actually a third tier of networks – a ‘substructure’ that is comprised of a variety of semi-autonomous groups that can service the demand size of today’s nuclear black market. The challenge for intelligence agencies, and international and national regulatory bodies, in the view of the writers, is to continue to investigate questionable activities and to find new tools to interdict any transactions which may result. Looking for indicators such as frequent buying missions to industrial countries, suspicious contacts and organizations operating out of embassies, scientific exchanges and other doubtful alliances among allied nations, and nationals living overseas shipping materials to their home country, investigators can identify and analyze the existence of new and existing procurement networks. These and other more innovative measures are needed to help enable the international community to stifle nuclear procurement activities, thereby slowing the spread of nuclear weapons, the writers concluded.</p> <p><strong>Summary of the Review                                                                                                                </strong>In all, the review of the extant shows that our research questions have not been satisfactorily addressed. In the first segment, none of the writers whose works were reviewed specifically evaluated whether the US government perceives North Korea nuclear programme as a threat to its national security, between 2000 and 2008. In the second segment also, the works reviewed could not explicitly articulated whether the US government perceives North Korea nuclear programme as part of its war on terror, between 2000 and 2008. Finally, in the last segment, the authors reviewed failed to logically and coherently articulate the link between the US government security policy on North Korea nuclear programme and multilateral intervention on nuclear weapon development, between 2000 and 2008.</p> <p>We have to reiterate that our broad concern in this study is to find out whether the US government perceives North Korea nuclear programme both as a threat to its national security and as part of its war on terror, between 2000 and 2008, on the one hand and whether the US government security policy on North Korea nuclear programme relegates multilateral intervention on nuclear weapon development, between 2000 and 2008, on the other.</p> <p>Despite the fact that the extant literature is redolent of efforts by scholars to address the foregoing, we discovered that the issue as articulated above still needs attention because it has not been satisfactorily addressed within the existing literature. In other words, there is need to re-interrogate the issue raised above with a view to filling the lacuna noted in the literature.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Theoretical Framework</strong></p> <p>For an in-depth explanation and understanding of the link between the US government security policy and North Korea nuclear programme, we predicated our analysis on the realist approach. This approach tackles politics from what it is without moralizing as to what ought to be. It comes to term with current facts and is ready to shift positions to meet the prevailing political trends. Here what is obtained in society is addressed as against what ought to or should obtain. The political realist must negotiate with situations as they really are.</p> <p>Indeed, the world is full of opposing interest and moral principles can never be fully realized, rather they must be balanced with interests and the precarious settlement of conflicts. Hence all pluralist societies must work in a system of check and balances, appealing to historic precedent rather than to abstract principles, and aim at realizing the lesser evil rather than the absolute good (Whitaker and Mills, 1922).</p> <p>The realist or power politics approach in the study of international relations essentially is anchored on a particular conception of man. This view of man arose as a result of the attraction of the realists to thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes, Nicollo Machiavelli, whose works emphasized the dark side of human behavior. As Hobbes noted while painting the picture of man in the state of nature, “in the first place, I put for a general inclination of all mankind, a perpetual and restless desire of power after power that ceaseth only in death”. Thus, political realism centers on the belief that man is generally selfish and aggressive in nature. H.

It seeks to analyse the role of the United Nations security council in international conflict resolution, using tonal conflict resolution, using the UN Weapons inspection in Iraq as a case study. This research work sets itself to determining whether the Weapons Inpectors  did indict Iraq of  possessing WMD. The  central focus of the study is to determine whether the UN Security Council authorized the war or whether the war was a pre-emptive  action on the part of the U.S. and its allies. On the above premise, the theoretical framework of political Realism which holds that the overriding national interest of each State is its national Security and survival defined in terms of power. However, the study revealed that the U.S. invasion of Iraq was a clear-cut case of aggression and territorial annexation of another country and therefore a violation of State Sovereignty. The findings of this research are that the United Nations Security Council which is the only organ that can authorize war in modern International law did not authorize the war on Iraq. Consequently, in a bid to justify the war, the U.S and U.K anchored their action on UN Resolution 1441 which, however, never gave Member States an explicit permission to attack Iraq. The study also revealed that the U.S. led war on Iraq was pre-emptive. Most importantly, the work revealed that the war has a significant relationship with the U.S. foreign policy on the Gulf region. Based on these findings; the study concludes that for peaceful co-existence among Nations, all States should uphold the integrity and authority of the United Nations and of International Law.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE   </strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></li> </ul> <p>The United Nations Organization was formed in 1945; it was to be a universal single purpose organization that would promote world peace and security. In order to ensure prompt and effective action by the United Nations, its members confer on the Security Council the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and agree that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility the Security Council acts on their behalf.</p> <p>The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is the organ of the United Nations charged with maintaining international peace and security among nations. While other organs of UN only make recommendations to member governments, the Security Council has the power to make decisions which member governments must carry out under Article 25 of the United Nations Charter, which reads “the members of the United Nations agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council in accordance with the president charter. The decisions of the Council are known as UNSC Resolutions. The Council is made up of 15 Member States, consisting of five permanent seats and ten temporary seats. The five permanent seats are China, France, Russia, The United Kingdom and the United States. These big five hold veto power over substantive but not procedural resolutions. The ten temporary seats voted in by the UN General Assembly on a regional basis. The presidency of the Security Council is rotated alphabetically each month.</p> <p>The Security Council performs these functions on the basis of a universal phenomenon that has come to be known as collective security. This is a system in which aggression against a state is taken to be aggression against all that are parties to the treaty; consequently, a collective action is to be taken by other states to counter such an aggression. A good example was in 1991, when the United States led a coalition force of about 23 countries in a battle code- named “Operation Desert Storm” on Iraq for the formers invasion and annexation of Kuwait on August 2, 1990.</p> <p>Resolution 687, adopted in 3 April 1991 set out terms of cease fire which demanded respect of inviolability of Iraq- Kuwait border, as well as inspection and destruction of Iraq’s weapon which range greater than 150 kilometres, together with related items paragraph 9 of the Resolution provided for the creation of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) with the mandate to implement immediate on- site inspections of Iraq’s chemical, biological and missile Capabilities, on the basis both of Iraq’s own declarations and of the designation of the special Commission itself. Iraq was equally obliged to declare its nuclear material, equipment and sub-systems to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</p> <p>A major reason given by the Bush administration for waging war on Iraq was that she possessed Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) as well as had  links with al-Qaeda (Osama Bin laden and Saddam Hussein). This led to the adumbration of a doctrine of “pre-emption” by the Bush administration; in Blair’s words, “it is a matter of time unless we act and take a stand before terrorism and weapons of mass destruction come together, and I regard them as two sides of the same coin”.</p> <ul><li><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></li> </ul> <p>In the period before the war, when it became apparent that a specific UN Security Council authorization was unlikely, States and international lawyers criticized the proposed US-led military action in Iraq as unlawful since this action was not a case of self- defence. To the extent that the invasion was based on a claim of anticipatory self- defence, Article 51 has been stretched beyond endurance. Secondly, to the extent that the invasion was based on claims of threats to international peace and security sufficient under Chapter vii to justify Security Council authorization, but with those claims poorly argued and the council eventually by passed, the credibility of the whole Charter system has again been frontally challenged. And thirdly, to the extent that the invasion was based on Saddam Hussein’s record of tyranny over his people- but again, poorly and inconsistently argued, and with the council by passed – we have almost choked at birth what many were hoping was an emerging new norm justifying intervention on the basis of the principle of “responsibility to protect”.</p> <p>Finally, this work would analyse the war on Iraq and its implications for international law. The law is clear, no amount of weapons a state has whether chemical, biological, and nuclear, laser and blinding weapons can be conceived as an attack by the possessor state against another state. Such possession may however be styled by the UN as constituting a threat to peace. A threat to National Security is not a recognized basis for use of force. President Bush, in giving the President of Iraq Saddam Hussein, a 48 hours ultimatum to leave Baghdad said: “the United State of America has the Sovereign authority to use force in assuring its own national security”. It becomes the task of this thesis to ascertain whether every state can launch a pre-emptive war against any state, she regards as a threat to her national security, which implies that international law no longer exists for nations to obey or that international law only entitled the right of pre-emptive war on the United State of America.  Nevertheless, the study will be guided by the following research questions.</p> <ul><li>Did the UN Security Council Support for the invasion of Iraq help eliminate the production of Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq?</li> <li>Did the UN Security Council Sanctions on Iraq help minimize the Iraqis quest</li> </ul> <p>For Weapons of Mass Destruction?</p> <ul><li>Did the IAEA of the UN fail to discover Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq? <ul><li><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>The broad objective of this study is to critically examine the UNSC and International Conflict Resolution. Whereas the specific objectives of the study are:</p> <ul><li>To determine whether the UN Security Council Support for the invasion of Iraq helped eliminate the production of Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq.</li> <li>To determine whether the UN Security Council Sanctions on Iraq helped minimize the Iraqis quest for Weapon of Mass Destruction.</li> <li>To determine whether the IAEA of the UN discover Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq. <ul><li><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>This study has both theoretical and practical significance. Theoretically, this research seeks to contribute and bring fresh insight to the understanding of the UN Security Council Weapon Inspection in Iraq. As a result it will reveal how America, invaded Iraq. Therefore, the significance of this thesis is predicated on the fact that it would re-echo, the need for nations to support the concept of collective security, a process in which all members of the international community join strengths to deter or punish those who resort to violence and aggression and discourage unilateral action on the part of powerful nations in pursuance of its national interest. The study will add to existing literature in this area and serve as a reference material for students and scholars with interest Weapon Inspection in Iraq. We hope that the study will stimulate further investigation in this area as little or no research has be done regarding Weapon Inspection in Iraq.</p> <p>At the Practical level, the findings of this study willhighlight the role the United Nations Security Council played in trying to discourage and prevent the United States from attacking Iraq. This work will help to reaffirm and increase the moral status of the UNSC among States especially third world States (the weaker and vulnerable members of the international system who depend upon these institutions to protect their sovereign status). This work hopes to make a modest contribution by way of addition to the extant literature on the US-led war on Iraq and its implication for international law by showing that, both the UN Charter and international law made adequate provisions for peaceful settlement of disputes among States.</p> <p>This work is equally important as it will act as a light and a guide on the paths of powerful States not to use their privileged positions in the UN to telescope and interfere with any UNSC weapons inspection activities in the future. Finally and most importantly, this work will show that, the United States and the United Kingdom stand accused of having waged an aggressive war against Iraq, exactly the same crime of which Iraq was accused in 1990 following the invasion and occupation of Kuwait. International law protects the sovereignty of disagreeable regimes, just as it did not matter in 1990 whether Kuwait was well governed, so it was irrelevant to this indictment that the governing regime in Iraq in 2003 was deeply unpleasant. Also, the findings of this study will help policy makers in Africa and Nigeria in particular to weigh options critically before acting especially, in international politics where betrayal has become almost a norm of statecraft.</p> <ul><li><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></li> </ul> <p>The literature review focuses on the diverse scholarly perspectives on the vexed issue of the invasion of Iraq considered fundamental in understanding and answering the questions posed in this paper. This includes the theoretical arguments with regards to the legality and justification of the invasion, the history and dynamics of UNSC’s role in the invasion of Iraq.</p> <p><strong>DID THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL SUPPORT FOR THE INVASION OF IRAQ HELPS ELIMINATE THE PRODUCTION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION IN IRAQ?</strong></p> <p>In the decade before the latest Iraq war, were numerous crises giving rise to demands for military action and particularly for intervention in States without the consent of those states government. Force has been used in a wide variety of circumstances and with a wide variety of legal justifications and authorizing bodies. Some of these actions have challenged certain aspects of the existing body of international law relating to the resort of force, in particular, they have been seen as either violating, moving beyond or reinterpreting the two principal accepted legal grounds for the use of force or self- defence as recognized in Article 51 of the UN Charter and authorization by the UN Security Council.</p> <p>According to Anjali  (2002),  the power of Security Council in dealing with disputes and situations that may disrupt international peace and security are the logical consequences of the “primary responsibility” conferred under Article 24, the specific powers given to the Council under Chapter VI and VII of the  Charter can be conveniently grouped under two headings; those powers that the organ may excise to maintain or restore international peace and security once peace has been threatened or breached (1946-1990).</p> <p>According to Amechi (2003), it should be noted that the maintenance of international peace and security is a primary function not of the state but of the U.N as an international institution with a judicial personality, it is therefore unacceptable for a member of the UN to develop a foreign policy incompatible with this provision. He cited Article 33 which provides that:</p> <p>Parties to dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall first of all seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort. To regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice (Amechi, 2003:81).</p> <p>Amechi  (2003) further observes that Article 2(3) and 33 impose a duty on all to settle difference by peaceful means for either to do otherwise is a breach of the charter and therefore a breach of international law.</p> <p>According to him…The United States did not exhaust the remedies provided in Article 33, Article 2(4) requires All members not only to use force against other states, but also not to threaten any other state with use of force: both the threat of force and the use of force are in conflict with Article 2(4) of the charter.</p> <p>The United States and its allies not only threaten Iraq with use of force if it did not allow the UN inspectors “free access” as understand by the US, it would be attacked not by the UN but by the US and its allies.</p> <p>Similarly, Adam (2003) has expressed that; the greatest problems regarding the legitimacy of uses of force arise when they are neither authorized by the Security Council nor a straight forward case of self- defence in response to an armed attack. To put it appropriately in his words:</p> <p>It would be easy to say that, apart from the cases of self-defence, force should never be used except when explicitly authorized by the Security Council.</p> <p>Supporting this position was the views contained in a letter from sixteen international law teachers, according to them , when it became apparent that a specific UN Security Council authorization was unlikely, states and international lawyers criticized the proposed US-led military action in Iraq as unlawful since this action was not a case of self-defence against an actual armed attack by Iraq, and did not have explicit authorization of UN Security Council, could easily be viewed as having at best a doubtful basis in international law.(Keir, 2003:51).</p> <p>Some writers in the field of international relations believe that the inability of UN Security Council to handle the Iraq crisis has rendered the organization irrelevant. One of such scholar is Michael (1989) According to him:</p> <p>The failure of the UN Security Council to agree on any coherent line on Iraq before the outbreak of war on 19-20 march 2003 confirmed in spectacular fashion, certain limitations of the council…with the rapture of the UN Security Council, it became clear that the grand attempt to subject the use of force to the rule of law had failed (Michael, 2003: 120).</p> <p>Mat (2003) partially supported this stance when he stated that, the failure to overcome council division followed by the US-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003 without explicit council authorization for the use force, added further to the sense of foreboding among those anxious for the council to play its charter-prescribed role in the field of peace and security.</p> <p>Herbert (2003) reasoned differently when he asserted that, the UN perfectly embodies in institutional form the strategic paradox of our age; it has become indispensable before it has become effective. As Adam Roberts puts it. The Security Council, while having no monopoly on international security issues, did not become entirely irrelevant to the Iraq crisis, in which its existing resolutions were of crucial important; and international law, while in a state of contestation has developed significantly in response to events since the end of the cold war and continues to provide useful criteria for consideration of particular uses of force. Adam (2003) maintained further that:</p> <p>The council is quite simply, the only forum of its kind; that is , a forum able to address, if not resolve security challenges of international concern and crucially to confer near-universal legitimacy on the actions of states or groups in a way that no alternative candidate or agency, real or proposed has been able to do (Adam, 2003: 45)<em>.</em></p> <p>According to Martin (1999)  As the council’s recent handling of Iraq weapons inspection Crisis made abundantly clear, power politics within and outside the organization is alive and well, and the entirely predictable persistence of conflicts of interest and value among members states means that the council is at one level, inescapably doomed to “ineffectiveness’, this is true above all, when the core or vital interests of states are seen to be at stake and when, as in the case of Iraq, issues of coercion are involved (Martin, 1999: 78).</p> <p>An underlying issue informing the present article is whether the UN Security Council has become irrelevant in its handling of the weapons inspection crisis in Iraq considering the fact that majority of countries and people of the world were opposed to the US-British disregard of international law and bypassing of the UN Security Council. According to Mats (2003),</p> <p>The intense diplomatic effort by Britain and the United States to secure an explicit authorization for the use of force, however unsuccessful and flawed the diplomacy, is itself testimony to the importance attached to the council’s legitimizing role. Not only that, but both the US and the UK, in justifying the resort to force and explaining the need for military action have continued to rely heavily on UN Security Council Resolutions, a fact that only reinforces the sense that neither country felt they could dispense with some kind of UN sanction for its chosen curse of action (Mats, 2003: 55).</p> <p>Supporting this view was the speeches and statements made by delegates to the XIII summit meeting of the Non-Aligned movement in Kuala Lumpur. According to them, “This esteem in which the Council continues to be held derives in large part from its custodial role as protector of principles and rules seen by the vast majority of member States as foundational to international order-above all, the principle of sovereign equality of states and its corollary, the rule of non-intervention by states in the affairs of other states. (Ari, 2003: 23).</p> <p>To the extent that military action in Iraq has been viewed in many parts of the world as a challenge to these principles, one may expect to see a renewed commitment to the UN by the membership at large. This, in turn, is unlikely to diminish the need for major powers to work through the UN to secure legitimacy for its actions.”</p> <p>According to Toby and Steven (2002),</p> <p>…the US has repeatedly been drawn back to the UN, finding that the legitimacy it    confers on its actions, if not indispensable to taking action, is extremely costly to ignore…The very decision by Bush to confront the issue of Iraq’s non-compliance through the UN is testimony to this fact(Toby and Steven, 2002: 451).</p> <p>As Steven (2002) puts it, “the US-led war has come to be regarded-right or wrong as an unwarranted, illegal and unjustified assault on sovereignty of an independent nation. To the majority of the UN’s Member States, the perception of operational Iraqi freedom as a test case of the Bush doctrine on pre-emption…has only reinforced the importance of the UN’s custodial role as protector of key character principles.</p> <p>According, a nationwide poll (2003) conducted after the start of hostilities on the United Nations showed that the importance of the UN had not been diminished as a result of its failure to approve action over Iraq. Confirming this stance was Colin Powell’s assertion that a “UN role might help lend legitimacy to a post-war Iraq occupation and reduce hostility toward the US and its allies in the region and around the world. While Gareth (2002) holds that: “Threats to international peace are what the Security Council says they are” Fighting against.</p> <p>Weapons of mass destruction were a major pretext by the Bush administration for waging war on Iraq. According to Paul (2002), The issue of weapons of mass destruction was the point of greatest agreement among Bush’s team among the reasons to remove Saddam from power, the truth is that for reasons that have a lot to do with the US government bureaucracy, we settled on the issue that everyone could agree on, which was weapons of mass destruction as the core reason.</p> <p>Mike (2002) asserted that, as early as January 2002, President Bush had declared that; states like Iraq and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world by seeking weapons of mass destruction; these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States.</p> <p>In his State of the Union address, President Bush linked the case for war against Iraq to the September 11 attacks, implying that Saddam Hussein would replicate them once he got unclear weapons. In his words: “Saddam is a threat and we are not going to wait until he does attack, he declared, his weapons of mass destruction are a direct threat to this country, if the world fails to confront the threat posed by the Iraqi regime…., from nations would assume immense and unacceptable risks, the attack of September 11, 2001, showed what the enemies of America did with four airplanes. We will not wait to see what terrorist states could do with weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>In the same speech, he stated emphatically that:</p> <p>Saddam Hussein is a threat to our nation, September, 11 changed   the… strategic thinking, at least as far as I was concerned, for how to protect the country… used to be that we could think that you could contain a person like Saddam Hussein, that oceans would  protect us from his type of terror. September 11 should say to the American people that we’re now a battle field, that weapons of mass Destruction in the hands of a terrorist organization could be deployed here at home (Bush, 2002: 18).</p> <p>According to the Washington post (2002), when asked about the possible human and financial costs of a war with Iraq, the President answered, the price of doing nothing exceeds the price of taking action…The price of the September 11 attack was enormous …And I’m not willing to take chance again.</p> <p>The failure to date of the Pentagon to turn-up evidence that any weapons of mass destruction existed in Iraq poses obvious problems for the US. According to Patrick (2003)  “ The unprovoked war was manifestly illegal, waged without the sanction of the UN and without any prior attack from Iraq” The absences of chemical and biological weapons have only confirmed what millions around the world have concluded, the justification for the war was nothing but a pack of lies. According to the New York Time, Documents were forged by the Bush Administration purporting that Iraq was trying to import Uranium from Niger with the intention of creating false impression that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction and is close to manufacturing nuclear bombs.</p> <p>This false allegation according to the paper was refuted by Retired Ambassador Joseph Wilson who was asked to travel to Niger to see if this was true and he reported that it was not. Furthermore, the U.N Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) 18th Quarterly Report refuted the allegation by the Bush administration that Iraq possesses several Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) programmes that were intended to deliver chemical and biological weapons, and concluded that there was no evidence that Iraq developed drones. Remotely Piloted Vehicles (R.P.V.s) and (U.A.V.s) of prohibited ranges or capable of delivering chemical or biological weapons. According to the report;</p> <p>These systems were more likely intended for conventional military                          Purposes such as air defence training, data collection and Surveillance (Joseph, 2002: 4).</p> <p>According to Patrick (2004), “compounding the failure of the US to find any weapons stockpile are declarations by leading Iraq Weapons scientist that were in U.S custody, that Iraq’s previous chemical, biological and nuclear Weapons programs were dismantled after 1991 Persian Gulf War, during the regime of UNSCOM inspection” Again, the (Los Angeles Times of April 14, 2004), in its editorial gave a comprehensive on LT. Gen. Amir Saadi- Saddam Hussein top Science Adviser who turned himself over to U.S. forces in Baghdad on April 12. According to the report;</p> <p>Lt. Gen. Amir Saadi told 2DF- a German television network which filmed  The event, that Iraq no longer possessed any weapons of mass destruction,  Declaring, I was telling the truth, always telling the truth, never told any Thing but the truth, and time will bear me out; you will see (Patrick, 2003: 24).</p> <p>Hans (2003), a former Chief UN Weapons inspector denounced the US led invasion of Iraq. In his words:</p> <p>The administration of US President George W. Bush must have other Reasons to invade Iraq besides the officially pronounced purposed to Find and destroy weapons of mass destruction, this is because the UN Weapons inspectors I led for several years and constantly monitored Failed to find any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (Hans, 2003: 14).</p> <p>According, to Bill (2003), the UN resolutions imposing sanctions included no reference to Iraq’s liberation; rather, they demanded that Iraqi biological, chemical and Nuclear weapons are “removed, destroyed or rendered harmless under the supervision of United Nations inspectors. Expatiating on this , Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanou declared “the decision cannot be automatic, it demands that conditions laid out in corresponding UN Security Council resolution be fulfilled…we need to be certain whether Iraq has weapons of mass destruction or not. “To put it appropriately in his words:</p> <p>…In the course of the month-long war, no banned weapons were used   By Iraqi forces. News reporters- both those ‘embedded’ with US Military units and those merely in bed with the Pentagon- have Repeatedly issued breathless accounts of chemical or biological Weapons “finds” in Iraq. These reports have invariably been Disproved, with chemical weapons turning out to be pesticides or</p> <p>Some other harmless material (Bill, 2003: 25).</p> <p>On why the Iraqi government was initially unwilling to re-admit the inspectors back to Iraq, Scott (2002), a former Chief UN Weapons inspector maintained that; “President Bush had reportedly authorized the CIA to use all the means at its disposal- including U.S Military Special Operations Forces and CIA Para-military teams to eliminate Iraq’s Saddam Hussein”. According to the report, CIA is to view any such plan as “preparation” for a larger military strike. He stated further that, as early as 1992, the Iraqi’s viewed the teams he led inside Iraq as threat to the safety of their President. In his words:</p> <p>…The Iraq’s were concerned that my inspections were nothing</p> <p>More than a front for larger efforts to eliminate their leader (Scott, 2002: 25).</p> <p>Martin (1999) added impetus to this stance when he posited that, Iraqi officials bitterly protested the activities of UNSCOM, declaring that its personnel were intelligence agents working for the United States, Britain, Israel and that its activities were aimed not at weapons monitoring, but at overthrowing the government of Iraq. According to him,</p> <p>…these charges have now been confirmed not only in American press, but in the statements of Clinton administration officials, who have conceded that U.S intelligence agents worked undercover at UNSCOM and that data collected by UNSCOM was passed on to the intelligence services. The United States, Britain and Israel (Martin, 2002: 102).</p> <p>This revelations according Martin (2002) has demonstrated that the Iraqi government was resisting not demands for weapons inspections, but demands that it expose the innermost working of its military and intelligence commands to agents of its bitterest enemies, to which no sovereign state could agree.</p> <p>Consequently, Ron (2002) challenged the Bush administration to substantiate any of its claims that Iraq continues to pursue efforts to re-acquire its capacity to produce chemical and biological weapons, which was dismantled and destroyed by UN Weapons inspectors from 1991 to 1998. He concludes that, if the case for war is to be made, it should be based on proven facts rather than speculative rhetoric.</p> <p>John (2002) observes that the Iraqi weapons Chief- Hussein Kamel who defected from the regime in 1995 had told UN inspectors that Iraq had destroyed its entire stockpile of chemical and biological weapons and banned missiles as Iraq claimed. According to him, these statements were ‘hushed’ up by the UN inspectors in order to “bluff Saddam into disclosing still more”. (John, 2002: 3).</p> <p>According to Fairness and Accuracy (2003) in Reporting (FAIR), a complete copy of the Kamel transcripts was obtained by Glen Rangwala, the Cambridge University analyst who had earlier revealed that Tony Blair’s intelligence dossier was plagiarized from a student thesis.</p> <p>Admittedly, the allegation of WMD was false, but the truth still remains that President George W. Bush of US carefully and craftily created a strategic framework aimed at giving a wrong impression among his people that Saddam Hussein possess WMD in order to wage a war against Iraq. In the words of Dana and Walter (2003)</p> <p>Despite the effort to focus on Saddam’s desires and intentions, the bottom line is That Iraq did not have either weapons stockpiles or active production Capabilities at the time of the war (Dana, 2003: 125).</p> <p><strong>INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE UNITED STATES NEW POLICY OF PRE-EMPTIVE ATTACK ON IRAQ</strong></p> <p>On March 20, 2003 the United States, aided by Great Britain and Australia, initiated a military invasion of Iraq. Both the US and UK contended that they had sufficient legal authority to use force against Iraq pursuant to Security Council Resolutions adopted in 1990 and 1991. President Bush also contended that given the nature and type of threat posed by Iraq” the US had a legal right to use force” in the exercise of its inherent right of self- defence recognized in Article 51 of the UN Charter. Given that the US had not previously been attacked by Iraq, that contention raised questions about the permissible scope of the pre-emptive use of force under international law. This section examines the issue as it has developed in customary international law and under the UN Charter.</p> <p>Hyde (2003) posited that until recent decades international law deemed the right to use force and even go to war to be an essential attribute of every state as he summarized:</p> <p>…it always lies within the power of a state to Endeavour to obtain redress for wrongs, or to gain Political or other advantages over another, not merely By the employment of force, but also by direct recourse To war (Hyde, 2003: 53).</p> <p>He maintained that within that framework customary international law also consistently recognized self-defence as a legitimate basis for the use of force:</p> <p>An act of self-defence is that form of self-protection which is directed against an aggressor or contemplated aggressor. No act can be so described which is not occasioned by attack or fear  of attack. When acts of self-preservation on the part of a state are  strictly acts of self-defence, they are permitted by the law of  nations, and are justified on principle, even though they may  conflict with the…right of other states (Hyde, 2003: 96).</p> <p>Again, the recognized right of a state to use force for purposes of self-defence traditionally included the pre-emptive use of force, i.e. the use of force in anticipation of an attack. Hugo Grotius, the father of international law, stated in the seventeenth century that; it be lawful to kill him who is preparing to kill.</p> <p>Emmerich (2002) a century later similarly asserted:</p> <p>The safest plan is to prevent evil, where it is possible. A Nation has the right to resist the injury another seeks to inflict upon it, and to use force…against the aggressor. It may even anticipate the other’s design, being careful however, not to act upon vague and doubtful suspicious, lest it should run the risk of becoming itself the aggressor (Emmerich, 2002: 24).</p> <p>The classical formulation of the right of pre-emptive attack was given by Secretary of State Daniel (2003) in connection with the famous Caroline incident. In 1837 British troops under the cover of night attack had sank an American ship, the Caroline in US waters because the ship was being used to provide suppliers to insurrectionists against British rule in Canada headquartered on an island on the Canadian side of the Niagara River. The US immediately protested this “extraordinary outrage” and demanded an apology and reparations. In the curse of the diplomatic exchange Secretary of States Daniel Webster articulate two conditions essential to the legitimacy of the pre-emptive use of force under customary international law. According to him,</p> <p>“An intrusion into territory of another state can be justified as an act of Self-defence only in those “cases in which the necessity of that self- defence is instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation (Daniel, 2003: 22).</p> <p>In another note, he asserted that the force used in such circumstances has to be proportional to the threat;</p> <p>It will be for her majesty’s government to show, also that the local authorities of Canada, even supposing the necessity of the moment authorized them to enter the territories of the United States at all, did nothing unreasonable or excessive; since the act, justified by the necessity of self-defence, must be limited by that necessity, and kept clearly within it (Daniel, 2003: 30).</p> <p>According to 1996 ICJ Reports, both elements- necessity and proportionality have been deemed essential to legitimate the pre-emptive use of force in customary international law.</p> <p><strong>EFFECT OF THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER</strong></p> <p>According to David (2005), with the founding of United Nations, the right of individual states to use force was purportedly curbed. The UN Charter, States in its preamble that the UN was established to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and its substantive provisions obligates Member States of the UN to settle their international disputes by peaceful means; (Article 2(3) and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, (Article 2 (4). In place of the traditional right of States to use force, the Charter creates a system of Collective Security in which the Security council is authorized to determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and to decide what measures shall be taken…to maintained international peace and security Article 39 (2003).</p> <p>Gareth (2001) asserted that while the Security Council’s power to approve force in acting to maintain or restore international peace and Security was left effectively open-ended, the traditional right of self-defence was spelt out in Article 51 in terms that are very far from open-ended and linked back to the council:</p> <p>Nothing in the present charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security (Gareth, 2001: 51).</p> <p>A contemporary example was when on June 7, 1981; Israel bombed and destroyed a nuclear reactor under construction at Osirik, Iraq. According to Carter and Trimble (1999), “the Security Council unanimously “condemned the military attack by Israel is clear violation of the Charter of the UN and the norms of international conduct and urged the payment of “appropriate redress”.</p> <p>Thus, in both theory and practice the pre-emptive use of force appears to have a home in current international law. Its clearest legal foundation according to David M. Ackerman is in Chapter VII of the UN Charter.</p> <p>In the words of Kofi Annan,</p> <p>If states reserve the right to act unilaterally, or in adhoc coalition without waiting for agreement in the Security Council-this logic represents a fundamental challenge to the principles on which, however imperfectly, world peace and stability have rested for the last fifty-eight years (Carter, 2004: 25).</p> <p>As Gareth (2001) puts it. “The problem is not with the principle of military action against non-imminent threats as such, it is perfectly possible to imagine real threats which are not imminent. The problem boils down to whether or not there is credible evidence of the reality of the threat in question, taking into account, as always, the capability and specific intent, whether the military attack response was the only reasonable one in all the circumstances; and crucially who makes the decision, in his words:</p> <p>The question is not whether preventive military action can ever be taken: it is entirely within the scope of the Security Council’s power under Chapter VII to authorize force if it is satisfied a case has been made. The question is whether military threat can even be taken unilaterally (Gareth, 2001: 55).</p> <p>Thus as Wu Miaofa (2000) has rightly observed;</p> <p>Politically, the implications of the doctrines of pre-emption and unilateralism are fundamentally destructive to the purpose and principles of the UN Charter and the basic rules of the international system as an immediate result, the UN Charter is in danger of deviating from its multilateral nature toward a unilateralist one, which is bound to sap its capacity for coping with various challenges to world peace and non-traditional security threats such as terrorism and proliferation of weapons mass destruction (Wu Miaofa, 2000: 16).</p> <p>Thus the express terms of Article 51 refers to the right of self-defence if any armed attack occurs and which has been interpreted by the international court of justice on several occasion. For instance, in the Nicaragua case, the court held that the right of individual or collective self-defence is triggered only by acts grave enough to amount to an armed attack. According to the court an armed attack triggering unilateral self-defence, may include “the sending by or on behalf of a State of armed bands, groups, irregulars or mercenaries, which carry out acts of armed farce against another state of such gravity as to amount to…an actual armed attack conducted by regular forces…</p> <p>Finally, in the Nicaragua case (Nicaragua V. US) 1986 ICJ 14 (June 27) where the court was assessing the US claim that its use of force against Nicaragua was a lawful act of collective self-defence of EI-Salvador, the court held that Nicaragua was not shown to be responsible for providing weapons and supplies to EI-Salvador rebels and that even if it had done so, the supply of weapons was not the same as an armed attack and that, EI-Salvador had not reported to the Security Council, nor had it invited the US to assist in its self-defence.</p> <p>This confirms the assertion made by Gareth Evans earlier on that, the question is not whether preventive military action can even be taken; that it is entirely within the scope of the Security Council’s Power under chapter VII authorize force if it is satisfied a case has been made. Therefore according to Mary (2013), it is consistent with the authoritative interpretation of Article 51 by the international court of justice (ICJ), the general consensus about when an armed attack begins for purposes of the right of self-defence is that an attack must be under way or must have already occurred in order to trigger the right of unilateral self-defence. Any earlier response requires the approval of the Security Council, there is no self-appointed right to attack another State because of fear that State is making plans or developing weapons unusable in a hypothetical campaign.</p> <p><strong>THE USE OF FORCE ON IRAQ AND UN SECURITY COUNCIL</strong></p> <p><strong> RESOLUTION </strong></p> <p>According to Keir (2003), “UN Resolution 678 which was passed in 29 November 1990 towards the commencement of the Gulf War was the only UN Resolution that explicitly authorized the use of force against Iraq and the only action it authorization was such force as was necessary to restore Kuwait sovereignty.” Liberation of Kuwait and restoration of peace and security in that region was thus the objective.</p> <p>In his words, “this was the only Security Council Resolution expressly authorizing the use of force (2003).</p> <p>Ogaba (2003) supported this view when he stated that;</p> <p>‘The most unambiguous exposition of unilateralism under the                                        Clinton administration with direct reference to the Iraq war was operation desert fox. The reason for this description Emanates from the fact that UN Resolution 678 of 1990 Authorized the use of force with which Iraq was evicted From Kuwait, following which the authority to use force Could only come from the UN Security Council which never ranted it (Ogaba, 2003: 78).</p>\n\nTHE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL AND INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT RESOLUTION A CASE STUDY OF THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL WEAPON INSPECTION IN IRAQ<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL AND INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT RESOLUTION A CASE STUDY OF THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL WEAPON INSPECTION IN IRAQ", "id": 39}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE STRUGGLE FOR A PERMANENT SEAT AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL: A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF</strong></p> <p><strong> THE CONTESTANTS IN 2012</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This work set out to investigate the struggle for Permanent Seats At The Security Council: A Critical Assessment of the Contestants in 2012. While observing that there exists a fundamental need to reform and enlarge both the membership and voting pattern in the Security Council in order to reflect geopolitical realities of the 21st Century by making both the organisation and the Security Council in particular to appear democratic while at the same time enhancing its efficiency and legitimacy around the world. It is noted that while all member states of the organisation accept this need and exigency, they however, differed on the modalities, nature and extent of the reform. Moreover, each of the major contestants though enjoys the support of one or the other of the members of the P5, but they at the same time faces opposition from major powers in their respective regions; thereby making the struggle a serious and arduous task.  We however, in this study vehemently believe that the structure and composition of the United Nations Security Council must definitely be reformed and reorganized to reflect the wide and varied membership of the organisation. The theory of national interest was used as our framework for analysing the quest and struggles for permanent seat in the Security Council. Data for the study was gathered through observation of the secondary sources like books, journals, Internet, official documents et cetera. Our method of data analysis which involved giving a qualitative description to quantitative information brings simplicity and coherence to our work. Our recommendations were also anchored on the findings of our research work which was clearly articulated in our conclusion.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The membership and structure of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) have been among the most controversial and intractable issues considered by UN member-states since the establishment of the organization in the mid-1940s (Article 23 of the United Nations Charters). Tillema (1989) opined that the importance of the UNSC, particularly the council’s permanent seats, stems largely from the status and prestige associated with its decision-making authority on questions of global peace and security. In fact, permanent membership is equated with “great power” status in the international political system.</p> <p>As a consequence, it is perhaps not surprising that a number of emerging global and regional powers throughout the world – including Japan, Germany, India, Brazil, Indonesia, Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt have sought permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council during the past few decades. However, Malik notes that, despite a tremendous amount of discussion and debate, there has been little consensus on the matter of United Nations Security Council restructuring, including to what extent the council ought to be enlarged, how many new permanent and non-permanent members ought to be added, whether the new members ought to be extended the veto privilege and which specific countries ought to be added as permanent members (Malik, 2005: 19).</p> <p>Although much has been written about United Nations Security Council restructuring during the past decade from an institutional perspective, (Russett et al., 1996; Daws, 1997; Schlichtmann, 1999; Afoaku and Ukaga, 2001; Berween, 2002; Weiss, 2003; Thakur, 2004; Blum, 2005; Malik, 2005; Price, 2005; Soussan, 2005), there has been relatively little focus on the politics of seeking a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council from the perspective of an existing or emerging global or regional power.</p> <p>Although the United Nations Security Council has been restructured only once in more than sixty years, there have been several attempts over the years to achieve this goal. As a result of several new UN member-states due to decolonization in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Spain and several Latin American countries proposed amendments to the UN Charter in 1956 to increase the number of non-permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council from six to eight (Bourantonis, 2005). He also notes that after several years of debate and disagreement, including the Soviet Union’s insistence on linking the issue of United Nations Security Council restructuring to the issue of mainland China’s membership in the UN, there was a “breakthrough” on the issue in the early 1960s. In December 1963, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) formally approved amendments increasing non-permanent seats from six to ten, and the amendments were ratified by the required number of member-states in 1965 (Afoaku and Ukaga, 2001; Weiss, 2003; Blum, 2005).</p> <p>As a result of continued decolonization, overall membership in the UN continued to grow significantly from the mid-1960s to the late-1970s. At the same time, developing countries were increasingly dissatisfied with the abuse of the veto power by the permanent members and the lack of “equitable representation” for Asian and African countries on the various councils of the UN. Bourantonis (2005) noted that consequent upon this scenario, India and several developing countries proposed amendments to the UN Charter in 1979 to increase the number of non-permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) from 11 to 14. “In 1980, several African, Asian, and Latin American countries proposed increasing the number of non-permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council from 10 to 16” (Blum, 2005: 637). But as noted by Archibugi (1993) unlike the previous effort to restructure the United Nations Security Council in the early 1960s, these subsequent efforts were unsuccessful largely because of heightened tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union during this period.</p> <p>With the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s, there was renewed interest in restructuring the United Nations Security Council to reflect the changes in the international political system (Russett, et al., 1996; Drifte, 2000; Miyashita, 2002). In December 1992, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) approved a resolution sponsored by India calling upon the United Nations Secretary-General to invite member-states to submit proposals for United Nations Security Council reform, resulting in proposals from some 80 countries (Drifte, 2000). A year later, the United Nations General Assembly established an “Open-Ended Working Group” to consider the proposals for United Nations Security Council reform (Daws, 1997; Price, 2005; Schlichtmann, 1999; Bourantonis, 2005). Several options for United Nations Security Council restructuring were among the proposals submitted to the working group, including a proposal by the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) calling for an increase in permanent seats from five to nine and non-permanent seats from ten to seventeen (Berween, 2002).</p> <p>In 1995, the United Nations General Assembly approved the Declaration on the 50th Anniversary of the United Nations, which stated the United Nations Security Council should be “expanded and its working methods continue to be reviewed in a way that will further strengthen its capacity and effectiveness, enhance its representative character, and improve its working efficiency and transparency” (Schlichtmann, 1999:510). Two years later, UN Ambassador Ismael Razali of Malaysia proposed adding five permanent seats (without veto power) and four non-permanent seats to the United Nations Security Council.</p> <p>The Razali Plan, which permitted the United Nations General Assembly to choose the countries to be given permanent seats, was ultimately blocked by members of the NAM, as well as countries such as Italy, Egypt, Mexico, and Pakistan (Bourantonis, 2005).</p> <p>After a decade of intense debate on UN reform, the then Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan established a 16-member high-level panel in 2003 to evaluate and recommend specific options. In 2004, the panel proposed two different options for United Nations Security Council restructuring: (1) six new permanent seats without veto power and three additional non-permanent seats; and (2) eight four-year renewable seats and one additional non-permanent seat (Blum, 2005; Price, 2005). After debating these and other options for United Nations Security Council reform during much of 2005, the United Nations General Assembly was unable to come to a consensus on how to restructure the council. Such that Brazil’s UN Ambassador Ronaldo Mota Sardenberg expressed frustration with the outcome of the debate by stating that a “few countries, seeking to avoid any decision on this matter, take refuge on claims for consensus and on allegations on the disruptive nature of the issue” and that the actions of these countries “only contribute to the perpetuation of current inequalities in the structure of the organization, and to the frustration of the aspirations of all members, for a more balanced distribution of power in the work of the Security Council.”</p> <p>On this background therefore, this study seeks to investigate the prospect of the contestant for the United Nations Security Council’s permanent seat; with focus on Nigeria and other contestants such as Japan, Germany, India, Brazil, Egypt and South Africa etc.</p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>There has been general agreement over time that the Security Council is an unrepresentative relic and that its composition is a throwback to the immediate Post-World War II global order. Several recommendations for expanding the Council have been proposed since the end of the Cold War. For instance, the Commission on Global Governance recommended establishing a new class of five…</p> <p>standing members, the intent of which would be to reduce the status of permanent membership; increasing the number of “non-permanent” members from ten to thirteen; and eliminating the veto, except for very exceptional and overriding circumstances related to the national interests of the major powers (Knight, 2005:106).</p> <p>According to the theory of cognitive dissonance, our minds find it taxing to hold two mutually inconsistent beliefs for a protracted period (Evanston and Row, 1957). The mind seeks to reconcile them over time, if necessary by substantially modifying one of them or by denying its validity altogether in order to relieve the dissonance. Politics, of course, holds innumerable examples of the phenomenon.</p> <p>At the United Nations, there may be no starker case than that of the protracted and polarizing matter of Security Council reform. On one hand, judging by public statements, it is generally accepted that the Security Council is long overdue for a major overhaul. The calls for its radical reform have come with such frequency and from so many quarters, as to qualify as common wisdom.</p> <p>In this connection Japan and Germany, the second- and third-biggest contributors to the UN budget, have been campaigning for permanent seat status on the Council. India, the world’s second most populous country, and Brazil, Latin America’s biggest country, also have designs on achieving permanent status on the Council. These four states have banded together to press their case before the UN membership, and they are joined in spirit by the Africans, who want two seats for their continent (perhaps Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa).</p> <p>None of these proposals for UN Security Council expansion is likely to go far. However, China mistrusts Japan. Italy opposes a permanent seat for Germany and has instead proposed a single permanent seat for the European Union. This latter recommendation is opposed by Britain and France who would have to give up their permanent seats under that scenario. Under the current charter, regional bodies are not UN members and would therefore be ineligible for seats on the Council. Mexico and Argentina oppose Brazil’s quest for a permanent seat on the Council, and Pakistan opposes India’s bid.</p> <p>The implications of the preceding analysis is that the United Nations Security Council, which is seen as the key organ of the United Nations charged with the responsibility of ensuring international peace and security are both technically and procedurally dominated by the winners of Second World War who shaped the Charter of the United Nations in their national interests, dividing the veto-power pertinent to the permanent seats amongst themselves; thereby giving the council the character of inequity, undemocratic, unrepresentative of the races of world, unaccountable et cetera to the larger world community that make up the organization.</p> <p>It is in order to address this anomaly that scholars such as Chopra, (2001), Beigbeder, (1994), Rourke (2002), Canton, (1986), Barry (2003), Kegley (1985), Roskin (1993), Roberts (2000), Goodrich (1999), Sheever (1999), Roskin (1993), Huggins (1988), Sigler (2002), (Maya, 2005), Brocker (2000), Hopkinson (1998), Galtung (2000), Cede (1999), Bourantonis, (2005), Afoaku and Ukaga (2001), Weiss (2003), Blum ( 2005), (Archibugi, 1993) and Heinrich (2012) have argued and continue to argue that there is the dire need for the reorganization and reformation of the UN Security Council both in terms of composition and voting pattern to reflect the multilateral character of the organization.</p> <p>However, while these group of scholars and existing literature on the issue of United Nations Security Council reform largely succeeded in  providing the descriptive analysis of the need to reform the United Nations Security Council and the on-going bid by some perceived “developing nations” in all the geo-political regions  of the universe for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council is very informative; it contains neither a thorough discussion of the potential strategies for obtaining a permanent seat nor a theoretical framework that might be used to further analyze the bids for these group of countries seeking permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council.</p> <p>Moreover, they fail to provide us with the yardstick with which we can use in ascertaining the method and criteria that can qualify a country to be <strong>(s)</strong>elected for such position of permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council. On the account of this, the study therefore elicits the following research questions:</p> <ol><li>Is the need to reform the United Nations Security Council implicated in the geopolitical realities of the 21st Century membership of the organisation?</li> <li>Is the quest to reform and enlarge the structure and voting pattern in the United Nations Security Council aimed at making it more democratic, efficient and legitimate?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.3       OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The broad objective of this study is to interrogate the issues involved in the quest and struggle for Permanent Seat at the United Nation’s Security Council: A Critical Assessment of the Contestants in 2012”. However, the study will address the following specific objectives:</p> <ol><li>To determine if the need to reform the United Nations Security Council is implicated in the geopolitical realities of the 21st Century membership of the organisation.</li> <li>To ascertain whether the quest to reform and enlarge the structure and voting pattern in the United Nations Security Council is to make it more democratic,  efficient and legitimate.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study has both theoretical and practical significance. Theoretically, the study will provide a comprehensive insight into the looming and cyclical issue of United Nations reforms, especially in to the United Nations Security Council reform by giving a detailed account of both the remote and immediate factors that necessitate the call for the reformation of the structure of the council and its voting pattern; it will also account for the reasons why the current veto wielding members (the so-called big five) have been giving the move a sort of lip service and lackadaisical attitude, rather than giving the issue the seriousness and attention that it deserved. It will also provide the reading public with a clear cut meaning and nature of the functions of the United Nations Security Council, its structure and the provision of the United Nations Charter as it regards the membership and power of the Security Council.  It shall equally add to the extant body of literature that borders on United Nations Reform and the Quest for permanent seat in the world especially as it concerns Africa, which Nigeria is part and is vehemently positioning itself as the beautiful bride to be crowned with one out of the two proposed slots (seats) that is to be allocated to Africa.</p> <p>Practically, it shall be of immense benefit to diplomats, public policy formulators, politicians and high level representative at the international level especially policy makers that are saddled with the task of devising appropriate institutional mechanisms for the smooth and foreign policy thrust that will enable their home government to adequately lobby and canvass for the its allocation or (s)election. For the United Nations Security Council, It will also provide the basis to scholars for further research into the United Nations  Reform and the expansion of the composition of the security for both the permanent and non-permanent categories.</p> <p><strong>1.5       LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p>This review focused primarily on those documents and commentators that comments and contributes to the on-going debate on the reformation, reorganisation and expansion of the United Nations Organisation especially as it relates to the call to reform United Nations Security Council both in composition, representation and in voting pattern because the use of Veto by a select few is causing disquiet among the rest of the world.</p> <p><strong>The Politics of Veto in United Nations Security Council (Uses and Abuses of Veto Power)</strong></p> <p>One of the most distinctive features of the UNSC is that it is the only U.N organ in which there is a formal rule of unanimity or ‘right of veto’. The UNSC is part parliament and part secret diplomatic conclave. As Beigbeder (1994:18) asserts, “the Charter declares that decisions of the Council shall be by the affirmative vote of nine members and that, except for procedural matters, the votes shall include the concurring votes of the permanent members”. The only exception to this Charter rule is that in decisions relating to the pacific settlement of disputes, a party to a dispute shall abstain from voting. Thus, if nine or more of the 15 members vote in favor of a proposal but one of the five permanent members votes `no’, the proposal will be nullified. The UNSC can veto virtually any decision including the proposals by the UNGA as a whole. A closer analysis however, reveals that there is no reference in the U.N Charter to the ‘right of veto’. What is called the ‘right of veto’ is intrinsically linked to permanent membership. Article 27 (3) of the U.N Charter merely calls for the ‘concurring votes’ of the permanent members when the UNSC takes substantive decision.</p> <p>The model on which the U.N was built has been proved to be too ambitious. The U.N Charter had been drafted on the assumption that the victors of the WWII would continue to co-operate as they did during the hostilities. Paradoxically, from the beginning, the U.N had been unable to function as designed. The working of the UNSC, a body designed to ensure the strong beat of the heart of the U.N Charter and its collective security provisions has over the years attracted widespread criticism. Instead of fostering co-operation, it became apparent in the early days of the U.N that the Post-War differences that had developed between the U.S and the then Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) significantly limited the ability of the UNSC to take action. As Chopra (2001:42) argues, “The superpowers were inevitably on opposite sides of most issues and the U.S controlled the votes in the council”. The USSR’s interests being frequently threatened, and because of its conspicuous minority position in the UNSC, it was left with the veto as its sole weapon within the U.N machinery to thwart any action it considered injurious to its interests.</p> <p>Since the U.N originated from a coalition of victorious wartime allies, “the organization faced for roughly several decades questioning on how those ‘converted’ to the antifascist side of peace might be admitted to the club” (Beigbeder 1984:45). Over the years, vetoes have been cast to block the admission of member states as well as nominations for the U.N Secretary General. As argued by Rourke (2002:34), “Despite all 14 other UNSC members having supported Boutros Boutros Ghali, the U.S veto ended his tenure as the U.N Secretary General”. As the Cold -War evolved, within an economically and ideologically diametrically opposed world, the U.S and the USSR approached this issue of new U.N membership, not from the viewpoint of who sided with whom during the WWII, but rather who sided with whom in the Cold-War.</p> <p>Thus, the U.S ensured that USSR allies applying for membership were denied the required UNSC majority. On the USSR side, in a bid to keep out Western- sponsored applicants, it used its veto recurrently (Canton 1986). In the early days of the U.N as Barry (2003:38) argues, “The USSR Commissioner and later Minister for Foreign Affairs, Vyacheslav Molotov said `no’ so many times that he was known as `Mr Veto’.” Vyacheslav Molotov regularly rejected bids for new membership because of the U.S refusal to admit the Soviet republics. This state of affairs led in 1955 to a compromise deal which resulted in the admission of sixteen members of the U.N. As Kegley (1985:128) asserts, “This compromise between the superpowers allowed the great powers to support a politically balanced package of applicants, including pro-Easterners, pro-Westerners, and neutrals”. The compromise deal opened the floodgates and by 1980, the U.N had more than 150 members, roughly three times the original number.</p> <p>It is apparent that the U.S and USSR would probably not have accepted the creation of the U.N without the veto power. This is because some exceptional privileges denied to Great Powers in the days of the League of Nations or in other security associations, the veto represents that right which was prerequisite of all sovereign states in the pre-UN world not to be overruled by other members. As Roskin argues:</p> <p>Stalin at Yalta in 1945 insisted on the veto provision, Churchill and Roosevelt went along. Stalin felt [correctly] that the USSR would be so outnumbered by non-Communist countries that it would suffer permanent condemnation. On the same basis, Stalin got the bizarre provision giving <em>three</em> UNGA votes to the USSR, whose constituent republics of Ukraine and Beloroussia were counted as U.N members. (Roskin, 1993:362)</p> <p>One may observe that since the UNSC was originally intended to deal with most critical issues of national interests, and because these Great Powers hold the preponderance of means for the enforcement, such an arrangement may be considered a necessary departure from the complete abandonment of unanimity. Though it is impossible to escape the fact that the primary purpose of the veto is not to foster co-operation but to prevent action, the use of veto is often in contradiction to the literal terms of the U.N Charter and has been manipulated for national interests. The veto strangles the UNSC and prevents a broad consensus from guiding its work across a wide range of issues surrounding global politics. This device however, in international politics helps Great Powers to make sure that their vital interests are not surrendered.</p> <p>According to Roberts (2000:41), “there was discontent when the U.S and Britain systematically blocked council action to impose economic sanctions on South Africa during hay days of apartheid regime and/or policy in the country in the 1980s”. Goodrich (1999:60) notes that, “there was dissatisfaction when France and Britain blocked action on Suez in 1956; when the U.S refused action on Vietnam in the 1960s, 70s and when the USSR prevented action on Afghanistan in the 1980s”. Today, the opposition is conspicuous because the UNSC, rather than failing to act, is now acting in ways that often seem motivated by geopolitical interests of permanent members. Currently, there has been sign that Russia and China are willing to veto any resolution punishing Iran because of its drive to control the nuclear fuel-cycle.</p> <p>Expressing the role of veto in the U.N system, Sheever (1999:59) notes that, “no important action can be undertaken by the U.N with any reasonable prospect of success in the face of U.S opposition. Conversely, if the U.S gives full support to a proposal, its chances of being adopted must be considered very high, unless of course the veto operates”.</p> <p>Similarly Roskin observes:</p> <p>In speeches and corridor conversations, diplomats often point out that four out of the five permanent members are ‘European’ (a concept that includes the U.S). He adds that ‘Four out of five are `industrialized’ countries. The four-fifths of humankind that live in the poor countries of the global South, they say, have only one voice, namely, China (Roskin, 1993:63).</p> <p>The Chinese role in representing Third World Countries founds expression in President Robert G. Mugabe’s speech, during his state visit to China where he implored to the Chinese leaders that Britain wanted to use the U.N Special Envoy for Zimbabwe, Anna Tibaijuka’s report to put Harare on the UNSC agenda, but expressed hope that China a staunch ally since the days of the liberation struggle would use its veto to thwart such action. In Beijing, the Zimbabwean President said, China, as a member of the United Nations Security Council, we appeal to you to act in defense of innocent people and nations in the Third World. My country at the moment is being brought into an arena of international publicity unnecessarily (<em>Southern Times</em>,   2005).</p> <p>In the same vein Huggins (1988:41) commented that, “it became the practice to use the veto more broadly both to stop the possibility of any sanction directed against permanent members, even to stop a mere critical resolution directed against an ally”. It is for this reason that Sigler (2002:67) posits that “the U.S use of veto has traditionally been tied to Israel with the U.S vetoing anything critical of the Israeli’s at the Security Council”. In September 2003, the U.S vetoed a resolution drafted by Syria that denounced Israel’s threat to remove the then Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat. Washington said the resolution was `flawed’ because it did not include a robust condemnation of acts of terrorism by Palestinian militant groups (Maya, 2005). “In 2002 the U.S again blocked another draft resolution criticizing the killing by Israeli forces and the destruction of the World Food Programme (WFP) warehouse in the West Bank” (Sigler, 2002:67).</p> <p>These above illustrations depict how relations among veto-wielding permanent members’ interests impinge as well as determine the shape, nature and character of global events within a particular epoch. The veto power was deliberately inserted in the U.N Charter by the Great Powers and universally accepted by others as an automatic switch off, to prevent the UNSC from becoming involved in a great power showdown. Considering the end of the Cold-War, the less used veto now serves as a mechanism:</p> <p>To prevent an ad hoc UNSC majority from ganging up on one of its permanent members, such as China for its human rights record. In addition, it forces the majority to consider minority positions in its resolutions, such as softening the sanctions against Libya for its failure to turn over those wanted for the airline bombings (Brocker, 2000:42).</p> <p>In the Libyan case, it is when the sanctions were softened; China (and other members) abstained, allowing the resolution to pass.</p> <p><strong>On Reform, Composition and Voting Power in the Security Council</strong></p> <p>The U.N reform, in the sense of changing the organization so that its capacities to fulfill the goals of its Charter are strengthened, has been a continuing matter of concern and the object of serious research. According to Trevor (2000:81), “The U.N’s failure to fully understand and doctrinally adjust to the new circumstances surrounding global politics brought the world body to the point of outright strategic failure”. As Hopkinson (1998:50) has put it: “The world balance of power has changed dramatically in the years since the United Nations was established but the composition of the Security Council has not”. Hence the need for reform has persistently been suggested.</p> <p>Over the years, a variety of proposals to amend the structure of the UNSC, to align it with the current geopolitical realities have been proffered. However, the veto power aspect has become a stumbling block, as the five permanent members have been ever ready to quash any attempt that may lead to the amendment of Article 108 of the U.N Charter. It was on the basis of this that Rourke declared that:</p> <p>The continuing importance of the veto in practice, its value as a symbol of big power status, and the difficulty of amending the Charter mean that the veto authority is likely to continue without major revision despite arguments that its existence is in the hands of an unrepresentative few countries and is undermining the legitimacy of the UNSC (Rourke, 1995:363).</p> <p>Advocating the overhaul of the U.N, Galtung observes that:</p> <p>Abolishing the Security Council, revising the contribution structure, significantly reducing the level of the United Nations salaries, the dewaldheimization of the United Nations system, greatly reducing the power and authority of the executive heads, and moving the United Nations headquarters out of New York will make this international body more efficient and reliable (Galtung, 2000:98).</p> <p>The special status enjoyed by the five Permanent members of the Security Council has become a simmering issue in the U.N. As Rourke (2002:169) argues, “The most common argument against the arrangement is that the existing membership has never been fully realistic and is becoming less so as time goes by”. Many global and regional powers that do not have the veto power have been pressing for changes in the UNSC structure. In the same vein, less powerful countries have jumped on the bandwagon. This can be illustrated by the Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga who once called on the UNSC “to become more representative and more responsible to the general membership of the United Nations” (Rourke, 2002:169). The Sri Lankan President’s sentiments were echoed by Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa who emphasised that “the Security Council can no longer be retained like the sanctuary of the hollies with only the original members acting as high priests, deciding on issues for the rest of the world who cannot be admitted” ( Rourke, 2002:169).</p> <p>In his report in 2005, titled “In Larger Freedom: Development, Security and Human Rights for All”, the then Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, stated that, no overhaul of the U.N would be complete without reform of the Security Council. Dissatisfaction with the UNSC has spawned many plans to revise it. However, any change in the membership of the UNSC requires an amendment to Article 108 of the U.N Charter which needs the consent of all the permanent veto-wielding members. As such, it is highly unlikely that any formal changes concerning membership of the permanent members or their veto power will materialize.</p> <p>As Cede (1999:35) argues, “five seats are attributed to the Afro-Asian group, two for the Latino-American, two for the Western European and others and one for the Eastern European group”. The term is for two years, with half of the number elected by the UNGA (Art. 23) each year. As Article 23(2) stipulates “a retiring member shall not be immediately re-elected”. The principal officer of the UNSC is the President who, rather than being elected, is appointed monthly, in rotation, according to alphabetical order. This rule gives each UNSC member (permanent and non-permanent) a chance to hold the Presidency.</p> <p>Bourantonis (2005) asserted that as a result of the entrance of several new member-states into the United Nations Organisation due to decolonization in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Spain and several Latin American countries proposed amendments to the UN Charter in 1956 to increase the number of non-permanent seats on the UNSC from six to eight. Bourantonis equally argues that after several years of debate and disagreement, including the Soviet Union’s insistence on linking the issue of UNSC restructuring to the issue of mainland China’s membership of the UN, there was a “breakthrough” on the issue in the early 1960s. In December 1963, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) formally approved amendments increasing non-permanent seats from six to ten, and the amendments were ratified by the required number of member-states in 1965 (Afoaku and Ukaga, 2001; Weiss, 2003; Blum, 2005).</p> <p>As a result of continued decolonization, overall membership in the UN continued to grow significantly from the mid-1960s to the late-1970s. At the same time, developing countries were increasingly dissatisfied with the abuse of the veto power by the permanent members and the lack of “equitable representation” for Asian and African countries on the various councils of the UN. Consequently, India and several developing countries proposed amendments to the UN Charter in 1979 to increase the number of non-permanent seats on the UNSC from 11 to 14 (Bourantonis, 2005: 31). In 1980, several African, Asian, and Latin American countries proposed increasing the number of non-permanent seats on the UNSC from 10 to 16 (Blum, 2005). Unlike the previous effort to restructure the UNSC in the early 1960s, these subsequent efforts were unsuccessful largely because of heightened tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union during this period (Archibugi, 1993).</p> <p>According to Schlichtmann (1999: 510) the UNGA approved in 1995 the Declaration on the 50th Anniversary of the United Nations, which stated that the UNSC should be “expanded and its working methods continue to be reviewed in a way that will further strengthen its capacity and effectiveness, enhance its representative character, and improve its working efficiency and transparency”.</p> <p>Heinrich (2012:1) showing the insignificant character of the non-permanent members of the UN Security Council, posed the question; “there are 10 non-permanent members on the UN Security Council – name three”. He went on to assert that beyond a handful of policy wonks, no one pays much attention to non-permanent members, which is indicative of how little prestige such a seat bestows. Although non-permanent members vote, they exercise no veto and so lack any pretence to a powerful say on the council, much less a decisive role of the kind enjoyed by their permanent, veto-wielding counterparts.</p> <p>Continuing he opined that indeed, the powerlessness of the council’s non-permanent membership betrays its real purpose. Elected in regional blocs (by a process that makes selecting a World Cup host look transparent), it exists to provide the UN Security Council with a democratic veneer, to legitimise the non-democratic decision-making of the permanent five. So which countries make up the numbers? Most non-permanent members sit within three informal categories. The first are the ”great-power wannabes”, countries such as India and Germany. Next are the ”minnows” – Togo and Azerbaijan, for example – so lacking in diplomatic weight that a UN seat is one of the only ways they manifest international presence. The third category comprises countries with geopolitical situations so benign they can afford a UN seat as a diplomatic comfort zone.</p> <p>According to the http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,5999729,00.html, the G4, (an alliance of some developed countries made up of Germany, Japan, Brazil and India) been pushing for an overhaul of the UN system as part of the G-4 alliance. A move which has seen them campaigning to join this elite group  (United States, Britain, France, Russia and China hold permanent seats on the UN Security Council and the power to veto all resolutions) as part of a more comprehensive project to revamp the Council for most of the past decade. The G-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the Council without the power of veto, and a further four non-permanent seats.</p> <p>The fall of the Berlin Wall and the unipolar stand of the United States have also added to the urgent need for a radical reformation of the entire UNSC structure and operations. Akpotor and Agbebaku (2010) observed that at the end of World War II, the United Nations was born with the Big Five negotiating them into the Security Council which is the most powerful organ of the U.N.O. But since 1955 there had been clamour for changes and reforms of the UN especially the Security Council which is regarded by many as a prestigious exclusive club. The calls for reforms increased with the collapse of the USSR in the 1990s. This made the United States too powerful and many times going against the decisions of the Security Council especially in the area of collective security as in Iraq.</p> <p>Tanin (n.d) commenting on the issue of Reform of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)  argued that the reform encompasses five key issues: categories of membership, the question of the veto held by the five permanent members, regional representation, the size of an enlarged Council and its working methods, and the Security Council-General Assembly relationship. Member States, regional groups and other Member State interest groupings developed different positions and proposals on how to move forward on this contested issue.</p> <p><strong>On the United Nations Reform and the Position of Africa in the Security Council</strong></p> <p>On his part Kasese-Bota Zambia’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, argued that the African proposal for permanent seat in the UN Security Council sought to redress the historical injustice to the continent through the Security Council composition and processes. Thus:</p> <p>It is the position of the African Group that there should be expansion in both the permanent and non-permanent categories with the new permanent members exercising all privileges and obligations that go with permanency tenure. (Kasese-Bota, 2012:5).</p> <p>He also added: “However, Africa exercises flexibility on issues of maintaining or abolishing the veto for all permanent members of the Security Council.” (Kasese-Bota, 2012:8).</p> <p>In the same vein, Charles Ntwaagae, (2012) Permanent Representative of the Republic of Botswana to the United Nations, maintained that Africa remained committed to reforming the Security Council to make it more representative, more accountable, more democratic and inclusive in its composition and methods of work. He however, said that the identification of the candidate countries to occupy the Permanent Seats should be left to the wisdom of African leaders to decide on.</p> <p>Responding to the double standard nature of the UN membership Security Council, Ambassador Wilfred Emvula, Permanent Representative of the Republic of Namibia to the United Nations, said his country was strongly opposed to any second-class permanent membership status for African countries or any other member state:</p> <p>The fact that the agenda of the Security Council has dealt more with issues concerning Africa than any other region is a compelling case for the continent to play an active part in deciding upon matters affecting its wellbeing (Emvula, 2012:3).</p> <p>Moreover, Coordinator of the C-10 Group negotiating on behalf of the African Group, Ambassador Shekou Touray, Permanent Representative of the Republic of Sierra Leone to the United Nations, said that support for the African Common position continued to receive support in the continent’s quest to claim permanent membership in the Security Council and address the historical under-representation.</p> <p>Arguing further he observed that:</p> <p>The UN Security Council was the principal decision-making organ in matters relating to international peace and security. Currently the UN Security Council is composed of five permanent members — China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America — and 10 non-permanent members of which only South Africa and Togo are from Africa, the continent with the largest number of members of the UN (Touray, 2012:6).</p> <p>Commenting on the issue of reforming the UN Security Council Nigerian President, Goodluck Jonathan (2012) called for a reform of the United Nations (UN) and support for Nigeria’s quest for permanent membership of the UN Security Council. President Jonathan made the call when he received the visiting UN Secretary General, Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, at the State House. President Jonathan decried the situation whereby no African nation is represented in the permanent category of the UN Security Council said the reforms were necessary to bring the world in line with the global current realities.</p> <p><strong>World Opinion Leaders and the United Nations Reform and Expansion</strong></p> <p>According to the http://www.wikipedia.org (2011) the existing five permanent members, each holding the right of veto on Security Council reform, announced their positions reluctantly. The United States supported the permanent membership of Japan and India and a small number of additional non-permanent members. The United Kingdom and France essentially supported the G4 position, with the expansion of permanent and non-permanent members and the accession of Germany, Brazil, India and Japan to permanent member status, as well as an increase the presence by African countries on the Council. China supported the stronger representation of developing countries, voicing support for the Republic of India. Russia, India’s long time friend and ally has also endorsed the fast growing power’s candidature to assume a seat of a permanent member on the Security Council.</p> <p>On his part the United Nations Secretary General, Ban ki Moon (n.d) opined that the UN Security Council reform, being debated since two decades is too long overdue and the necessary expansion must be made considering how much the world has changed.</p> <p>In a joint declaration by the United Kingdom and France on reform to the United Nations Security Council through their permanent representatives, held that:</p> <p>Reform of the UNSC, both its enlargement and the improvement of its working methods, must therefore succeed. We reaffirm the support of our two countries for the candidacies of Germany, Brazil, India and Japan for permanent membership, as well as for permanent representation for Africa on the Council. We regret that negotiations towards this goal remain in deadlock and are therefore ready to consider an intermediate solution. This could include a new category of seats, with a longer term than those of the current elected members and those terms would be renewable; at the end of an initial phase, it could be decided to turn these new types of seats into permanent ones. We will work with all our partners to define the parameters of such a reform. UNSC reform requires a political commitment from the member states at the highest level. We will work in this direction in the coming months with a view to achieving effective reform.</p> <p>India’s permanent representative to the UN commenting on the need for a reform of the Organisations, said that:</p> <p>Activities of the Security Council have greatly expanded in the past few years. The success of Security Council’s actions depends upon political support of the international community. Any package for restructuring of the Security Council should, therefore, be broad-based. In particular, adequate presence of developing countries is needed in the Security Council. Nations of the world must feel that their stakes in global peace and prosperity are factored into the UN’s decision making. Any expansion of permanent members’ category must be based on an agreed criteria, rather than be a pre-determined selection. There must be an inclusive approach based on transparent consultations. India supports expansion of both permanent and non-permanent members’ category. The latter is the only avenue for the vast majority of Member States to serve on the Security Council. Reform and expansion must be an integral part of a common package.</p> <p>Moreover, the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh during the General Debate of the 59th Session of the United Nations General Assembly observed:</p> <p>It is common knowledge that the United Nations is often unable to exert an effective influence on global economic and political issues of critical importance. This is due to what may be called as “democracy deficit”, which prevents effective multilateralism, a multilateralism that is based on a democratically-evolved global consensus. Therefore, reform and restructuring of the United Nations system can alone provide a crucial link in an expanding chain of efforts to refashion international structures, imbuing them with a greater degree of participatory decision-making, so as to make them more representative of contemporary realities. The expansion of the Security Council, in the category of both permanent and non-permanent members, and the inclusion of countries like India as permanent members, would be a first step in the process of making the United Nations a truly representative body (Manmohan Singh, 2004:13)</p> <p>During the General Debate of the 64th Session of the United Nations General Assembly </p>\n\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR A PERMANENT SEAT AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL: <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE STRUGGLE FOR A PERMANENT SEAT AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL: ", "id": 40}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>EUROPEAN UNION AND CHALLENGES OF AFRICA’S DEVELOPMENT: A CRITICAL APPRAISAL, 1999-2010</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study examined the European Union, EU and challenges of African development. Specifically, the study ascertained if the increasing rate of EU-African relations has increased the volume of trade between EU and Africa and secondly, ascertained if the increasing rate of EU-African relations has increased the volume of foreign direct investment from EU states to Africa. The study interrogated the following research questions. First, has the increasing rate of EU-African relations increased the volume of trade between EU and Africa? Second, has the increasing rate of EU-African relations increased the volume of foreign direct investment (FDI) from EU states to Africa? The theory of complex interdependence was chosen as our theoretical framework. Our choice of the theory is because of its ability to highlight cooperative actions among states and facilitate deep understanding of global patterns of interrelationship. The study relied on secondary sources of data, and as such generated both qualitative and quantitative data. After a critical analysis of available data, the study revealed as follows: first, the increasing rate of EU-African relations has increased the volume of trade between EU and Africa. Second, the increasing rate of EU-African relations has increased the volume of foreign direct investment from EU states to Africa. Based on these findings, the study is of the view that Africa as a continent should deepen the rate of economic activities between her and EU in order to attract more FDI and trade deals. Further, Africa should cultivate, and compete for, foreign direct investment inflows to bridge their domestic saving-investment gap and therefore augment the available funds to finance development process through bilateral investment agreements like their developing countries counterpart in other regions.</p> <p><strong>1.1    INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>International relations are undergoing profound change with newly emerging powers entering the scene. The European Union is itself an “emerging” foreign policy actor, hoping to reinforce its political influence in order to match its weight as global development actor (2007). The European Union, (EU), is an international economic organization comprising some advanced countries of the north, which originally included France, West Germany, Belgium, Italy, Luxemburg and the Netherlands. It has however, to include twenty one (21), other countries namely, Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and  United Kingdom. Through a conglomeration of the African, Caribbean and Pacific, (ACP), group of states which today number seventy nine, (79), (48 African, 16 Caribbean and 15 Pacific) countries are associated with the EU.</p> <p>As a result of the Cold War, Europe took so much interest in the affairs of Africa coupled with the fact that most of the African countries were colonized by Major European powers and dependent on them. It is also believed that Euro-African relations arises by default. According to John (1995:95):</p> <p>Africa’s dependence on Europe also arises by default, that is, from the failure of African countries to diversify to any significant degree their trading links in the three decades since most states received their independence…And Africa’s economic decline makes the continent an attractive prospect as trading partner.</p> <p>Europe, preoccupied with the its own problems as it moved toward the establishment of a single integrated market in 1992 and with the growing instability on its eastern borders following the disintegration of the Soviet Bloc, appeared, in the early 1990s, to have lost enthusiasm for the development compact with Africa. Following the end of the Cold War, it seemed that the EU and its Member States were losing interest in Africa. At the level of the bilateral policies of the Member States, France, the United Kingdom, and numerous other countries in Europe cut substantially the level of their development programmes (Fredrik, 2007).</p> <p>In fact, John (1995:96) observed that:</p> <p>Even France, long the champion of increased assistance to Africa within the European Union, seemed to be tiring of the cost of supporting its sphere of influence.</p> <p>However, since international politics is shaped by the underlying global dynamics and the political context of each continent. The relationship appears to be on the resurgence. With the beginning of the new century, the collective commitment to double aid to Africa and to enhance its effectiveness has increased among members of the EU. The 2000 Lomé Agreements – renamed Cotonou Partnership Agreement (CPA) has become the main legal framework of cooperation between the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP). The first EU-Africa Heads of State Summit in 2000, in Cairo, recognised the need for a new high-level political relationship between the two continents and professed a new standard of multilateral cooperation that would not be based on the usual post-colonial perspectives and donor-recipient philosophy (Andrew, 2010).</p> <p>Further, the adoption of the European Consensus on Development, the ambitious agenda on policy coherence for development marked a change in the EU’s approach to international development. On the other hand, the process towards a ‘common’ strategy for Africa, which culminated in the Joint Africa-EU Strategy adopted in Lisbon in December 2007, meant that the EU was trying to play a leading role in the international arena (Fredrik, 2009).</p> <p>Africa, therefore, became central not only to the EU’s development policy, but, more widely, to its overall external affairs. This study has been designed to critically evaluate the European Union and challenges of development in Africa.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Europe’s relationship with Africa is not new. It is deeply rooted in history and has gradually evolved from often painful colonial arrangements into a strong and equal partnership based on common interests, mutual recognition and accountability. Europe and Africa are connected by strong trade links, making the EU the biggest export market for African products. For example, approximately 85% of Africa’s exports of cotton, fruit and vegetables are imported by the EU. Europe and Africa are also bound by substantial and predictable aid flows. In 2003 the EU’s development aid to Africa totalled €15 billion, compared to €5 billion in 1985. With this, the EU is by far the biggest donor: its ODA accounts for 60% of the total Official development Assistance, ODA going to Africa (see Commission of the European Communities, 2005).</p> <p>Moreover, some EU Member States retain longstanding political, economic and cultural links with different African countries and regions, while others are relative newcomers to African politics and development. At Community level, over the last few decades the European Commission has built up extensive experience and concluded a number of contractual arrangements with different parts of Africa that provide partners with a solid foundation of predictability and security.</p> <p>However, for too long the EU’s relations with Africa have been too fragmented, both in policy formulation and implementation: between the different policies and actions of EU Member States and the European Commission; between trade cooperation and economic development cooperation; between more traditional socio-economic development efforts and strategic political policies. Neither Europe nor Africa can afford to sustain this situation and in December 2005, the European Union made a decisive effort to define a more strategic platform for its relations with Africa, aiming at a mutually beneficial partnership.</p> <p>Against this backdrop and building on the work of the first Africa-EU summit in Cairo in 2000, leaders from both continents decided to move cooperation to a new level in 2007. At the Lisbon Summit, 80 Heads of States and Government from Europe (27) and Africa (53) agreed to pursue common interests and strategic objectives together, beyond the focus of traditional development policy. To do so, they adopted the Joint Africa-EU Strategy which redefines the relations between the two continents for tackling global challenges together. In the context of the Strategy, the first action plan covering the period 2008-2010 and introducing concrete measures was structured around eight strategic partnerships: As noted by the EuroBarometer (2010), the areas of strategic partnership are:</p> <ol><li>Peace and security</li> <li>Democratic governance and human rights</li> <li>Trade, regional integration and infrastructure</li> <li>Millennium development goals (MDGs)</li> <li>Energy</li> <li>Climate change</li> <li>Migration, mobility and employment</li> <li>Science, information society and space</li> </ol> <p>However, studies in Africa’s relations such as Adogamhe, (2006); Princeton (1988); Diamond (1995); George (2006); Cornelissens (2000); De Lorenzo (2007); with the rest of the world has always centered on her relations with America, with specific countries within the EU and more recently with China. This does not help us to understand the trajectory and dynamics of Africa-EU relations. More fundamentally, this has glossed over the role of EU in Africa’s development. Hence, this forms the lacuna in literature that we seek to bridge. This study therefore, sets out to critically appraise the EU and its role in development in Africa.</p> <p>In the light of the above discussions, we pose the following research questions:</p> <ul><li>Has the increasing rate of EU-African relations increased the volume of trade between EU and Africa?</li> </ul> <ul><li>Has the increasing rate of EU-African relations increased the volume of foreign direct investment (FDI) from EU states to Africa?</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.3 Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The broad objective of this study is to critically appraise the EU and development in Africa. Specifically, this study has the following objectives:</p> <ul><li>To ascertain if the increasing rate of EU-Africa relations has increased the volume of trade between EU and Africa.</li> </ul> <ul><li>To ascertain if the increasing rate of EU-Africa relations has increased the volume of foreign direct investment from EU states to Africa.</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.4 Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study has both practical and theoretical significance. Practically, the study will guide policy makers of African states in their relations with the external environment and in their domestic policy making and implementation process to develop effective ways in its relation with other continents of the world. Further, as no nation in Africa is static and every generation has its own unique problems, this work will serve as a catalyst to the present and future generations of Africa to deepen Africa’s relations with EU knowing that we are presently in an interdependent world.</p> <p>Theoretically, this study will provide students of international relations with new knowledge on Africa-EU relations. The study will equally add to existing literature on Africa-EU relations and expectedly, provoke further research on the subject matter.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Literature Review</strong></p> <p>In this section, our primary concern is to concentrate on existing literature in relation to the subject matter of our research questions with a view to understanding what scholars have already written or what have not been properly and satisfactorily addressed in the literature concerning the discourse under investigation. In this context, the major thrust of our review shall concentrate on:</p> <ol><li>EU-African Relations and trade.</li> <li>EU-African Relations and foreign direct investment.</li> </ol> <p><strong>EU-African Relations and Trade</strong></p> <p>Anne (2003) noted that from the EU’s perspective, one way of easing the political tension and persuading African governments of the good intensions of European donors would be to give a clearer sign that the EU does indeed view the relationship with Africa as a valuable and equal partnership rather than what many African leaders seem to think, as a one-way stream of paternalistic charitability, thinly camouflaging self-interested economic policies. This could be done by focusing less on aid, and more on other factors that promote development – particularly trade, but also migration. She further observed that while bad governance is a hindrance to economic growth, it is also the case that economic sluggishness is a hindrance to democracy and good governance. There is general agreement that aid is not the best way to create economic growth. The EU would therefore do well to focus more on other strategies than aid in their quest to assist Africa’s development.</p> <p>Greg (2003) looking at the linkage between aid from EU and good governance in Africa observed that most governments in Africa today have had their leadership endorsed through some form of democratic election. Many of them find it problematic that they then should have to follow the standards set by outsiders rather than themselves when it comes to how they choose to run their country. Even when the standards are very similar to the ones that they endorse themselves, it is often seen as a dent in their sovereign pride to have to endure others imposing these standards in the form of demands and conditions. While it is, in principle, entirely voluntary whether to accept conditional aid or not, in reality most poor African countries are highly dependent on aid money and would find it difficult .This leads us to a discussion of the political problem of sovereignty caused by the good governance agenda of donor states to say no. He said that in 1996, foreign aid constituted the equivalent of 12.3 percent of GDP in Africa, if we exclude Nigeria and South Africa.</p> <p>Ian (2009) in exploring how changes within Africa have influenced the evolution of the EU-Africa relations opines that  the beginning of the 2000s, a developmental agenda was advanced by leading African elites aimed at revitalising Africa’s place in the global political economy. The NEPAD, launched in 2001, was received with considerable enthusiasm in some quarters of the developed world as an African-led initiative that would provide the framework for promoting development in Africa. The African Union (AU), launched in 2002, effectively replacing the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) which had been the premier continental organisation in Africa, was an ambitious project, but fraught with all sorts of difficulties. It is difficult, for example, to see how such vitally needed unity could be achieved, given the current tensions that continue to wrack Africa. Both the AU and the NEPAD have been launched at a time when there has been a growing questioning of the basic neo-liberal philosophy that underpins contemporary capitalism, frequently cast within the catch-all term ‘globalisation’.</p> <p>He further infers that observers may proffer the view that this juncture opens up space for Africa and that perhaps the AU and the NEPAD may be vehicles to advance this. Such a commitment has been agreed and signed by African elites themselves and there can be no retreat. Even though the AU takes as its departure the European Union as the ultimate end game, it must be seen as an internally originated institution deserving of particular attention and scrutiny. In the same vein however, its commitments need to be measured against actual concrete action rather than accepting at face value the various pronouncements made on extremely important issues.</p> <p>On the part of Richard (2009) the EU’s engagement with Sub-Saharan Africa  have been a characteristic of the development of the Union’s foreign, security and defence policies since the 1990s. The EU’s policies pursued Sub-Saharan Africa have played a key role in developing both the <em>form </em>of the EU’s foreign policy infrastructure and its instruments and, crucially, in the forms of military intervention that the EU has undertaken outside of Europe. He argues that argues that Sub-Saharan Africa has provided a crucial component in the evolution of an embryonic strategic culture for the EU.</p> <p>Nugent (1996) devoted a considerable part of his work to the events that led to the formation of the EU, formerly known as the EEC. He observed that the 1957 treaty of Rome which set up the then EEC is in consonance with the ideas and burning desire of Europe to improve the world economy most especially the economy of the third world. He further discussed the politics that goes on in the EU between the more developed and less developed member states. Britain, France, Italy, and Germany were specifically mentioned as power brokers in the EU. Nugent’s analysis was so much faulted because he dwelt much on the contributions made by individual European nations towards the formation of the EEC and failed to illustrate how the EU would help to improve the third world economy.</p> <p>Weigall and Stirk (1997) traced the origin of the EU to the EEC, although they made no attempt to provide solutions towards the economic problems of much of the third world. However, they offered a very detailed analysis of the EU and how it works. The duo described the foundation, structure and all the functions of the EU. Weigll and Stirk also examined EU policies and resolution of trade disputes between and among member states or any other organ of the (EU) body. The work also reviewed the process of “dialogue and détente”. The writers observed that the European Union has become a tool in the hands of more powerful members.</p> <p>The EEC (EU) is a compromise between a weakened original six and self-asserting latecomers. Britain falls into the later category according to Leonard (1990). Leonard examined the composition of the EEC and the place of each member state in it. As at the time Leonard published his book, the EU was still known as the EEC and was made up of twelve European nations. Leonard asserted that Britain, with states like France, Italy, and Germany has become dominate in the EEC and calls the shot. He also appointed out that the leadership of the European commission and parliament has generally resided with the original six, though the self-asserting latecomer sates have from time to time asserted their influence. In leonard’s words, “this derives partly from the often outstanding ability of their representatives and their degree of organization”. He posited that all EEC (EU) member states are firmly committed to the eradication of poverty from Africa. However, this assertion is seriously doubt and subject to debate. He equally argued that the mere existence of the EEC has created a sense of unity and solidarity among member states especially in international issues, despite their very real differences.</p> <p>Rodney (1972) provides insight into how the underdevelopment of Africa and the development of Europe are two sides of the same coin. The development of Europe he asserts was possible because of the enormous loss of both human and material resources of Africa to Europe. Historically, this systematic sapping of Africa by Europe occured during the era of slavery and colonialism down to the present neo-colonial period. He shows that the pendulum has always swung against Africa. Thus, Africa’s underdevelopment is diametrically related to European development. His argument is that:</p> <p>The Europeans slave trade and the overseas trade in general had what is known as multiplier effects on Europe’s economy in a very positive sense. This means that the benefits of foreign contacts extends to many areas of European life not directly connected with foreign trade…the positive was true to Africa no only on the crucial sphere technology, but also with regard to the size and purpose of each economy in Africa (Rodney, 1972:118).</p> <p><strong>EU-African Relations and Foreign Direct Investment         </strong></p> <p>According to Lodge (1990), the EU was out to exploit the third world while protecting its own sphere of influence from intruders. She also observed that the ideology behind the wide open. She finally predicted that the Europe in the years to come become a super power. In lodge’s words, “if Europe is defined broadly, its population, territory, wealth, and technological prowess are clearly adequate to such a prospect”. According to lodge, the economic and technological capacity to sustain a single European super power is in place, if it could be mobilized. It is unity, community, governance, and perhaps “will and idea” that now falls short that will do that.</p> <p>Lodge’s analysis of the EU institutions is very incisive, being a former employee of the European commission and of African descent. However, at some point in the work, lodge started to sound emotional though this is understandable having been sacked by the European commission under controversial circumstances.</p> <p>The structure of Euro-Africa relationship was traced as far back as 1949 when the first meetings of the council of Europe, (when European countries were still primarily concerned with their post-war reconstruction) were held (Okigbo, 1967). He concentrated his study on Europe’s relations with Africa as a whole. He was to wind up his study with a call for the establishment of an Africa common market.  Okigbo’s works is interesting because of it’s indepth discussion on the existing relationship between Africa and European community. His observation that the way out of this continued exploitation of African countries by the EEC lies in her formation of a common front to confront the Europeans is worth considering by African leaders. The major problem that has continued to plague Africa’s development efforts is the lack of intra-African economic relations and total dependence of African states on Europe for economic survival.</p> <p>Ake (1978) looked at the issue of Africa’s underdevelopment vis-à-vis Europe’s development. His works are of immense benefit to this study because of the background information they provide on European community and Africa, the exploitative relationship, which they exposed in the Europe-African relations still continues under the present dispensation. If there is any change, it is that instead of the exploitation being done by individual European countries, it is now under the collective strategy of the European Economic Community.</p> <p>Afolabi (1986), in his own contributions on the Nigeria-European relations, traces the historical origins of Nigeria and European Economic Community in which he asserts that the economic interactions between Nigeria and EEC were conducted via the approval of the United Kingdom the erstwhile imperial power, since Britain had not made up her mind to join the EEC. He looked into the existing pattern of economic and relations of the continent of Africa and the community member states. He is of the view that Nigeria and other African countries stand to gain from their cooperation with EU through the Lome Convention in the area of trade, industry and finance. He pointed out that the imbalance in the trade relations between Nigeria and Europe community member states is attributable to Nigeria’s industrial underdevelopment. He called for Nigeria’s stronger tie with the European community especially then that the integration of Europe seemed eminent. In his words. “..Our approach should whilst not undermining the benefits, lay greater emphasis on our relations with the community as an essential element of Nigeria’s foreign policy”. (Afolabi, 1986:54).</p> <p>He advocated for a stronger tie between Nigeria and the European Economic Community as a strategy for Nigeria’s development but he failed to clear the issue of whether actually, the economic relations between Nigeria and the Community has been truly beneficial to Nigeria, and why Nigeria has not been able to overcome her industrial underdevelopment which he reasoned was responsible for the existing imbalance between the two. The lack of industrial development of Nigeria rather than being responsible for the imbalance is a by-product of such relations with the community. It is the manifestation of the exploitation of Nigeria by the community in their economic relations, which leaves her more underdeveloped. However, the work is relevant for the insight it provides on the nature of the African-European community relations with special reference to Nigeria. Also, his recognition of the imbalance that exists in the trade relations between the two continents is in order.</p> <p>Asobie (1983) also examined Nigeria-European community relationship. Apart from explaining Nigeria’s ambivalence in its attitude to the EEC at earlier stage and why such rejection of association was later reversed, it sought to know how the operation of Lome Convention negated Nigeria’s national interest. The reversal of earlier decision represented a gradual surrender to external pressure as well as the working out of dynamics of Nigeria’s political economy.</p> <p>He observed that the association is detrimental to Nigeria’s economic interest because Nigeria’s decision to associate with the EEC is informed more by political rather than economic reasons. But he doubts the political and diplomatic imperative of associating with the EEC as Nigeria’s leadership role in the third world will be damaged due to the fact that such an association brings about decisive tendencies among the third world countries. According to him, such association will only help in disintegrating any solidarity movement amongst them through consolidating Africa’s vertical integration with Europe.</p> <p>Ogunremi (1989) discussed the Euro-African economic relations in general. He did not confine his discussion only to that of European community. He noted that the economics and essentially trade are the central issue, which the relationship between Africa and Europe revolves around. This assertion is in line with Hopkins’ (1986) idea that “trade first brought Europeans to Africa in the fifteenth century and trade has remained the basis of their relations with the continent from then onwards”. But this trade with Europe, he pointed out, has always been disadvantageous to Africa since the earliest trade contact. Hopkins noted that this because the items of trade have always been determined by the Europeans to suit their industrial development interests. For instance, he argues that when industrial revolution occurred in Europe, they felt that trading in slave was no more profitable and therefore initiated the trade in industrial raw materials to feed their industries. He sees this trade relation as being responsible for Africa’s underdevelopment.</p> <p>It is a lamentable but certain fact that Africa has hitherto been sacrificed to our West Indian colonies. She has been confined to a trade, which seems to preclude all advancement in civilization (Ogunremi, 1989:56).</p> <p>He posited that the future relationship between the two continents my depend largely on Europe’s attitude to Africa and so suggested that Europe should use her technological advancement to the advantage of Africa and that the two continents begin to see each other as partners in progress. Finally, he called on African states to integrate and deal with Europe as a body not separately.</p> <p>Arghiri (1972) in his study, made a scholarly exposition of the unequal exchange and transaction between the North and the South. He delved into the issue of international trade transaction between countries of the South specializing in primary commodities and those of the North whose chief exports are manufactured goods. The study portrayed two views. There are those who hold the view that there was a long-term deterioration in the terms of trade of the developing countries, and those of the opposite view, who believe that there was no such deterioration in terms of trade and that actually, there was an improvement in terms of trade of the developing countries.</p> <p>Arghiri supported the view of deterioration but differed as to the causes and mechanism of the deterioration, which for him, are joined in the unequal exchange that takes place between the advanced industrialized countries and the developing countries. He used statistical figures and quantification of empirical data to substantiate his view that the imperialism exploits of the underdeveloped countries are primarily through the instrumentalities of trade rather than through investments and repatriation of profits.</p> <p>On the problems of underdevelopment and instability in Africa using Nigeria as a case study, Klausen (1999) argued that uncontrolled population growth in African continent is the cause of her backwardness. According to him, “The unprecedented high rate of population growth has a considerable effect on the development of Nigeria” (Klausen, 1999:14). Klausen saw the Western European nations through the EU as rendering developmental services to the Nigeria state. He contended that the serious economic problems of Nigeria have prompted the western industrialized countries to take special measures. Nigeria has better access to its markets than other African countries. He argued that the only hindrance Nigeria has in competing effectively in the international trade is her over-reliance on oil and agricultural product instead of manufactured goods.</p> <p>Most literatures such as Nweke (1986); Obiukwu (1987); have also tended to analyze Nigeria’s foreign policy and diplomatic relations in terms of the internal and domestic variables that influence it. However, this tendency is very myopic since domestic factors alone do not shape the external behavior of states in international politics. This is because no state operates in the international political scene in isolation of other states. It is a world of inter-dependence and inter-connectedness.</p> <p>Gambari (1980) saw Nigeria’s foreign policy more as a consequence of the domestic politics than any other factor. He discussed Nigeria’s foreign policy in the first republic and saw the defect in her foreign policy as a result of the conflicts between the various political parties of that period and argued that Nigeria was always sitting on the fence on most issues and that her African posture on independence is a manifestation of the internal contradictions of Nigerian politics. Gambari’s study focused on foreign policy positions of the various political parties in Nigeria’s first republic rather than on analysis of the foreign policy of Nigerian government. Gambari endorsed the principle of “concentric circle”, in Nigeria’s foreign policy objectives, when he was Minister for Eternal Affairs. The principle emphasized Nigerian, African and World interests in that order.</p> <p>In Akinyemi’s analysis of the foreign policy of Murtala/Obasanjo regime, he went into what he referred to as the environmental background to the foreign policy system, which the regime inherited. These were the pro-western nature of Balewa’s government, experiences of The Nigerian civil war, and the reconciliatory nature of the Gowon administration. He noted that, “Murthla /Obasanjo regime had to overhaul Gowon’s foreign policy so as to justify their taking over of power especially as Gowon’s foreign policy exhibited lack of tardiness  in decision taking” (Akinyemi, 1979:153)</p> <p>Aluko (1981) surveyed Nigeria’s foreign policy initiatives with particular reference to the O. A. U. He traced Nigeria’s role in the O. A. U in the first ten years of the organization. He argued that during the first half of the period, Nigeria’s role was not commensurate with her size and economic potentials. She changed from vying for the O. A. U leadership to that of a kingmaker.</p> <p>Obasanjo and Oville (1990) observed that Nigeria’s foreign policy in the years after the unification of Europe in 1992, would take a dramatic  turn. They recounted how the 1957 treaty of Rome, which gave birth of the E. E. C. came about. The duo equally examined Nigeria’s relationship with the E. E. C. and concluded that the impact of the E. E. C on Nigeria is enormous especially as regards foreign policy.</p> <p>The authors believed that Nigeria’s economy would be on a downward trend if she does not consider her national interest in her association with the community. To really benefit maximally from the E. E. C. under the umbrella of A. C. P group of countries, Obasanjo and D. Oville advises that Nigeria should become more strong in her diplomatic bargaining.</p> <p>Discussing the alternative standards in Nigeria’s economic diplomacy, 1960-1985, Asobie (1991) noted that since 1960, successive Nigerian governments have demonstrated an appreciation of linkage between the country’s foreign policy and her economic circumstances. Asobie also looked at how this linkages was conceived and the policies deriving therefrom, however, differed, though not necessarily from regime to regime. Overall from 1960 to 1985, he pointed out three overlapping patterns or strands of strategies, which emerged in the history of Nigeria’s economic diplomacy. These, Asobie noted are:</p> <ol><li>The diplomacy of dependent import substitution – industrialization ( I. S. I) 1960-1974</li> <li>The diplomacy of regional economic integration (R. E. I) 1970-1985, and</li> <li>the diplomacy of the establishment of a New International Economic Order (N. I. E. O) 1973-1985</li> </ol> <p>The then Nigerian Prime Minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, in appreciation of the link between Nigerian’s industrial development and her external relations formulated clearly, the classical dilemma, which confronted Nigeria at the time. He defined the problem in this way.</p> <p>At the present, we lack the necessary capital and technical skill to d3evlop our resources by ourselves alone,… How are we to o9btain help from outside and still keep free from being under the influence of one power bloc or another (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1961:3).</p> <p>The Council of European Union (2005) examined strategies the European Union will take with Africa between now and 2015 to support African efforts to build a future. It is a strategy of the whole of the EU for the whole of Africa. It takes into account regional and country-specific needs and African countries’ national strategies. Its primary aims are the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and the promotion of sustainable development, security and good governance, in Africa.  The strategy builds on important progress made by the Africans themselves. Its core principles are partnership based on international law and human rights, equality and mutual accountability. Its underlying philosophy is African ownership and responsibility, including working through African institutions.</p> <p>Ondrej and Philippe (2006) after bemoaning the state of the African country, appealed to the European Union to help Africa overcome its challenges. According to them, if there are still some reasons for afro-pessimism, they are nourished by worries that many countries in sub-Saharan Africa will not achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. In fact, Africa is the only region in the world where poverty has progressed since 1990. Today, almost one African out of two lives on less than one euro a day. Two out of five do not have access to improved water supply, and the coordination of the common policy on Africa at various levels of intervention. The enlarged European Union is supposed to assist African countries in their fight against poverty. It has to keep its promise to Africans to retain credibility in their eyes.</p> <p>Sven et al (2009) examined EU and the challenges it faces with emerging new actors in the international community and the prospects for European Union development co-operation in the period up to 2020. They noted that in the past 10-15 years, the established development donors in the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) have forged a consensus about what aid is for, where it should be best directed and how it should be managed. With the increasing salience of a variety of new actors in international development, both governmental and nongovernmental, this consensus is being challenged at a time when aid budgets are under threat and when there are other new challenges for development cooperation, not least climate change.</p> <p>Awil (2009) observed that democracy-building in Africa through the mediation of the African diaspora in Europe is not a priority on the agenda of the European Union (EU). According to him:</p> <p>Indeed, it has failed even to gain the political attention of those EU member states where diaspora organizations and institutions can be actively mobilized in democracy-building efforts in Africa. This is primarily because the role that African diasporas play in democracy-building on the continent is an area which has not yet been sufficiently studied. The lack of a solid knowledge base on the subject hinders the EU and its member states from formulating appropriate policies that can be translated into feasible strategic interventions and realizable actions (Awil, 2009:3).</p> <p>He goes further to state that the human resources and strategic potential of the African diaspora in Europe have not been sufficiently harnessed to promote and advance effective, responsible, transparent, accountable and democratic systems of governance in Africa. Over the past five years, the aspect that has received the most policy attention from the EU and its member states has been the size and impact of the financial remittances that the diasporas transfer to their respective homelands. However, the African diasporas also transfer non-financial values which influence the development of their homelands, values that could make a significant contribution to improving the situation on the continent.</p> <p>He is of the view that the Joint Africa-EU Strategic Partnership presents an opportunity for the EU, its member states and their subsidiary development circles to align themselves with the African diaspora.</p> <p>The successful execution of the programme will require a broad spectrum of resourceful actors and stakeholders in development cooperation circles and beyond, both in Africa and in Europe. There are great advantages to working with the African diaspora as potential human agents to translate the Africa-EU Strategic Partnership policy priorities into real outcomes. Diasporas can contribute to democratic governance in much the same way that they currently contribute to economic welfare and development in their home countries. They can do so by making their knowledge, professional experience and expertise available to strengthen the capacity of political institutions in Africa. For the diaspora, democratic governance is critical in creating an enabling environment in the homelands. Creating an enabling environment in the home countries is, in effect, a precondition for sustainable development in Africa, and for engaging the diasporas in the overall development of their respective home countries (Awil, 2009:3-4).</p> <p>Halfdan (2010) examined the view of EU members on New Partnership for Africa’s Development, (NEPAD). According to him, from the outset, the EU welcomed NEPAD as an expression of African leaders’ commitment to building democracy and strengthening good governance. Different EU institutions, including the EU Presidency, the EU Commission, and the European Parliament, issued statements that expressed political support for NEPAD in different multilateral forums, including the G8, the Tokyo International Conference on African Development, the Africa Partnership Forum, and the UN. At a high-level plenary meeting in 2002 on how the international community could support NEPAD, Denmark, which then held the EU Presidency, stated that:</p> <p>the EU is a strong supporter of NEPAD and the promise it holds for African development … The African leaders and people have raised the stakes with the adoption of NEPAD. The international community should be prepared to match this (Moeller, 2002:5).</p> <p>Adebayo (2010) explored the scope and opportunities for Africa to push an international governance reform agenda that will serve its long-term interests of securing the development of the continent and increasing Africa’s voice in the international system. In so doing, he briefly reviewed the roots of the contemporary international governance order, its dysfunctionalities, and the historic case for a new international order that the countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America made between 1960 and 1980. The study also examined the tensions within the contemporary governance architecture, and the rise of new important players in the international system, symbolised by the biggest of them all, China. The growing weight of these new players is already forcing a redistribution of power in the global order that has direct implications for global governance.</p> <p>Therefore, he noted that the Africa-EU dialogue is taking place within a context of global change that concerns both regions, but that neither of them solely or primarily drives. He suggested that it is within this framework that Africa must shape an agenda for global governance reform, which accommodates the collective interests of the countries making up the continent. This paper suggests that Africa’s case for reform may possess important moral dimensions that are worth pursuing, but it also needs to build on argument and strategy much more than morality.</p> <p>Ake (1985) viewed leadership in Africa as one of the injurious imports of the capitalist system of production in Africa. He argued that the capitalist system of production brought into Africa a very serious antagonism between and among leaders in different states of Africa, and consequently upon which there ensued crises among them.</p> <p>Anene and Brown (1981) noted that the colonialist worsen African situation by merging incompatible ethnic nations and also went on to sensitize and fuel ethnic division and differences so as to forestall any possible integration and unity of the people in the state-colonies.</p> <p>Vicker (1993) observes that ethnic conflict occur as a result of colonial power’s arbitrarily drawn frontiers following the 1884/1885 colonial partition of Africa. This stems from the fact that most African states are but amalgamation of different ethnic/national groups who have differences in their historical background, cultural language, ideology and religion.</p> <p>Following literature reviewed, it appears inquiries on EU and Africa’s development either looks at the unequal relationship between the duo or the historical role that EU has played in the underdevelopment of the African continent. This does not help us to understand the role of EU in Africa’s development. Also previous studies do not allow us to see the role trade and FDI have played in EU-African relations. These gaps in literature are what this study seeks to bridge. Filling of these gaps are the main objectives of this study.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Theoretical Framework</strong></p> <p>Most academic work in international relations, especially  involving Africa and Europe are usually analysed either within dependency or centre-periphery theory; or realist theory as the theoretical frameworks of analyses. These frameworks are inadequate for explaining and understanding the role of EU in Africa’s development. This is because these frameworks are descriptive and conservative without putting into consideration the changing nature of international politics.</p> <p>Our analysis in this study will be predicated on the complex interdependence theory, as developed by Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye. This is because we indeed live and grow in an interdependent world. The theory recognize that the various and complex transnational connections and interdependencies between states and societies were increasing, while the use of military force and power balancing are decreasing but remain important. That cooperation between states is bringing about a decline in the use of military force and coercive power in international relations (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/complex_interdependence).</p> <p>According to Nye and Keohane (1977) complex interdependence is based on specific characteristics that critique the implicit and explicit assumptions of traditional international politics (i.e., the superiority of the state and a hierarchy of issues with military force and power the most important leverages in international relations, which traditionally defines political realism in political science). Nye and Keohane, thus, argue that the decline of military force as a policy tool and the increase in economic and <em>other forms of interdependence</em>should increase the probability of cooperation among states. According to Lee (2000) the theory of complex interdependence came out of the changing world during the 1970’s when the realist perspective on international relations was failing to take into account many of the new aspects on interstate relations. Although the global stage setting has continued to change quite remarkably since the original inception of this theory into the study of international relations, the basic principles and assumptions of complex interdependence remain the same.</p> <p>Further, these principles serve as the basis of policy between African states and most of her allies in the last decade, with increased emphases placed on economic interdependence, rather than a military strategy as focused on in the realist perspective practiced during the Cold War. The theory is not only relevant to our analysis but enhances as stated by Okolie (2006:75) our appreciation of cooperative actions among states and facilitates deep understanding of global patterns of interrelationship.

Notable scholars on Nigerian external relations such as Akinyemi, Aluko, Gambari, Birai etc demonstrated the influence of domestic conditions on the country’s attitude and behaviour to other actors in the international system. The influence of domestic politics on Nigeria’s foreign policy was made obvious to the international community on 1st  October, 1960, by the then first Prime Minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa himself in a moving address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. He observed that:</p> <p>Nigeria does not intend to ally itself as a member of routine with any of the ideological power blocs and Nigeria hopes to work with other states for the Progress of Africa and to assist in bringing all other African territories to a state of responsible independence.</p> <p>Given the domestic nature and the country’s size and at the same time natural resources, it was assumed that Nigeria would play a leading role in the continent of Africa. Some scholars even spoke of the country’s “manifest destiny” to lead Africa surrounded by small and weak states.</p> <p>Abubakar, O.S reviewing Gambari said that; the first phase, one of uncertainty and timidity of Nigerian Foreign Policy coincided with the period of the First Republic (1960 – 65). The major issue at that time were the official foreign policy declaration itself; the Anglo Nigerian Defence pact, the Congo Crisis and African Unity; Negotiations for associate status with the European Economic Community (EEC): the Rhodesian Crisis and Common Wealth relations; and the Arab Israeli antagonism and the search for a cohesive policy towards the middle east. Nigeria throughout this period operated a Pro- West foreign policy disposition. The conservative nature in her external relations was dictated by Nigerian Federalism which professes three strong regions with a weak centre. Prime Minister Balewa then had a constitutional authority which was not always matched by the political power needed to override these divergent groups encroachment upon Nigeria’s foreign policy. The coming together of the two parties i.e Northern People’s Congress (NPC) and National Council for Nigerian and Cameroon (NCNC) which formed a coalition government then forced the Balewa government to make adjustment in order to keep the partnership viable.</p> <p>Consequently, Nigerian foreign policy during the 1960 – 65 period was less dynamic than it would have been if the NCNC had been  solely responsible. By the same token, it was far more assertive, Pan Africanist and neutralist especially on the Middle – East than it would have been if the NPC had exclusive control. The need to adjust in order to accommodate the sometimes contrasting views of the governing parties and save the alliance, made Balewa’s foreign policy liable to such criticism as lacking in consistent imagination and dynamism and characterized by Ad – hoc decision making which tended to be contradictory and self – defeating.</p> <p>The second phase of Nigerian Foreign Policy was the period between 1966 – 1975 under which a lot of changes took place at the domestic political level. The Nigerian external relation was marked by active, positive and influential role especially in the continent. The fragile nature of the Federalism was replaced by a stronger centre with 12 states constituting the Federating Unit. The assertion of the military rule under General Yakubu Gowon dramatically changed the dimension of authority Domestic politics and Nigerian Foreign Policy.</p> <p>The discovery of oil boom also assisted in great measure in allowing the country to play more decisive leadership role in World affairs, as it increased the revenue accruing to the Federal government. The previous low keyed, resistant and often apologetic approach to African affairs had to be changed. The aftermath of Biafra experience was also instructive as the country came up with a coherent policy to her fellow African countries. The integrative efforts of Gowon with the establishment of ECOWAS and the financial and moral assistance to neighbouring West African countries were remarkable. Nigeria’s extension of hand of fellowship to the Eastern block countries such as China and Soviet Union was seen as a policy shift from the earlier position. The country played a frontline role in Southern Africa problems by increasing financial and other assistance to the Liberation Movement there. Gowon’s active role in Africa later earned the country the chairmanship of OAU.</p> <p>Similarly, Nigeria led other African countries in breaking diplomatic ties with Israel in the wake of the latter’s hostility against Egypt. The nature of the regime and its domestic economic condition explained fundamentally the drastic change in Nigeria’s diplomatic style under General Gowon. General Gowon was overthrown in a bloodless coup in July, 1975.</p> <p>A momentous shift of Foreign policy position was however achieved under the General Murtala/Obasanjo regime. This is one administration whose foreign policy posture was characterized by dynamism as the regime strove to move the country’s foreign policy to a more truly non – aligned position particularly within the six months of Murtala’s rule. The regime’s bold move to recognize MPLA in Angola and the memorable speech to the OAU extra – ordinary Summit Conference at Addis – Ababa in January, 1976 remains a remarkable turning point. Three main factors have been identified as being responsible for this dynamic posture. The first factor is that of increased revenue due to the oil wealth. The other two factors are the character of the leadership itself and the institutional re-organization of the foreign policy making process that took place during this time.</p> <p>The next phase in the development of Nigerian Foreign Policy came with the return to civilian rule (1979 – 1983). The external policy of the Shagari administration is comparable only to that of the Balewa Era. Some scholars and commentators consider the Second Republic as having “engendered retrogression” in the country’s foreign policy resulting from its Pro – Western policy. For sure, the period of retrogression began during the Obasanjo regime when the country experienced a “return to subservience” The major factor explaining the retrogressive nature of the country’s foreign policy during the period is found in the character of the leadership. The National Party of Nigeria (NPN) was made up of the most aristocratic, conservative businessmen and a sprinkle of academicians of the same mould. Most of them have economic and social links with the elite of the Western World even if at a peripheral level. This among others made it difficult for them to formulate an independent foreign policy which might necessitate occasional disagreement with the Western powers.</p> <p>Moreover, the nature of Nigeria’s mono – cultural economy with its sole dependence on oil was such that by 1979, the country’s level of integration into the World capitalist system by transitional interests was enhanced as represented by the oil companies. Between 1981 – 1982, the country total export had declined considerably by 34.5 percent and the monthly import bill reached the one billion mark just one year after Shagari took over. Invariably, the regime could not keep to its electoral promises to the people. On the foreign arena, the regime could not maintain the momentum of those progressive actions taken since Murtala Mohammed came to power that continued to enjoy the support of the informed elites.</p> <p>Indeed, there was recourse to the old order of passive and reactionary posture in Nigerian Foreign Policy as manifested in the country’s policy on the Chadian Crisis, OAU and ECOWAS. It was abysmal lack of focus and inability of the regime to respond to the various domestic demands that precipitated the collapse of the 2nd Republic with the overthrow of the government by the Buhari led military Junta in December, 1983. The coming to power of this administration was very much welcomed by the Nigerian public. This was largely due to the total disaster of the Shagari administration. The new government was well received more so as it claimed to have been the offshoot of Murtala administration. The administration came with the purpose of restructuring and bringing the economy back to sound footing. It also vigorously sought to institutionalize a new ethic of National leadership based on discipline, public accountability and integrity.</p> <p>There was also more commitment to the polisaro and recognition of the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic. Other policy issues, particularly the expulsion of aliens and the closure of Nigerian borders were received with mixed feelings by the neighboring countries.</p> <p>However, Buhari’s anti – West Posture was remarkable, as it demonstrated its autonomy and status in decision making. Nigeria’s diplomatic relations with such powers as United States and United Kingdom became ruptured. In all these instances, Nigeria demonstrated to the rest of the World that she was not ready to take insults or directive from any country big or small, The regime at the end suffered “Support Erosion” with its human right abuses, a situation which made it easy for it to be overthrown.</p> <p>The Babangida government that succeeded the Buhari regime was described as a Liberal/benevolent military regime especially at its infancy. The administration like its predecessor was committed to economic restructuring which informed its choice of the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP). The programme had adverse effects on the life of Nigerians, and as expected had serious implications on the country’s external relations. The regime’s handling of the bombing of Libya by the USA was heavily criticized so also was the regime’s OIC policy which almost precipitated serious internal upheaval. It was apparent that the government under the guise of economic diplomacy succeeded in playing into the hands of the</p> <p>Western powers as its economic programme could be said to be anything but humane. The failure of Babangida to respect the peoples mandate with the annulment of the June 12 Presidential elections result, after endless political transition led to the demise of the regime.</p> <p>Following the annulment of June 12 presidential election in 1993, the interim government which was put in place by General Babangida on 26th, August, 1993 did not enjoy the support of a wide range of Nigerians. General Sani Abacha’s intervention on 17th November, 1993 was therefore very timely and inevitable given Nigeria’s drift towards anarchy and disintegration.</p> <p>During the Abacha regime, development between China and Nigeria was one of the most prominent aspects of the shift in Nigeria’s foreign policy. At this time Nigeria and China entered into different agreements, which allowed China to become involved in oil production, refurbishment of the long – neglected Nigeria Railway Corporation, the dredging of Seaports at Calabar and Warri and the development of Mass – housing projects. Abacha’s foreign policy thrust shifted to Asia, failing to realize that in a globalized world, aligning Nigeria with Asia alone is inadequate. The political heat from both home and abroad continued until Abacha died on 8th June, 1998.</p> <p>Following the death of Abacha, General Abubakar Abdulsalam (rtd) took over as the Head of State of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He succeeded in conducting a peaceful, free and fair election that finally brought Olusegun Obasanjo as the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Nigerian Armed Forces on May 29, 1999.</p><p> Goodluck Jonathan foreign policy under democratic rule has been underlined by Nigeria’s return to a place of prestige in the International Community.

Political realism believes that politics, like society in general is governed by objective laws that have roots in human nature.</p> <p>The realist school sees international politics in the context defined in terms of power. Realism assumes that the idea of interest is indeed of the essence of politics and is unaffected by the circumstances of time. Charles A. Beared shows how national interest became the priority of diplomacy when he used it to explain and analyze the basis of American foreign policy. The arrival of the theory replaced parochial concept such as “National honour, reason of state or the will of prince, dynastic labour” etc. In terms of its relevance, the theory could be used to explain</p> <p>Nigeria’s foreign policy and domestic politics under Olusegun Goodluck Jonathan civilian administration (2010 – 2015)in terms of actualizing Nigeria’s socio – political and economic interests.</p> <p><strong>1.7 Research Methodology</strong></p> <p>The research adopted the secondary source of data.

Descriptive analysis is an interpretative analysis based on data collection. As regards data analysis, a combination of simple descriptive – analytical and deductive methods was mainly employed.

In many parts of the world, women have few resources or rights and little opportunity to improve their lives. They are restricted in terms of education, ownership of property, monetary return for their work, financial opportunities, and opportunities to influence decision-making at the level of the family and society. Country by country, the lack of resources and opportunities open to women is strongly associated with society-wide poverty or lack of development. Charles Humana (1992), for example, reports that almost all of the countries ranked in the top quintile of wealth provide social and economic equality to women; none of those in the poorest quintile do.</p> <p>This paper reviews the economic literature that touches the role of gender in the economy, with specific focus on issues and challenge that might be expected to be the most critical for overall development in Nigeria.</p> <p>We define what gender equality means; present stylized facts about the current relative status of women and men; and touch on the methodological difficulties encountered in studying this topic. We then present the issues and analyses from studies concerning gender equality and the status of women in both the developed and the less developed worlds. There is wide range in women’s status across countries, just as there is a wide range of differences in the level of economic welfare. In some cases the research allows a look at how a country’s economic development over time is associated with changes in the role of her women.</p> <p>Economic studies of this issue are found in the fields of labor economics, family economics, growth and development economics and political economics. The latter portion of this paper presents explanatory models, and reviews literature on factors that challenge or facilitate gender equality.</p> <p><strong>1.1 Background Of The Study</strong></p> <p>The issue of gender inequality in Nigeria in particular and Africa in general has been debated since the introduction of western formal education during the colonial period. Starting from the late 1950s and early 1960s when many African countries acquired their political independence, this date has taken a new dimension in local as well as international fora.</p> <p>What role do women’s class and gender status play in national development: that question and many others were examined at recent seminar and meeting organized specially to address the issue of gender imbalance in access to polities and education in Nigeria. There were two major conferences in March, 1990. The Jointien conference on education for all, sponsored by several international organizations including the world Bank, UNESCO, etc, and the Mexico world congress on planning and management of educational development also organized by UNESCO<strong>.</strong></p> <p>In Africa, the sixth Regional conference sponsored by UNESCO, with the co-operation of the organization of Africa unity (O.A.U), and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, was held in July, 1991 in Dakar. The problem of uplifting the burden of women, for national development received attention at a recent seminar on women and demographic change in Dakar, Senegal in March, 1993.</p> <p>The seminar was organized by the international union for the scientific study of population (IUSSP) and brought together more than 60 experts from Africa and elsewhere , from the discussions, a consensus was reached that women’s class and gender status have been neglected by both demographers and policy makers interested in population change and that the first step toward getting women’s issues of the agenda of the population and development sector is to improve understanding on how women’s position in society varies across Africa and shapes demographic outcomes. (Emezi, C.E and Ndoh, C.A 1998:181)</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement Of Research Problem</strong></p> <p>The research examined and analyzes the effect of United Nations and the challenges of promoting gender equality in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Aims And Objectives Of Research</strong></p> <p>The research is aimed at achieving the following objectives:</p> <ol><li>To assess the factors that affects gender inequality.</li> <li>To examine the influence of United Nations and the challenges of promoting gender equality in Nigeria.</li> <li>To proffer solutions woman’s empowerment and strengthening development.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4 Significance / Justification Of Study</strong></p> <p>Economists have long tried to understand why some countries are poor and some rich, and why some develop and grow while others remain stagnant. As research has moved from Solow’s growth theories to endogenous growth, we are still unable to explain the huge difference in GDP per capital that exists among countries. Explanations that developed countries have greater technological</p> <p>progress, a higher rate of investment and saving, better education, skill levels and infrastructure leave unanswered the question of where these differences come from (see Weil, 2005). Macroeconomics theories have influenced the World Bank and the IMF policies over the decades as these institutions attempted to help developing countries towards economic growth and development. Easterly (2001) recounts the history of attempted solutions that have repeatedly turned out to be disappointments, a situation he explains as the result of a lack of attention to the incentives that people face in their environments. The literature and its prominent authors are currently moving towards explaining the growth discrepancy between the poor and the rich nations with factors like social infrastructure (Hall and Jones, 1999), values (Guiso et al., 2002), trust (Knack and Keefer, 1997), religion (Barro, 2002;</p> <p>Dollar and Gatti, 1999) or other aspects of the culture (Weil, 2005). These new explanations will increasingly require a better understanding of the roles, status and behavior of a heretofore largely ignored half of the population – women.</p> <p>These new efforts sometimes involve expanding our understanding of what is meant by the concept of development itself. Most prominently, Noble-laureate Amartya Sen (1999) argues that increasing GDP by itself should not be the ultimate goal of efforts to help poor countries. Rather, what aid should hope to maximize are the freedoms associated with wealth: freedom to exchange goods and labor, freedom to make choices and influence one’s life, freedom to live longer, freedom to get an education. He suggest that restrictions on an individual’s right to own property, save, borrow, become educated, make labor contracts or to control the products of one’s own labor would qualify as disincentives to growth, while freedom to exercise these activities would be associated with economic growth. Given that roughly half of the population of any country is female, it is reasonable to postulate that a society’s failure to provide such freedoms or resources to them would be reflected in failures at the macroeconomics level as well.</p> <p>Although the literature exploring such a relationship between the freedoms accorded women and development is still small, interest in this area is growing. Those in grass root development work  generally acknowledge the importance of the status of women in development, believing that these restrictions on freedoms are directly counterproductive for development. The United Nations Millennium Development Goals, for example, include gender issues among the top priorities. United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the World Bank have also done extensive research on gender and development.</p> <p>Generally speaking, however, much of the work in economics has little theoretical interest in women’s welfare per se. Standard economic theories such as those in public choice or welfare economics do not focus on individual characteristics; the individual actor in welfare economics could equally well be a world citizen, a country national, a man or a woman. However, empirical work requires that gender be controlled for, as women’s behavior differs from that of men to such an extent that a single explanatory model is not applicable. An example of this will be seen in the empirical growth studies by Robert Barro.</p> <p>Those writing in the feminist economics tradition challenge the general invisibility of gender in economic studies and urge that it be considered in order to avoid further biased results (Ferber and Nelson 2003). Emphasizing efficiency at the cost of equity, economists shy away from interpersonal utility comparisons. Yet, if the welfare of women is important, we need to identify the separate constraints on women in order to assess how lifting them affects economic choice and development.</p> <p>We need to be aware of cultural issues such as gender restrictions (on both sexes), and changes in them, when analyzing the effect of gender-related issues on development. Blank and Reimers (2003) point out that the standard economic method of focusing on choices under given tastes and constraints tends to simply accept the status quo concerning cultural issues as permanent and unchanging. This raises concern given the large changes in gender roles over the past hundred years.</p> <p>Psychology, sociology, and anthropology give insights on how such tastes and desires are formed.</p> <p>However, the economists tend to be relatively uninformed on the results of other social sciences. Some of the newer fields in economics, such as behavioral economics, take these challenges more seriously. Another example of rising awareness of the need to consider changing social norms and culture is a recent book on economic growth by David Weil (2005), which places considerable emphasis on culture and values.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Theoretical Framework</strong></p> <p>Gender equality (and women’s empowerment) has become one of the central themes in global treaties, covenants and declarations principally due to the understanding that it is a catalyst to clear-cut development strategies which is targeted at poverty reduction, improved living standards, good governance and profitably productive investments that are critical to the creation of an enlarged capacity that provide men and women equal opportunity and unrestrained access to decision-making and policy implementation institutions and processes.</p> <p>Essentially too, African countries have demonstrated some measure of concern about human development problems by initiating specific developmental goals and strategies and accepting the critical role of gender equality or parity in the developmental process. The African Charter on Human and People’s Rights (ACHPR) adopted in 1981; the Women Right Protocol of 2003; the ECOWAS Protocol on Democracy and Good Governance and the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) adopted in 2001 are some of the initiatives that are linked with the Millennium Development Goals and at the same time, a testimony to commendable response in the African continent.</p> <p>Historically, women have comparatively been subjected to marginalization, oppression and injustice both in public and private life. Although the Millennium Declaration underscored the importance of eliminating all forms and shades of discrimination, exploitation, social harassment and gender bias as well as all situations that encourage the infringement of the rights of women through government policies and decisions, traditional and customary practices, cultural prejudices and religious extremism, a lot more commitment and a pragmatic approach that will translate into concrete actions are desirable around the globe, particularly in Africa. Parity between boys and girls in primary school enrolment has, for instance, been achieved in most regions of the world, except sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. Gender disparity in tertiary education is also still tilted in favour of men in Africa and women access to paid employment that is secured in the light of income and social importance is still very low when juxtaposed with that of men in all sectors including agriculture. However, women’s access to political decision-making, especially in terms of their share of seats in the parliament has gradually and steadily increased globally.</p> <p>Today, it is instructive to note that due to the realization of the gap created by the marginalization and social injustice against women and the missing link in the developmental agenda by the limited access to existing opportunities in virtually all sectors of the socio-political and economic setting, women are gradually coming into public fore. A plausible explanation for this trend and development is the thinking that one of the indicators of the progress and development of any nation is the position of women in that society (Akpoveta, 2008:191; Thompson and Hickey 2012). It therefore follows that women are seen to represent a tool for positive change, an end that depends on the level of access to the opportunity for actualizing their potentials and talents.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Research Methodology</strong></p> <p>The research adopted the secondary source of data.

Chapter four concerns the intervention proper, and there I will look into the political and military behaviour of ECOWAS to highlight what I aim to show are gross failures.  The concluding chapter assesses the relative performance of ECOWAS in two subsequent interventions, in Guinea-Bissau and in Sierra Leone.  This I do to highlight that ECOWAS has not learnt sufficient lessons from Liberia, and in actual fact went on to make the same mistakes many years later.</p> <p><em><strong>1.3 Clarification of Terms and Limitations of Study</strong></em></p> <p>It is of importance to note that in this dissertation I deal with the entirety of ECOWAS as an organisation, as opposed to limiting myself to dealing with the states that officially partook in the military intervention in Liberia.  The term ‘Community’ is used throughout interchangeably with ‘ECOWAS’.  It is also of note that the term ‘West Africa’ always refers to ECOWAS member states.</p> <p>I use the term ‘failure’ to indicate performances of the organisation that contravened its intended purposes.  For example, when a member state breaches an ECOWAS protocol, I state that to be failure.  Such failures I sum together to evaluate the performance of ECOWAS in its relationship with Liberia.  It is vital to understand that Community members followed differing policies; hence performance appraisals are gauged by the organisation’s stated aims, as opposed to gauging them against any one state’s intentions.</p> <p>Finally, it is highly important to be aware of the fact that this dissertation merely deals with the first Liberian civil war (1989-1996).</p> <p><em><strong>1.4 Research Questions</strong></em></p> <p>The first question I seek to answer is how did the formation of ECOWAS lead to member states being able to act out policies on their own accord?  This question relates to the problem of intra-ECOWAS policy incoordination.  As member states contributed to the conflict in Liberia in a disparate way, it is vital to consider how such failures were allowed to occur.  To answer this it is imperative to consider the protocols that ECOWAS was built on.   Secondly, I question the legality of the conflict, and ask whether ECOWAS contravened the UN Charterand the Liberian peoples’ right to self-determination.   This question concerns some of the legal aspects of the conflict and seeks to examine whether or not ECOWAS contravened the UN Charter by intervening in the Liberian conflict.  It also seeks to examine whether ECOWAS barred the Liberian people from their right to self-determination.  Thirdly, I examine issues of bias and ask if Nigeria or ECOWAS biased, and if so, how this affected the conflict.  It is important to question the bias of Nigeria (as a supposed regional hegemon), as well as that of ECOWAS.  Bias by either party would result in an ‘unnatural’ resolution of the conflict, as well possibly prolonging it and hence causing further damage.  Finally I question if ECOWAS learnt sufficient lessons from the case of Liberia so as to excuse it from its failures.  This I perform by briefly investigating the performances by ECOWAS in the conflicts of Sierra Leona and Guinea Bissau.   The aim of this is to inquire as to whether or not ECOWAS learned from the mistakes that it had made in Liberia, as an improvement would possibly pardon some of its earlier mistakes, if it has managed to evolve into a more effective organisation.</p> <p><em><strong>1.5 Methodology and Potential Challenges</strong></em></p> <p>Throughout this dissertation I predominantly rely on secondary sources, including books, journal articles, official reports, and news articles (both online and print-based).  I also make use of primary sources such as treaties, protocols and election results.  Such documents are bound to be liable to disparate interpretation, hence I utilise secondary sources in conjunction so as to provide more balanced analyses.  The vast majority of this dissertation draws on qualitative research, although I do supplement this with portions of quantitative data from organisations such as Human Rights Watch and the US Energy Information Administration when necessary.</p> <p>My primary research is limited to utilising such documents as exemplified above, as any further primary research such as conducting a widespread opinion poll of the Liberian population would be immensely time-consuming and costly.</p> <p>There is a danger in that some sources may be biased in favour or contra ECOWAS, as some have been written by participants of the Liberian conflict, hence I would be reticent to accept all such sources without juxtaposing them with similar sources by different authors.</p> <p><em><strong>1.6 Current Research</strong></em></p> <p>The following literature review is of course not indicative of the entirety of the literature available on the topic, but is rather an attempt to portray how the topic has been approached in the past, and how such approaches have faltered or succeeded in their contribution to the discussion.</p> <p>Via this review, I aim to highlight the chief gaps in the current debate; some of which I intend this dissertation to contribute research to.  The issue of Liberia has caught the world’s attention intermittently over the past two decades, but the Tuareg uprising in Mali has sparked a resurgence of debate about the validity and usefulness of military interventions in African states (BBC, 2012), particularly, those states that occupy the western region of Africa.  This renaissance of discussion is often fixated on the merits of the concept of ‘allowing’ African states to deal with African matters themselves, as opposed to inviting or submitting unto non-African states for support.</p> <p>Molnár (2008: 55) argues that ECOMOG is a “viable solution for West African problems”, adding that “its importance to handle regional crisis cannot be denied” (2008: 61).  It does seem undeniable that ECOMOG (and by extension ECOWAS), plays a key role in conflicts in the region (simply because it exists), but this does not inherently define its role as a “viable solution”.  Molnár (2008: 60) admits the various contentious issues surrounding the involvement of ECOWAS, such as the “prolongation of the war itself”, but does not seem to concede that such results are massively damaging to a state (HRW, 1997).  Molnár (2008: 61) concludes by arguing that “it [ECOMOG] has built the basis for further developments to create a viable state in Africa”.  This ambiguous statement purports all the hallmarks of eurocentrism, and disappointingly, the author offers no clear definition of what exactly a “viable” solution looks like, though she does offer the means to that solution: ECOMOG.  The approach by Molnár seems to lack any clear methodology, and she crassly highlights events that are pertinent to the argument being made, whilst at the same time spuriously disregarding vital facts such as ECOMOG’s cooperation with militant groups, hence disallowing a balanced analysis.</p> <p>Khobe (2000) too is supportive of ECOWAS, praising the organisation in its role in the conflict, stating that “…[ECOMOG] is a positive security development requiring some finetuning”, and that it “successfully…restored functional state structure in Liberia”.  It may be stated that the development of ECOWAS is conducive to the state of intra-African relations, but his second declaration is very susceptible to criticism indeed.  What he does not mention directly is that it took seven years for a long enough lull in violence so as to allow elections, and a further six before Liberia would be at peace after the second civil war, and only after the UN had intervened.  The validity of the argument that Khobe (2000) purports falls flat furthermore as questions of bias arise, due to his being Commander of ECOMOG in its mission in Sierra Leone.  He describes the ECOMOG mission in Liberia as one which sought to “reinstate law and order” by defeating the “drug addicted combatants”.  The fact is that ECOMOG itself was committing acts of violence and other forms of criminality, as highlighted by Berman and Sams (2003) as well as Horvitz and Catherwood (2006), who at the very least partially nullify the praise Khobe (2000) so unapologetically dispatches.  Furthermore, the methodology used certainly lacks any scientific rigour.  Frequently ascribing acts of criminality unto rebels, he seems to lack or at least cite any evidence.  Whilst he continuously sensationalises the topic, using the term “anarchy” throughout; he manages to conveniently disregard the severity of damage that ECOWAS caused to Liberia.</p> <p>Khobe (2000), Molnár (2008), Jenkins (2005), Gberie (2003) and a plethora of other authors make their analyses based merely on the parties that contributed to ECOMOG.  This is why I argue that the discussion vis-à-vis this topic is severely lacking, and hence my dissertation seeks to consider the entirety of the Community in its relationship with Liberia, and how said relationship affected that particular state.  Although Gberie (2003: 147) treats the case of Liberia just by considering ECOMOG, he does sustain throughout his argument that ECOMOG, although well intentioned, was a failure; “[a] heroic failure”.  It is clear though that Gberie (2003) could have gone much further in his analysis had he considered ECOWAS and not just ECOMOG.</p> <p>Although the literature in my avenue of investigation is limited, there is more than enough evidence to sustain my position throughout this dissertation.  Particularly useful is the paper by Mortimer (1996) which deals with the francophone states’ involvement (or lack thereof) in Liberia, with a specific focus on Senegal.  Mortimer (1996: 306) describes how the “political consensus so imperative for success” lacked prior to Senegalese involvement, but even remained “elusive over the period of direct Senegalese participation”.  Much like Gberie (2003), Mortimer (1996) simply does not seem to draw the various issues together to finally and conclusively show that ECOWAS failed Liberia.</p> <p>Aoi (2011) highlights the evidence that indicates that Nigeria was a highly biased actor within ECOWAS, a position shared by Adeleke (1995), who provides a highly relevant account of the Nigerian role within ECOWAS.  Adeleke (1995: 591) explains that “Nigeria orchestrated the formation of ECOMOG”, a widely supported theory, including by Aoi (2011) and Nweke (2010).  Though this would appear true to some extent, it is a drastic oversight to ignore the reality that many Community members were apathetic, and hence the balances and checks that should have been enacted against Nigeria simply were not, as shown by Mortimer (1996), and yet other states even sponsored and helped instigate the war in Liberia, as argued by Huband (1990).  Adeleke (1995) does draw attention to this, but does not ascribe such a failure directly to ECOWAS.</p> <p>Adeleke (1995: 593) seems to hold an ambiguous position with regards to his views on ECOMOG, arguing that it would be a “fatal error” for West African states to rely on ECOMOG as a counter-insurgency tool; but does not heavily criticise the organisation.  Adeleke (1995) also states that to merely focus on the legality of the conflict is to ignore the reality of the violence, a similar position to that of Molnár (2008).  Both authors discount the usefulness of a legal appraisal, yet both seem to be unaware that humanitarian causes were certainly not of chief concern for ECOWAS, as shown by Jenkins (2005).</p> <p>The work of Jenkins (2005) is particularly pertinent as he conducts a legal assessment of the ECOMOG intervention, usefully showing that human rights were not a priority.  Though the work is beneficial, it is merely so with regards to an analysis of ECOWAS and its position in situ of a UN contingent.  Jenkins (2005) supports the intervention as it conforms to Nanda’s (1998: 827) framework for the “validity of humanitarian intervention”.  The framework is a lens with which to analyse a conflict and decide whether or not a humanitarian intervention is legal.  Whilst Nanda’s overall methodology and research appears sound, the arrogance of purporting a legal framework based on such ethnocentric thought is clearly questionable, particularly considering Jenkins (2005) uses it to deliberate as to whether or not the intervention was legal.</p> <p>Despite my opposition to some of Jenkins (2005) methods, I do utilise his paper as it is a useful legal appraisal, as long as its inherent eurocentrism is kept in mind.  In this dissertation I build on the work of the likes of Gberie (2003), Adeleke (1995), Aoi (2001), and others, in an attempt to disprove the likes of Molnár (2008) and Khobe (2000), whilst attempting to avoid the traps of ethnocentrism as succumbed to by the likes of Jenkins (2005) and Nanda (1998).  I aim to unite various bodies of evidence to show that ECOWAS, as a sub-regional organisation, failed Liberia.</p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF ECOWAS IN THE FIRST LIBERIAN CRISIS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF ECOWAS IN THE FIRST LIBERIAN CRISIS", "id": 44}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>The Nigeria and India Trade and others Relationship</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The establishment of the Diplomatic House in Nigeria in 1958 (two years prior to Nigerian independence) by India laid the foundation for what was to become solid, warm and concrete bilateral relations between India and Nigeria. The subsequent diplomatic and commercial visits between officials of the two countries crystallised and concretised their cooperative ties regarding political, economic and socio-cultural issues. This paper examines the politico-diplomatic, socio-cultural and economic relations between India and Nigeria. Using a historical approach, the paper argues that although in economic terms the balance of trade is in favour of Nigeria due to increasing importation of Nigeria’s crude oil into India, Indian investment activities in Nigeria have exemplified what might be termed an unequal relationship in which India has an edge over Nigeria. Nevertheless, in view of the magnitude of the cordial relations between the two countries, their development potentials and some socio-political and cultural commonalities, they stand a very good chance of further solidifying and enriching their interactions with regard to several important issues, such as the development of democratic institutions and the redefinition of economic relations between the two states. This, the paper argues, would not only strengthen their political and economic relations, but also bring mutual benefits.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>The bilateral relations between the Republic of India and the Federal Republic of Nigeria have considerably expanded in recent years with both nations building strategic and commercial ties.</p> <p>Oil-rich Nigeria stated recently that India has replaced the United States as its largest crude importer 20 – 25 percent of India’s domestic oil demand. India, however, now purchases some 30% of Nigeria’s daily crude production which currently hovers around 2.5 million barrels. With bilateral oil trade valued at US$10 billion, Indian oil companies are also involved in oil drilling operations in Nigeria and have plans to set up refineries there.</p> <p>1.1 Background Of The Study</p> <p>Trade between Nigeria and India nowadays is strategically becoming important and of global considerations because of the increasing need of Nigeria’s crude oil by India and India’s pharmaceutical products by Nigeria. This has significantly boomed bilateral trade relations between Nigeria and India and again expected to further and enhance trade relations between the two countries. Nigeria is now the largest trading partner of India in the whole African continent, because it is the largest market for India’s exports and India also is Nigeria’s second largest trading partner in the whole world (Kabiru &amp; Dilfraz, 2014). The Nigeria’s exports is mostly covered by crude oil which constitutes 95% of the total exports of the country, out of which India patronized 11% of these crude oil exports (Rupa, Saikat, &amp; Aayush, 2010). In addition there are so many agreements that are still been put in place in order to increase supply of crude oil to India from Nigeria in order to help India meet its energy security (requirements). In 2000 there was an agreement between India and Nigeria as per the content of the agreement, Nigeria will be supplying crude oil to India at the rate of 1 20,000 barrels per day and hydro-carbon of 6 MT (Harshe, 2002). In addition to this Nigeria exports cotton, wood, cashew nuts, gum Arabic, pearls, rubber to India while India’s exports to Nigeria is made up of Pharmaceuticals and drugs, wood products, transport equipment, textiles materials, chemicals, plastic and machineries. Trade between Nigeria and India have since 1999 been increasing with trade balance in recent years been in favour of Nigeria (Sulaiman, 2009). Presently now the nature of Nigeria and India trade relation is dominated by commodity trade. India as a country with the growing service sector will now look for other areas to trade with Nigeria in order to boost their trade relation, and help India narrow the current trade imbalance/deficit with Nigeria. (Rupa, Saikat, &amp; Aayush, 2010), have identified the service sectors in Nigeria that requires immediate Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) attention, these are Oilfield services, Health care, Information technology, and Agro based. These sectors of the Nigerian economyif properly look into with huge amount of investment by India as one of the worlds leading service provider will help India in narrowing it trade deficit or imbalance with Nigeria. The rationale behind this study is to establish trade complementarily and similarities between Nigeria and India in order to explore, establish and investigate the commodities of their trade having comparative advantage and those having comparative disadvantage. The study of Nigeria and India trade complementarily and similarities is very much important because of the just recent booming commodity trade between the two countries. Over the last one and half decade the trends in Nigeria and India trade for both import and export has risen which again necessitate the rise in their total trade, and with increased in the number of group of commodities that are being traded between the two nations, the intensity of their trade has become very much significant, as their import, export and total trade intensities are found to be high in these days (Kabiru &amp; Dilfraz, 2014[1]). As a result of the recent rise in India and Nigeria trade with accompanying increase in the number of commodities or sectors traded and the high trade intensity the study centred on exploring complementarily and similarities of trade among them.</p> <p>1.2 Objective of Study</p> <p>1. To examine the trade relationship and other relation between Nigeria and India.</p> <p>2. To examine the relationship between International Trade and Economic Development.</p> <p>3. To evaluate the disadvantages of International Trade.</p> <p>4. To study the importance of International Trade in the World.</p> <p>1.3 Significance of Study</p> <p>The study reviews bilateral trade relation and other relation between Nigeria and India and how it led to improved and economic growth of the both country. However this study will contribute to the growing body of knowledge in globalization and its linkage with trade policy and will therefore aid researchers who might want to carry out research in related areas.</p> <p>1.4 Scope and Limitation</p> <p>The study examines the linkage between Nigeria and India trade relationship It is also limited in part to the information available from books, journals, books and internet resources.</p> <p>1.5 Research Methodology</p> <p>For the development of this work and its relevance or contribution to existing works, Articles, text books were consulted. Data which contributes to the development of this research was also gathered.</p> <p>This research work will make use of historical research method. Hence, findings from secondary sources are sourced; the secondary sources include written documents such as government publications, documentaries and newspapers. Added to these are descriptive accounts of experts on bilateral trade relation and  other relation between Nigeria and India. Desk study will also be made with those considered authorities in the field of history, political science and international relations to complement the other sources. Furthermore, this research work depends largely on archival materials both online and offline. Official publications cited on the websites will also be used. Books, journal articles, conference proceedings, seminar papers and finally other related publications will be used in gathering secondary information for this research.</p> <p>1.6 Literature Review</p> <p>Detailed and historical validation has proved that international trade affects economic growth positively by stimulating capital accumulation, industrialization, technological progress and institutional development specifically increased imports of capital and intermediate products, which are not available in the domestic</p> <p>market may induce the productivity of the manufacturing sector (Lec, 1995).</p> <p>More active participation in the international market by promoting exports will lead to competition and trade improvements in terms of productivity (Wagner, 2007).</p> <p>Before the 1960s, research in trade effects was actually limited to a few specific countries, with the development of econometrics, however, many complicated methods based on a mathematical model were introduced to analyse the impact between trade and economic growth. So far, opinion has been divided into two categories. One focuses on the causality relationship between international trade and economic growth to examine whether economic growth is propelled by international trade or the other way round. The other mainly discusses the contribution of foreign trade to economic growth.</p> <p>The OECD (2003) studies the impact of trade on the average income per population. The result revealed that elasticity of international trade was 0.2 which was statically significant Maizel’s (1963) investigated the impact of international trade on economic growth using a rank correlation analysis among developed countries. The results of the study showed a positive relationship between international trade and economic growth.</p> <p>Kavousssi (1984), after studying 73 middle and low income developing countries found out that the higher rates of economic growth was strongly correlated with higher rates of export growth. He revealed that there exist a positive correlation between exports and economic growth for both middle and low income countries but the effects tend to diminish according to the level of development. Balassa (1986) and Dollar (1992) argued that outward oriented developing economies achieve more rapid growth than inward oriented developing ones. Sachs and Warner (1995) construct a policy index to analyse economic growth rate and found</p> <p>that the average growth rate in the period after trade liberalization is significantly higher than in the period before liberalization.</p> <p>Baldwin (2003) demonstrated persuasively that countries with few trade restriction achieve more rapid economic growth than countries with more restricted policies. As poverty will be reduced more quickly through faster growth, poor countries could use trade liberalization as a policy tool. Trade liberalization reduces relative</p> <p>price distributions and allows those activities with a comparative advantage to expand and consequently foster economic growth. Poor countries tend to engage in labour – intensive activities due to an over abundance labour supply.</p> <p>Thus the removal of trade openness measures seem to be positively associated with GDP growth – the more open the economy, the slower the growth rate. On the other hand, trade restrictions or barriers are associated with reduced growth rates and social welfare and countries with higher degree of protectionism, on average, tend to grow at a much slower pace than countries with fewer trade restrictions. This is because tariffs reflects additional direct cost that producers have to absorb, which could reduce output and growth.</p> <p>Oyejide (1997) also points out the impact of restrictive measures was to produce a large anti-export bias in the African countries. More specifically, restrictions on imports translate effectively into a tax on exports by making import substitution effectively more profitable they increase barriers in these countries by promoting intense economic activity via employment and income to many impoverished people.</p> <p>Ann Harrison‟s (1991) study makes a synthesis of previous empirical studies between openness and the rate of GDP growth comparing the results from cross section and panel estimations while controlling for country effects. The study concluded that on the whole, correlations across openness measure seem to be positively associated with GDP growth – the more open the economy, the higher the growth rate or the more protected the local economy.</p> <p>Khan and Zahler (1985) assert that trade can promote growth from the supply side, but if the balance of payments cost reduces the availability of imported inputs which enter the product of exports, thus forcing exporters to use expensive imports of doubtful quality.</p> <p>In a 1998 study of the role of trade and trade policy in achieving sustained long term growth in African countries, Dani Rodrik (1998) concluded that high levels of trade restriction have been an important obstacle to export performance and growth. He contends that the reduction of these restrictions can be expected to result in significantly improved trade perofamcance in the region.</p> <p>Fraikel and Roman (1999) and Irwin and Tevio (2002) in their separate and independent studies suggested that countries that are more open to trade tends to experience higher growth rates and per capital in income than closed economy Klanow and Rodriguez – Clare (1997) need used general equilibrium model to</p> <p>establish that the greater number of intermediate input combination results in productivity gain and higher output, despite using same capital and labour input which exhibit increasing return to scale.</p> <p>Ghezakos (1973) examines the effect of export instability on economic growth in18 developed and 50 less developed countries separately. The growth rate of export proceeds has a positive effect in explaining the growth rate of real per capita income. Michaely (1977) focuses attention on correction between the rate of growth of export and GNP. Michaely finds that the correlation between rates of growth of the economy is particularly strong among the countries with successful growth experience. Balassa (1978) in his study of eleven countries that have an established industrial base discovers that the positive correlation between export growth and the GDP growth will provide indication of the total effects of exports on economic growth. Shuchin Yang of the World Bank Development institute also maintains that exports are the major dynamic factor in determining</p> <p>the level of general economic activity in most primary exporting countries. He also argues that if the developing countries do not develop their export, it might mean slow economic growth (Shuchin 1979). Similarly, Bairam (1988) estimates the model for a large sample of developed countries and arrived at the conclusion that the growth performance of a country is a function of the values of its income elasticity of both export and imports.</p> <p>In the same vein, Perraton (1990) solves the model for 59 developing countries for the period between 1970 and 1984 and report that the model provides a good fit. For almost one half of the sampled countries. This study also suggests that a country growth performance depends on income elasticity of both exports and imports.</p> <p>Lin and Li (2002) examined the contribution of feign trade to China‟s economic growth and found that the previous studies on this subject underestimated the contribution of exports to GDP growth by over looking the indirect impacts of exports on domestic consumption, investment, government expenditures and imports. They proposed a new estimation method and found that a ten percent increase in exports resulted in a one percent increase in GDP in the 1990s in China, when both direct and indirect contributions are considered. In another study, Wah (2004) reported for the past four decades (1961-2000), the Malaysian economy grew at an impressive average rate of 6.8% per annum. The rapid growth was attributed, in part, to the tremendous success in the export-oriented industrialization policy.</p> <p>In Nigeria some authors had examined the performance of foreign trade and economic growth. For instance, Oyejide (1974), using Nigeria, as a laboratory test ground that an increase in export proceeds could lead to an expansion.</p> <p>Ogbokor (2001), investigated the macroeconomic impact of oil exports of oil exports on the economy of Nigeria. Utilizing the popular OLS technique, he observed that economic growth reacted in a used in the study. He also found that 10% increase in oil exports would lead to 5.2% jump in economic growth. He</p> <p>concluded that export-oriented strategies should be given a more practical support. Oviemuno (2007), looks at international trade as an engine of growth in developing countries taking Nigeria (1960-2003) as case study, he uses four important variables which are export/import, inflation and exchange rate. The results shows that Nigeria exports value does not act as an engine of growth in Nigeria.</p> <p>(Atoyebi, Adekunjo, Edun and Kadiri (Sep-Oct. 2012), “Foreign Trade and Economic Growth In Nigeria An Empirical Analysis”, IOSR Journal of Humanities and Social Science (JHSS) ISSN: 2279-0837, ISBN: 2279-0845.

The African philosopher must get ready to examine the old controversy of epistemology. Rationalism  and Empirical; one of the most recent problems that seem to be militating against  progress  in African philosophy today is the ontological status of African Epistemology. K.C. Anyanwu has argued that “the basic problem of any philosophy is epistemology or the theory of knowledge, that is the method which the mind must follow in order to arrive at the trust worthy knowledge of reality. Epistemology provides the basic premises with which other problems, namely metaphysics, religion, moral political and aesthetic doctrines can be approached”.2 Anyanwu therefore places knowledge as prior to being.</p> <p>This is however a centesian way of philosophizing which has randomly been condemned by Ukagba in his unpublished doctoral dissertation (1993)3.  For Ukagba, being is always  prior to knowledge or else we fall into Reductio Absandum, knowledge is the knowledge of somebody, a being.

Since the research concerns Africans, it should be limited to how the African conceives the nature of his knowledge, his community knowledge and in the last analysis the ultimate knowledge. However, when necessary reference can also be made to western knowledge as ways of comparing and contrasting</p> <p><strong>1.4   PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The first purpose here is to bring stability in the various conceptions and notion about how the African knows the things he clams to know.</p> <p>Secondly, it is also our intention to show that any attempt to approach African theory of knowledge from the ambit of western Rationalism and Emperialism, will be a fruitless exercise.</p> <p>Finally, it is also our intention to emphasis once again the relevance of metaphysics albeit African ontology as the only condition sine quo non for African Epistemology. With these three purposes in mind, it will become easier to focus properly on the nature of African theory of knowledge.</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong>   <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The importance of this research centers on the present need to put the perception of the African man in proper perspective. Having been beaten out of ontological psychological and economic shapes, due to centuries of colonialism, exploitation and humiliation. It becomes necessary to recover the authentic African, the basis of his knowledge.4 The inter­­-relatedness and limit of this knowledge will go a long way towards understanding the ‘being’ of the African.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong>   <strong>METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>Our methodology  shall follow a gradually  unfolding of ‘being’ through exposing, analyzing  classifying, synthesizing and evaluating its part in its entire ramification  since the nature of African epistemology is not yet clear to all and sundry. It therefore becomes imperative that it should be exposed first before analyzing. The analytical method will enable us to clarify the various concepts like truth. We shall be making us of such concepts truth, wisdom, e.t.c in this research essay.</p> <p>Equally through the synthetic method, we shall seek together the various views expressed so far with regards to the nature of African Epistemology.

LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The researchers’ scope is going to be African conception of knowledge.

BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY Aristotle many years ago asserted that it is the nature of man to know: in other words, every man seeks to know. In fact, philosophical activity started out of the spirit of wonder when men were no longer satisfied with the mythological explanation of reality. It was their curiosity that sparked off this enormous discipline man is awed by the stand back of mystery of the universe. Man stand back and ask himself question in order to understand the universe.  Man has ever been in search of the knowledge of the world. What is knowledge, what is its nature and scope, are questions that have attracted philosophers from various orientation or schools of thought. The western philosophical tradition has been divided sharply on what constitutes the source of knowledge namely: Rationalism and Empiricism. Unfortunately, this controversy has led to dualism in knowledge and consequence a bi-fraction of man should be considered as a metaphysical unit. Against this extremism in knowledge, African proposes another criterion of acquiring knowledge. Anyanwu has correctly observed that: ……any appeal to empirical and rational methods has no meaning and relevance unless we know the basic assumption about the African cultural reality we want to know1 The Africans as human being following the metaphysical imperative of human nature equally want to know, what is the nature of this knowledge? How do we come to know the things we claim to know? Does consciousness constitute a philosophical data, without which his life cannot begin in the first place? It is in light of the above question that we have decided to carry out a research titled “knowledge in Traditional African Perspective”. 1.2. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM From time immemorial, knowledge and what ever constitutes its nature have been a topical issue and a problematic one in philosophical circle. The problem of knowledge arose in the past, more often than not, as a result of philosophers. Inability to seek for the unity of experience. This in no doubt led to the unfortunate controversy between Empiricism and Rationalism. Since the advent of African professional mode of philosophizing. The African philosopher must get ready to examine the old controversy of epistemology. Rationalism  and Empirical; one of the most recent problems that seem to be militating against  progress  in African philosophy today is the ontological status of African Epistemology. K.C. Anyanwu has argued that “the basic problem of any philosophy is epistemology or the theory of knowledge, that is the method which the mind must follow in order to arrive at the trust worthy knowledge of reality. Epistemology provides the basic premises with which other problems, namely metaphysics, religion, moral political and aesthetic doctrines can be approached”.2 Anyanwu therefore places knowledge as prior to being. This is however a centesian way of philosophizing which has randomly been condemned by Ukagba in his unpublished doctoral dissertation (1993)3.  For Ukagba, being is always  prior to knowledge or else we fall into Reductio Absandum, knowledge is the knowledge of somebody, a being. The being who must cognize must exist first before the act of cognition and this is why Ukagba asserts that ontology  or metaphysics comes before Epistemology. We shall examine the premises of these different positions in this research in order to find where the truth lies. 1.3 SCOPE OF THE STUDY In the scope of this study, we shall seek to limit ourselves to those areas, which will enable ‘en bloc’ give the research a justifiable treatment. Since the research concerns Africans, it should be limited to how the African conceives the nature of his knowledge, his community knowledge and in the last analysis the ultimate knowledge. However, when necessary reference can also be made to western knowledge as ways of comparing and contrasting 1.4   PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The first purpose here is to bring stability in the various conceptions and notion about how the African knows the things he clams to know. Secondly, it is also our intention to show that any attempt to approach African theory of knowledge from the ambit of western Rationalism and Emperialism, will be a fruitless exercise. Finally, it is also our intention to emphasis once again the relevance of metaphysics albeit African ontology as the only condition sine quo non for African Epistemology. With these three purposes in mind, it will become easier to focus properly on the nature of African theory of knowledge. 1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY The importance of this research centers on the present need to put the perception of the African man in proper perspective. Having been beaten out of ontological psychological and economic shapes, due to centuries of colonialism, exploitation and humiliation. It becomes necessary to recover the authentic African, the basis of his knowledge.4 The inter­­-relatedness and limit of this knowledge will go a long way towards understanding the ‘being’ of the African. 1.6   METHODOLOGY Our methodology  shall follow a gradually  unfolding of ‘being’ through exposing, analyzing  classifying, synthesizing and evaluating its part in its entire ramification  since the nature of African epistemology is not yet clear to all and sundry. It therefore becomes imperative that it should be exposed first before analyzing. The analytical method will enable us to clarify the various concepts like truth. We shall be making us of such concepts truth, wisdom, e.t.c in this research essay. Equally through the synthetic method, we shall seek together the various views expressed so far with regards to the nature of African Epistemology. In the last analysis, we shall evaluate the nature of African Epistemology and other theories. These various methodologies will help in presenting our research in scientific light. 1.7. LIMITATION OF STUDY The researchers’ scope is going to be African conception of knowledge. We will however, limit ourselves to the conception of truth, wisdom, what is knowable and that which is not knowable, amongst others in the African context. One major limitation of this essay is the non-viability of recent literature on the issue under discourse.   REFERENCES AND NOTES E.A. Ruch and K.C.

The name Nigeria was first suggested in an article for the Times that the several British protectorates on the Niger be known as Nigeria1. The history of Nigeria as it is today goes back more than two thousand years. The earlier history of its peoples is contained in myths and legend, for north only, where the Kanuri and Hausa came into contact with the Arabs there any records noticed before the nineteenth country. One can say. However, reconstruct something of the history of Africa or Nigeria political division from archaeological research, which has greatly advanced in the last decades.2</p> <p>Although Nigeria was the creation of Western ambitions and rivalry in West Africa; it is erroneous to believe that its peoples had little history contacts before its own boundaries were negotiated by Britain, France and Germany at the turn of the twentieth century. The Nigeria state contained not just a multiplicity of ethnic groups, but also a number of great Kingdoms that had evolved complex system of government devoid of European influence.3 The great Kingdom of Kanem-Borno, had a known history of more than a thousand years. The Sokoto Caliphate which for nearly a hundred years before its defeat by British had ruled most of the Savannah of Northern Nigeria; the Benin and Ife Kingdoms had become famous in art as amongst the most accomplished in the world. It is evident that the Empire of Oyo was once the most powerful of the States of the Guinea Coast. The Niger Delta (City States) had tremendously grown in response to European demands for slaves and later palm oil. On the other hand the Igbo-speaking peoples were known for the famous Igbo- Ukwu bronzes and terracotta’s. Before 1900, the diverse groups had in one way or the other through trade and war been in contact with each other4.</p> <p>The Federal Republic of Nigeria covers an area of 570,000 square Kms and according to the last census has a population of over 150,000,000 people. The coastline stenches for 800 km from Badagry in the West of Calabar in the East, which includes the Bights of Benin and Bonny. The borders are contiguous with the Republic of Benin to the West, Niger Republic to the North and the Republic of Cameroon to the East. Despite the continuous notion that Nigerians were not consulted before the 1914 amalgamation, today Nigeria is inhabited by a large number of ethnics groups ranging in some from a few thousand to many millions, speaking between them several hundred languages. Though looking at the variety of customs, languages and social organization is confusing, they can be grouped into a number of linguistic groups which gives a honest good indication of their wider cultural relationship or affiliations.5</p> <p>The Nigeria linguistic affiliation does not imply common decent, since contact between two very different groups can lead to assimilation of the linguistic system of one by the other. According to Joseph H. Greenberry, the majority of Nigeria’s inhabitants speak one of the large groups of languages of Niger-Corgo family that form part of the larger Congo-Lordofanion family. 6The Kwa family which Nigeria is concerned is sub family of Niger-Congo family. The Yoruba, the Edo, Nupe and Igbo speak language classified as Kwa 7</p> <p><strong>THE AMALGAMATION</strong></p> <p>A crucial look at Nigeria issues and problem has be alluded to the 1914 amalgamation of Southern and Northern Nigeria as one state. In 1914, the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria and the protectorate of Northern Nigeria were united together by Lord Fredrick Lugard on 1st January 1914, thus becoming the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. The year 1914 has attracted so much importance in analyzing the politics of Nigeria as it marks the turning point in the evolution of the Nigeria state and also making Nigeria a political entity. A lot has been given as the reason for the amalgamation of South and North8. However, the immediate reason for the decision to amalgamate the two Nigeria was economic expediency or idea.  9The Northern Protectorate was running at a severe deficit, which was taken care of by Southern protectorate subsidy with British imperial Grant-in-Aid of about £300,000 a year. This was a departure from the age old policy of colonial autonomy, especially in financial matters.</p> <p>Also, there were the pressing issues to coordinate railway policy, which at times was not in existence. The singular action by Lugard influenced the whole future of Nigeria. 10These actions would have been averted if Lord Lugard had listened to better judgment of a man who knew Nigeria well. E. D Moral, at that time editor of the African Mail. A known critic of the colonial policy, he proposed the division of the country into four large provinces; namely Northern, Central, Western and Eastern Provinces. While Temple, the then Lt. Governor of the Northern Protectorate suggested the division of Nigeria into seven with three each at North and South respectively, Lagos as the last of the seven.</p> <p>          However, the decision of Lord has inevitably led Nigeria to political crisis and peace. At the era of Nigeria independence, it’s clear to note that the seeming unity of Nigeria was at low ebb. The events that preceded the October’s 1st 1960 have attracted serious question on the amalgamation of the North and South in 1914.11</p> <p><strong>THE PATH TO INDEPENDENCE</strong></p> <p>          The Richard’s Constitution of 1947 marked the actual turning point in Nigeria’s road towards independence, though the constitution received serious attacks from every side of Nigerian nationalists.12 The very objectives of the constitution signified unity, providing unity for the diverse elements that make up Nigeria and to ensure much participation by Africans in the discussion of their affairs. The most striking feature of the Constitution was the inclusion of the North in the Central legislature, a move seen as an effort at ensuring unity. Though they were mainly restricted to discussion, the creation of Regional Assemblies in the Constitution has been seen as the foundation of tribalism in Nigeria politics.  Dike (1957) reaffirmed the nation that Richard’s constitutional development, is against the effort of unifying Nigerian towards a centralized state and the realization of a common nationality.13</p> <p>          However, it has been argued that if Lord Sir Arthur wanted to contain regional and ethnic differences he would have followed the notion proposed by Moral and Temple, also later by Zik. This whole action set a precarious situation of a very unwieldy federation with one region twice the size in area and population of the other two. The events that followed the introduction of the constitution show a great deal of damage it had caused to the unity of Nigeria. The decision made at the Ibadan conference 1948 must be seen in the context of the great increase in ethnocentrism. The origin of this tribal feeling was the source of much bitterness and recrimination by Nigeria political parties; an issue that later climaxed on party polities leading to a coup which led to Nigeria Civil War in years to come.14</p> <p>          In fact originally, the increase in tribalism, as Ezera showed, was resisted by circumstance rather than design and only later was it seized upon by politician. This trend continued to dictate the politics then, as later it also led to crisis in the Nigeiran Youth Movement (NYM) Tribal feeling had set in the quarrel between Zik and then older members of the Nigerian Youth Movement on the candidature of Samuel Akinsanya for a seat on the legislative council; Zik left the group. By 1949, the Northern People’s Congress, a cultural Congress like Egbe Omo Oduduwa set in an era of tribal party politics posing a greater danger to the Nigeria polity in years to come. 15The events at the coal miners’ strike in which the police opened fire on the strikers leading to the death of about twenty one led to the need for a new Constitution that was thought of arresting the regional politics. Again the Minority reports which would have ensured national building and national character were dropped aside leading to events that occurred in 1956.16</p> <p>          On 1st April 1956 an Action Group backbencher, Anthony Enahoro moved a motion demanding self government in 1956. It was clear that the Northern members would not support the motion as they were not yet prepared. The question here is whether the colonial authority would have approved if the Western region people wanted self government. This would have arrested the violence that followed the motion. The Kano riot gave a final blow to the seeming unity in the theory of 1914 amalgamation. It clearly sent a signal that all was not well despite all efforts at ensuring unity through the Macpherson Constitution of 1951. Though the Macpherson’s Constitution was much more liberal in its look than it’s predecessor, and much more in keeping with the needs of Nigeria which inevitably led to the end of colonial rule in Nigeria.17</p> <p>          The issues that coloured the motion for self government continued to shape Nigeria politics long after independence. Uncertainty and lack of trust became the order of the day in Nigeria politics. At the immediate post motion of self government, seeking alliance between the West and East Nigerian unity collapsed leading to more complex regional politics. At the height of the crisis among the North, West and East, the North demanded the dissolution of the Federation.18 The immediate result of the riots and the motion in the Northern House was the realization by the Colonial Secretary, Mr. Oliver Lyttelton that his earlier complacent statement that what Nigeria needs is a period of reflection to let the dust die down was a departure from the truth.</p> <p>          The London conferences of 1956 seemed almost impossible.  The various parties sent delegations to the conferences with many misgiving against this unpromising background; it is remarkable how much agreement was in fact reached by the delegates to the London Conferences.</p> <p>          The all important question of self government in 1956 was cleverly, side stepped by offering self-government to those region that wanted it in 1956, but not to the federation as a whole, thus leaving it open to the North choice for self government. The bitterest issue of the conference, which broke the N.C.N.C., Action Group Alliance, was whether Lagos should be part of Federal territory. The N.C.N.C. which had many members in Lagos, also felt that a federation should have a true Federal Capital, while the AG wanted it to be part of the Western Region. Once again a conference about which most people had been very pessimistic was a striking success.19</p> <p>          In so far, the two conferences presented a framework that led to a Constitution under which Nigeria was governed till the military take-over in 1966.</p> <p><strong>The Coup to Coup (January 1966 to July 1966)</strong></p> <p>          On October 1, 1960 Nigeria became an Independent member of the International Community.  There was clear optimism about its future both within the country and outside, particularly the European powers. The Independence was achieved through patient negotiation between Nigerian leaders and the colonial masters, not by violent revolution. The three governing parties of the regions namely N.P.C in the North, the N.C.N.C. East and A.G. in West all ensured western-style parliamentary democracy. The N.P.C. and N.C.N.C. formed alliance with Dr. Nnamdi Azikwe as Governor-General and Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa as Prime Minister. The tension that had preceded independence seemed over as Nigeria appeared in its first year of sovereign nationhood, a sea of tranquility in reference to the situation in Congo20. In the early years of independence, the constitution was able to contain the various strains to which it was subjected. This is supported by one Nigeria newspaper which put it succinctly, “Nigeria seemed to have perfected the art of walking to the brook of disaster without falling in\". However, the complete breakdown of law and order in the western region in late 1965 led the military to take over the government and suspend every democratic institution.</p> <p>          Many factors have been given, including the historical, regional and ethnic differences that led to the breakdown of the political order in Nigeria. First, by the end of 1965, the politicians had earned increased contempt for their corruption and profligacy in dealing with Nigerians. Secondly, the gap between wealthy and the growing wage earning closes grew rapidly greater during the next first years. Thirdly, the growing discontent between Balewa and the elite as regard the west. Fourthly, the continued policy by the government to disregard the provision of the constitution and lastly the census of 1952-3, had created a slight overall majority was, however, the failure of the politicians to respect both the letter and spirit of the constitution that led to chaos which precipitated the January 1966 coup. The coup of January set the road for another coup in July, 1966.</p> <p>          The coup in January was mainly seen as an Eastern coup by the North. The North subsequently saw the unification of regional and federal public services as policy to dominate by the Igbos. Also they saw the killing of Northern military personnel as an attempt to dominate the military. In July, Northern officers staged a coup in which Ironsi on a visit to Ibadan was killed together with his host, Governor Fajuyi. Finally the Army Chief of Staff, Lt Col. Yakubu Gowon a Northerner took over as Head of State. The legitimacy of Gowon as Head of State caused civil unrest leading to conflict and killing between the North and Igbos. The continued rejection of Gowon by Lt. Col. Ojukwu led to chaos that plugged into a thirty-month-long civil war, with the Igbos declaring their Republic of Biafra.21</p> <p>          Conclusively, the colonial rule in Nigeria set a standard that started in 1914. The constitutional framework at bringing unity to Nigeria did not engender peace in the State. The war that ensued in Nigeria has in the colonial legacy which the master left in the hand of Nigerians the word is independence.</p> <p><strong>END NOTES</strong></p> <p>1.       A.H.M.

While other regions have successfully used their integration mechanisms to improve their economic welfare, Africa lags behind with respect to GDP growth, per capita income, capital inflows, and general living standards. This is a problem across most of the continent, in spite of the existence of a plethora of policy plans and grand visions. The first major blueprint for Africa’s development – the Lagos Plan of Action and the Final Act of Lagos – was adopted almost three decades ago, and set out a vision of an integrated African market by the year 2000. It was given further impetus by the Abuja Treaty which was approved in 1991 and came into force in 1994. According to this Treaty, the African Economic Community (AEC) would be in place by 2028. Some of its milestones would include strengthening of existing regional economic communities and the formation of the new ones (between 1994 and 1999); stabilization of existing tariffs, and integration and harmonization of economic sectors (1999 to 2007); establishment of a free trade area and customs union (2007 to 2017); harmonization of tariff systems across various regional economic communities (RECs) (2017 to 2019); the creation of a common African market and harmonization of monetary, financial, and fiscal policies; and the establishment of a pan-African economic and monetary union (2023 to 2028). This plan envisaged that, through RECs, deep-seated challenges of poverty and underdevelopment would be eradicated. Among the latest initiatives has been the New Economic Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), as well as the vision for the ‘United States of Africa’. The establishment of the Pan-African Parliament (PAP) in March 2004 can be regarded as an important achievement towards this strategic objective. While the previous plans placed a premium on intra-regional trade, agriculture, technology and the environment, it would seem as if the new initiatives are emphasizing ownership, economic reform and political modernization. It is unclear if and when the fruits of the latest initiatives will begin to manifest. The question is: In view of the fact that the plans that were articulated by the first generation of postcolonial leaders failed to materialize, what gives force to the new-found optimism that characterizes today’s proponents of Africa’s integration? Could there have been something fundamentally wrong with the initial casting of this vision that today’s elite can successfully rectify, so that Africa can be set on a promising developmental trajectory? The contention in this paper is that too little has changed since the 1980s to advance regional integration and to ensure developmental progress on the continent. It would seem that Africa’s elites are focusing on the wrong set of priorities with too little genuine commitment towards the goal of Africa’s development. For regional integration in Africa to be a success, Africa’s leaders will have to move beyond grand gestures and abstract visions. Africa’s challenges call for pragmatism and a sense of urgency in action. More focused and gradual steps that are carefully executed at the domestic level may be the best place to start. The focus of such steps at the domestic level should be on bold and sustainable political and economic reforms. At the regional level the focus should be on developmental coordination and gradual harmonization of policies and regulations, which could form the foundation for greater integration. As Percy Ministry contends: ‘African governments need to be less ambitious and more realistic and pragmatic aboutthe objectives and intermediate targets for integration, taking into account the constraints and capacities of integrating national governments.</p> <p>The formation of regional blocs and groupings has progressively become a prominent feature of world politics since the end of the World War II (Olubomehin and Kawonishe, 2004). Regional integration generally involves a complex web of cooperation between countries within a given geographical area, to harmonize policies in such sectors as trade, investment, infrastructural, as well as monetary and fiscal policies of member states. There has been much support for the economic integration of African states since independence. This received a great deal of impetus following severe economic instability of the 1970s (Asante, 1999). According to Hartzenberg (2011), the ambition of African leaders to integrate Africa provided the rationale for the Lagos Plan of Action (LPA). Both the LPA (1980) and the Abuja Treaty of 1991 became the agenda for an integration based on solidarity and self-reliance. The treaties also called for the creation of regional integration arrangements as starting points for the continent’s integration. According to Asante (2000), ECOWAS is the most concrete African initiative in this direction. ECOWAS is a regional group of 15 West African countries established on 28th May, 1975 under the Treaty of Lagos. It represents a regional institutional framework for the coordination and promotion of economic cooperation in West Africa. Since its inception, ECOWAS has done remarkably well, especially in the areas of peace and security, trade and the free movement of people and goods in the region. However, the community is faced with a number of challenges which are likely to impede the effective exercise of its functions and the fulfillment of its purpose. Considering the growing importance of regional integration in the world, it is important therefore, to identify the challenges and prospects for regional integration in West Africa</p> <p>1.2 <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Over the last thirty years, Regional Integration Agreements (also referred to as Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) or Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) to underline that these agreements almost always involve preferential access) have been spreading everywhere including across Africa where they have also been called Regional Economic Communities (RECs). During the period, the landscape of PTAs has changed drastically. The early phase of integration started during the first decades of independence, and was enshrined in the Lagos Plan of Action, an initiative of the Organization for African Unity now known as African union AU, adopted by the heads of states in 1980. It is in view of this that the researcher intend to investigate the challenges of regional integration in West Africa.</p> <p>1.3 <strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is to the prospect and challenges of regional integration in West Africa.

Multilateral efforts to identify actions that governments should pursue to encourage international transfer of technology are largely of a best-endeavor nature. Starting in the mid 1990s, multilateral disciplines on international transfer of technology-related policies began to deepen.

For several years past, Africa was the centerpiece of Nigeria’s foreign policy and, therefore, spent heavily pursuing foreign policies of decolonization and apartheid. This policy emphasized aggressive championing of the freedom of African countries such as Congo, Angola and Mozambique then reeling under the yoke of colonialism and those under minority racist regimes such as Zimbabwe and South Africa. Nigeria did not waver to commit moral, financial and diplomatic support in pursuit of this policy. This study advocates a change in focus and highlights the imperatives of economic diplomacy in Nigeria’s foreign policy. It suggests that Nigeria’s pressing economic problems should be holistically examined and tackled first, which will then form the basis of a vibrant foreign policy. It is believed that when the living standards of citizens are enhanced, the approach will earn Nigeria and our leaders respect not only at home but also in the comity of nations. </p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT</strong></p> <p>Title page</p> <p>Approval page</p> <p>Dedication</p> <p>Acknowledgment</p> <p>Abstract</p> <p>Table of content</p> <p> <strong>CHAPETR ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0   INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p>1.1        Background of the study</p> <p>1.2        Statement of problem</p> <p>1.3        Objective of the study</p> <p>1.4        Research Question</p> <p>1.5        Significance of the study</p> <p>1.6        Scope and limitation of the study</p> <p>1.7       Definition of terms</p> <p>1.8       Organization of the study</p> <p><strong>CHAPETR TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>2.0   LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPETR THREE</strong></p> <p>3.0 Theoretical Review</p> <p>3.1 economic diplomacy and conduct of Nigeria external relations</p> <p>3.3        Nigeria foreign policy</p> <p>3.4        Nigeria foreign policy formulation and implementation</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></p> <p><strong>Economic diplomacy</strong></p> <p>4.1 Introductions</p> <p>4.2 poverty reduction in Nigeria under national economic empowerment and development</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></p> <p>5.1 Introduction</p> <p>5.2 Summary</p> <p>5.3 Conclusion</p> <p>5.4 Recommendation</p> <p>Appendix</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Foreign policy refers to actions chosen by the national government to maximize its strategic goals and objectives in the international arena. Every state will have established goals, a set of options, and an algorithm for deciding which option is most appropriate in meeting its goals1 . Thus, foreign policies are the strategies that guide the actions of governments in the international system as they spell out the objectives state leaders pursue in a given situation or relationship2 . For Funso Adesola, “foreign policy could be seen as the totality of all actions, decisions, overtures, and /or interactions between and among states in the international system”3 . Put differently, foreign policy could be based on economics, politics, culture or the creating of co-operation or understanding among nations of the world. It is the sum total of the interactions between and among domestic economies and policies of world nations. Since independence, Africa had been the corner stone of Nigeria’s foreign policy. Issues that concerned the continent were the primary focus of the Nigerian government. Nigeria played unmatched role in restoring peace to conflict-ridden African countries such as Congo, Sudan, Liberia and SierraLeone. In these endeavors, Nigeria committed huge human and material resources. Although Nigeria played the role of a big brother, despite its sustained assistance, it has not been accorded the appropriate recognition for its leadership role in the continent. Instead, Nigeria has been the butt of derision by several African states. For instance, some Francophone African countries brazenly disdain Nigeria and exhibit hostility by subjecting Nigerians living in their midst to varying degrees of torture and humiliation. The poor perception of Nigeria in the international community is attributed to ineptitude in political leadership and economic comatose into which the country has been steeped for several years. This paper, therefore, argues that economic diplomacy should be the main thrust of Nigeria’s foreign policy in the new political dispensation as it will go a long way in solving several of the pressing economic problems that have bedeviled the country. The historical antecedents of Nigeria’s foreign policy owes much to the vision of Alhaji Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Nigeria’s first Prime Minister and Head of Government, October 1960 to January 1966, and can be located in his famous speeches during the immediate pre and post independence periods. These speeches include his statement in the House of Representatives on August 20, 1960; his Independence Day Address on October 1, 1960 and his Acceptance Speech on the occasion of Nigeria’s admission into the membership of the United Nations in New York on October 8, 1960. From the late 1950s especially from 1958 when he became head of the Self-government and when Nigeria’s Independence was slated for October 1, 1960, Balewa articulated in these speeches the fundamental principles that would guide Nigeria’s external relations after independence and the basis upon which the country would relate with other countries of the world, as well as what its posture would be towards international organizations. The policy of economic diplomacy as a central plank in the correction of the imbalances in the political-economy of the Nigerian state may as well be written off, if one considers the rascality of the operators of the country in the period under discourse. However, for a keen observer and an objective researcher, the policy scored some measure of success between 1988 an 1993. Like in all human ventures, the gains of the ‘new’ economic diplomacy should be seen in terms of long and short term perspectives. Policies at all levels take time to mature and in the case of the ‘new’ economic diplomacy, expectation of tangible and handsome results may be a tall dream, within a short period of five years that the General Ibrahim Babangida regime operated the policy. However, this observation does not suggest a complete failure of the policy. One of the most important objectives of economic diplomacy as a state policy was the development of an enduring economy for the Nigerian people, especially through the attraction of foreign investment. This necessitates the reorganization of the Ministry of External Affairs (MFA) and this was complemented at the domestic level by a host of reforms aimed at achieving positive results. These included the adoption of a new investment code whose objective was to make the process of company incorporation easier; the amendment of the indigenization decree of the 1970s to increase the number of foreign investors in the economy; the elimination of bureaucratic `procedures associated with profit repatriation and dividend remittance, and the introduction of new tax relief measures (Olukoshi and Idris, 1991). With this recap, it is easy to discuss some of the gains of economic diplomacy within the period and scope of this study The policy, within a short time, created a new awareness and interest among the private sector operators, especially in the nation’s export promotion drive. The government introduced very attractive insurance scheme for exports of both manufactured and agricultural goods. Although, it is difficult to quantify the benefits of these measures in cash values, it is reasonable to submit that it had a multiplier effect on the country’s economic growth. The policy of ‘new’ economic diplomacy was pre-occupied with marketing the Structural Adjustment program (SAP) to the outside world.∗ This brought a modest increase in foreign investments and a little halt in the divestment of foreign investment. As a matter of fact, promotional agencies like Commonwealth Development Authority (CDA) and Canada International Development Agency (CIDA), which had left Nigeria earlier, returned to the country with more vigour (Ike Nwachukwu Years). At this point, it is imperative to make some clarifications of the concept of economic diplomacy. This brand of diplomacy involves the decision-making, policy-making, and advocating of the sending state’s business interests, and requires the application of technical expertise that analyze the effects of a country’s (receiving state) economic situation on its political climate and on the sending state’s economic interests. The sending state and host state, foreign business leaders as well as government decision-makers work in synergy on some important issues in foreign policy, such as technology, the environment and HIV/AIDS as well as in the traditional areas of trade and finance. Qualities needed for proper execution of economic diplomacy are versatility, sound judgment and strong business skills12 . The scope of economic diplomacy comprises international and domestic economic issues including the “rules for economic relations between states”. Due to increased globalization and the resultant interdependence among states, economic diplomacy has gone deeper into domestic decision making to cover policies relating to production, exchange of goods, services and instruments (official development assistance). Economic diplomacy is therefore, defined as: The process through which countries tackle the outside world, to maximize their national gain in all the fields of activity including trade, investment and other forms of economically beneficial exchanges, where they enjoy comparative advantage; it has bilateral, regional and multilateral dimensions, each of which is important13 . Thus, economic diplomacy encourages and promotes investment, protects deals from inception to signing of contracts and in fact markets an entire nation as if it is a business outfit itself. The diplomats would conduct trade events and seminars, attend trade shows, visit potential investors and be proactive in marketing the attributes of their country. Success in this endeavour requires knowledge of the business process, of the home country’s economy, and of salesmanship. In this wise, and with proper training, diplomats become essential link in the strengthening of their economies by private investors, with governments facilitating the process.</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>In the contemporary international system where interdependence drives economic issues, economic diplomacy emerged as the most efficient instrument of conducting foreign policy. This is because it is absolutely necessary for any policy thrust to aim at, achieve and maintain a self reliant and prosperous economy. Adefuye (1992:140) adopts this view and asserts that “an economy that fails to sustain a society destabilizes that society”. Nigeria is not left out of the strategic economic calculations since economic issue is the driving force behind its foreign policy in the 21st century despite the attendant misconception, abuses and misapplication. The economic diplomacy of New Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy was applied by Olusegum Obasanjo to reverse the debilitating conditions of Nigerian economy. These policies supposedly are activities generally focused on the affirmation of economic interest of Nigerian state as “the health of a nation’s economy is one index of the vigour and purposefulness it displays in her relationship with others” (Rodee, 1983; 464). In other words, “a strong economic foundation and a happy and contended people provide a sound basis for effective pursuit of foreign policy” (Olusanya, 1988:525). In Nigeria, the regime in question had a negative conception of economic diplomacy as foreign policy thrust. They appear to place politics before economics. Their target appears to perpetrate invidious political roles in their state not minding that our domestic structure is not strong enough to support external outcomes. The primary thrust of economic diplomacy is to strengthen Nigerian political economy and reposition it for sustainable human and material development. “Economic diplomacy employs economic resources either as reward or sanctions in pursuit of a particular foreign policy objective. This is sometimes called “economic craft” (Harun, 2008:2). This is to enhance human welfare and create an economic environment that will constantly satisfy the basic needs of man. Any diplomatic ties, bilateral, multilateral or institutional relations would be conducted in a manner or intention to impact on Nigeria’s human and material development.</p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is on examining the efficiency of ministry of foreign affairs and economic diplomacy of Nigeria foreign policy, but to aid the completion of the study, the following specific objectives are were put forward by the researcher;</p> <p>i)             To examine the impact of ministry of foreign affairs in attaining economic diplomacy</p> <p>ii)           To examine the relationship between the ministry of foreign affairs and Nigeria economic diplomacy</p> <p>iii)          To ascertain the role of the government in attaining economic diplomacy in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.4      </strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>The following research questions were formulated by the researcher to aid the completion of the study;</p> <p>i)             Is there any impact of ministry of foreign affairs in attaining economic diplomacy of Nigerian foreign policy?</p> <p>ii)           Is there any relationship between the ministry of foreign affairs and Nigeria economic diplomacy?</p> <p><strong>1.5      </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The primary goal of economic diplomacy as a tool of foreign policy in Nigeria is the promotion and protection of national interest of the Nigerian state. Nigeria under the regime of 8 Olusegun Obasanjo applied the economic diplomacy of national economic empowerment and development strategy as reform measures to achieve pre-determined economic development. This study has both theoretical and practical significance. At the theoretical level, it will add to the existing literature on economic diplomacy of the Nigerian state and will assist student researchers in economic diplomacy and related fields as reference material. It will equally underscore the link between economic diplomacy and foreign policy. It will also highlight the reform impact on foreign direct investment and sustainable human development. At the practical level, the result of our investigation will be used during the formulation and implementation of any related economic reform polices of Nigeria state. The political and bureaucratic leaders in charge of foreign policy will apply the result of an investigation in enhancing a proactive economic reform package for Nigerian State. </p> <p><strong>1.6      </strong><strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of the study covers ministry of foreign affairs and economic diplomacy of Nigerian foreign policy; but in the cause of the study, there were some factors that hinders the scope of the study;</p> <p><strong>a) AVAILABILITY OF RESEARCH MATERIAL:</strong> The research material available to the researcher is insufficient, thereby limiting the study  </p> <p><strong>b) TIME:</strong> The time frame allocated to the study does not enhance wider coverage as the researcher has to combine other academic activities and examinations with the study.</p> <p><strong>c) Finance</strong>: Limited Access to the required finance makes it difficult to get all the necessary and required information concerning the activities.</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS </strong></p> <p><strong>Economic diplomacy</strong></p> <p>Economic diplomacy is a form of diplomacy.

It is a state of discord caused by the actual or perceived opposition of needs, values and interests.1It exist whenever incompatible activities occur. An activity that is incompatible with another is one that prevents, blocks or interferes with the occurrence or effectiveness of the second activity.</p> <p>The incompabitlity or differences may exist in reality or may only be perceived by the parties involved. Nonetheless, the opposing actions and the hostile emotions are very real hallmark between people in all kind of human relationship and in al social settings. As a result of the wide range of potential differences between people, the absence of conflict usually signals the absence of meaningful interaction2. A conflict can be as small as a perceived disagreement or as large as war. It can originate in the person, between two or more people or between two or more groups. Conflict by itself is neither good nor bad but the manner in which conflict is handled determines whether it is constructive or destructive.</p> <p>A conflict is different from competition and cooperation because in competitive situations, the two or more individuals or parties have mutually inconsistent goals as either party tries to reach its goals, it undermine the attempt of the others to reach theirs. Therefore, competitive situations will by their nature cause conflict. Conflict can also occur in cooperative situation, in which two or more individuals or parties have consistent goals because the manner in which one party tries to reach its goal may undermine the other individual or party.3</p> <p>A clash of interests, values, action or directions often sparks a conflict and conflict is also seen as the existence of the clash. The world ‘conflict’ is applicable from the instant the clash occurs. Even when it is described as a potential conflict, it is implying that there is already conflict of direction even though a clash has not occurred. As a result, conflict can occur whenever there is interaction. Leo Otoide describe this situation in the international system thus:</p> <p>When states interact there is competition for power and prestige and in the process, the international system elicits a picture of perpetual conflict, of survival of the fittest, where the desire for power and influence determines the attitudes of states and the course of events.4</p> <p>Conflict occurs in different levels. The first is interpersonal conflict. Interpersonal conflict is when two people have incompatible needs; goals, or approaches in their relationship.5 Communication breakdown is often an important source of interpersonal conflict and learning communication skills is valuable in preventing and resolving such difficulties. At the same time, very real differences occur between people that cannot be resolved by any amount of improved communication. Personality conflict refers to very strong differences in motives, values or styles in dealing with people that are not resolvable. For instance, if both parties in a relationship have a high need for power and both want to be dominant in the relationship, there is no way for both to be satisfied, and a power struggle ensures common tactics used in interpersonal power struggles includes the exaggerated used of reward and punishments, deception and evasion, threats and emotional blackmail and flattery or integration. Unresolved power conflict usually recycles and escalates to the point of relationship breakdown and termination.6</p> <p>The next level of conflict is intergroup conflict. It occurs between collections of people such as ethnic or racial groups. It can also be a conflict between departments or levels of decision making in the same organizations. Another common source of inter-group conflict is the competition for scarce resources between groups in a nation or between union and management staff of the same organization.7 One characteristics of intergroup conflict is that group members tend to develop stereotypes beliefs of the opposing group. They also tends to blame them for their problems and lastly, tends to practice discrimination against them.8 These classic symptom of intergroup conflict is especially tenced and prone to escalation and intractability when group identities are threatened.9</p> <p>Another level of conflict is multi-party conflict. It occurs in society when different interest groups and organizations have varying priorities over resource management and control as well as policy development. These complex conflict typically involve a combination of economic, value and power sources. This complexity is often beyond the reach of traditional authoritative or adversarial procedures, and more collaborative approaches to building consensus are required for solution.10</p> <p>The last level of conflict is supranational conflicts. These are conflicts that involves states or in which one of the parties is a state. There are three common types of supranational conflicts, they include conflict involving maritime boundaries, dispute involving land and investor-state conflict also known as investment treaty dispute.</p> <p>In resolving supranational conflict, it is important to bear in mind that unlike other conflicts, it is likely to arise out of a treaty. For example a maritime delimitation disputes may be govern by the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS III) or an investor-state dispute which is guided by the international settlement of the investment dispute convention. The court is also to apply international conventions, international customs and the general principles of laws recognized by the nations or parties in question.11</p> <p>Regardless of the level of conflict, there are different approaches to deal with the incompabilities that exist between the parties. If conflicts are managed creatively, solutions that are mutually satisfactory to both parties are attainable. It may involve a new distribution of resources or forms of influence than before. Creative outcome are more probable when the parties are inter-dependent, that is each having some degree of independence or autonomy from which to influence one another, rather than one party being primarily dependent on the other.12 Given inter-dependence, three general strategies have been identified that one parties make take towards dealing with their conflict. These include win-lose, lose-lose, and win-win.</p> <p>The win-lose approach is a strategy that forced the other side to capitulate. Sometimes, this is done through socially acceptable mechanisms such as majority vote, the authority of the leader, or the determination of a judge. Sometimes, it involves secret strategies, threat, innuendo – whatever works is acceptable that is Mechanuallian principle in which the end justify the means. The value outcome is to have a victor who is superior and vanquished who withdraw in shame.13</p> <p>The lose-lose strategy is exemplified by smoothing over conflict or by reaching the simplest of compromises. In neither case is the creative potential of productive resolution realized or explored. This is base on the notion that disagreement is inevitable and thus is the better to split the differences or smooth over difficulties in a painless a way as possible. Each party gets some of what it want.</p> <p>The win-win approach is a conscious and systematic attempt to maximize the goals of both parties  through collaborative problem solving. The conflict is seen as a problem to be solved rather that war to be won. This method focus on one problem from the perspective of both parties and the needs as well as constraints of both parities rather short term accommodations. Communication is open and direct rather than selective and calculating. Attitudes and behaviours are directed toward an increase of trust and acceptance rather than an escalation or suspicion and hostilities.14</p> <p>There are two methods of conflict resolution – the authoritative and the alternative methods.</p> <p>The first approach under the authoritative methods of conflict resolution is the use of power. The stronger side promotes its interest by force regardless of interests of the other parties. There is another case of use of power in conflict resolution. In this case, some issues are won by one side while other issues are won by one other sides, both parties make no agreement but push through their interest forcefully regardless of interest of each other.15</p> <p>Decision made by authority is another strategic under the authoritative methods of conflict resolution. In this system, an authority interferes in a conflict and makes a decision based on his judgement of what is the best solution for the conflicting parties.16 In many cases such solution also satisfy the interest of that authority. This is different from arbitrage. The role of the arbiter is to work as an independent third party, who hear both conflicting sides, finds legally correct solution based on valid legislation and then communicate such decisions to the disputants.17 Lastly under the authoritative methods of conflict resolution is the decision of a court. Under this, a judge or jury decide a solution to a conflict based on evidence supplied by attorneys representing both conflicting sides of the issue. The judge or jury then interpret the law and use it as a basis for their decision which both parities will be forced to respect, the jury is composed of either laymen or professional judges.</p> <p>First, under the alternative methods of conflict resolution is facilitation.18 In this process, a facilitator works as an impartial third party person who helps two conflicting parties direct their discussion in order to reach an agreement satisfactory to both side according to previously agreed rules. The Latin world facilatare means to ease. Therefore, the role of a facilitator is to provide both side with such methods and guidelines for discussion which will ease their communication. In mediation, the mediator is a third party and primarily a facilitator who seeks to established or restore communication between feuding parties. The mediator strives to bring the parties face to face to negotiate and this constitutes a vital objective of his endeavous, the mediator must have good influence, credibility and good standing with the parties. Above all, he must have good diplomatic skill.19</p> <p>Another method of conflict resolution is conciliation which is similar to mediation except for the legal distinction that the third party is a commission or an international body whose aid has been sought in finding a solution satisfactory to the disputants.</p> <p>Arbitration is a step further tan a fact finding mission since it involves the practical examination of the issues involved in a crisis and the decision is binding on the parties. Often a tribunal is set up to examine the issues and make recommendation to a superior body.20</p> <p>Adjudication or judicial settlement is a process of submitting to an international covert for decision. Unlike arbitration, the covert is subjected to no preliminary litigations upon its procedures, evidence to be considered or legal principles to be applied except those stated at the statute by which it was created.2</p>                                                           \n\nCONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN AFRICA: THE ROLE OF THE CIVIC SOCIETY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN AFRICA: THE ROLE OF THE CIVIC SOCIETY", "id": 53}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      Background of the study</strong></p> <p>The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in Washington, D.C., New York City, and Pennsylvania were acts of war against the United States of America and its allies, and against the very idea of civilized society. No cause justifies terrorism. The world must respond and fight this evil that is intent on threatening and destroying our basic freedoms and our way of life. Freedom and fear are at war. The enemy is not one person. It is not a single political regime. Certainly it is not a religion. The enemy is terrorism—premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents. Those who employ terrorism, regardless of their specific secular or religious objectives, strive to subvert the rule of law and effect change through violence and fear. These terrorists also share the misguided belief that killing, kidnapping, extorting, robbing, and wreaking havoc to terrorize people are legitimate forms of political action. The struggle against international terrorism is different from any other war in our history. We will not triumph solely or even primarily through military might. We must fight terrorist networks, and all those who support their efforts to spread fear around the world, using every instrument of national power— diplomatic, economic, law enforcement, financial, information, intelligence, and military. Progress will come through the persistent accumulation of successes—some seen, some unseen. And we will always remain vigilant against new terrorist threats. Our goal will be reached when Americans and other civilized people around the world can lead their lives free of fear from terrorist attacks. There will be no quick or easy end to this conflict. At the same time, the United States, will not allow itself to be held hostage by terrorists. Combating terrorism and securing the U.S. homeland from future attacks are our top priorities. But they will not be our only priorities. This strategy supports the National Security Strategy ofthe United States. As the National Security Strategy highlights, we live in an age with tremendous opportunities to foster a world consistent with interests and values embraced by the United States and freedom-loving people around the world. And we will seize these opportunities. This combating terrorism strategy further elaborates on Section III of the the National Security Strategy by expounding on our need to destroy terrorist organizations, win the “war of ideas,” and strengthen America’s security at home and abroad. While the National Strategy for Homeland Security focuses on preventing terrorist attacks within the United States, the National Strategy for Combating Terrorism focuses on identifying and defusing threats before they reach our borders. While we appreciate the nature of the difficult challenge before us, our strategy is based on the belief that sometimes the most difficult tasks are accomplished by the most direct means. Ours is a strategy of direct and continuous action against terrorist groups, the cumulative effect of which will initially disrupt, over time degrade, and ultimately destroy the terrorist organizations. The more frequently and relentlessly we strike the terrorists across all fronts, using all the tools of statecraft, the more effective we will be. The United States, with its unique ability to build partnerships and project power, will lead the fight against terrorist organizations of global reach. By striking constantly and ensuring that terrorists have no place to hide, we will compress their scope and reduce the capability of these organizations. By adapting old alliances and creating new partnerships, we will facilitate regional solutions that further isolate the spread of terrorism. Concurrently, as the scope of terrorism becomes more localized, unorganized and relegated to the criminal domain, we will rely upon and assist other states to eradicate terrorism at its root. The United States will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community in this fight against a common foe. If necessary, however, we will not hesitate to act alone, to exercise our right to self-defense, including acting preemptively against terrorists to prevent them from doing harm to our people and our country. The war on terrorism is asymmetric in nature but the advantage belongs to us, not the terrorists. We will fight this campaign using our strengths against the enemy’s weaknesses. We will use the power of our values to shape a free and more prosperous world. We will employ the legitimacy of our government and our cause to craft strong and agile partnerships. Our economic strength will help failing states and assist weak countries in ridding themselves of terrorism. Our technology will help identify and locate terrorist organizations, and our global reach will eliminate them where they hide. And as always, we will rely on the strength of the American people to remain resolute in the face of adversity. We will never forget what we are ultimately fighting for—our fundamental democratic values and way of life. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new international relationships and redefining existing ones in terms suited to the transnational challenges of the 21st century.</p> <p><strong>1.2      Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>In recent years, terrorist networks have evolved, moving away from a dependency on state sponsorship; many of the most dangerous groups and individuals now operate as non-state actors. Taking advantage of porous borders and interconnected international systems finance, communications, and transit terrorist groups can reach every corner of the globe. While some remain focused on local or national political dynamics, others seek to affect global change.</p> <p>At the forefront of this trend is al-Qaeda. From its base in the borderlands between Afghanistan and Pakistan, the al-Qaeda network has spread widely, establishing branches or affiliates elsewhere, including in North Africa, Yemen, and Southeast Asia. Driven by an extreme Salafi ideology characterized by opposition to Western influence and the goal of creating a global Islamic caliphate al-Qaeda operatives have killed thousands from Madrid to Bali to Baghdad. What is more, the group’s alluring ideology extends its reach, prompting some individuals outside its direct command to take violent action. The threat from al-Qaeda has proven global, multifaceted, and difficult to track and contain. It continues to pose the most prominent terrorist threat.</p> <p><strong>1.3      Objectives of the study</strong></p> <p>The objective of this study is to suggest possible ways in which United States, together with its friends and allies, eliminates terrorism as a threat to our way of life.</p> <p><strong>1.4      Research questions</strong></p> <p>1.    What measures can be put in place in order to eliminate terrorism completely from the United States.</p> <p><strong>1.5   Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>Americans know that terrorism did not begin on September 11, 2001. Regrettably, its history is long and all too familiar. The first major terrorist attack on New York City’s financial district, for instance, did not occur on September 11, or even with the 1993 truck bombing of the World Trade Center. It occurred September 16, 1920, when anarchists exploded a horse cart filled with dynamite near the intersections of Wall and Broad Streets, taking 40 lives and wounding about 300 others. Starting with the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901 and continuing with the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998 and the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000, American history in the 20th century was punctuated by terrorism. Americans also understand that we are not alone in the struggle against terror. Terrorists have left their mark in some way upon every country in the world. Citizens from some 90 countries died in the attacks of September 11. For decades, the United States and our friends abroad have waged the long struggle against the terrorist menace. We have learned much from these efforts. Even as we experience success in the war on terrorism, new enemies may emerge. Thus, the United States will confront the threat of terrorism for the foreseeable future. Consequently, we must continue to take aggressive action to uncover individuals and groups engaged in terrorist activity, by analyzing the common characteristics of terrorists in order to understand where our enemies are weak and where they are strong.</p> <p><strong>1.6   Scope/Limitations of the study</strong></p> <p>This study is on United States and fight against terrorism and it has the following limitations.</p> <p>1.    <strong>1.        Financial constraint</strong>– Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).</p> <p>2.    <strong>2.        Time constraint</strong>– The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

Foreign and domestic policy must be mutually supporting if national policy aspirations are to be achieved in an atmosphere of political stability. The research was carried out on the impacts of domestic politics in Nigeria’s foreign policy using a case study method with a focus on General Murtala Obasanjo’s military administration (1975 – 1979). The review of literature on foreign policy and other related material and the adoption of “Realist Theory” which is anchored on interest led us to the conclusion that Nigeria’s seeming inaction during the period of study was an acknowledgement of the limits of its power. Against this background the study concludes that Nigeria’s foreign policy has since independence been consistently guided by the same principles and objectives. Nigeria’s Foreign Policy initiatives and actions have been defined by one firm and constant variable, i.e the protection of the country’s national interest. As a panacea, the study recommended, above all, that Nigeria must involve a “home grown” economic policy and honestly abode by its implementation.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1 Historical Background Of Nigerian Foreign Policy</p> <p>A study in Nigeria’s foreign policy over time has quite often under – scored the potency of its domestic contents. Notable scholars on Nigerian external relations such as Akinyemi, Aluko, Gambari, Birai etc demonstrated the influence of domestic conditions on the country’s attitude and behaviour to other actors in the international system. The influence of domestic politics on Nigeria’s foreign policy was made obvious to the international community on 1st October, 1960, by the then first Prime Minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa himself in a moving address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. He observed that:</p> <p>Nigeria does not intend to ally itself as a member of routine with any of the ideological power blocs and Nigeria hopes to work with other states for the Progress of Africa and to assist in bringing all other African territories to a state of responsible independence Given the domestic nature and the country’s size and at the same time natural resources, it was assumed that Nigeria would play a leading</p> <p>role in the continent of Africa. Some scholars even spoke of the country’s “manifest destiny” to lead Africa surrounded by small and weak states. Abubakar, O.S reviewing Gambari said that; the first phase, one of uncertainty and timidity of Nigerian Foreign Policy coincided with the period of the First Republic (1960 – 65). The major issue at that time were the official foreign policy declaration itself; the Anglo Nigerian Defence pact, the Congo Crisis and African Unity; Negotiations for associate status with the European Economic Community (EEC): the Rhodesian Crisis and Common Wealth relations; and the Arab – Israeli antagonism and the search for a cohesive policy towards the middle east. Nigeria throughout this period operated a Pro- West foreign policy disposition. The conservative nature in her external relations was dictated by Nigerian Federalism which profess three strong regions with a weak centre. Prime Minister Balewa then had a constitutional authority which was not always matched by the political power needed to override these divergent groups encroachment upon Nigeria’s foreign policy. The coming together of the two parties i.e Northern Peoples Congress (NPC) and National Council for Nigerian and Cameroon (NCNC) which formed a coalition government then forced the Balewa government to make adjustment in order to keep the partnership viable.</p> <p>Consequently, Nigerian foreign policy during the 1960 – 65 period was less dynamic than it would have been if the NCNC had been solely responsible. By the same token, it was far more assertive, Pan Africanist and neutralist especially on the Middle – East than it would have been if the NPC had exclusive control. The need to adjust in order to accommodate the sometimes contrasting views of the</p> <p>governing parties and save the alliance, made Balewa’s foreign policy liable to such criticism as lacking in consistent imagination and dynamism and characterized by Ad – hoc decision making which tended to be contradictory and self – defeating.</p> <p>The second phase of  Nigerian Foreign Policy was the period between 1966 – 1975 under which a lot of changes took place at the domestic political level. The Nigerian external relation was marked by active, positive and influential role especially in the continent. The fragile nature of the Federalism was replaced by a stronger centre with 12 states constituting the Federating Unit. The assertion of the military rule under General Yakubu Gowon dramatically changed the dimension of authority Domestic politics and Nigerian Foreign Policy. The discovery of oil boom also assisted in great measure in allowing the country to play more decisive leadership role in World affairs, as it increased the revenue accruing to the Federal government. The previous low keyed, resistant and often apologetic approach to</p> <p>African affairs had to be changed. The aftermath of Biafra experience was also instructive as the country came up with a coherent policy to her fellow African countries. The integrative efforts of Gowon with the establishment of ECOWAS and the financial and moral assistance to neighbouring West African countries were remarkable. Nigeria’s extension of hand of fellowship to the Eastern block countries such as China and Soviet Union was seen as a policy shift from the earlier position. The country played a frontline role in Southern Africa problems by increasing financial and other assistance to the Liberation Movement there. Gowon’s active role in Africa later earned the country the chairmanship of OAU.</p> <p>Similarly, Nigeria led other African countries in breaking diplomaticties with Israel in the wake of the latter’s hostility against Egypt. The nature of the regime and its domestic economic condition explained fundamentally the drastic change in Nigeria’s diplomatic style under General Gowon. General Gowon was overthrown in a bloodless coup in July, 1975.</p> <p>A momentous shift of Foreign policy position was however achieved under the General Murtala/Obasanjo regime. This is one administration whose foreign policy posture was characterized by dynamism as the regime strove to move the country’s foreign policy to a more truly non – aligned position particularly within the six</p> <p>months of Murtala’s rule. The regime’s bold move to recognize MPLA in Angola and the memorable speech to the OAU extra – ordinary Summit Conference at Addis – Ababa in January, 1976 remains a remarkable turning point. Three main factors have been identified as being responsible for this dynamic posture. The first</p> <p>factor is that of increased revenue due to the oil wealth. The other two factors are the character of the leadership itself and the institutional re-organization of the foreign policy making process that took place during this time.</p> <p>The next phase in the development of Nigerian Foreign Policy came with the return to civilian rule (1979 – 1983). The external policy of the Shagari administration is comparable only to that of the Balewa Era. Some scholars and commentators consider the Second Republic as having “engendered retrogression” in the country’s foreign policy resulting from its Pro – Western policy. For sure, the period of retrogression began during the Obasanjo regime when the country</p> <p>experienced a “return to subservience” The major factor explaining the retrogressive nature of the country’s foreign policy during the period is found in the character of the leadership. The National Party of Nigeria (NPN) was made up of the most aristocratic, conservative businessmen and a sprinkle of academicians of the same mould. Most of them have economic and social links with the elite of the Western World even if at a peripheral level. This among others made it difficult for them to formulate an independent foreign policy which might necessitate occasional disagreement with the Western powers.</p> <p>Moreover, the nature of Nigeria’s mono – cultural economy with its sole dependence on oil was such that by 1979, the country’s level of integration into the World capitalist system by transitional interests was enhanced as represented by the oil companies. Between 1981 – 1982, the country total export had declined considerably by 34.5 percent and the monthly import bill reached the one billion mark just one year after Shagari took over. Invariably, the regime could not keep to its electoral promises to the people. On the foreign arena, the regime could not maintain the momentum of those progressive actions taken since Murtala Mohammed came to power that continued to enjoy the support of the informed elites.</p> <p>Indeed, there was recourse to the old order of passive and reactionary posture in Nigerian Foreign Policy as manifested in the country’s policy on the Chadian Crisis, OAU and ECOWAS. It was abysmal lack of focus and inability of the regime to respond to the various domestic demands that precipitated the collapse of the 2nd Republic with the overthrow of the government by the Buhari led military Junta in December, 1983. The coming to power of this administration was very much welcomed by the Nigerian public. This was largely due to the total disaster of the Shagari administration. The new government was well received more so as it claimed to have been the offshoot of Murtala administration. The administration came with the purpose of restructuring and bringing the economy back to sound footing. It also vigorously sought to institutionalize a new ethic of National leadership based on discipline, public accountability and integrity. There was also more commitment to the polisaro and recognition of the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic. Other policy issues, particularly the expulsion of aliens and the closure of Nigerian borders were received with mixed feelings by the neighbouring countries.</p> <p>However, Buhari’s anti – West Posture was remarkable, as it demonstrated its autonomy and status in decision making. Nigeria’s diplomatic relations with such powers as United States and United Kingdom became ruptured. In all these instances, Nigeria demonstrated to the rest of the World that she was not ready to take insults or directive from any country big or small, The regime at the end suffered “Support Erosion” with its human right abuses, a situation which made it easy for it to be overthrown. The Babangida government that succeeded the Buhari regime was described as a Liberal/benevolent military regime especially at its infancy. The administration like its predecessor was committed to economic restructuring which informed its choice of the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP). The programme had adverse effects on the life of Nigerians, and as expected had serious implications on the country’s external relations. The regime’s handling of the bombing of Libya by the USA was heavily criticized so also was the regime’s OIC policy which almost precipitated serious internal upheaval. It was apparent that the government under the guise of economic diplomacy succeeded in playing into the hands of the Western powers as its economic programme could be said to be anything but humane. The failure of Babangida to respect the peoples mandate with the annulment of the June 12 Presidential election’s result, after endless political transition led to the demise of the regime.</p> <p>Following the annulment of June 12 presidential election in 1993, the interim government which was put in place by General Babangida on 26th, August, 1993 did not enjoy the support of a wide range of Nigerians. General Sani Abacha’s intervention on 17th November, 1993 was therefore very timely and inevitable given Nigeria’s drift towards anarchy and disintegration During the Abacha regime, development between China and Nigeria was one of the most prominent aspects of the shift in Nigeria’s foreign policy. At this time Nigeria and China entered into different agreements, which allowed China to become involved in oil</p> <p>production, refurbishment of the long – neglected Nigeria Railway Corporation, the dredging of Seaports at Calabar and Warri and the development of Mass – housing projects.5 Abacha’s foreign policy thrust shifted to Asia, failing to realize that in a globalized world, aligning Nigeria with Asia alone is inadequate. The political heat from both home and abroad continued until Abacha died on 8th June, 1998. Following the death of Abacha, General Abubakar Abdulsalam (rtd)</p> <p>took over as the Head of State of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He succeeded in conducting a peaceful, free and fair election that finally brought Olusegun Obasanjo as the President and Commander-in- Chief of the Nigerian Armed Forces on May 29, 1999. Obasanjo’s foreign policy under democratic rule has been underlined by Nigeria’s return to a place of prestige in the International Community. Particularly of interest in this research is the influence of domestic politics on Nigeria’s foreign policy under Obasanjo’s Civilian administration (1999 – 2003).</p> <p>1.2 Objective of Study</p> <p>To assess the internal factors that affect Nigeria’s foreign policy.</p> <p>To examine the principles of globalisation and how it affects the country</p> <p>To examine the different government response to position the country in the world by formulating policies to take advantage of globalisation and the challenges facing them.</p> <p>To examine how the forces of globalisation has restrained Nigeria’s foreign policy and economy?</p> <p>To examine the influence of Domestic politics on Nigeria’s foreign policy under Murtala/Obasanjo’s militarys administration.</p> <p>To proffer solutions on how to improve on Nigeria’s foreign policy.</p> <p>1.3 Significance of Study</p> <p>The study reviews Nigeria’s military rule in 1975-1979 and how it led to improved country image abroad and allowed the country to take more active and productive roles regionally and on the global stage, Murtala/Obasanjo however has travelled to many parts of the world to restore Nigeria’s poor economic implementation led to the breakdown of relations. However this study will contribute to the growing body of knowledge in globalisation and its linkage with foreign policy and will therefore aid researchers who might want to carry out research in related areas.</p> <p>1.4 Scope and Limitation</p> <p>The study examines the linkage between foreign policy and globalization under the Murtala/Obasanjo regime in the period of (1975-1979). It is also limited in part to the information available from books, journals, books and internet resources. It shall be within the frame work of the economic policies with the international community.</p> <p>1.5 Research Methodology</p> <p>For the development of this work and its relevance or contribution to existing works, Articles, text books were consulted. Data which contributes to the development of this research was also gathered.</p> <p>This research work will make use of historical research method. Hence, findings from secondary sources are sourced; the secondary sources include written documents such as government publications, documentaries and newspapers. Added to these are descriptive accounts of experts on the impact of globalization and domestic politics on Nigeria’s foreign policy. Desk study will also be made with those considered authorities in the field of history, political science and international relations to complement the other sources. Furthermore, this research work depends largely on archival materials both online and offline. Official publications cited on the websites will also be used. Books, journal articles, conference proceedings, seminar papers and finally other related publications will be used in gathering secondary information for this research.</p> <p>1.6 Literature Review</p> <p>For the purpose of this research we shall make use of the principle of dependency theory which appeared in the 1950s as a critical reaction to the conventional approaches to economic development that emerged in the aftermath of World War II. According to Dos Santos, 2002, there are two dependency theory traditions. The first is the Marxist influenced by Paul Baran and Paul Sweezy, and developed by André Gunder Frank with important ramifications in the works of Samir Amin, Theotônio dos Santos, Arghiri Emmanuel, and Aníbal Quijano. The second dependency tradition is associated to the Structuralist school that builds on the work of Raúl Prebisch, Celso Furtado and Aníbal Pinto at the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC). The dependence theory believes that developing countries depend on the developed countries for support. The poorer countries are underprivileged. The dependence theory shall be utilized in analyzing Nigeria and its developmental policies in the face of a globalizing world.</p> <p>Both groups would agree that at the core of the dependency relation between center and periphery lays the inability of the periphery to develop an autonomous and dynamic process of technological innovation. The lack of technological dynamism, and the difficulties associated with the transfer of technological knowledge are the main cause of the underdevelopment of the periphery with respect to the center. The main contention between the two groups was ultimately related to the possibilities of economic development in the periphery.</p> <p>The existing wide disparities between the developed and the underdeveloped economies make globalization a tool for dampening the industrialization process, and by extension, retarding the growth and development of underdeveloped economies. Trade liberalization, the cardinal instrument of globalization ensures that industrialized countries have access to world markets, which enhances further industrialization of industrialized countries while incapacitating the industrialization process of the underdeveloped economies.

It will also suggest how areas of conflict could be resolved by both countries. This project research also hopes to contribute to the academic literature on Nigeria’s foreign policy through coverage of a turbulent period in Nigeria – Cameroon history.</p> <p>Following the judgement by the International Court of Justice that ceded 33 Nigerian villages around Lake Chad and some in the South-Eastern border with Cameroon which included Bakassi Peninsula, which is known to be very rich in oil, Nigeria – Cameroon relations have been affected by the judgement made by the International Court of Justice in 2003. The political relations between Nigeria and Cameroon since independence have been in a state of flux. The initial peace enjoyed by the two countries (Nigeria and Cameroon) as members of the Conservative Group of African States which formed the Monrovia Group in the years immediately after independence in 1960, soon shifted from periods of pretentious friendship and cooperation to cold war and even military confrontation. It has been underlined that by the virtue of a common border and the controversial boundary demarcation between Nigeria and Cameroon, the relationship between the two countries have been marred by constant and severe border conflicts.</p> <p>Nigeria – Cameroon relations have been marred by border disputes which is a colonial creation. This does not mean that there was no frontier existing before the coming of the colonial powers, however, the border as we know it today evolved from the arbitrary manner in which African borders were created. The problems that bedevilled the creation of this border were neatly handed over to both countries at independence. What ensued after independence and the post-plebiscite era was constant border clashes. Consequently and in realization of the dangerous dimension the border clashes may lead to, the International Court of Justice judgement in 2003 has put settlement machinery into motion by both governments.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION:</p> <p>BACKGROUND TO THE NIGERIA-CAMEROON CRISIS</p> <p>The boundary dispute between Nigeria and the Cameroon Republic arising from their long, but ill-defined border (1680 kilometres or 1050 miles) is of colonial origin. However, it has remained a source of conflict in the direct bilateral relations of the two countries since their independence. In one form or the other, the dispute has engaged the attention of almost all Nigerian governments since 1960. Many informed Nigerians believe that the Balewa government in the First Republic lost an opportunity to resolve the dispute to Nigeria’s maximum satisfaction in 1960-1961. That opportunity, they claim, was lost because of a myopic and fratricidal conception of national interest in Nigeria’s domestic politics. That loss continues to haunt to date particularly with respect to the maritime section where its acclaimed vital security and strategic interest stand threatened, and also where Nigeria continues to suffer the humiliation of seeing the Cameroonian authorities administer a territory in the disputed area whose population is 90 percent Nigerian nationals.1 Ironically, what was considered a national blunder in the immediate independence period was almost re-enacted in 1975, this time more consciously, when the Gowon administration signed the Maroua agreement with president Ahidjo’s government in Cameroon, an agreement which, effectively would have ceded the channel of the Calabar River and a portion of the Cross River estuary to the Cameroon. As it turned out, the Maroua agreement is null and void in law as it was never ratified by the Nigeria, leaving open the prospect of new form of arrangement with the Cameroonians for solving the dispute in a mutually beneficial manner to both sides.2</p> <p>The dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria over the Bakassi Peninsula has assumed great prominence because of its richness in oil. It is important to note, however, that the case of Bakassi is only one element in the dispute that extends to the land boundary between Nigeria and Cameroon from the Lake Chad region to the Coast. This long standing dispute over the ownership of the Bakassi Peninsula which was apparently laid to rest by the ruling of the International Court of Justice provides an example of judicial arbitration at the international level. The ownership of the Bakassi Peninsula was a protracted dispute that involved several attempts by leaders and representatives of both countries to resolve although without success. Indeed, such has been the doggedness of both countries to their claims that it witnessed the eruption of violence on a number of occasions.3</p> <p>In terms of geography the Bakassi Peninsula, is a network of islands and creeks situated between latitudes 4,050 and 4,025 north. It is bounded to the North by the river Akpa Yafe. Its western limit lies at approximately 8043 East of Greenwich. To the west lies the estuary of the Cross River, into which flows the Akpa Yefe. To the East of Bakassi lies the Riodel Rey estuary. To the South of Bakassi lies the South Atlantic ocean, known in this region as the Gulf of Guinea, consisting of the Bight of Benin and the Bight of Bonny. The Bakassi Peninsula itself is transverse by numerous channels and creeks of varying sizes and navigability.4 Transportation around the peninsular is mainly by water. At its widest point the Bakassi is approximately 28 kilometres across. The total concluded by or under the authority of the British Consul, Edward Hewett.</p> <p>The European imperial powers used the concept of “protectorate” as the legal basis for much of their activity in Africa, acquiring protectorates on the basis of treaties of protection between themselves and the kings and chiefs of the protected lands. This system effectively met the European power’s needs for a degree of control in their protectorates, which excluded that of their rivals, while at the same time leaving in place the local authority of the kings and chiefs within their territories. The traditional ruling class was a recognized feature of the pre-colonial Nigerian reality. The exact number of these pre-colonial empires, kingdoms, caliphates and autonomous communities cannot easily be determined, and varied from period to period. Furthermore, the size, character and form of these traditional political units were not uniform.5 Some were as large and populous as some African states today, while the influence and activities of others were limited. The kings and chiefs of old Calabar however, constituted a very powerful polity wielding considerable influence and authority extending even to Victoria in Cameroon. During the pre-colonial period, these traditional authorities exercised complete sovereign power over their people and territory. In some pre-colonial societies, political power was centralized in the office of the traditional ruler while in others it was dispersed to a variety of smaller units.</p> <p>However, the dispute over the Bakassi peninsular is product of a number of contradictions. First, there is a clash between tradition and modernity. The pre-colonial history of the ancient kingdom of Calabar is haunting the post-colonial reality of contemporary Nigeria and Cameroon. Secondly, there is the tension between cartographical fact and cultural reality: the map is in conflict with the people. Third, there is conflict between the dictates of abstruse international law and the existential imperatives of struggling humanity. Fourth, there is a gap between the concept of citizens.6</p> <p>In pre-colonial time Bakassi was under the ancient kingdom of Calabar which in 1914 became part Nigeria, under British rule. The people of the main settlement in the Bakassi peninsula owned allegiance to the Obong of Calabar. It was therefore, the Obong of Calabar that placed not only the kingdom of Calabar itself, but also Efiat and Idombi (in the peninsular) under British protectorate via a treaty of September 10, 1884. The chiefs of Efiat and Idombi were co-signatories to the treaty. However, subsequently, through a series of bilateral treaties and other legal instruments, the British ceded the territory first to Germany and then placed it under the mandate of the League of Nations and the trusteeship of the United Nations. Meanwhile, the British protectorates in Nigeria including the Kingdom of Calabar were merged with its colonies in the area, as one integrated British colony. Later, largely due to the political errors and indifference of Nigerian politicians, the Republic of Cameroon obtained the Bakassi peninsula in the process of a plebiscite conducted by the United Nations in 1959 and 1961.7 By the same process, Nigeria also obtained some territories which formerly belonged to Cameroon. In particular, the critical legal instruments that changed the status of the peninsula and its inhabitants were the following:</p> <p>1)         The agreement between the United Kingdom and Germany signed in London on March 11, 1913;</p> <p>2)         The Anglo-German protocol signed in Obokun, on April 12, 1913;</p> <p>3)         The exchange of letters between the British and German government on July 6, 1914; and</p> <p>4)         The endorsement in 1961, by both the United Nations General Assembly and the International Court of Justice, of the result of the plebiscites conducted in Northern and Southern Cameroon and February 11 and 12, 1961 and the diplomatic note accompanied by Nigeria, in 1962 accepting the result of the plebiscite.</p> <p>Cameroon was a German territory ceded after the first World War to the League of Nations at the 1919 Versailles peace treaty that ended the first World War and later ceded to the United Nations in 1945 and the British. The Eastern part of Cameroon was administered by the French while the western part by the British.8 For administrative convenience the British government placed the western part under Nigerian colonial government before Nigerian independence. It started soon after Nigeria’s independence in 1960, over the exact location of the Northern borders, after the British Northern part of Western Cameroon (parts of the present Adamawa and Taraba States) had voted to join Nigeria and the Southern parts of the Western Cameroon voted to join French Cameroon.9</p> <p>Oil Factor: The discovery of oil in commercial quantities in Nigeria and particularly of offshore oil on the Nigerian side of the territorial waters in the Atlantic Ocean area called Bakassi peninsula, which is part of the Cross River State of Nigeria bordering Cameroon made Cameroonians envious of Nigeria’s oil wealth. The Cameroon Republic therefore, desperately started oil exploration along the borders, both on shore and offshore, and in so doing the Cameroonians started trespassing into Nigerian territory. Nigeria responded by establishing her boundaries on land and sea, and making firm arrangements for security of these boundaries through armed patrols. The boundary between Nigeria and Cameroon was seated between the British and German government since 1913 during the colonial days, even before the first World War started. Therefore the territorial waters of both countries were clearly defined and demarcated on a colonial map, which both Britain and Germany had endorsed. All independent African countries recognized at the level of OAU the inviolability of former colonial boundaries created by the European partition of Africa at the Berlin Conference of 1885.10</p> <p>In any case the subsequent extension of territorial waters brought a new dimension of the problem of maritime international boundaries. The Nigeria-Cameroon border dispute was aggravated in this case by the discovery of large deposits of oil under the sea in the Bakassi Peninsula area. The Bakassi Peninsula has always been rich in maritime resources and with the discovery of oil, the territory assumes a portion of land worth dying for. Cameroon however, took advantage of Nigeria’s pro-occupation with the civil war between 1967 and 1970 to start drilling for offshore oil in the disputed area in the Atlantic sea along the Nigerian border in the Bakassi peninsula. After the end of the civil war the two countries made efforts to settle the dispute when General Yakubu Gowon visited Cameroon in 1970 to discuss the issue with the former president Ahidjo of Cameroon. As a minister in the Gowon administration and an eye witness to the agreement former president Shehu Shagari said:</p> <p>The two leaders (General Yakubu Gowon and president Ahidjo) discussed the matter of border dispute between themselves behind closed doors, only the chief surveyors of Nigeria and Cameroon were invited in the secret meeting between the two presidents or heads of state. At the end of the negotiations the two leaders signed a communiqué and initiated a MDP which showed the boundary lines agreed by both of them with the understanding that the details were to be worked out later, it was not until 1975 that General Gowon met with president Ahidjo at Maroua in Cameroon when the final agreement on what was known as the Coker/Ngoh line were finally agreed upon and initiated by the two leaders.11</p> <p>It was understood that the agreement signed in 1975 by the two leaders would become law only after it was ratified by both countries  legislature. In the case of Nigeria the legislature at that time was the supreme military council under Gowon, but in the case of Cameroon, the elected legislature took no time in ratifying the agreement since it was mostly in their favour. The Nigerian Supreme Military Council under Gowon refused to ratify the agreement because it noticed serious anomalities in the agreement which gave away substantial part of what should have been Nigerian territory to Cameroon on the ground that Cameroon had already got some oil rigs placed in the territorial waters of the disputed area which Cameroon was not prepared to remove. It is believed that that General Gowon made this generous concession to the Cameroon in recognition of and appreciation of Cameroons stand behind Nigeria during the difficult period of the Nigerian civil war. However, members of the supreme military council, in the Gowon’s Administration believed that he ought to have shown Nigeria’s appreciation to Cameroon in some other ways, instead of surrendering (Gave Away) Nigerian’s rights and those of further generations to Cameroon.12</p> <p>The Nigeria –Cameroon border is the most sensitive security zone of all our neighbours, because of this unresolved border problems in the Bakassi peninsula and is also potentially very explosive issue in the relationship of the two countries, because Nigeria shares ethnic affinity in both the north and south west of Cameroon. For instance, 98 percent of the people who live in the Bakassi peninsula are Nigerians from the Cross River State. Access to Calabar port to the southern eastern coast of Nigeria is controlled by the Bakassi peninsula. The port serves both merchant and Naval shipping, which makes it strategically important to Nigeria. On many occasions the Cameroonian security guards the Gendarmes have killed Nigerians in the surrounding villages of the Bakassi peninsula.</p> <p>However, the dispute over the Bakassi peninsular is not only the product of redefinition of boundary by the colonial powers but more so a product of resource allocation and clash of tradition and modernity in which the pre-colonial history of the ancient kingdom of Calabar haunted the post-colonial reality of contemporary Nigeria and Cameroon. In pre-colonial times, the ancient kingdom of Calabar became part of Nigeria in 1914 under British rule. Among the many factors that contributed to the Nigeria – Cameroon conflict was the legacy of both the imperialist colonial rule and the neo-colonial regimes in African at the time, the imperialist-capitalist and the colonial masters like Portugal, German, France and Britain and their shrewd and selfish economic, political and strategic co-operations of the 19th Century acted as nursery for future African conflict. The ground work for such future conflicts in the region were laid through things like the divide and rule system of administration and the partitioning of African States and its peoples irrespective of the damage it caused to the peoples language, socio-political life and cultural affiliations and ancestral lineage. This selfish behaviour divided ethnic groups into territories controlled by the colonial lords and then stifled the reign of peace in the region as divided families opposed the system and fought for the unity of their families and friends. This response became rampart across the board in Africa as people objected the cruel and selfish destruction of their culture caused by the colonial masters. This selfish, mean and sneaky behaviour ignited many African conflicts especially the Bakassi peninsula case study. It is important to note that the primary cause of the conflict between Nigeria and Cameroon was the discovery of natural crude oils in the region. It is interesting to say that long before the discovery of oil in Bakassi, Cameroonians and Nigerians in the region lived in harmony although few squabbles were registered here and there. The reason both countries did not pay attention to Bakassi is in part because it was a remote area inhabited by people considered to be non-consequential. Notwithstanding, when oil and other natural resources and minerals were discovered in the peninsula, attention from both countries and also from their colonial connections was ignited, thus creating tension, argument and in some cases death. This is sad and really hypocritical because if oils was never discovered in this region, both regimes would have cared less about the region with its poor, remote, marshy and non-consequential inhabitants.13</p> <p>However, this boundary is a product of the Anglo-German treaties and agreement 1885 and 1913: and Anglo French agreement during the mandate and trusteeship period.</p> <p>THE ANGLO-GERMAN BORDER ARRANGEMENT</p> <p>The foundation of the conflict: Much of the current border between Nigeria and Cameroon was determined in a series of accords and agreement between the British and Germans, beginning with the accord of April – June 1885 that defined the German and British spheres of influence from the coast of the Gulf of Guinea. This agreement placed the dividing line on the right bank of the Riodel-Ray, which reaches the sea between 8042 East and 8046 east.</p> <p>In a bid to correct these flaws, the Germans and the British signed yet another agreement in 1890, which further modified the boundary. This time the Anglo-German spheres of influence were defined by a provisionary line from the head of Rio-del-Rey creek to a point on the British Admiralty chat at about longitude 808 East.</p> <p>On 14th April another Anglo-German accord was signed with the aim of clarifying the ambiguities of the previous one. It clearly stipulated the boundary between the British Cross River protectorate and the German Cameroons. In November 1893 a further agreement was reached that extended the border up to Lake Chad, and in March 1906 another accord was signed which defined the frontiers from Yola to Chad.14</p> <p>Despite the multiplicity of agreements, Britain and Germany failed to agree on a satisfactory border. While the Germans who had realised the coastlines strategic importance, insisted that the Akpa-Yafe River was the ideal natural dividing line, the British preferred Ndian River. As far as the British were concerned, the latter River formed the natural boundary between the Bantu peoples of the Cameroons and the Efiks of Nigeria. After a long negotiation the British reluctantly accepted the German preference, which was formalized in an agreement signed on 20 April 1906. The starting point of the new coastal boundary was the intersection of the channel linking king point with Bakassi point and the Akwa-Yafe River. Between may 1907 and October 1909, Britain and Germany exchanged a series of notes, giving more precision to the borders of their colonial possessions of Cameroon and Nigeria, from Yola to the Atlantic Ocean.15</p> <p>The last and probably most important border agreement was signed on 11 March 1913. It is particularly significant for at least three reasons. It was purportedly signed to correct the short comings of all the earlier agreements, as a result of the outbreak and outcome of World War II, this agreement turned out to be the last between the British and the Germans, and it has played a key role in all subsequent border negotiations and tensions between the two territories.</p> <p>Some key clauses of the 1913 agreement were specifically aimed at addressing sensitive issues surrounding the volatile maritime portions of the border, particularly relevant are articles 18, 19, 20, 21, 27 and 29. Article 18 defined the boundary line at the coast as follows: it follows the thalweg of Akpakorum River dividing the mangrove islands near iKang… It then follows the thalweg of the Akwa-Yafe as far as a straight line joining Bakassi point and king point.</p> <p>Conscious that the river might change its course article 19 stated that: should the thalweg of the lower Akwa-Yafe, upstream from the line Bakassi point, change its position in such a way as to affect the relative positions of the thalweg and the mangrove islands, a new adjustment of the boundary shall be made on the bases of the new positions as determined by a map to be made for this purpose. By establishing the thalweg of the Akpa-Yafe as the new maritime boundary between the two colonies, article 18 and 27-29 placed the Bakassi peninsula under German jurisdiction. However, there was uncertainty over the ownership of the peninsula should be lower course of the Akpa-Yafe River change.16</p> <p>This ambiguity was addressed by article 20, which stipulated that: should the lower course of the Akpe-Yafe so change its mouth as to transfer its waters to the Rio-del-Rey, it is agreed that the area now known as the Bakassi peninsula shall still remain German territory. The same condition applies to any portion of the territory now agreed to is being British, which may be cut off in a similar way.</p> <p>Article 21 further clarified the definition of the maritime boundary by stating that: from the centre of the navigable channel on a line joining Bakassi point and king point: the boundary shall follow the centre of the navigable channel of the Akpa-Yafe River as far as a three-mile limit of territorial jurisdiction. For the purposes of defining the boundary, the navigable channel of the Akpa-Yafe River shall be considered to lie whooly to the East of the navigable channels of the Cross and Calabar River.17</p> <p>Article 23 provided for free navigation between the open sea and the Akpa-Yafe, while article 25 gave Britain the right to develop the navigable channels of the Cross and Calabar Rivers from a three-mile limit landward. Article 36, on the other hand, protected the fishing rights of the native populations on the Bakassi Peninsula without however, diminishing German jurisdiction over the Peninsula.</p> <p>More importantly, the nationality of the border populations as affected by these boundary adjustments was addressed by article 27, which stipulated that: it is agreed that within six months form the data of marking the boundary, natives living near the boundary line may if they so desire, cross over to live on the other side, and may take with them their portable property and harvesting crops.</p> <p>This was the state of the Cameroon-Nigeria – a border when World War I broke out in 1914. Despite the apparently detailed nature of the Anglo-German treaty of 1913, the border was still ill-defined, which made the agreement difficult to implement. Arguably, the origins of the Cameroon-Nigeria border question could be traced back to the failure of the British and the Germans (who first colonized the area) to create a well defined and conflict free boundary. Following the war, the Cameroons were taken over by the British and the French. This led to new boundary arrangements between Cameroon and Nigeria.</p> <p>THE ANGLO-FRENCH BORDER ARRANGEMENT</p> <p>After Germany’s defeat, Lancelot Oliphant and George’s picot, representing the British and French Governments respectively, partitioned the former German Cameroon in February 1916, with France claiming four fifths and the British barely one fifth of the territory. This arrangement was formalized in March 1916 in what became known as the picots partition. Meanwhile on 17 March 1916, General Dobell “unilaterally” issued proclamation No. 10 that determined the boundary between the British and the French zones. On 10thJuly 1919 the British security of state for colonies, Lord Alfred Milner, and the French Minister of Colonies, Henry Simon, signed an agreement that essentially confirmed the accord of 4th March 1916. And in 1922 the League of Nations accepted the Anglo-French arrangement over former German Cameroon.</p> <p>The various Anglo-French accords from 1916 to 1919 did not alter the Cameroon-Nigeria border as laid down in the 1913 Anglo-German treaty, especially in respect of the maritime portions. Border discussion between London and Paris from 1919 to 1960 were largely limited to tiding the partition line between the British and French Cameroons. As regards the British Colony of Nigeria and British Cameroon, a kind of “no boundary mentality,” prevailed for much of this period. This was especially so as the British for the purposes of administrative convenience administered their portion of the Cameroon as an appendage to eastern Nigeria.</p> <p>In the minds of the British, Southern Cameroon was ethnologically part of the eastern region of Nigeria. And, to borrow from Adener, “the British acquired Southern Cameroon in order to extend the Eastern Nigeria boundary Eastwards, and in the process, fill the missing links of Eastern Nigeria. However, the plebiscite in the British Cameroons on 11 February 1961 revived the importance of ascertaining the Cameroon-Nigeria border, it brought about the first major change in the boundary line between Cameroon and Nigeria since the 1913 agreement. While the northern portion of British Cameroons became an integral part of the independent Federal Republic of Nigeria, the Southern part was reunited with the French speaking parts, however this did not affect the coastal boundary line between Nigeria and Cameroon Treaty of 1913.18</p> <p>POST-INDEPENDENCE BOUNDARY ARRANGEMENT (1961-75)</p> <p>Although Cameroon and Nigeria subscribed to the principle of the inviolability of colonially inherited boundaries, as prescribed by departing colonial powers and formalised in the OAU Charter, the governments of the two contiguous states were aware that their border constituted a potent seed of discord, especially in the aftermath of the controversial plebiscite in southern Cameroon in 1961. To forestall any dispute, a joint Cameroon-Nigerian border commission was created in 1965, shortly after independence. However, the commission had hardly begun its work when the Nigerian civil war broke out in 1966. It resumed its activities after the war, arriving at a number of landmark declarations on the border question.19</p> <p>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The aims and objectives of this project work are listed as follows:</p> <p>To analyze Nigeria – Cameroon relations under President Olusegun Obasanjo’s administration;</p> <p>To examine the International Court of Justice judgement and its impact on Nigeria – Cameroon relations;</p> <p>To examine issues that led to the settling up of a joint commission between Nigeria and Cameroon;</p> <p>To examine the impact of the 1913 Anglo-German Agreement on Nigeria and Cameroon; and</p> <p>To make appropriate recommendations in which Nigeria – Cameroon relations could be improved.</p> <p>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This research work will be limited to the issue of the Nigerian foreign policy towards Cameroon. For a time frame, I will be locating my research on from 1999 to 2007.

The western government feared that Eastern Europe would sink into chaos and this led western government to embrace a bold strategy in which they utilized their own military forces to help reconstruct the armed forces of former war saw Pact countries through non violent activities. T his gave birth to the term “defence diplomacy”2. Defence Diplomacy works not on the capacity of forces to impose their will but rather their ability to constructively engage their opposition and use cooperation to bring about a mutually desired   outcome3.<br/>    Nigeria’s approach to sub-regional security has been largely influenced by the national role conceived for it in international relations by its leaders. This perspective has propelled Nigeria to the centre stage of African Affairs generally and in West African security matters in particular4. In the past few decades, member states of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have had to contend with quite a number of security problems, the type which was not envisage when the treaty establishing the organization was signed in 19755. At the first session of the ECOWAS Standing Committee under the leadership of Nigeria from 7th to 8th August 1990, the principle of non-intervention was waved aside, considering the tragic situation6. Since that initial period ECOWAS with Nigeria’s support,  has had to intervene again and again in other member state, it did so in Sierra Leone from 1997 to 2000, in Guinea Bissau in 1999 and in Cote d’Ivoire from 2002 and indeed with crisis that engulfed the centre Mano River Basin.7<br/>    Thus, Nigeria could be appropriately considered a driver of security policy in West Africa. This is because of the loosely structured defence system, for which only Nigeria has the size, logistic resources and experience to serve as the core of an ECOWAS rapid deployment force. The role in this regard is quite broad, including conflict resolution through peace-keeping and peace support operations and mediation of political crisis in the sub region, along with personal diplomatic efforts.<br/>Aims and Objectives<br/>    This research work is focused on Nigeria as a military power in West Africa. The policies Nigeria executed that showed her as a military power from (1999 – 2007) in international diplomacy, and also the challenges and obstacle Nigeria faces as a military power in West Africa.<br/>Methodology<br/>This research work will consist of two methods of writing, namely:<br/>Primary and secondary sources of information gathering;<br/>Primary Source:<br/>    The primary source will be oral interview from military personnel, journals and other relevant materials.<br/>Secondary Source:<br/>    The secondary source of information will be text books, Journals, articles and other relevant materials. Thus a comprehensive work will be done in this research work.<br/>Literature Review<br/>    The work of Gregory Winger in his book “THE VELVET GAVNTTET” A Theory of Defence Diplomacy, talks about defence diplomacy also known as military diplomacy. His work seeks to resolve the conceptual ambiguity surrounding defence diplomacy by formally integrating the practice into the broader study of power and international statecraft. He identifies defence diplomacy as a variant of soft power and it is used to help government achieve their international objectives. Also in the proceedings of a conference organized by the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs in Collaboration with the Friedrich Ebert Foundation on “NEPAD in the Nigerian Dock”, insights on issues that are pertinent to the Nigerian position on the successful implementation of NEPAD and how it seeks to provide a home grown solution to internal demands for development, national reconstruction and reconciliation, democracy, good governance, as well as peace and security, and Africa achieving a substantial growth in the 21st century. Chapter six talks of NEPAD and the human security,  and  what NEPAD has to offer to the African people in order to reduce upsurge in intra-state conflict in Africa, which is connected with the rapid collapse of human security. NEPAD constitutes a concept between African leaders and their people.<br/>     In the book, PEACE KEEPING AS A SECURITY STRATEGY IN AFRICA CHAD AND LIBERIA AS CASE STUDIES, by M.A. VOGT and L.S AMINU eds. Volume 1 and 2 indentified that a in a world of increasing demand for peace making, peace keeping and post conflict peace building, Africa can no longer afford to abandon the management of crisis in Africa to external factors. Africa therefore, needs to develop strategies for the management of conflict and crisis, and participate in the search for solutions to conflicts in Africa and the rest of the world. The great and complex problems of peace-keeping operations have now mushroomed, and some instances seem to have taken some character of peace enforcement, yet it is important to maintain the differences between peace keeping and peace enforcement. <br/>    The book analysis the Liberia and Chad conflict and the role in which Africa played in these conflict through OAU, ECOWAS and ECOMOG, also the role played by Nigeria in peace keeping and conflict resolution in these two countries.

The other sister groups are Ebira Koto and Ebira Mozum (Koyi State), Ebira panda, Ebira Oje Toto (Nassarawa State), Ebira Etuno (Edo State) Ebira Agatu (Benue State) Ebira Oloko (Ondo, Oyo, Osun, States).1 Written records about the origin of the Ebira people were these compiled from place sources by the British colonial administrator in early 20th century. <br/>    The Ebira through oral tradition, trace their descent to Wukari (in the present Taraba State) where they were constituent part of the Kwararata confederation in about 1680 AD, they (along with the Idoma and Igala) migrated out of Wukari a chieftaincy dispute. The Ebira later split into various groups and settled in different locations between 1680 and 1750 AD.<br/>    The Ebira Tao first sojourned with the Igalas at Idah but later crossed the River Niger and settled at Ebira Opete located the vicinity of Upaka in Ajaokuta Local Government Area (L. G. A) The “Father of the Ebira Tao who led them to his premier settlement in Ebira land was Itaazi. Itaazi had five (5) sons who all later migrated from Ebira Opete and were the founders of the various district in Ebira land. The children and the districts they founded are Obaji (Eyika), Adaviruku/Ohizi (Adavi) Ododo (Okeli) Uga (Okengwe) and Ochuga/ Outu (Ihima). His daughter named Ohunene settled in Eganyi district members of the various clans in Ebiraland are descendants or the children of Itazi. Ohizi had five (5) children who progenitors of the five (5) traditional Adavi clans named after them. These are Upopo-Uvete (Apasi), Uka, Idu (Aneku), Adeyika and Uhwani. A migrant group from Eganyi known as Ezi- Onogu clans is also found in Adavi the sons of Ododo who are the ancestors of Okeli clans were Okovi Ovevi and Enwgukonyai. Obaji the founder of Eyika had ten children named ohiaga, Iyewe, Avassa, Ehemi, Anchi, Epoto, Egiri, Ubobo, Ogu, and Eyire. Uga of Okengwe had two sons whose children constitute the present Okori and Aguda group of clans. <br/>    Due to a sizeable concentration of other Ebira clans in Okengwe district, they formed a socio-political coalition known as Ada-ehi-Ochuga had six (6) children and their descendents make up the six clans in Ihima. These are Emuni, Oha/Idu, Ohu eta, ure, Ohongwa and Odumi.2 The seventh clan is Akuta who migrated from Okengwe. Though Itaazi’s daughter name Ohunene was the founder of Eganyi not all the clans there are descended from her. Eganyi clan are Ede, Esugu, Ehede, Ogu, Onoko, Idu, Anavapa and Ogodo. The Aniugere who are skilled craftsmen are found in all districts. They are however more concentrated in Okengwe and Adavi districts.<br/>    “Eche Ovi” is a new yam festival celebrated only in two districts in Ebira land. These are Ihima and Eganyi. During the festival, traditional worshipper make sacrifices in the secrets groove of Ori (deity) high up in the mountain to show gratitude for its protection and provision of bounteous harvest. The worshippers carry long canes with which they whip one another in turns without any one exhibiting any sign of pain. This is a mark of strength or manhood. Another important attractive of the festival is the delightful ‘Echori’ music in which female singers features prominently. Only after the festival can one eat or sell new yam in the market as it is a taboo to do so before the festival in Ihima and Eganyi.<br/>    This is a night masquerade festival which is the end of the Ebira calander year and the beginning of a new one.<br/>    Ododo is popularly acclaimed to be the initiator of this masquerade festival. The Akalapa masquerade in heading the beginning of the festival often says “Irayi Ododo Osigu, Irayi akatapa osi gu eech. Osa yeeeh!” which mean “the year of the Ododo has ended the year of Akatapa has ended. Here is another year. The festival begins with a festival eve in which folk singers (Ome Ikede) perform to the delight of both men and women. The following day the real festival in which masquerades sing and dance to entertain people from dusk to down takes place. It is restricted to men only so all women stay indoors throughout the duration of the festival. All dead relatives are believed to return to an earth on a visit this night, so woman prepare delicious ‘Apapa’ (beans read) and he-goat meat of the visitors. The women also at time monetary gift with the men for the visiting dead relatives, trust men, the meals and gifts are properly and neatly delivered to the beneficiaries who only the men have the privilege of seeing and interacting with the spirit.3<br/>Aim and Objectives<br/>    The research work is aims at revealing the impact of western culture on the Ebira people of Okene, it also aims at revealing the socio-economic and political development of the Ebira people in pre-colonial time, its influence inter-group relation between the Ebira people and their neighbours.<br/>Scope of Study<br/>    The research work will cover a brief history and geographical location of the Ebira people, the traditional and socio-cultural development in Ebira land in pre-colonial times, the influences of Western culture and Christianity on the Ebiria people.<br/>Literature Review<br/>    In Festus Ojo work titled “The History of the Okene People”4 This book examined the geography of Okene land in Nigeria and the people who occupy that region, according to Festus Ojo stated that the Ebira people are republican by nature, outspoken and very hard working farming and cloth weaving are occupations for which the Ebira are well known. They are presently spread in Five Local Government Area of Kogi State namely: Adavi, Okene, Okehi Ajaokuta and Ogori-mangongo. A sizeable number is also found in Lokoja Local Government Area and Oyo State.5<br/>    According to Adavi Mayaki works titled, “The Culture of the Ebira People”6 he examined the Ebira tradition, the men does not walk to the parents of the woman to disclose his intentions his parents or elders mostly the women do this by going to the lady’s parents to introduce themselves and also to inform them of their reason for coming to the house. The amount to be collected as bride price is also agreed upon by the parents of the bride and it depends to a large extent, on the financial strength of the man.7<br/>    According to Joseph Okeli works titled. The Iron culture and Ebira People8 this work examined the numerous potentials of the Ebira land, he also elaborate on the traditional migration story of the Ebira people, as stated “the Ebira through oral tradition, trace their decent to Wukari (in the present Taraba state where they were a constituent part of the kwararata confederation. In about 1680 AD, they (along with the Idoma and Igala) migrated out of Wukari a chieftaincy dispute.9<br/>    Also in this category is P. A. Igbafe article titled Benin in pre-colonial Era10. The author takes an historical analysis of the entity or state called Benin in her pre-colonial era.11<br/>    Another work to be examined is an article by J. I Osagie titled “Nigerian History in pre-colonial times Southern Nigeria.12 Where he discusses the pre-colonial history and peoples of Southern Nigeria. The period according to the author was when major empires like Oyo, Benin and Igbo state emerged in the area. He discusses that Benin, more than any other ethnic group has played major roles in the history of Nigeria.<br/>    Another literature that was consulted in the course of this essay is the book also by P. A Igbafe titled Benin under British Administration.13 Where he narrated how the white men came to Benin and publicly declared that overanin is no longer the king of Benin. The book discusses the attempt to strip the Oba of his erstwhile political influence which was to be rounded off by moor’s calculated plan of a one year tour with Oba Ovnramwen and two other Benin chiefs to old Calabar, Lagos and some parts of Yoruba Land. The tour was probably designed also to give Ovonramwen an insight in to the government of other territories under British rule. Chapter ten discuses clearly that the immediate concern of the British officers after the capture of Benin City was the economic exploitation of the natural resources and the forest wealth of the kingdom.14<br/>    Another work to be examined is RE Bradbury’s book titled “The Benin Kingdom and the Edo speaking people of South Western Nigeria.15<br/>    Where he writes that Benin City is called Edo by its inhabitants and in certain contexts individuals from all parts of the kingdom will refer to themselves as Oviedo (Child of Edo) or Ovioba (Oba’s subject). He also writes that contrast with all other Edo-speaking areas there are many villages in the Benin Kingdom whose inhabitants have no tradition that their ancestors came from elsewhere, and that some informants speak vaguely of a general migration from the east and other trace everything back to Ife a tendency which may simply follow from the fact that Ife is the accepted origin of the present ruling dynasty. The author also discusses the main features of economy markets and the political system of the Benin people.16<br/>Methodology<br/>    The method of writing research work will be primary and secondary sources. The primary sources will be oral interviews archival document, newspapers, and documentary while the secondary sources will be textbooks, articles, and journals e.t.c<br/>Chapter Outline<br/>Chapter One: Background to Study: <br/>    The chapter gives an introduction to the whole project, emphasis are placed on the mode by which the project would be undertaken which includes the justification of the research, the aims of the project, the scope of the study, methodology and the literature review for the construction of the intended project.<br/>Chapter Two: A Brief History of Ebira Peoples: <br/>    This chapter provides a history of the Ebira people. It shows where they came from, where they settled before relocating to their present location now. Their socio-political structures evolved in the pre-colonial era would also be examined though in a minimal study. Also some of their festivals will be examined and also rulers who had great influence in Ebira. The political administration in the pre-colonial time will also be well explained.<br/>Chapter Three: The Family System in Ebira: <br/>    This chapter will attempt a critical and in-depth study of the family activities of pre-colonial Ebira. The different family structure the of Ebira people, their land tenure system, their forms of marriage, different dance and song used in marriage, burial and other occassion in the pre-colonial time.<br/>Chapter Four: The Impact of Western Culture on Ebira Socio-Political and Economic Institution: <br/>    This chapter would examine the western influence on Ebira land in their traditional political society, commerce and trade-investment and their socio-cultural activities. Also   Craft activities which the Ebira people involved themselves in the pre-colonial period. Also how the people formed different guild in other to trade will be examined; types of goods produced in these industries will also be well explained.<br/>Chapter Five: Conclusion:<br/>    This chapter concludes this project, it would give a general summary of how the Ebira people were in the pre-colonial time, and different socio-economic activities they involved in, how these activities help them to grow in the pre-colonial time. However, the conclusion is the total summary for the different socio-economic activities that has been explained above in the pre-colonial time of Ebira people. Also the impact of western influence upon Ebira socio-economic and political activities would be discussed.<br/>Endnotes<br/>F.

It also investigates the impact of the organization in promoting the economic well-being of member states. It also discusses the implication of security development for not only the region directly, but for the international community. <br/>The European Union (EU), as it stands to day, is a regional organization unlike any other in the world. It has for better or worse, been able to provide its citizens with economic and security stability for over half a century1. At the heart of this union lies an alliance between France and Germany, which many would have deemed impossible not long ago. The past 50 years, however, have transferred the union into a more integrated region whose goal has become that of furthering stability and democracy within the European continent. <br/>    The fall of the Berlin War in 1981 and the reunification of Germany started the ball rolling for a new series of Eastern European countries to join the union. Current members of the union welcomed the fall of communion with great enthusiasm and looked forward to a larger re-unification of Europe. The initial enthusiasm, however, was slowly tamed by institutional and security concern that reflected both fear that activities of  other continents at once would threaten so significantly disrupt the economic integration of the European Union any the fear that the Eastern European economics were developing the slowly to integrate smoothly into the larger European society. The adoption of the single currency and the growth and stability pact has created a new challenge for future securities, making the preparation process more wearisome and inevitably longer. <br/>    Europe has never been so prosperous, so secure nor so free. The violence of the first half of the 20th century has given way to a period of peace and security stability unprecedented in European history. The creation to this development. It has transformed the relations between European states and her citizens. European countries are committed to dealing peacefully with disputes and to cooperating through common institutions. Over this period, the progressive spread of the rule of law and democracy has been authoritarian regimes change into secure, stable and dynamic democracies. Successive enlargements are making a reality of the vision of a united and peaceful continent. No single country has is able to tackle today’s complex problems on its own. The United States has played a critical role in European integration and European security, in particular through NATO.<br/>Europe still faces security threats and challenges. The outbreak of conflict in the Balkans was a reminder that war has not disappeared from the European continent, and as such, the need for security becomes pertinent among the European states to units for collective security through the European Union. <br/>    Over the east decade, no region of the world has been untouched by armed conflict. Most of these conflicts have been within rather than between states, and most of the victims have been civilians. As a union of 28 states, with over 500 million people producing a quarter of the world’s Gross National Product (GNP), and with a wide ranges of instruments a global player2. In the last decade, European forces have been deployed abroad to places as distant as Afghanistan, East Timor and the DRC. The increasing convergence of European interests any the strengthening of mutual solidarity of the EU makes Europeans more effective actors in the world security. <br/>Aims and Objective of the Study<br/>    This research analyses: <br/>The organizational structure of the European Union. <br/>The role of the European Union in providing international peace and security. <br/>To examine the economic integration of the union. <br/>To afford a proper assessment of the international economic and security system of the European and.<br/>To examine the implications of the economic and security developments on European neighbouring countries, and measure taken and put in place to contain them amidst problems and challenges. <br/>Scope of the Study<br/>    The scope of the study shall cover the periods between 1993, that is, when the European Union (EU) was established, and presently 2016. It shall attempt to tough in passing relevant events that have occurred between 1993 to date. On the whole, it is the intention here to take bearing from the internal security activities of the EU member states and the international securities of its neighbouring states. In similar lane, this study shall touch on the implications and or the relationship between the European Union’s activities and the NATO, since its emergence. This will be in a passive sense since European Union, as a regional organization, has virtually its members as members of the United Nations.<br/>Methodology<br/>    This study utilizes the historical framework of scholars of international relations. Part of this work is written in narrative form to accord a deeper understanding of the historical implications of the topic or study. Otherwise, the study is analytical and draws materials from library sources, as well as secondary sources, such as comments, newspapers, magazines, books by different authors from journals, articles and online materials. <br/>In all, this research is limited mostly by online materials because the European Union (EU) as a regional organization, is in Europe and most of its activities which this study covers are updates from online.<br/>Literature Review <br/>    According to Anca Pussa in his book “European Union: Challenges and promises of a new enlargement3, regional organization are often hampered by international unwillingness to take charge, furthermore, they attempt to structure external stimuli in a way to making them compatible with their own international reasoning. Yet, challenges to security and economic policy alike, such as state fragility, natural disasters and post-conflict reconstruction, are likely to respect any institutional boundary or delimitation of competences. Thus, actors in international relations and global developments in general and the European Union (EU) in particular are constantly compelled to find new ways in order to increase inter-institutional, as well as infra-institutional collaboration and to provide effective policy responses.<br/>    In the words of Snokpeka S.A.4.. The European Union developed out of the initial step taken by six West European countries, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxemburg and the Netherlands is establishing three communities with the aim of gradually integrating their economies and moving towards political unity. These three communities were the European coal and steel community (ECSC) the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC OR EURATIOM). On July 1st 1967, these three communities, though legally separated under their constituent treaties merged their three executives and councils in one commission of the European Community (EC) under a single treaty. <br/>    The economic integration of Europe which was the objective of the founding six nations of the above communities were reflected in the emergence of EC in July 1967. From the very onset also the founding six also had the aim of develop the European community into a political nation. The intention was transformed to action in February 7, 1992, when the treaty on European Union (the Maastricht Treaty) was signed and when it came into force on November 1, 1993. This political union was discernable from its provisions which called for monetary integration, the co-ordination of social policies and other steps to increase economic integration. <br/>    Economy and security are intrinsically linked and mutually reinforcing. The economic securities bridge has two dimensions: First, a politico-legal one as its suggests that there is need for sustained efforts to further improve coordinating coherence between distinct, but inter-locking policy areas. Second, it exposes a time dimension for there is need to marshal instruments that build bridges between securities or humanitarian interventions and long-term economic programmes. By all means, current debates on the new interfaces between security and economy have for more strongly emphasized “convergence in conceptual and practical policy terms. <br/>    According to Kuijper P.J., in his book titled “The law of EU external relations”, the European Union has positioned itself as a proponent of the “bridges” rather than the “gap” approach to foreign and developmental policies on security3. Being associated to the EU’s common foreign  and security policy (CFSP) ever since the Maastricht Treaty, the European commission, for instance, has been constantly pressing for an improved coordination between external relations. The commission has made an effort to frame the EC instrument for stability (IFS), or alternatively, the “security instrument” as the community’s flag-ship-like instrument whose main purpose is to address the internal and external security activities. Since January 2007, the IFS has been providing financial assistance to countries in situations of emerging crisis. consequently, it also is the key instrument for sustaining economy and security development. In terms of its objectives, the IFS is three pronged and distinguishes between a short term from a long term component. First, I situation of (emerging) crisis, it seeks to help to stability by providing an effective response to help preserve, establish or reestablish the conditions essential to the proper implementation of the community’s development and cooperation policies. <br/>    According to Gangle Stefan, in his book titled: Coping with the security-development; the European Union aims, in the context of stable conditions for the implementation of community cooperation policies in partner countries to contribute towards building the capacity to address specific global and trans-regional threats with a view of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and trafficking, terrorism and organized crime. <br/>    According to Goldstein S. Joshua, in his book titled “International Relations”, security has been constructed in terms of an intergovernmental paradigm and firmly anchored in the field of European political cooperation (EPC) since the early 1970, economic policy in term, has evolved as a shared competence of both the EU institutions and its member states and thus, patterns of mix governance involving supranational and intergovernmental features6.<br/>    In order to better understand the mixed governance, it is worthwhile to look at the place of security and economic  policy within the history of European integration. <br/> Endnotes<br/>Goldstein, S.

Often juxtaposed with this assertion is the sometimes parallel modern states vested with enormous authority in rule application and developmental enforcements. As Africa seeks to build and strengthen capable states, there is need to recognize the role of some traditional indigenous institutions such as the Age-grade in respect to their advisory , participatory and developmental role as well as mobilizing the population , promoting education and health care and not without inspiring respect for law and order. <br/>    Against this background, this study of Age-grade as a tool for community development in Contemporary Africa, a case study of Abiriba community is subjected to trace the unique origin of Age-grade institution as it has been a major tool in the development of the community as pioneered by their forefathers out of the quest to solve their immediate security problems in the community.<br/>    Uniquely organized, the Age-grade often referred to as (UKE) in Abiriba language has been structured in such  manner so as to ensure a peaceful coexistence in their abode and as such entrench the institution as a unifying belief system that must be observed by everybody. This has been the case such that governance and development of the people have gone on orderly for centuries through this indigenous system (Age-grade) of the people. More so the people had achieved a high level of indigenous technology and democratic government long before the advent of the foreigners’ credit to her indigenous traditional institution. Also many significant modern developments have taken place through the same means. These modern developments are easily noticeable from every aspects of the life of the people of the community. Yet the indigenous tradition of the people have remained arguably essentially intact and dynamic as they were centuries before European Christians and colonial peoples made contacts with Abiriba people.<br/>    However, it is striking that where as in many other communities of Africa, one reads of the massive devastations of African peoples customs and traditions by foreigners or the results of the reconstruction of devastations caused by foreign people’s ideas, customs and practices hence this project argues that every essential modern development in Abiriba was through the indigenous traditional system of the people (Age-grade) with facts provided.<br/>    With this, we will therefore try to put into writing as accurately as possible the large orally transmitted customs and practices of the Age-grade in Abiriba Kingdom, more so, judging from the developmental patterns of the communities surrounding Abiriba before the arrival of Europeans in the area, the Abiriba  Age-grade traditional system has remained a mystery to outsiders. Some have ascribed the much faster pace of development to voodoo, some supernatural powers or some Christian’s arrival in Abiriba and their proper assessment of the socio-economic strength of the customs and traditions of the people. However some scholars have generally agreed that God answered our Lord’s Prayer in Abiriba during the founding of the community.2 <br/>CONCEPT OF DEVELOPMENT<br/>There has been few concepts in social, political and economic thought which have been as ambiguous  as the concept of development .the  theoretical debates and and policy decisions concerning development have varied considerably and have sometimes stressed technological well being and education. <br/>    Generally , development is the progressive unfolding of the inner potentialities of a given reality. It is to  develop , that is to bring out to light ( existential, functional and epistemic) what was enveloped, folded or hidden. As it applies to a people , if we must get a clear  understanding of this research work, development is the integration as the various giving, natural, physical, acquired and human as a people towards the full working out permanently and cumulatively of their being as persons of their community and of their real productivity. Moreso to talk as development is to talk as the human being progressing in various aspects, socio-cultural, moral – religious, intellectual – spiritual, political –economical and scientific – technological development.3<br/>      1.2    AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>    This project is a study of Age-grade as a tool for community development in Contemporary Africa, A case study of Abiriba a community in Ohafia local government, Abia State, Nigeria.<br/>    In the early history of Abiriba Age-grade (UKE) as it is often called in Abiriba land was profoundly introduced in the community with its unique features such that in the contemporary time, the traditional institution had become the backbone behind probably all development in Abiriba.<br/>    This work aims to analyze the role of Age-grade in Abiriba with a view to understanding how it has been a tool for community development. With the information gathered, advocate strongly for its adoption in several other African communities.<br/>    Though little professional attention has been paid to the study of Age-grade in Africa, references have been made to it in some secondary documents; however this aspect of Abiriba study has not been taken before now, hence the intention of this work is to document this important aspect of Abiriba historiography using available source materials used in studying African history.<br/>    It is therefore hoped that this would make a meaningful contribution to the history of Abiriba ,Nigeria and Africa at large.<br/>1.3    SCOPE<br/>       For a proper historical interpretation, this work covers pre-colonial history of Abiriba up to the contemporary time within the context of Age-grade role to the advancement of the community.<br/>    To place the work in a perspective of historical analysis, it will be instructive to discuss the traditions of origin as well as the origin of Age-grade, more importantly, the socio-cultural, political and economical development offered by the Age-grade in the pre-colonial so as to give meaningful understanding of their role to the contemporary Abiriba.<br/>    Also examined is the nature and length of development in Abiriba that can be accrued to Age-grade. The scope of this work has promoted the search of different changes and developments as offered by individual Age-grade in Abiriba in time perspective. It has made the work very expensive, cumbersome and time consuming.<br/>1.4    LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>    Age-grade system is an age long socio –cultural Institution in Africa land; One of the oldest institution used in the administration of communities before the advent of the whites. Argued that one of the greatest achievements of the Age-grade system is healthy competition and assistance that members of the community give to each other and the fear of being sanctioned if any crime is being committed by an individual.4<br/>While Kalu Ogba a Journalist having taken a part in a research conducted by his newspaper Daily Times argued in his article that most Age-grade in Africa, even up to date, are embarking on development and upgrading of the infrastructural facilities of their  towns. He closely maintained that the Age-grade sometimes call for abrogation of some obvious practices and fight against juvenile delinquencies.5<br/>    Ejim Akuma on the other hand posits that it is a means of enrollment among the grownups in town.6<br/>    Kalu O. Uche observed in his own work that It’s a system whereby all males are put into various groups according to time of their birth for the purpose of rendering compulsory services to the community as recognized groups. Uche later instructively noted that though the communities around Abriba such as Igbere, Umuhu, Item, Nkporo, Ohafia, Abam and Edda have their people grouped according to their Age grades. These communities that share boundaries with Abriba do not have the Age grade system in the form it exists in Abriba. The reason for this development he argued could be traced to certain circumstances within the Abriba community and history.7<br/>    Oji Ukegbu Oji gave a unique argument in his work, The political history of Abriba, when he asserted that the introduction of the indirect rule for native administration in Nigeria by lord Lugard Fredrick after the amalgamation of the Southern and Northern protectorate in 1914 was indeed to all intents and purposes a modification of Abriba Age-grade system of community administration, in the sense that while indirect rule used Emirs in the North, the Oba’s in the West and Obis in the East for Native administration, the Age-grade system was and still is the machinery of commercial administration and mobilization in Abriba.8<br/>    Ijekpa Kalu Ijekpa, to him the Age-grade system emphasizes the sub-ordination of the individual to the society. “madu bu nke oha” the individual belongs to the society. He further maintained that the Age-grade system is a civilized master piece of socio-political science conceived by wise minds aimed at serving the community in war situation, home security situation and social services at peace time and in modern days community development services.9<br/>    However, in all of these, yet professor Elizabeth Isichei showed that in nearly all Igbo societies, the system existed in one form or the other. And it would appear that not only in the Igbo nation but also in East, central and South Africa is the system also practiced.<br/>    Okolo Ikechukwu in his work “the Igbo Age-grade and African traditional Religion in an international online multi-disciplinary journal, argued that Igbo age grade system is a social phenomenon which is organized in various places throughout Igbo land in order to give men and women common places in various Age-grade union; his observation contended that these members discuss matters that are peculiar to themselves and as a result make their situation better.10<br/>    Interestingly, some literature on Abriba studies and African studies have asserted their different views about the subject matter but none has distinctively tolled the line of assessing their role in community development within the context of social, economic and political changes or the time under discuss. This is the gap this work would fill in the historiography of Abriba with a careful approach in assessing the sole institution (Age-grade) that is predicated on the socio cultural, economical and political service to the people of Abiriba.<br/>    It is however pertinent to note that Abriba community until the early twentieth century remained a non literate community. There are at the moment insufficient written documents about the settlement and the stage of socio political development of the people of Abriba. However, Abriba people have a rich tradition on every aspect of the life of the people. Interestingly too, almost every aspect of the tradition can easily be evaluated to ascertain its accuracy.11<br/>    A lot of work has also been done concerning the use of the above data in writing the history of Africa or any other community. Jan Vansina’s work Oral tradition: A study in historical methodology is a significant contribution to the proper evaluation of African sources in writing African history.12<br/>    More so, the contribution of R. Cornevin in his paper, The African problems and character of African History, is also significant.13 <br/>ENDNOTES<br/> Kalu O.

According to Kalu Ezera, <br/>“when the country was first divided (into 12 states, the state retained its name and size).2<br/>Geographically, Bendel state comprises Edo and Delta state then called Benin province and Delta province. Benin province comprises: Akoko Edo division, Afemai Division, Benin Division, Ishan Division, while Delta Province comprises: Aboh Division, Ijaw Division, Isoko Division, Urhobo Division and Warri Division. In 1971, the regions population was estimated 3.5 million people scattered about in Nineteenth local government area with a land mass of 36,293 kilometer, in 1991 two states were created from Bendel state they are: Edo state and Delta state. 3<br/>In the book: Leadership by example, Emiator M. Osagie explains that the creation of the state could be traced back to the early days of British Colonial Administration of the country. The communities of the Bendel State, having close cultural and political ties that bond the various people in the community, there evolved a kind of group consciousness among the people. As this conscious group crystalised into group identify, political expressions for a separate region were put forward by representative from Bendel and Warri province at the regional conference held at Ibadan in 1950 to discuss the working of the Richard Constitution of 1946. 4<br/>From this point onward, determined effort were made by the people of the area of secure for themselves a separate state of their own. It is necessary to point out that the agitation for a separate state was not peculiar to the people of this area, because the majority in each region drew most   of its support in the legislations of its member from the same linguistics group. There was widespread fear among minority groups in the region that self government would facilitate their political and economic subjugation to the interest of the majorities. These fears led to the setting up of the Willinck  commission in 1957 (otherwise known as the minority commission), part of whose terms of reference was to examine the fear of minority in any part of Nigeria and propose means to alley them.5 <br/>The commission found as a matter of fact the fear expressed by the minorities were genuine but refused to accept that the fear could be removed by splitting the existing three regions into smaller regions. Instead, the commission included among its recommendation for protecting minorities provision in the constitution, a comprehensive list of fundamental human rights. In  addition, the commission recommended the establishment of minority and special area to promote social and economic progress in the areas.6<br/>An offshoot of this recommendation was the establishment of the Niger Delta Development Board, with headquarter in Port-Harcourt to cater for the social and economic development of the minority communities in the Niger Delta region. <br/>The idea of a separate state for the Mid-West Minority did not find favour with the Western Regional Government, rather, it went ahead after the 1957 constitution conference to announce the creation of a minority of Midwest Affairs, and the establishment of a Midwest Advisory Council with a MidWestern, Chief Anthony Ehahoro as the first Minister of Midwest Affair.7 <br/>In a prepared statement, the premier of Western Nigeria, Chief S.I Akintola announced in the House of Assembly on September 28, 1960 that his government had established a Mid –West Advisory Council. Like the later body, the functions of the Midwest Minority Council  would be allowed to exercise certain executive powers in regard to the Midwest. <br/>The aim was to foster a more effective way possible under the old Advisory Council further recognition of the right of the people of the Minority area to play a greater part in the planning and execution of all government schemes for the development and welfare of the area and of the need for their collaboration in getting government decisions to be understood and accepted by the people.8<br/>The federal constitution of 1960 otherwise known as the independence constitution included provision for the creation of new region from existing ones. Section 4(3) (a) and (b) provided that a resolution to create a new region must be passed by both Houses of parliament and supported by at least two-third of votes of all the members of each of the two Houses, and thereafter be approved by two Houses of a majority or each Houses of at least two region, including that of the region from which the new region is to be carved out.9<br/>Advantage was taken of this provision when on March 22, 1962, the following resolution was moved by the Prime Minister, AlhajiAbubakarTafawaBalewa and later passed by the House of Representatives and subsequently approved by the senate.10 That this house approves a  proposal for an alternative to section 3 of the constitution of the federation of Nigeria, for the purpose of establishing a fourth region within the federation of Nigeria consisting territorially of Benin province in Western Nigeria  including Akoko Edo District in Afemai Division and Delta province in Western Nigeria including Warri Urban township area.10<br/>The resolution having been passed as laid down under section 4(3) of the independence constitution, other requirements for the creation of a new region were specified in the independence constitution. Parliament enacted the Mid Western Region Act 1962 which in effect amended a section of the independence constitution by redefining the area of the Western Region out of which the new region was to be created. <br/>For the act to come into force, the legislatures of Northern and Eastern Region had to signify their consent as required by section 4(5) of the constitution. The same section also provided for the holding of a referendum before the act could have effect. The referendum was eventually held on July 27, 1963. The result showed that 89% of the qualified voters, i.e 29% more than the statutory minimum voted in favour of the Mid-Western Region Act 1962 which was subsequently brought into force on August 9, 1963.10<br/>The Mid Western Region legally came into existence with effect from that data, thus from the Western region, it became Midwest and subsequently Bendel State. <br/>EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN BENDEL STATE 1975-1979<br/>    The development of Education in Bendel State from 1975 began basically with a steady and substantial increase in primary school enrolment. This agenda continued until the introduction of the Universal Primary Education (UPE) in 1976.11<br/>    However, the increase in primary school enrolment in the Mid-Western Region (comprising Edo and Delta), was minimal. J.C.S Musaazi in his book, Planning and Development in Education said <br/>“Enrolment rose from, 1,124,788 in 1960, to 1,128,127 in 1976. Source statistics gotten from JSC book planning and development in Education”.<br/>    In January 1974, the then Head of State General Yakubu Gowon declared that Nigeria was to embark on a Nationwide programme of Universal Primary Education. In the third National Development Plan of 1975 – 1980, the Federal Government made provision for the sum of N300 million for the scheme and projected a pupil enrolment of 11.5 million by 1980. The Gowon’s government also allocated 200 Million Naira for the training of teachers for the programme. On the 6th of September 1976, the programme was launched. It provided for free universal primary education throughout the country and it was to become compulsory from 1979.12<br/>    The universal primary education scheme was a major contribution to educational development in Bendel State and indeed of immense benefit to the country in terms of mobilizing its human resources, adjusting its educational imbalances and providing equal opportunities and access to education for Nigerian children. <br/>    Statistics of primary school enrolment between 1975 - 1976 in Bendelstate was as follows = 151,048; 1976-1977=174,340, 1977-1978 = 180,211, 1978 – 1979 = 177,783. <br/>    However, there is one other significant point to note after the UPE year (1976-7), enrolment started declining, one of the problems which the UPE scheme faced, was lack of sufficient trained and qualified teachers, this situation is shown in the statistics below in Bendel State. <br/>    Between 1975-6 (pre-UPE) in Bendel State, the teaching  force was: Total number of teacher 1975 – 6 = 17,909 <br/>Number of grade II teachers (passed) 8,152 <br/>Number of grade II teachers (failed) 2,528<br/>Number of grade III teachers (passed) 599 <br/>Total number of trained teachers (P &amp; F) 11,279 <br/>Total number of untrained teachers = 6,630 <br/>Percentage of untrained teachers 37%<br/>    In 1976 – 7 (the UPE year) the position of the teaching force was as follows: <br/>    Total number of teacher 19,898 <br/>Increase over 1975 – 6         1,989<br/>Percentage increase        11.9%<br/>Total number of grade II teacher (passed) 8,585<br/>Total number of grade II teacher (failed) 2,692<br/>Total number of grade III teacher (passed) 483<br/>Total number of trained teachers     11,766<br/>Others trained                 8,138 <br/>Percentage of untrained teachers 40%.13<br/>Source: Secondary source, statistics gotten from JSC Musaazi book: planning and Development in Education Africa perspective pp.7—92. <br/>    The increase in the number of teachers seemed normal but there was still a significant percentage of untrained teachers. The increase in teachers does not seem to be disproportionately great. Many of the teaching staffs were still untrained. <br/>    The problem of untrained teachers was a common factor in Bendel State. The 40% of untrained teachers suggests that not enough teaching education programme were mounted before the UPE scheme was launched. By implication , all kinds of unqualified people were employed as teachers to cope with an increasingly large school population  brought about by the introduction of UPE. An appraisal exercise of the programme carried out in 1977 showed increase in pupils enrolment but, with immense shortage of untrained teachers, classrooms, equipment and funds.14<br/>    However, education at the secondary school level varied, the primary school leavers had many options from which to choose, he can proceed to a secondary grammar school, a secondary modern school, a comprehensive secondary school, a trade centre, a technical school or a teacher training college. The growth of secondary education was influenced by the expansion of primary education. However, the secondary school was faced with the problem of both quality and quantity of education. <br/>    The problem faced by secondary school education in Bendel State ranges from great shortage of trained graduate teachers in schools, professional incompetence, great indiscipline and lack of dedication, poor funding of science laboratories, lack of school facilities and equipments of among other study materials.15<br/>    However, despite the myriad of problems secondary schools in Bendel state received some expansion. In the various secondary schools, the secondary grammar school was the most popular, with its boarding facilities, it offered the best chanceof post-secondary educational advancement. As at 1975, there were 127 of such schools in Bendel state with 52,852 students enrolled. Secondary modern schools were particularly established in Mid-Western Region in the late 1950s, such schools had a programme lasting for only three (3) years. They offered courses in practical subjects such as metalwork, woodwork, agricultural science, domestic science, and needlework. Generally speaking these schools catered for those students who failed to gain admission to a secondary grammar school.16<br/>    Teacher training college is one of the keys to educational development and advancement in every country. No country can afford to expand her educational frontiers facilities and its development plan without recourse to growth of teachers training institute. There are 10 teachers training schools in Bendel state (Mid Western Region), with 4109 student enrolment as at 1975.17<br/>    In the area of higher education, the institute of technology was accorded the status of a full-fledged university by the National Universities Commission (N.U.C) on 1st July 1971, it was  later renamed the University of Benin, the Midwest Institute of technology offered courses on petrol chemical and industrial engineering, Auto-mobile engineering, Geographical and agricultural engineering, material engineering and medicine.18<br/>    Another higher institute in Bendel state as at 1975 was the Auchi Polytechnic, founded in 1964, it started as a technical college which was a gift from the British government to the then Mid-Western Region. It offer courses only up to the ordinary level in limited areas of engineering and businesses, in 1973, the Bendel state government upgraded the technical college to a full fledged polytechnic with the mandate to trained skilled manpower up to Higher National Diploma level in broad range of engineering sciences, environmental studies, Business studies,  Art and Design. <br/>    The college of Education, Abraka was another higher institution in Bendel State. It started as teachers training college during the colonial era, and became a full fledge college of education that awards Nigeria Certificate of Education (N.C.E) from 1971-1985. In 1981, it was affiliated to the University of Benin, Benin City and consequently offered degree programme from 1981 up to 1985 when it became the faculty of Education of the then Bendel state University with its main campus at Ekpoma.19<br/>    The introduction of the Universal Primary Education (UPE) in 1976, by the Gowon led administration set the stage for the development of education in Nigeria. The UPE led to the expansion of secondary schools to accommodate the mass graduation of pupils from primary schools. This also affected the increase in the teacher training colleges and the tertiary institutions.<br/> Endnotes <br/>1.    KaluEzera, Constitutional Development in Nigeria, (London: Cambridge University Press, 1964), p.42.<br/>2.    Ibid., <br/>3.    SegunAdesina, The Development of Modern Education in Nigeria (Ibadan: Heinemann Educational Books, 1988), p.127. <br/>4.    Emiantor M.

Supported by several international conventions and treaties (such as the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human rights in 1948), these include cultural, economic, and political rights, such as right to life, liberty, education and equality before law, and right of association, belief, free speech, information, religion, movement, and nationality. Promulgation of these rights is not binding on any country, but they serve as a standard of concern for people and form the basis of many modern national constitutions. Although they were defined first by the Scottish philosopher John Locke (1632-1704) as absolute moral claims or entitlements to life, liberty, and property, the best-known expression of human rights is in the Virginia Declaration of Rights in 1776 which proclaims that \"All men are by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity.\" <br/>The idea of human rights has been tackled in a number of ways in recent times, both in the course of diplomatic and political encounters across the globe. Human rights are commonly understood as “inalienable fundamental rights to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being. Human rights are thus conceived as universal (applicable everywhere). These rights may exist as natural rights or as legal rights, in both national and international law.1 the doctrine of human rights in international practice, within international law, global and regional institutions, in the policies of states and in the activities of non-governmental organizations, has been a cornerstone of public policy around the world.2 <br/>Stated in article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) states;<br/>All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and right. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.3<br/>Against this background, we can justifiably agree with Funmi Olonisakin who argues that the whole idea of human rights is based on the need to maintain freedom and justice among human beings with the expectation that ultimately peace and harmony can be achieved among peoples.4<br/>    Following from this, it is clear that a democratic nation like Nigeria has or should have as one of its objectives the protection of its citizens’ rights and ensure their freedom under the rule of law. For men who are granted political power will insist that liberty and equality are inevitable corollaries of democratic systems.5 But sadly enough, these are not given serious attention except theoretically. If every state is known by the rights it maintains, then we cannot sink in silence and watch ourselves being swept away by the hurricane of human rights abuse in Nigeria. Hence, it becomes imperative for us to interrogate the reality of the Nigeria case which stirs us in the face.6<br/>THE NATURE OF THE NIGERIA CRISIS<br/>Trade and Slavery<br/>    In order to assess the complex problem of freedom and human rights, it is important to examine the nature and dynamics of the Nigeria state. However, we cannot adequately speak of the emergence of Nigeria without allusion to the issues of trade and slave. It is on record that early Euro-American contact with Africans was first necessitated by trade, even though some westerners came to Africa under the auspices of missionary activities and personal exploitation in either case, these people had contact with Africans. At first a better system of trade was in vogue- Africans traded with the Euro-Americans in terms of valuable commodities such as gold, ivory etc. in exchange for tobacco, whisky, and clothing among others. The end of this era saw the beginning of slavery.7<br/>The Emergence of Nigeria<br/>Nigeria was created by the British colonialism bringing together its diverse peoples and regions in an artificial political entity. It was not unusual that the nationalism that became a political factor in Nigeria during the interwar period derived both from an older political particularism and broad pan-Africanism rather than from any sense of a common Nigerian nationality. Its goal initially was not self-determination, but rather increased participation in the governmental process on a regional level. Inconsistencies in British policy reinforced cleavages based on regional animosities by attempting simultaneously to preserve the indigenous cultures of each area and to introduce modern technology and Western political and social concepts. In the north, appeals to Islamic legitimacy upheld the rule of the emirs, so that nationalist sentiments there were decidedly anti-Western. Modern nationalists in the south, whose thinking was shaped by European ideas, opposed indirect rule, which had entrenched what was considered to be an anachronistic ruling class in power and shut out the Westernized elite.8<br/>The ideological inspiration for southern nationalists came from a variety of sources, including prominent American-based activists such as Marcus Garvey and W.E.B. Du Bois. Nigerian students abroad joined those from other colonies in pan-African groups, such as the West African Students Union, founded in London in 1925. Early nationalists tended to ignore Nigeria as the focus of patriotism; rather, the common denominator was based on a newly assertive ethnic consciousness, particularly Yoruba and Igbo. Despite their acceptance of European and North American influences, the nationalists were critical of colonialism for its failure to appreciate the antiquity of indigenous cultures. They wanted self-government, charging that only colonial rule prevented the unshackling of progressive forces in Africa. <br/>Political opposition to colonial rule often assumed religious dimensions. Independent Christian churches had emerged at the end of the nineteenth century because many European missionaries were racist and blocked the advancement of a Nigerian clergy. European interpretations of Christian orthodoxy also refused to allow the incorporation of local customs and practices, even though the various mission denominations themselves interpreted Christianity very differently. It was acceptable for the established missions to differ, but most Europeans were surprised and shocked that Nigerians would develop new denominations independent of European control. Christianity long had experienced \"protestant\" schisms; the emergence of independent Christian churches in Nigeria was another phase of this history. The pulpits of the independent congregations provided one of the few available avenues for the free expression of attitudes critical of colonial rule.9 <br/>In the 1920s’ there were several types of associations that were ostensibly non-political. One group consisted of professional and business associations, such as the Nigerian Union of Teachers, which provided trained leadership for political groups; the Nigerian Law Association, which brought together lawyers, many of whom had been educated in Britain, and the Nigerian Produce Traders Association, led by Obafemi Awolowo Ethnic and kinship organizations that often took form of a tribal union also emerged in the 1920s. These organizations were primarily urban phenomena that arose after large numbers of rural migrants moved to the cities. Alienated by the anonymity of the urban environment and drawn together by ties to their ethnic homelands – as well as by the need for mutual aid – the new city dwellers formed local clubs that later expanded into federations covering whole regions. By the mind – 1940’s, the major ethnic groups had formed such associations as the Igbo federal union and Egbe Omo Oduduwa (Society of the Descendants of Oduduwa), a Yoruba cultural movement, in which Awolowo played a leading role.  <br/>A third type of organization that was more pointedly political was the youth or student group which became the vehicle of intellectuals and professionals. They were the most politically conscious segment of the population and stood in the vanguard of the nationalist movement. Newspapers, some of which were published before World War I, provided coverage of nationalist views.10<br/>Conclusively, every society must have a conception of how it is related to other societies and how it is to conduct itself toward them. It lives with them in the same world, except for the very special case of isolation of a society from al the rest as it were during primitive ages. It must formulate certain ideals and principles for guiding its policies toward other peoples. A human being has rights only if she/he is to be other than ‘a’ human being, the person must in addition become an “other” human being. Then “the other” can treat him as their fellow human being. Undeniably, human rights are natural, in born and inalienable. They have a history and are acquired. They are increased and developed. Human rights have a universal common basis in human thought and community. They are differently interpreted, and their recognition and practice depend on the development of a common understanding of rights and freedoms.11  <br/>ENDNOTES<br/>T.

The United Nations includes 192 member countries and its main headquarters are located in New York City.1 <br/><b>History and Principles of the United Nations</b><br/>Prior to the United Nations (UN), the League of Nations was the international organization responsible for ensuring peace and cooperation between world nations. It was founded in 1919 \"to promote international cooperation and to achieve peace and security.\" At its height, the League of Nations had 58 members and was considered successful. In the 1930s its success waned as the Axis Powers (Germany, Italy, and Japan) gained influence, eventually leading to the start of World War II in 1939.2 <br/>The term \"United Nations\" was then coined in 1942 by Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt in the Declaration by United Nations. This declaration was made to officially state the cooperation of the Allies (Great Britain, the United States, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) and other nations during World War II. <br/>The UN as it is known today however was not officially founded until 1945 when the Charter of the United Nations was drafted at the UN Conference on International Organization in San Francisco, California. The conference was attended by 50 nations and several non-governmental organizations - all of which signed the Charter. The UN officially came into existence on October 24, 1945 after ratification of the Charter.3 <br/>The principles of the UN as explained in the Charter are to save future generations from war, reaffirm human rights, and establish equal rights for all persons. In addition it also aims to promote justice, freedom, and social progress for the peoples of all of its member states. <br/><b>Organization of the United Nations Today</b><br/>In order to handle the complex task of getting its member states to cooperate most efficiently, the UN today is divided into five branches. The first is the UN General Assembly. This is the main decision-making and representative assembly in the UN and is responsible for upholding the principles of the UN through its policies and recommendations. It is composed of all member states, is headed by a president elected from the member states, and meets from September to December each year. <br/>The UN Security Council is another branch in the organization of the UN and is the most powerful of all the branches. It has power to authorize the deployment UN member states' militaries, can mandate a cease-fire during conflicts, and can enforce penalties on countries if they do not comply with given mandates. It is composed of five permanent members and ten rotating members. The next branch of the UN is the International Court of Justice, located in The Hague, Netherlands. This branch is responsible for the judicial matters of the UN. The Economic and Social Council is a branch that assists the General Assembly in promoting economic and social development as well as cooperation of member states. Finally, the Secretariat is the branch UN headed by the Secretary General. Its main responsibility is providing studies, information, and other data when needed by other UN branches for their meetings.4 <br/>United Nations Membership<br/>Today, almost every fully recognized independent states are member states in the UN. As outlined in the UN Charter, to become a member of the UN a state must accept both peace and all obligations outlined in Charter and be willing to carry out any action to satisfy those obligations. The final decision on admission to the UN is carried out by the General Assembly after recommendation by the Security Council.5 <br/>Functions of the United Nations Today<br/>As it was in the past, the main function of the UN today is to maintain peace and security for all of its member states. Though the UN does not maintain its own military, it does have peacekeeping forces which are supplied by its member states. On approval of the UN Security Council, these peacekeepers are often sent to regions where armed conflict has recently ended to discourage combatants from resuming fighting. In 1988, the peacekeeping force won a Nobel Peace Prize for its actions. <br/>In addition to maintaining peace, the UN aims to protect human rights and provide humanitarian assistance when needed. In 1948, the General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a standard for its human rights operations. The UN currently provides technical assistance in elections, helps to improve judicial structures and draft constitutions, trains human rights officials, and provides food, drinking water, shelter, and other humanitarian services to peoples displaced by famine, war, and natural disaster.6 <br/>The UN plays an integral part in social and economic development through its UN Development Program. This is the largest source of technical grant assistance in the world. In addition, the World Health Organization, UNAIDS, The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, the UN Population Fund, and the World Bank Group to name a few play an essential role in this aspect of the UN as well. The UN also annually publishes the Human Development Index to rank countries in terms of poverty, literacy, education, and life expectancy. For the future, the UN has established what it calls its Millennium Development Goals. Most of its member states and various international organizations have all agreed to achieve these goals relating to reducing poverty, child mortality, fighting diseases and epidemics, and developing a global partnership in terms of international development by 2015. Some member states have achieved a number of the agreement's goals while others have reached none. However, the UN has been successful over the years and only the future can tell how the true realization of these goals will play out.<br/>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATION <br/>The United Nation Organization (UNO) is an association of sovereign states bound by a Charter (Constitution) to maintain international peace and security. It is the world largest international organization; a successor to the League of Nation.7<br/>Aims of Objectives of the United Nations Organization   <br/>To maintain peace and security in the world<br/>To work together to remove poverty, disease and illiteracy and encourage respect for each other’s rights of basic freedom. <br/>To develop friendly relations among nations. <br/>To be a centre to help nations achieve these common goals. <br/>Membership of the United Nation Organizations<br/>Admission of Members: <br/>New members are admitted to the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council and two-third of the members should vote in favour.<br/>Secretary General of the United Nations <br/>    Names    Years in office <br/>    Trygve Lie      1942 – 1952 <br/>    Dag Harmmarskjod (he was killed in an air crash)    <br/>1953 – 1961 <br/>    U.

In the process, the activities of blue-helmeted peace-keepers have emerged as the most visible role associated with the world organization.<br/>The United Nations, however, is much more than a peace-keeper and forum for conflict resolution. Often without attracting attention, the United Nations and its family of agencies are engaged in a vast array of work that touches every aspect of people's lives around the world.<br/>Child survival and development, environmental protection, human rights, health and medical research, alleviation of poverty and economic development. Agricultural development and fisheries, education, family planning, emergency and disaster relief, air and sea travel, peaceful uses of atomic energy, labour and workers' rights. The list goes on. Here, in brief, is a sampling of what the United Nations organizations have accomplished since 1945 when the world organization was founded.8<br/>Maintaining Peace and Security: By having deployed a total of 54 peace-keeping forces and observer missions as of September 2001, the United Nations has been able to restore calm to allow the negotiating process to go forward while saving millions of people from becoming casualties of conflicts. There are presently 15 active peace-keeping forces in operation.<br/>Making Peace: Since 1945, the United Nations has been credited with negotiating many peaceful settlements that have ended regional conflicts. Recent cases include an end to the Iran-Iraq war, the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, and an end to the civil war in El Salvador. The United Nations has used quiet diplomacy to avert imminent wars.<br/>Promoting Democracy: The United Nations has enabled people in many countries to participate in free and fair elections, including those held in Cambodia, Namibia, El Salvador, Eritrea, Mozambique, Nicaragua, South Africa, Kosovo and East Timor. It has provided electoral advice, assistance, and monitoring of results.<br/>Promoting Development: The UN system has devoted more attention and resources to the promotion of the development of human skills and potentials than any other external assistance effort. The system's annual disbursements, including loans and grants, amount to more than $10 billion. The UN Development Programme (UNDP), in close cooperation with over 170 Member States and other UN agencies, designs and implements projects for agriculture, industry, education, and the environment. It supports more than 5,000 projects with a budget of $1.3 billion. It is the largest multilateral source of grant development assistance. The World Bank, at the forefront in mobilizing support for developing countries worldwide, has alone loaned $333 billion for development projects since 1946. In addition, UNICEF spends more than $800 million a year, primarily on immunization, health care, nutrition and basic education in 138 countries.<br/>Promoting human rights: Since adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, the United Nations has helped enact dozens of comprehensive agreements on political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights. By investigating individual complaints of human rights abuses, the UN Human Rights Commission has focused world attention on cases of torture, disappearance, and arbitrary detention and has generated international pressure to be brought on governments to improve their human rights records.<br/>Protecting the environment: The United Nations has played a vital role in fashioning a global programme designed to protect the environment. The \"Earth Summit,\" the UN Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, resulted in treaties on biodiversity and climate change, and all countries adopted \"Agenda 21\" - a blueprint to promote sustainable development or the concept of economic growth while protecting natural resources.<br/>Preventing Nuclear Proliferation: The United Nations, through the International Atomic Energy Agency, has helped minimize the threat of a nuclear war by inspecting nuclear reactors in 90 countries to ensure that nuclear materials are not diverted for military purposes.<br/>Promoting self determination and independence: The United Nations has played a role in bringing about independence in countries that are now among its Member States.<br/>Strengthening international law: Over 300 international treaties, on topics as varied as human rights conventions to agreements on the use of outer space and seabed, have been enacted through the efforts of the United Nations.<br/>Handing down judicial settlements of major international disputes: By giving judgments and advisory opinions, the International Court of Justice has helped settle international disputes involving territorial issues, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, diplomatic relations, hostage-taking, the right of asylum, rights of passage and economic rights.<br/>Ending apartheid in South Africa: By imposing measures ranging from an arms embargo to a convention against segregated sporting events, the United Nations was a major factor in bringing about the downfall of the apartheid system, which the General Assembly called \"a crime against humanity.\" Elections were held in April 1994 in which all South Africans were allowed to participate on an equal basis, followed by the establishment of a majority government.<br/>Providing humanitarian aid to victims of conflict: More than 30 million refugees fleeing war, famine or persecution have received aid from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees since 1951 in a continuing effort coordinated by the United Nations that often involves other agencies. There are more than 19 million refugees, mostly women and children, who are receiving food, shelter, medical aid, education and repatriation assistance.<br/>Aiding Palestinian refugees: Since 1950, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) has sustained four generations of Palestinians with free schooling, essential health care, relief assistance and key social services virtually without interruption. There are 2.9 million refugees in the Middle East served by UNRWA.<br/>Alleviating chronic hunger and rural poverty in developing countries: The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) has developed a system of providing credit, often in very small amounts, for the poorest and most marginalised groups that has benefited over 230 million people in nearly 100 developing countries.<br/>Focusing on African development: For the United Nations, Africa continues to be the highest priority. In 1986, the United Nations convened a special session to drum up international support for African economic recovery and development. The United Nations also has instituted a system-wide task force to ensure that commitments made by the international community are honoured and challenges met. The Africa Project Development Facility has helped entrepreneurs in 25 countries to find financing for new enterprises. The Facility has completed 130 projects which represent investments of $233 million and the creation of 13,000 new jobs. It is expected that these new enterprises will either earn or save some $131 million in foreign exchange annually.<br/>Promoting women's rights: A long term objective of the United Nations has been to improve the lives of women and to empower women to have greater control over their lives. Several conferences during the UN-sponsored International Women's Decade set an agenda for the advancement of women and women's rights for the rest of the century. The UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW) have supported programmes and projects to improve the quality of life for women in over 100 countries. They include credit and training, access to new food-production technologies and marketing opportunities, and other means of promoting women's work.<br/>Providing safe drinking water: UN agencies have worked to make safe drinking water available to 1.3 billion people in rural areas during the last decade.<br/>Eradicating smallpox: A 13-year effort by the World Health Organization resulted in the complete eradication of smallpox from the planet in 1980. The eradication has saved an estimated $1 billion a year in vaccination and monitoring, almost three times the cost of eliminating the scourge itself. WHO also helped wipe out polio from the Western hemisphere, with global eradication expected by the year 2000.<br/>Pressing for universal immunization: Polio, tetanus, measles, whooping cough, diphtheria and tuberculosis still kill more than eight million children each year. In 1974, only 5 per cent of children in developing countries were immunized against these diseases. Today, as a result of the efforts of UNICEF and WHO, there is an 80 per cent immunization rate, saving the lives of more than 3 million children each year.<br/>Reducing child mortality rates: Through oral rehydration therapy, water and sanitation and other health and nutrition measures undertaken by UN agencies, child mortality rates in the developing countries have been halved since 1960, increasing the life expectancy from 37 to 67 years.<br/>Fighting parasitic diseases: Efforts by UN agencies in North Africa to eliminate the dreaded screw worm, a parasite that feeds on human and animal flesh, prevented the spread of the parasite, which is carried by flies, to Egypt, Tunisia, sub-Saharan Africa and Europe. A WHO programme also has saved the lives of 7 million children from going blind from the river blindness and rescued many others from guinea worm and other tropical diseases.<br/>Promoting investment in developing countries: The United Nations, through the efforts of the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), has served as a \"match-maker\" for North-South, South-South and East-West investment, promoting entrepreneurship and self-reliance, industrial cooperation and technology transfer and cost-effective, ecologically-sensitive industry.<br/>Orienting economic policy toward social need: Many UN agencies have emphasized the need to take account of human needs in determining economic adjustment and restructuring policies and programmes, including measures to safeguard the poor, especially in areas of health and education, and \"debt swaps for children.\"<br/>Reducing the effects of natural disasters: The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has spared millions of people from the calamitous effects of both natural and man-made disasters. Its early warning system, which utilizes thousands of surface monitors as well as satellites, has provided information for the dispersal of oil spills and has predicted long-term droughts. The system has allowed for the efficient distribution of food aid to drought regions, such as southern Africa in 1992.<br/>Providing food to victims of emergencies: Nearly 815 million people are currently suffering from chronic malnutrition, including 300 million children. In 2001, the World Food Programme (WFP) distributed 4.2 million tons of food to 77 million people in 82 countries for a total operational expenditure of $1.74 billion. 20 million people received, through development projects, aid in food-for-work projects to promote agriculture, improve the environment, and in school feeding, health, and nutrition projects, and 57 million people were offered assistance through short- and long-term operations.These beneficiaries include internally displaced people, refugees, and victims of natural disasters such as floods and drought.<br/>Clearing land mines: The United Nations is leading an international effort to clear land mines from former battlefields in Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, El Salvador, Mozambique, Rwanda and Somalia that still kill and maim thousands of innocent people every year.<br/>Protecting the ozone layer: The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) have been instrumental in highlighting the damage caused to the earth's ozone layer. As a result of a treaty, known as the Montreal Protocol, there has been a global effort to reduce chemical emissions of substances that have caused the depletion of the ozone layer. The effort will spare millions of people from the increased risk of contracting cancer due to additional exposure to ultraviolet radiation.<br/>Curbing global warming: Through the Global Environment Facility, countries have contributed substantial resources to curb conditions that cause global warming. Increasing emissions from burning fossil fuels and changes in land use patterns have led to a build-up of gases in the atmosphere, which experts believe can lead to a warming of the Earth's temperature.<br/>Preventing over-fishing: The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) monitors marine fishery production and issues alerts to prevent damage due to over-fishing.<br/>Limiting deforestation and promoting sustainable forestry development: FAO, UNDP and the World Bank, through a Tropical Forests Action Programme, have formulated and carried out forestry action plans in 90 countries.<br/>Cleaning up pollution: UNEP led a major effort to clean up the Mediterranean Sea. It encouraged adversaries such as Syria and Israel, Turkey and Greece to work together to clean up beaches. As a result, more than 50 per cent of the previously polluted beaches are now usable.<br/>Protecting consumers' health: To ensure the safety of food sold in the market place, UN agencies have established standards for over 200 food commodities and safety limits for more than 3,000 food containers.<br/>Reducing fertility rates: The UN Population Fund (UNFPA), through its family planning programmes, has enabled people to make informed choices, and consequently given families, and especially women, greater control over their lives. As a result, women in developing countries are having fewer children - from six births per woman in the 1960s to 3.5 today. In the 1960s, only 10 per cent of the world's families were using effective methods of family planning. The number now stands at 55 per cent.<br/>Fighting drug abuse: The UN International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) has worked to reduce demand for illicit drugs, suppress drug trafficking, and has helped farmers to reduce their economic reliance on growing narcotic crops by shifting farm production toward other dependable sources of income.<br/>Improving global trade relations: The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has worked to obtain special trade preferences for developing countries to export their products to developed countries. It has also negotiated international commodities agreements to ensure fair prices for developing countries. And through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which has now been supplanted by the World Trade Organization (WTO), the United Nations has supported trade liberalization, that will increase economic development opportunities in developing countries.<br/>Promoting economic reform: Together with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations has helped many countries improve their economic management, offered training for government finance officials, and provided financial assistance to countries experiencing temporary balance of payment difficulties.<br/>Promoting worker rights: The International Labour Organization (ILO) has worked to guarantee freedom of the right to association, the right to organize, collective bargaining, the rights of indigenous and tribal peoples, promote employment and equal remuneration and has sought to eliminate discrimination and child labour. And by setting safety standards, ILO has helped reduce the toll of work-related accidents.<br/>Introducing improved agricultural techniques and reducing costs - With assistance from the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) that has resulted in improved crop yields, Asian rice farmers have saved $12 million on pesticides and governments over $150 million a year in pesticide subsidies.<br/>Promoting stability and order in the world's oceans: Through three international conferences, the third lasting more than nine years, the United Nations has spearheaded an international effort to promote a comprehensive global agreement for the protection, preservation and peaceful development of the oceans. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which came into force in 1994, lays down rules for the determination of national maritime jurisdiction, navigation on the high seas, rights and duties of coastal and other states, obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment, cooperation in the conduct of marine scientific research and preservation of living resources.<br/>Improving air and sea travel: UN agencies have been responsible for setting safety standards for sea and air travel. The efforts of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) have contributed to making air travel the safest mode of transportation. To wit: In 1947, when nine million travelled, 590 were killed in aircraft accidents; in 1993 the number of deaths was 936 out of the 1.2 billion airline passengers. Over the last two decades, pollution from tankers has been reduced by as much as 60 per cent thanks to the work of the International Maritime Organization (IMO).<br/>Protecting intellectual property: The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) provides protection for new inventions and maintains a register of nearly 3 million national trademarks. Through treaties, it also protects the works of artists, composers and authors world-wide. WIPO's work makes it easier and less costly for individuals and enterprises to enforce their property rights. It also broadens the opportunity to distribute new ideas and products without relinquishing control over the property rights.<br/>Promoting the free flow of information: To allow all people to obtain information that is free of censorship and culturally unbiased, UNESCO has provided aid to develop and strengthen communication systems, established news agencies and supported an independent press.<br/>Improving global communications: The Universal Postal Union (UPU) has maintained and regulated international mail delivery. The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has coordinated use of the radio spectrum, promoted cooperation in assigning positions for stationary satellites, and established international standards for communications, thereby ensuring the unfeterred flow of information around the globe.<br/>Empowering the voiceless: UN-sponsored international years and conferences have caused governments to recognize the needs and contributions of groups usually excluded from decision-making, such as the aging, children, youth, homeless, indigenous and disabled people.<br/>Establishing \"children as a zone of peace\": From El Salvador to Lebanon, Sudan to former Yugoslavia, UNICEF pioneered the establishment of \"Days of Tranquillity\" and the opening of \"Corridors of Peace\" to provide vaccines and other assistance desperately needed by children caught in armed conflict.<br/>Generating worldwide commitment in support of the needs of children - Through UNICEF's efforts, the Convention on the Rights of the Child entered into force as international law in 1990 and has become law in 166 countries by the end of September 1994; following the 1990 World Summit for Children convened by UNICEF, more than 150 governments have committed to reaching over 20 specific measurable goals to radically improve children's lives by the year 2000.<br/>Improving education in developing countries: As a direct result of the efforts of UN agencies, over 60 per cent of adults in developing countries can now read and write, and 90 per cent of children in these countries attend school.<br/>Improving literacy for women: Programmes aimed at promoting education and advancement for women helped raise steadily the female literacy rate in developing countries from 36 per cent in 1970 to 56 per cent in 1990 and to 72 per cent in 2000.<br/>Safeguarding and preserving historic cultural and architectural sites: Ancient monuments in 81 countries including Greece, Egypt, Italy, Indonesia and Cambodia, have been protected through the efforts of UNESCO, and international conventions have been adopted to preserve cultural property.<br/>Facilitating academic and cultural exchanges: The United Nations, through UNESCO and the United Nations University (UNU), have encouraged scholarly and scientific cooperation, networking of institutions and promotion of cultural expressions, including those of minorities and indigenous people. <br/> CONSTRAINTS OF THE UNITED NATIONS<br/>The achievement and contributions of the United Nations Organization cannot overemphasize. From 1945 to the 1970’s, the United Nations looked to be a strong successor to the failed League of Nations. Success of sorts in Korea and the Congo had boosted its international image. However, many of the problems from the Cold War it could not stem. The effective occupation of Eastern Europe by Russia made a mockery of the promises made at Yalta and other war meetings. The treatment of Hungary in 1956 could not be stopped by the United Nations. Likewise, America’s involvement in Vietnam could not be stopped.1 By the end of the 1970’s the United Nations had lost some of its prestige. It was clear that the two superpowers, America and Russia, would follow the foreign policy that they wanted to regardless of what the UN wanted.<br/>The whole issue of the relationship between America and the UN weakened the UN. Since 1945, America had been the dominant force in the UN. America provided the UN with 25% of its annual budget and expected to have a big say in final UN decisions - an influence that matched the hundred of millions of dollars America has paid into the UN’s budget. Likewise, some major international problems were dealt with by America flexing her diplomatic muscles (such as in Suez and especially in the Middle East) rather than the UN solving them.9<br/>As more and more Asian and African nations gained their independence and joined the UN, power blocs within the General Assembly have developed. These have challenged the belief that the old order of western nations should dominate the UN simply by using their financial clout and their historic connections. Seven blocs have been identified:<br/>The Developing Nations which consists of 125 states<br/>The Non-Aligned Movement which consists of 99 states (mostly Asian and African who avoid joining military alliances)<br/>The Islamic Conference which consists of 41 states<br/>The African group of 50 states<br/>The Latin American group of 33 states<br/>The Western European group of 22 states<br/>The Arab group of 21 states<br/> Within the General Assembly, all nations regardless of wealth, military power etc., have one vote. The same is true in the specialist agencies - one nation one vote. However, much of the important UN work is done in the Security Council and the five nations of Russia, America, Britain, France and China still have the right to veto a decision of the Security Council. This system has been challenged by the newer members of the UN who want one nation one vote in the Security Council as well. The five permanent members of the Security Council have fought to keep the system as it is claiming that as the five permanent members invest far more money into the UN’s budget and, as a result, should have more sway than nations that pay far less into the UN’s budget.<br/>In 1985, America provided the UN with 25% of its budget; the USSR provided 10.5%; Angola 0.01% and Saudi Arabia 0.86%. America claimed that such an investment should have its rewards. If the ‘Big Five’ withdrew their financial support or reduced it to the level of other nations in the UN, then the UN itself would face near bankruptcy. There was little the UN could do if members failed to pay their contribution. After the Congo crisis from 1960 to 1964, Russia, France and Belgium refused to contribute to the $400 million it had cost the UN to bring peace to the Congo.10 <br/>Throughout the 1960’s, 1970’s and 1980’s, the UN run up debts nearly totalling $1 billion. In 1986, America refused to pay 50% of its annual contribution in protest at the influence newly emerging nations had or were attempting to get. America pointed out that 85% of the UN’s budget was paid by just 20 nations yet many smaller nations were trying to reform the way the UN was run (especially its voting system) without making the same financial commitment to the UN.<br/>Towards the end of the 1980’s the UN appeared to have split in two: the richer old established nations that essentially funded the UN on one side and the newly established but poorer nations on the other side. These nations claimed that they were only poor because so much of their annual wealth was taken up in paying off debts to the world’s richest nations. The world’s richest nations have responded to this charge. They claim that internal corruption within these newer nations is responsible for their poverty - not the debts they owe for money borrowed.<br/>Within just 45 years of its birth, the UN stood at a crossroads. If it divides into rich and poor nations, where does this leave the whole concept of all nations working for one common goal?<br/> ENDNOTES<br/>Lord Gore-Booth and D.

The first attempt at economic cooperation was during the colonial era. Generally speaking, cooperation within the West African sub-region has been organized along distinct linguistic lines inherited when the colonial state gave way for independence.1 The major groups are French-speaking countries comprises Mali, Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea, Togo, Benin, Ivory Coast, Niger, Burkina Faso and Cameroon and the English-Speaking ones Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone and Gambia. One significant feature of the two groups is the unique influence, which the cultural, social, economic and political systems of the metropoles have had on the West African States. 2 <br/>In the colonial days, two major kinds of financial zones were typical of the West African Countries. They were the monetary areas and the currency unions. <br/>Apart from the financial organization among West African countries, during the colonial era there were other institutional arrangements for cooperation. In the English speaking countries, one institution involved was the West African Court of Appeal (WACA), whose jurisdiction covered the four former British colonies of Nigeria, Gold Coast (Ghana), Sierra Leone and Gambia.3 Also, there was a common West African Territories (Unitransport) Order-in-Council promulgated in 1946 under which a West African Air Transport Authority (WAATA) and a West African Airways Corporation (WAAC) were established. Other similar institutions of common service to the colonies were the West African Council for Medical Research, West African Institute for Oil Palm Research (WAIFOR), the West African Institute of Trapanosomsiasis (WATIRA), the West African Institute of Economic and Social Research (WAISER), the West African Cocoa Research Institute and the West African Examination Council (WAEC) Each of these served as a research centre for conducting basic studies in the respective areas of interest.4 <br/>Within the French-speaking countries, on the other hand, Air Afrique was established to improve and harmonize air transport.5 <br/>These institutes set up under the colonial system were destroyed because of attainment of independence by West African states. The first institution to be disintegrated was the West African Currency Board.6 This resulted when Ghana became independent in 1957, it established its own central Bank issuing the Ghana pound, which was in turn replaced by the Cedi.7 The attainment of independence by each member country led to the dissolution of the West African Court of Appeal which was replaced by supreme courts in the respective countries. In rapid succession, other common services organizations disintegrated as a result of Ghana's withdrawal from these organizations after independence. Ghana lead in• withdrawing from these organizations was followed by Nigeria and later Sierra Leone and Gambia who at independence established their own national organizations and institutions.8 <br/>Areas of cooperation for some time after independence generally tended to follow the economic and political dichotomy existing between the French-speaking and English- speaking countries, the only exception being the short-lived political union of Ghana, Guinea and Mali at the turn of the I 960s.9 The first such co-operation was the convention of association signed in 1963 with the European Economic Community (EEC) by all former French territories including those in West Africa (except Guinea).10 under the first Yaoundé convention for economic, technical, financial and trade cooperation. Tariff preferences were granted in both directions on a reciprocal basis.11 <br/>Within the sub-region itself, the post-independence era witnessed a variety of economic groupings and associations aimed at preserving historical, commercial and economic links. This was especially true among the Francophone countries. The first of such groups was the West African Customs Union (UDEAO), established in June 1959 by Ivory Coast, Senegal, Benin, Mauritania, Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso. The grandiose program the union set out to achieve was the cause of' its undoing right from the start. 12 <br/>Despite all these form of cooperation within the West Africa sub-region nothing really concrete came out of it because of some reasons: <br/>There were absence of resources to execute the programs; <br/>There were practical difficulties or co-coordinating policies and objectives, coupled with political friction which inhibited any form of cooperation; <br/>Also there were unions within the union. For example, in 1959 four members of the UDEO (the Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Niger and Benin) also established the Council de I’ entente that was to grow to be another economic grouping. <br/>These hindered the economic cooperation in West Africa sub region.13 <br/>Nigeria's Role in the Formation of the Economic Cooperation of West African State <br/>The history of Nigeria's initiative in the formation of a West African economic community dates back only to the middle of 1970. Admittedly before then, she had talked of the formation of an economic community in West Africa, and had actively participated in the series of conferences sponsored by (ECA) between 1960 and 1968 which culminated in the Monrovia submit meeting of fourteen West African countries; Dahomey, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo and Upper Volta. On 24 April 1968 these Heads of State signed a protocol establishing a West African regional grouping that was to be formed immediately by the member states.14 This would be followed later by a free factor movement to establish the common market. <br/>However, more realistically, Nigeria and Guinea were chosen by the summit to study and report priority area for cooperation between the members. By early 1969, they had reported, identifying the following field or cooperation in descending order of importance. <br/>Trade, Transport and communication, education, cultural exchange and information; <br/>Research and health; and <br/>Energy and heavy industries. 15<br/>The report was not considered: This was partly because the leadership of pan West African economic cooperation then fell to William Tubman 16 who lacked sufficient muscle to bring other West African states together and partly because Nigeria was in the midst or gruesome civil war too in 1967 until early in 1970. <br/>But shortly after the war Nigeria took some bold steps to rekindle the enthusiasm for West African economic community. Late in 1970, the then Federal military government sent letters to all the other West African government asking for their cooperation in an attempt to form a West African economic community. To this end it suggested that a conference of all the West African states should he held to consider the Guinea-Nigeria report. 17 One of the main reasons for' Nigeria’s swift rapprochements alter the end of hostilities with Ivory Coast who, in 1969 had recognized Biafra, was the need to secure the support of the Abidjan government. However, only a few West African countries showed enthusiasm for the Nigerian proposals. Undaunted by this, General Gowon, then Head of the federal military government, followed up the official letters with personal diplomacy. Between mid- 1970 and early 1972 he visited all the other countries except Ivory Coast which had been visited by Dr. Okoi Arikpo, the then Commissioner for External Affairs. In the communiqués issued at the end of General Gowon’s visits to these countries it was stated that agreement had been reached in principle on the formation of a West African Economic Community.18 <br/>Yet nothing concrete came out of the visits. There was no prospect of a West African Summit conference that was held to discuss the question. Nigeria grew impatient, especially alter Britain, Demark and Ireland, had by early 1972 successfully negotiated an arrangement to join the European Economic Community (EEC) on 1st January 1973. All this led to some rethinking in Lagos, tactics were changed first, instead of waiting until the other West African States were ready to act, the federal Military Government decided that a modest arid realistic approach should be adopted through the formation of any Economic Association with any state or group or states in West Africa, Nigeria and Togo signed a treaty in April 1972 establishing what president Eyadema called the embryo or a West Africa Economic Community since then a number of meetings at both official and ministerial levels had taken place between the two countries.19<br/>    Secondly, the Nigerian government decided to work out joint development project that could be undertaken with the cooperation of other West African States, instead of trying to work for the abolition of Tariff and non-Tariff barriers between them. It purchased of 10 percent (estimated at about $350,000) of the shares in the iron ore company, Mifergui Nimbe and Simandou or Guinea in June, 1973 was in line with this new approach. 20<br/>Thirdly, Nigeria has been committed to establishing an all West African Forum for working out detail of projects that can be sponsored jointly by more than one country. To this end a joint Nigerian -Togolese delegations visited the capitals of the twelve other member states in late July and August 1973 to present their proposal for an Economic Community. The delegation was said to have been warmly received in all the places visited including Ivory Coast. At the end of the month long tour all the West African Governments agreed to hold a meeting of ministerial level in Lome from 12th to 16th November, 1973.21 But because some     Francophone West African leaders were to meet President Pompidou in Paris on 12th November The ministerial meeting had to be postponed. <br/>Fourthly, the signing of a bilateral trade pact with many West African countries had now been given greater prominence than the task of working out a West African Free Trade Area. By the second half of 1973, Nigeria had trade agreements with ten out of the thirteen other West African States.22 <br/>At an unofficial level also Nigeria has been taking steps towards the formation of an Economic Community. Thus, the Gowon government had been encouraging the Nigerian chamber of Commerce, industry and Mines to spearhead the formation of a Federation of West African Chambers of Commerce and Industry.23 <br/>The president of Nigerian Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Mines the late chief Henry Fejemorokun, was its first president and Lagos was made its headquarters. The meeting of the federation in Accra in October 1972 was attended by representatives of the Chambers of Commerce of Ghana, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Upper Volta, Benin and Nigeria. Among the resolutions were those calling on all West African Governments to establish directs telecommunications links with one other, to review their various immigration and customs laws, to facilitate free movements of goods and services and to harmonize industrial policies in the region in order to avoid unnecessary duplication in the name of nationalism and unrealistic self- sufficiency. 24 The question is why Nigeria has taken all these steps for the realizations of this project? What is she likely to gain? This brings us to the ideas behind the initiative. <br/>Ideas behind the Initiative <br/>The main ideas behind Nigeria's initiative for ECOWAS arc political, security and economic consideration. For political reasons, Nigeria wanted an arrangement that will put an end to colonial division in West Africa. Furthermore, she believes that such a step will put an end to border dispute and will be an important contribution to African Unity. Moreover according to Dr. Arikpo the federal military government held the firm views that in order to strengthen the bargain position of African States with the EEC, there must be West African Economic Community through which all the states in the region could speak with one voice. It must be acknowledged that, Nigeria played all important role in bringing all African States together to form a common front in their negotiations with the European common market. 25 <br/>For security reason, Nigeria does not want to be surrounded by small countries that are heavily dependent on extra- African powers, especially France, for their military, political and economic survival. It could be recalled that France has put some measure in place to prevent the working of ECOWAS, this was the Economic Cooperation of the Francophone states which has the cardinal policy of the French government to counter-balance the weight of Nigeria, also the during Nigeria civil war, the French government granted diplomatic recognition to the Biafra State. 26 It is firmly believed in Nigeria that as long as there are clients, West Africa States closely tie to European powers, Nigeria's own security cannot be, assured. Such state can be either manipulated against Nigeria or used as a staging ground by foreign powers who wish to cause disaffection and confusion in the country. The experience of the civil war when Benin (formerly Dahomey) was used briefly in 1969 for airlifting arm's and relief supplies to Biafra brought home this point to the Nigerian leaders more clearly than ever. So, one of the ideas behind Nigeria's intense campaign for the formation of a West African Economic Community was to reduce dependence by African states on extra - African countries. Largely for security reasons Nigeria since 1970 has taken certain measures such as granting an interest free loan of £ 1 million to Dahomey in 1972 for rehabilitating road between Idiroko and Porto Novo. The sum of £2 million was offered to Benin in 1971 to pay for imports from Nigeria, several occasions Dr. Arikpo has said that for security reasons the federal military government would be prepared to assist neighbouring states in establishing joint development projects.27 <br/>Controversy over Nigeria Initiative <br/>From the above explanation, it is clear that Nigeria played a prominent role in the economic cooperation for West Africa Sub-region. This novel idea, which was welcomed by almost all West African States, had it controversy in Nigeria. <br/>There was controversy in Nigeria about the economic justification for spearheading the formation of a West African Economic Community. Dr. Gerald Helleiner in .1962 had argued that Nigeria would gain little or nothing economically from a West African Common Market.28 Also in April 1973, Dr. Dotun Philips expressed a similar view.29 Dr. Adebayo Adedeji, then federal Commissioner for Economic Development and later the champion of West African Economic Community, argued in 1970 that Nigeria was likely to lose than it will gain. These arguments were valid in view of the economic situation of the co untries in the area. First, all fourteen (fifteen in 1976) countries are underdeveloped. Secondly, all except Nigeria and Ghana had in 1970 a population of fewer than Six million. Nigeria alone had about 60 percent of the total population of the fourteen countries. Thirdly, the bulk of their trade has remained with Europe and North America. Nigeria trade with the other West African countries has not shown any substantial Increase since independence.30 <br/>In spite of all this, however, there are those who believe that some economic benefits to Nigeria could be derived from an economic community in West Africa. The federal military government from 1970 onwards held the view that Nigeria would benefit economically from such a Pan-West African economic arrangement. Dr. Adebayo Adedeji argued in 1972 that the formation of an Economic Community of West Africa would give Nigeria access to some raw materials that are either not available in the country or available in poor quality. For example, the proposed iron Ore steel industry would have to rely mainly                                            on imported iron Ore, from Liberia and Guinea. It was for these reasons that Nigeria signed an agreement with Guinea to invest on $350,000 in her Iron Ore mining company, in return for which Nigeria's company was guaranteed one million tons of good quality iron ore every year. It has also be argued that savings in foreign exchange could be made if Nigeria and other West African States could set up joint industrial projects such as the proposed cement industrial complex in Togo where there is an abundance of limestone. It is also believed that as the pace of industrialization increases it will be easier for Nigeria to sell some of her industrial products under a West African economic arrangement. This presumption is what cannot really be ascertained. In the main time, Nigeria continued her effort which eventually resulted in the formation of Economic Community of West African States in May, 1975.31 <br/>There were also some hindrances militating against the formation of ECOWAS, which Nigeria has to tackle for the realization of her dreams. This brings us to the prospect of the community. <br/>Prospect of the Community <br/>The prospects in the early 1970s were not all that good. In spite of Nigeria's generosity and restraint, she remains suspect in many West African capitals with her vast economic resources and her enormous political and military strength, Nigeria was seen in many of the West African States as working for domination of her smaller neighbours. This impression has persisted despite Dr. Arikpo's statement in a radio broadcast in Cotonou in March 1973 that such a view was false and pernicious. In spite of the apparent goodwill that the joint Nigerian - Togolese delegation received in all the West African capital visited in July and August 1973, nothing substantial came out of it until later. Even the ministerial meeting of all the West African countries planned for 12 to 16 November 1973 could not be, held because of French government intervention which resulted in a meeting between the leaders of most or the francophone West African states and President Pompidou in Paris on 12 November, 1973.32 <br/>Nothing concrete followed the signing by Nigeria and Togo of the treaty of April 1st 1972 in Lome establishing the nucleus of a West Africa Economic Community, as was lamented by the Nigerian Daily times. Togo attended the OCAM (Organization Commune Africane Et Malagache (OCAM) meeting in Dakar, in August, 1973 to breathe life into the dying, French-Inspired, exclusively Francophone Organization. Furthermore, Togo still remains within the France Zone by means of which France exercises tight control over her former colonies in West Africa except Guinea and Mauritania. President Eyadema's call for the adjustment of the parity or the French franc and the Communate Financiere Africaine (CFA) Franc during President Pompidou's visit to Togo in November 1972 was fiercely resisted by the French president who warned the Togolese president of the dire consequences that would follow such a move. This kept Togolese leader quiet.33 <br/>In other Francophone states, French government exercises her influence over them. It was no secret that the French cardinal policy was to encourage close cooperation among its former West African colonies to counterbalance the weight of Nigeria. In pursuit of this policy, the French inspired the establishment or an exclusively Francophone West African Economic Community between 1971 and 1972. <br/>Moreover, there was lack of political will for an economic community on the part of some West African States. Only eight of' the fourteen countries attended the meeting of' the federation of West African Chambers of Commerce in Accra in October 1973. Most West African leaders were still jealous of their independence and suspicious of one another. During the 1970s, it has become difficult for all the countries in the region to abolish their Tariff and non-Tariff barriers to trade. <br/>Another obstacle to the formation of a West African Economic Community is the existence or different currencies. Most or which arc inconvertible. All attempts to work out a payment union agreement between the fourteen West African states under the auspices or the Economic Commission for Africa in 1964 were unsuccessful. <br/>In spite of these problem, however, and partly as a result of Nigeria's diplomacy partly because of the successful completion of the first Lome convention which associated the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries to the EEC in February 1975, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) was formally established by fifteen West African States in Lagos in May 1975. <br/>Since the formation of ECOWAS, the Nigerian Government has continued to provide impetus for its effectiveness. A series of meetings at summit, ministerial and official levels have been held since May 1975.34<br/> ENDNOTES<br/>S.B. Falegen, “West African Organizations for Co-operation”, in F.C. Edozien and E.

There were other immigrants that care to settle in Ugbawka, these immigrants made up to present day Ugbawka clan. The immigrant came from different parts these are Awka, Nnewi, Okigwe in Anambra state. Ugbwka main stay of livelihood is agriculture. The people were predominately agriculturalist, they produce rice, yam, maize, vegetable, palm wine, corn etc.1 <br/>GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF UGBAWKA<br/>Ugbawka is located in Nkanu-East local government area. The headquarter is located at Amagunze community. Ugbawka is bound in the east by Nkerefi, west by Agbani South by Nara, and North by Obe Ugbawka village is about 30km drive to the present day Ebonyi state.2<br/>The political aspect, the system of governance in Ugbawka and other part of Igbo land, is not centralize government. The system of governance is decentralize system of government in Ugbawka and in Igbo land in general. The practice is republican in nature. The practice is different from what you find in other parts of Nigeria for example, Benin, Empire, the Oyo Empire and the Northern states of Nigeria.<br/>At the Peak of the 9th century Ugbawka clan saw the intervention of the British colonial administration and the unprecedented development distorted her relations with her neighbours.<br/>As the work goes further to examine the different institutions that make Ugbawka clan, what it is before the advent of British colonial administration the project will also examine how the imposed British rule affected Ugbawka and her neighbours. Despite these problems the people encounter there is still traditional activities that are still practice by the people till date.<br/>JUSTIFICATION OF RESEARCH<br/>In more recent times scholar have shown interest in the history of Ugbawka clan, but these efforts have not been able to abate because there have o been true documented work about the comprehensive history of Ugbawka clan, in order to have a better understanding of the history of Ugbawka clan, there is need to look at other ethnic groups in Igbo land for us to have a better understanding of the history of Ugbawka clan, and also oral interview was also conducted for us to understand the historical background of Ugbawka. In the course of this endeavour there have emerged two schools of thought on the place of history of Ugbawka clan.<br/>The first school of though deal with the historical background of Ugbawka clan. They migration from other places to Ugbawka.<br/>These people came from Awka, Nnewi, Okigwe, etc. to form the present day Ugbawka clan. This school believes that before the British administration the people had a solid institution that government the affairs of the people. The system of governance in Igbo land was republican in nature, that is, it is not centralized like you find in other part of Nigeria, for example the Benin Empire, the Oyo Empire and the Northern part of Nigeria. With the system in practice in Igbo land, everybody is equal before the law no matter were you came from this school believes that it was the colonial master that disrupted this system of governance in Ugbawka clan. An example was the indirect rule in Igbo land, the warrant chief that was imposed by the British to govern the people in Ugbawka and other parts of Igbo land.3<br/>The second school of though deals on the impact of the British colonial administration, the conquest of Lagos in 1815 and the colonalization of Lagos in 1861 and the subsequent colonialisation of the southern part of Nigeria that brought the colonial master to Easter part of Nigeria. This was basically economical factor and that Ugbawka was not different from any other parts of Nigeria, and that the British exploitation affected Ugbawka people. The colonial master carry away raw materials, such as palm, produce rubber, groundnut cotton, iron ore and this affected the economy of Ugbawka clan greatly.4<br/>The major beneficiaries were the colonial masters and their expatriates. This school believes that the people had attain a high level of exchanged and distribution, through the trade by barter system before the colonialist came to Nigeria.<br/>Since there was no work done on the history of Ugbawka clan and her relations with her neighbours, I conducted an in-depth research through interviews I interview few elders in my village and who could help with the historical background of my village and their way of life before the imposed British colonial administration, in this regard research on the historical background of Ugbawka clan and her neighbours.<br/>It must however be noted that available work on other major ethnic group in Igbo land, which are useful for our understanding of the history of Ugbawka and her relations with her neighbours. The works are as follows: A. E. Afigbo’s5 Tradition of “Igbo Origin”. The work examine the history of Igbo the emergence of Igbo society and the Igbo and their neighbor before the colonial era  the work was not centered on Ugbawka in pre-colonial times, but it will help us to have a better understanding of the history of Ugbawka in pre-colonial era, because the whole of the Igbos have the same institution. Another to be examine is Uzodima Nwala’s 6 “British conquest of Igbo Traditional Oracle”. The work examine traditional culture and the western culture of the British. The grievances and difficulties which the British encountered during the existing culture of the people of Igbo. Ugbawka is not left out because the people experience similar difficulty with the British.<br/>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>Aim and objectives of this study include:<br/>To examine the major inter-group relationship Ugbawka and her neighbors in pre-colonial era.<br/>To examine the historical background and migration of present day Ugbawka;<br/>To examine the political relationship between Ugbawka and her nieghbouing communities;<br/>To examine the economic relations of Ugbawka and her neighbouring communities; and<br/>To examine the social-cultural relationship between Ugbawka and her neighbours.<br/>SCOPE <br/>The project work intends to make theoretical evaluation of the origin of Ugbawka. The historical events that took place in Ugbawka and her relationship with her neighbours before the colonial rule. The study will shared light on settlement of the people of Ugbawka and her neighbours and in the area of political, social and economic relations before the coming of the British to Ugbawka in the 19th century. The study would also take a look at the first settlers that made up the present day Ugbawka clan. The study will cover all aspect of life of people of Ugbawka and their relations with their nieghbour within the period of 1800-1900. The work would look at the institutions that sustain the development programs in Ugbawka that is the elders youth and women. The role they played to contribute to the development of Ugbawka before the colonial era and how the people of Ugbawka had been able to sustain peace and tranquility between her neighbouring communities, and how the political social, and economic activities were carried out, before the British colonial administrations.<br/>METHODOLOGY<br/>In the course of this research, relevant data and information were obtained from two main sources. These are primary and secondary sources.<br/>Primary Source: These were obtain mainly from interview and archival materials consulted at the ministry of local government in Enugu state and chieftaincy affair. They include intelligent reports, annual reports correspondence and other documents relating to the pre-colonial administration. Oral interview were conducted with experienced individual. Some of whom are adult and had played and still playing some roles in the inter-group relations of Ugbawka and her neighbours. These interviewed include: traditional chiefs, traders and civil servants<br/>Secondary Source: These were consulted in the university and public libraries from textbooks, journals and periodicals information obtained for these mere use to guide and supplement those materials obtained from primary source. These will help to provide data for a historical analysis of inter-group relations between Ugbawka and her neighbouring communities before the British colonial administration<br/>LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>As already been noted above, there are no work done on the history of Ugbawka and her neighbouring communities in pre-colonial times. These however cannot be said of other major ethnic group in Igbo land were there are number of works, which deals on the history of the Igbos, as a people and there are other works which deals on the political, social and economic aspects of the Igbos, and what really disguised the Igbos from other ethic groups in Nigeria, before the coming of the white men into the country. These works were carried out on the Igbos as a whole but not Ugbawka as a community. Although these works are very vital in understanding the history of the people of Ugbawka, their political, social, and economic lives because the Igbos have the same institutions, that distinguished the people from other major ethnic groups in Nigeria, before the imposed British rule. Literature works to be examined, that deals with history of the Igbos, include A.E. Afigbo’s article titled: “The Tradition of Igbo Origin” the work examines three aspect of Igbo Origin: traditions of oriental origin, tradition of origin from neighbouring great states and traditions claiming indigenous origin. The writer was writing on the migration of the Igbos to present day region Nigeria He traced the people to the ten ‘tribe of Israel, the other tracing them to ancient Egypt. Early in this century. The writer see a very close resemblance between Igbo culture and Jewish culture without saying the Igbo were of Jewish decent. Traditions of origin from neighbouring great states: in this second group are found mainly in communities on the periphery of Igbo land. Many communities on these areas trace there origin to one or other of the two great states at different times. The Igbos close to the Niger says that they traced their origin from the Benin Empire. Lastly to be examined, traditions claiming autochthony. Autochthony means a tradition which seeks to establish that in question originated from the area of present Igbo land, not necessarily in the exact location where they group may now be settled, though in a number of cases this may be so. Traditions in this category are found in those communities located in what has often been described as Igbo heart land, that is the Awka, Orlu, Okigue complex But following our definition just given, the tradition of such Igbo group as the Ngwa, Ohuhu, Mbaise who claim to have migrated from the Amargbo Umunneooh axis the work was not on Ugbawka, but it will help on the issues of migration.<br/>Another work to be examined is Osagie’s8 article titled “Nigeria History in pre-colonial times: Southern Nigeria”, the work examine the political institution of the Igbos in pre-colonial times the writer described the people as segmentary or acephalous people, that has no centralized states and operated a kind of government without no kings. The writer goes further  to say that, in pre-colonial era, that the Igbo’s never had an Igwe that what we found today is as a result of the European legacy that the people that pride themselves are product of the indirect rule system in Igbo called the “warrant chiefs”. The system was a kind of governance in Igboland, this was the kind of institution of governance in Ugbawka in pre-colonial era.<br/>Also, E. Osichei’s book titled, A History of the Igbo People,9 Uzodinma Awala’s article titled “British conquest of Igbo traditional Oracles” the works examine the emergence of Igbo society, the villages groups and clans into being coherent social-cultural and at times political units. These chatter are what ordinarily may called traditions of origin of the various autonomous or sub cultural units. The work was not on Ugbawka but it focuses on the Igbo society in pre-colonial era. It would help in the understanding of the history of Ugbawka, their tradition of origin the autonomous or sub-cultural units in pre-colonial Ugbawka society E. Isichei’s work examines the origins, settlement agriculture, iron works and the nineteenth century Igbo land and Nri and Igbo-ukwu. The work examine the first human inhabitant of Igbo land, that must have come from areas further north, possibly from the Niger – confluence, but that men have been living in Igbo land for at least five thousand years. The work goes further to examine the invention of agriculture that it may water shed between the hazardous wandering life of the hunter and collector of wild edible plants and settle more comfortable life. The work will be useful, in the origins and settlement of Ugbawka, in pre-colonial era.<br/>Uzodima’s work examine the British encounter with the Igbo at the beginning of the century was rather a confrontation of two cultures, namely the industrialized western culture and the peasant traditional culture. The work will be relevant in understanding the traditional system of Ugbawka in pre-colonial era. The other category of works to be examined G.T Bastern book titled, A Description of the primitive life, customs and Animistic Belief.11 The work is on the social aspect of the Ibo’s in pre-colonial times. The work examines the Oru and Osu- slaves of men and goods, the yam festival as an important cultures of the Ibos and the youth to old age boys and men and the kind of system of marriage practice equal right with the rich. The writer goes further to a detail account on how this institution copes well, before the advent of British colonial rule. The work will be relevant in understanding the institutions in Ugbawka, and how it was able to sustain the people before the imposed British colonial administration in Ugbawka in pre-colonial times.<br/>Ukwu I. Ukwu article titled “the Development of Trade and Marketing in Ibo lands”12 examine the sociological background, trade and marketing in traditional Ibo society, and the Aro trade system. The sociological background at the traditionally, as it was the effective unite of social control in Ibo land to the village. While it examines the trade and market and the mode of transaction of goods and services in Igbo land, market is the principle venue for commercial exchange in every four or eight days. The work is on colonial period, but it will be useful to understand the market system on Ugbawka in pre-colonial era. <br/>A. E. Afigbo’s article titled, “The warrant Chief system in Eastern Nigeria”,13 examines how the imposed indirect rule affected the system of governance in Igbo land and Ugbawka is not left out of the imposed colonial administration.<br/>Also, Afigbo’s article titled, “The Economic foundation of pre-colonial Igbo society”,14 where the writer gave a clear picture of the economic side of pre-colonial Igbo society, thus rested on three aspect agriculture, with trade and industry coming as subsidiaries. Trade distributed the products of agriculture and manufactured goods, wile the leter not only offered some relief from the other two more strenuous occupation, but also supplied the technological base of Igbo society, as well as providing some items made necessary by social and ritual life, the more was not on Ugbawka, but was on the Igbo society, in pre-colonial era. The work will help us to understand the economic place of Ugbawka in pre-colonial era.<br/>From the above, it can be see that non of the existing literature was on Ugbawka, but on the generality of the Igbo society. However, the literature will be useful in understanding the history of Ugbawka and her relations with her neighbours in pre-colonial British era, because the have similar institutions in the area of political, social and economic relation.<br/>CHAPTERIZATION<br/>The research work is divided into six chapter as follow:<br/>Chapter One: Introduction<br/>The first chapter serves as a preamble to the entire work. It introduces the work and tries to give an insight of the entire (work) bodywork. It introduces various settlement and geographical location and vegetation of Ugbawka, which was responsible for economic and social-political system of the people of Ugbawka.<br/>Chapter Two: Historical Background<br/>The chapter examine the historical background and migration of the Ugbawka people<br/>Chapter Three: Political Relations between Ugbawka and her Neighbours<br/>The chapter examines the political relations between Ugbawka and her neighbor during the period under study.

Among these are public statements by Church leaders, programs of action at local and international levels, organisations dedicated to bringing about peace, courses of study, commemorative days etc.In recent decades, Church leaders have frequently made statements in support of peace. In some cases these statements have been specific appeals for peace in particular circumstances, however, on other occasions they have also published more comprehensive statements on the need for peace and the means of achieving it. The teachings of Christianity which is guided by the dictates of the bible (word of God) has constantly encourage the members to ensure peace and harmony in the society.<br/>Christian leaders have always publicly stood for societal peace and harmony and against violence. It is now widely accepted that violent conflict is the major hindrance to the development of the African continent and Nigeria in particular. It inflicts human sufferings through death, destruction of livelihoods, constant displacement and insecurity (Barash, 2000). Violent conflict disrupts the process of production, creates conditions for pillage of the country’s resources and diverts their application from development purposes to servicing war. Violent conflict is thus responsible for perpetuating misery and underdevelopment in the country-Nigeria and the continent at large (Adetula,2006).<br/>Peace is a universal phenomenon that everyone desires and wishes to enjoy endlessly.Traditions, cultures, religions and societies do have different prescriptions to attaining and enjoying peace. Whenever and wherever there is peace there tends to be development and longevity is enjoyed (Salawu, 2010). To this end, Christianity which is one of the predominant religions in the world today teaches peace and encourages all adherents to the faiths to pursue peace and live peacefully with one another. The above statement now seems to be questionable with the rise of intra, inter and ethno-religious conflicts in the world. While most Arab and some Europeancountries are faced with intra-religious conflicts, an African country like Nigeria is faced with both intra and inter-religious conflicts. Nigeria, which is popularly known as Africa’s most populous black nation with apopulation of now about 170 million people, with more than 250 ethnic groups has Christianity and Islam as its predominant religions, though there is still in existence the African Traditional Religion (ATR).<br/>Christianity as a word means followers of Christ or Christ like. Christians therefore are those who follow and act the teaching of Christ in all ways of life. One of the climaxes of Christianity or Christian virtue is peace. Christians are enjoined in the Bible to embrace and live peacefully with their neighbors’. The following scriptures confirm this:Depart from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it (Psalm 34 vs 14).Blessed are the Peace makers for they shall be called the children of God Matthew 5 vs 9).Let him eschew evil and do good; let him seek peace and ensue it (1 Peter 3 vs 11).Follow peace with all men and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord (Hebrews 12 vs 14). If it be possible, as much as it lieth in you, live peaceably with all men (Rom 12 vs 18)<br/>The word Peace in Christianity is translated from the Hebrew word ‘Shalom’, which is a key word in the Bible and its at the center of how God wants us to live on earth. One of the key things Jesus came to give humanity is Peace and expects us to live in peace as cited in the scriptural verses above. Peace was not only what Jesus taught but He also lived it, this in most cases is what scholars call pacifism, as Jesus never taught violence, even at his arrest by the Pharisees and one of his disciples struck the ears of the priest, Jesus rebuked the disciple and said that “those who live by the sword shall die by the sword” (Mathew 26:52, NKJV).In another place Jesus taught the people not to retaliate any evil done to them as it used to be, an eye for an eye, a tooth for atooth, if one should strike you on the right cheek, turn the left cheek (Mathew 5:38-39, NKJV) but now to always forgive those that offend them and he charged them to forgive their neighbors even seventy times seven (Matthew 18:22, KJV). With all these scriptural teachings of the church, Christians are suppose to live in peace and harmony in the society.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The church has always taught the members on the act of non retaliation as taught by Jesus which helps to absorb violence instead of escalating it, hence every cycle of violence provoking revenge, which in turn provokes more violence is broken by the simple act of tolerating the violence and avoiding retaliation. On the contrary, there has been increased cases of disruption to peace and harmony in the world today despite the church teachings of peace as stipulated by Jesus Christ. However, the researcher is examining the role of church in ensuring peace and harmony in the society.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The following are the objectives of this study:<br/>1.    To examine the role of church in ensuring peace and harmony in the society.<br/>2.    To examine the dictates of the church as regards peace and harmony.<br/>3.    To identify the factors disrupting peace and harmony of the society.<br/>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.    What is the role of church in ensuring peace and harmony in the society?<br/>2.    What are the dictates of the church as regards peace and harmony?<br/>3.    What are the factors disrupting peace and harmony of the society?<br/>1.5    RESEARCH HYPOTHESES<br/>Ho: The church plays no significant role in ensuring peace and harmony in the society.<br/>H1: The church plays significant role in ensuring peace and harmony in the society.<br/>1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The following are the significance of this study:<br/>1.    The findings of this study will be useful for the government, church leaders and the general public on the role of the church in ensuring sustainable peace and harmony in the society.<br/>2.    This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.<br/>1.7    SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY<br/>This study will cover the position of the church and Christianity in general as regards the issue of societal peace and harmony.<br/>1. Financial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<br/>2. Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

The core of the reforms and development was to provide and bring government closer to the people. No doubt, to achieve this, there is need for leaders with a visionary sense of direction, who are willing to carry out purposeful programmes for the benefit of the masses. These leaders must be willing to serve the people and selflessly put the people ahead in their administration. The study of administration in Nigeria has received commendable attention from scholars over the years and Idemili North Local Government Area is one of the local governments that has reforms and changes in administration. Just like any other local government, it has the capability to develop and benefit its citizens. This study deals with the administration of Idemili North Local Government Area from 1996-2010. Local government administration and its impact on the people is obviously a factor to reckon on with in the history of political administration in Nigeria. This is why a study of this nature is essential. Although the local government was created by the military in 1996, it was not until the start of civilian rule in 1999 that the core of its development process began. Such development in the local government has revolved around the key sectors of agriculture, human development, health, trade and transportation. This work thus is a contribution to the history of Nigerian government administration albeit of the grassroot level. By adopting both the qualitative and quantitative research methodologies, this work examines the various facets of administration of Idemili North LGA as well as the efforts of various local chairmen at bringing development to the area. While narrating certain strides made by the administrators, it also examines the administrative deficiencies of these leaders as well as the factors that hindered full dividends of democracy in the local government. The study adopts inter disciplinary approach and relied on oral interviews, government documents, archival materials and relevant secondary text for information. In the end, the work provides a launching pad for assessing grassroot administration and development as well as opens up doors for further important but yet to be studied areas of Idemili North LGA’s history.<br/>List of Abbreviations<br/>ANSIEC - Anambra State Independent Electoral Commission<br/>APF - Anambra People’s Front<br/>ATR - African Traditional Religion<br/>CBOs - Community Based Organizations<br/> ECCE - Early Child Care Education<br/> INEC - Independent National Electoral Commission<br/>LGA - Local Government Area<br/>NGO - Non-governmental organization<br/> PTA-Parent-Teachers- Association<br/> LIST OF TABLE<br/> Table 1: Major Markets in Anambra state by LGAs<br/> Table 2: Anambra state annual population projection by LGAs<br/> Table 3: Idemili North Local Government Chairmen and their Tenures Table 4: Towns in the LGA and numbers of primary schools therein.

It tries to bring the dividends of government closer to the people at the grassroots. Local governments over the years have gone through various reforms and developments. As a tier of government, Nigerian local governments have left a mark in history not because of its efficiency and effectiveness but because of the many and varied changes it brought in its wake in Nigeria. Idemili North LGA is undoubtedly an integral part of administration at grassroot level.<br/>The evolution and development of modern local government in Nigeria could be traced back to the British colonial era. Due to the heterogeneous nature of Nigeria, the British merged different regions of the country for easy and “efficient” administration. The North had good administrative machinery upon which the British grafted an effective local government structure.1 A series of ordinances set up a definite pattern of local government based on the Native Authority System in the North that allowed the Emirs, among other things, to pay officials and impose taxes on the people. In the East, the story was a little different as indirect rule was imposed, but “the Aba Women Riot of 1929 exposed the short-comings of the indirect rule system in the East and led to radical<br/> review of the system.”2 In 1950, the British system of local government was introduced in the East with the Eastern Region Local Government Ordinance. In 1952, the West 1followed suit.3 It was not until 1954 that the North absorbed elected members into the native administration following pressure from the “young elements.”4<br/>After Nigeria regained her independence in 1960, the federal government of Nigeria, adopted different forms of local government as respective regions became responsible for the structures, legislation and operation of local government under their jurisdiction. It was in 1976, that the Federal Military Government led by General Olusegun Obasanjo reformed the local government system. As expected, “the 1976 reform established a uniform single tier, all-purpose local council throughout the<br/>country.”5 After The Reform, the 1976 and subsequently the 1999 Constitutions gave local governments legal backing. The provisions of the Constitution made clear of the relationship between state government and local government on the one hand and the federal government on the other hand. The constitution also spelt out categorically the responsibilities of local government, thus making local government a “constitutional expression.”6 Local government created was to cater for the social needs and aspirations of those at the grassroots and would be “judged by its success in providing<br/> such services.”7 In spite of the enormous reforms and impact of Idemili North LGA on the people of the area, there has been no detailed historical account of the growth and development in the LGA.Thus, the need for this research on Idemili North LGA of Anambra State from 1996 – 2010.<br/>What exists as Idemili North LGA was part of Idemili LGA until October 1st, 1996 during General Sani Abacha’s regime, when the local government was split into two to form Idemili North and Idemili South LGA. The name Idemili was derived from Idemili river. The river has its source from Agulu Lake in Aniocha LGA and it flows through most<br/>communities in the area. Idemili river flows into River Niger at Iyi-Owa in Onitsha.8 From October 1, 1996, Idemili North became one of the twenty-one local government councils in Anambra state. Ogidi community which was headquarters of Idemili LGA still retains her status in the present Idemili North LGA. Idemili North LGA is bounded in the North by Oyi LGA, in the South by her sister LGA, Idemili South, in the East by Njikoka LGA and in the West by Onitsha North LGA. Ten communities make up the local government namely: Abacha, Abatete, Eziowelle, Ideani, Nkpor, Obosi, Ogidi, Oraukwu,<br/>Uke, and Umuoji.9 “These communities are linked by ancestral and cultural ties.”10 The local government has twelve political wards. Each community has one except for Ogidi and Umuoji communities that have two apiece.<br/>Idemili North LGA occupies an expense of land of about 43.756 square kilometers. According to the 2006 census, the population of the local government stood at 431,005, of which, 219,223 were male while 211,782 were female.11 The local government constitutes about 10.30 percent of the total number of inhabitants in<br/>Anambra state.12 Increase in population is alluded to the local government’s proximity to the commercial city of Onitsha and Anambra state policy in the last decade, to decongest Onitsha. With that, some markets have been transferred to some communities in the local government. These include, the Electrical Spare Parts market now located at Obosi, the Building Material market now at Ogidi, the Bakery Material partly located in Ogidi and Ogbuike (Ogbuike is in Oyi LGA). There are other markets like the New Motor Spare Parts Market in Nkpor, the Old Motor Spare Parts in Nkpor and Obosi. Apart from these major markets, each community that forms part of the local government has their own local markets that have continued to serve their needs and to assist inter-group relations. The major markets in Idemili North are also a source of revenue generation which if properly utilized could have gone a long way in fostering development. “Rural-urban migration”13 has made workers, traders and artisans reside in some of the communities like Nkpor, Obosi, Ogidi and Umuoji, where they commute to their various business areas.<br/>There is no doubt that there are avenues for development in Idemili North LGA. Hence, this work sets out to analyses the overall performance of the administrators of the LGA and examines how their administration had either speed up or derailed development in the area from 1996 up to 2010.<br/>Statement of the Problem<br/>The success of a local government is basically measured by how far the leaders are willing to commit themselves to the welfare and well being of the populace. Like any other LGA, Idemili North was created to cater for the needs of the people at the grassroot level. The LGA leaders have the responsibility of making sure that the needs of the people are met. Research into the history of administrations in Nigeria especially at the grassroot level therefore becomes essential especially given the fact that when it comes to local government administration in Idemili North LGA, few studies have been carried out. More so, there is a need to appraise how willing the leaders were able to utilize resources at their disposals to bring about any meaningful development in the area. To that end, certain questions are raised: were these leaders selfless or selfish?<br/>Did the leaders have a willingness to serve? How did pattern of administration differ from one administrator to the other and what levels of development, if any was carried out by the different leaders? These issues underpin the problem of the study.<br/>Theoretical Framework<br/>The study is anchored on the modern world system theory. Proposed by Immanuel Wallerstein in 197414 the world system theory maintains that the system is composed internally of variety of social structures and member groups with a set boundaries and a definable lifespan. Wallerstein defined the system as held together by a variety of forces that are inherent tension. These forces have the potential of tearing the system apart. He argued that one type of world-system- the modern capitalist economy relies on economic domination whereby operate political entities absorb whatever losses occur, while economic gain is distributed to few private Lords.15 The core geographical areas dominates and exploits the rest of the system. The periphery consists of those areas that provide raw materials to the core and are heavily exploited by it. The semi periphery is residual category that encompasses a set of regions somewhere between the exploiting and exploited.<br/> The world-system theory can aptly be applied to the study of local government administration in Idemili North LGA during the period of study. For one thing, member group of communities comprising the LGA form a system. These villagers have been held together by some forces, most notably, the political force. This force in the study will soon show here created tensions both at the top among the ruling elites and below among the masses. In the end, there socio-political forces have prevented radical and meaningful development to occur and seemingly tore the system apart. More so, the political domination of the elected chairmen by the state governors that appointed the various caretaker committee chairmen have led to an increase level of exploitation. The periphery, masses, do not benefit maximally but rather exploited for economic gains. The appointed caretaker committee chairmen appear to be the semi-periphery served as the link between the exploited (Idemili North LGA citizens) and the exploiting (the state governors who appointed them). As would be shown from the work, this system yielded no positive result as the entrenched pattern of exploitation even clouded any trace of development by these administrators. Worse still, the forces in control tore the local government administration system apart.<br/>Purpose of Study<br/>The purpose of this work is to historize local government administration in Idemili North LGA from 1996-2010. It examines how various local government chairmen administered the LGA and analyzes their achievement during the tenure of their administration. It also assesses the achievements to the end of determining whether they impacted positively or negatively.<br/>Significance of Study<br/>This study bears a measure of significance. First, the study will enhance our knowledge of the nature of administration at grassroot level particularly in Idemili North LGA and conclusions reached can serve as a springboard for good leadership at the state level and federal government level. The study will inspire further research on local government administration in other local governments in Nigeria while playing a vital role in stimulating future academic discourses as findings will be meaningful to historians, sociologists, political scientists, administrators and analysts as well. Also, the study will serve both as a reference document for researchers and as a contribution to local government administration, hence adding to the existing literature on Nigerian political history.<br/>Scope of the Study<br/>The study covers the period 1996-2010. 1996 was a landmark in that it was when Idemili North LGA was created. The year 2010 was chosen as the termination date because it marks the end of Governor Peter Obi’s first tenure in office. The focus is on Idemili North LGA which includes the following communities: Abacha, Abatete, Eziowelle, Ideani, Nkpor, Obosi, Ogidi, Oraukwu, Uke and Umuoji. The various administration of the local government chairmen are considered in the study also. These local government chairmen are Tony Ezike (October 1996-March 1997), J.C Omekagu (March 1997-July 1998), Emma Ike (July 1998- April 1999), Okey Muo Aroh (May, 1999-May, 2002), Edwin Ekwuino (June, 2002- Oct. 2002), Nikky Nwabueze (Nov.2002-Feb 2003), Ben Mozie (March, 2003-May, 2003), Uche Ezediorah (June, 2003-May, 2006), Emeka Akabueze (May, 2006-March, 2007), Amaechi Ekwume (April,2007-July, 2007), John Obodzie (Aug.2007-July,2008), Frank Mabuike (Aug. 2008-July,2011)<br/>Review of Literature<br/>Tony Onyishi (Ed.) in Key Issues in Local Government and Development: A Nigerian perspective16 discusses historical development of local government system in Nigeria. The work is a good source material for this study as it offers conceptual explanations of local government viz-a-viz development. It also evaluates the various plans and programmes at the local government level aimed to bolster growth and development. Although the author presented a panoramic view of local government, the work is important in laying the foundation for an elementary understanding of the concept of local government and its practice in Nigeria. The work also falls short in discussing specific local government administrations; hence the present study will consider a specific case study of the Idemili North LGA<br/>F.C. Okoli’s Theory and Practice of Local Government: A Nigerian Perspective,17 discusses the theoretic of local government in Nigeria as well as its practice. It generally gives a history and function of local government in Nigeria. Like the earlier work, it is merely a general overview of local government administration in Nigeria. Beyond theory, the present study narrows its concern to the practice of local government administration in Idemili North.<br/>Similarly, Local Government Administration in Nigeria: Current Problems and Future Challenges18 articulates the problems of local government in Nigeria and the efforts of state and federal government interference on the development of local government system. This work is useful in understanding the factors militating against development of LGA. The work however focuses only on problems and challenges of local government administration in Nigeria. The present study will expand its concern to include history, problems and possible solutions of local government administration in Nigeria with specific emphasis on Idemili North LGA.<br/>Government at Grassroots19 edited by E.J. Otagburuagu examines leadership at the grassroots, sources of income to the local government, and so on. Though the work does not focus on Idemili North LGA in particular, it is relevant to the present study especially in the area of income generation. E.C. Nwankwo’s work Local Government in Practice20 explains in details problems facing local government administrators in Nigeria in general. Handbook of Local Government Administration21 edited by John J. Gorgan is an overview of the principles and applications of government administration and management practices in local government sector. The effect of environment on the performance of local government administrators is of great relevance to this work. These works fall short in discussing specific local government administration in Nigeria. The present study covers this gap by examining the Idemili North LGA as a case study.<br/>Governance and Economic Development in the Fourth Republic22 edited by Terhemba, Wnam and M. S. Talla, discusses on community development and the need to utilize the local government, as veritable tools for rural development. It also examines the justification for local government existence and how politics and politicians had hindered development and dividends associated with local government administration especially during the Fourth Republic. The work would be useful in understanding political developments in Idemili North LGA in the Fourth Republic.<br/>R. C. Obi in his book, Understanding Local Government Administration in Nigeria23 discusses major historical and development prospects in the practices of local government in Nigeria. However, the work falls short to consider the changes local government administration brought on a specific local government and its implication to their socio-political and economic growth. This study strives to cover the gap.<br/>Ebonyi Ozor’s work- Third Tier Government in Nigeria: Evolution, Development,<br/>Future24 examines the evolution and development of local government in Nigeria from pre-colonial times. The work also discusses the future of Nigerian local government system especially after the 1976 Local Government Reform. This work is useful for its evolutional development of local government of which Idemili North LGA is a part of.<br/>E.E. Akpan’s work, Principles and Practice of Local Government25 gives a general account of local government in the then Eastern Nigeria and the need for improvement. The work explains the purpose and factors for establishing a local government, the functions which local governments perform and their sources of revenue. The work provides concrete insight into the estimated expenditure made in the then Eastern Nigeria between 1960 and 1961. The work falls short though in its scope of coverage as it deals basically with First Republic politics and governance. The present study narrows its focus to the Fourth Republic local government administration.<br/>In work State Government26 by F.G. Bates et al, local government is seen as an extension of the state government. According to the authors, the functions of state and local governments overlap because of the relationship between the two. The dual purpose of local government as stated in chapter seventeen is to serve as an area of self government and as an administrative district of the state. Findings from this work assisted the present study in determining the nature of how such relationship could be applied to Idemili North LGA However the work dwells on the link between government at state and local level. Despite being of help, the present study focuses on how this relationship between the state and local governments affected Idemili North LGA.<br/>Government at the Grassroots level in Nigeria27 edited by E.A.O. Oyeyipo and Odoh Adejo sees local government as an instrument for rural development; the work also expresses the need to improve local government for greater development. Nevertheless, the panoramic views on some local governments create need for this study.<br/>Aliyu Abubaka’s work, The Role of Local Government in Social, Political and<br/>Economic Development in Nigeria 1976 – 197928 highlights the roles of local government in development of the country after the Local Government Reform of 1976 up to 1979. With the background in mind, there is a need for the present study 1996-2010 as to see continuity in local government development especially after the creation of Idemili North LGA. The roles which local governments are supposed to perform would be useful to the present study.<br/>M. Atakpa et al in their study “Analysis of Options for Maximizing Local<br/>Government Internally Generated Revenue for Nigeria.”29 discuss in detail the various options for maximizing revenue generation and the problems of exploiting the various source of revenue generation in Nigeria. The study suggests feasible and pragmatic ways of maximizing internal revenue generation in Nigeria local governments. The work is panoramic thus the need for the present study by studying the various sources of revenue to Idemili North LGA.<br/>In the work A Survey of the Igbo Nation,30 some contributors to the work namely, F.C. Okafor and T.O. Okoye discuss the Igbo in the changing world. For them, urbanization was partly caused by contact with Western civilizations. Thus development is viewed as a narrative concept synonymous with improvement, the changes in spatial organization of the neat Igbo rural living diffused city wards with positive elements of modern cities such with streets and routes ways. It is deducted from the work that proper planning and contacts changed aspects of Igbo rural settlements.<br/>Egodi Uchendu et al31 examines the concepts of leadership and followership in Africa. The work also looks at leadership values, perspective on leadership and developments in Africa. The work’s assessment of leadership and developments in Africa was of great value to the present writer. The panoramic view of leadership and development of the work gives room to the present study. Chinua Achebe’s work32 is a good source material for this study. The work concluded that Nigeria’s backwardness is a problem of leadership and not necessary the environment or form of government being practiced. The work though panoramic leaves out the specific detail of local government administration and leadership in Nigeria thus the need to study Idemili North LGA to examine if enthroning quality leadership at the local government level would serve as a spring board for good leadership at state and federal government levels.<br/>Sources, Methodology and Organization<br/>The study is drawn from primary and secondary sources. Oral source constitute the bulk of the material from which the work is derived and the primary source used.<br/> Informants are drawn from the ten communities in the research area and spread across different geographic and occupational interest. Attention was paid to informants who could give information that could be fairly reliable, based on their experiences. Most of the informants were involved in the changes and continuity in Idemili North LGA. Other primary sources include records in the National Archives Enugu such as, intelligence reports on old Idemili LGA. These did not adequately address the needs of the subject of the study. Secondary sources include published and unpublished books, Journals and other texts relating to local government, Idemili North, development and leadership. Various academic libraries were also visited among them were Chinua Achebe Library at Idemili North LGA and department of political science library Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Akwa.<br/>The research is approached thematically and chronologically and combines description with analysis of various data. Thus, qualitative and quantitative research methodology would be applied in the course of the work. The qualitative research methodology seeks to build on largely narrative description to inform the researcher’s understanding of an event. It relies heavily on content analysis of oral histories, interviews, reports and records to describe and explain the period of local government administration in Idemili North LGA. On the other hand, qualitative research methodology draws on empirical data and fact by making use of figures, charts, numbers and statistic to valid ate or represents a historical event. Given the nature of the study both methods were employed extensively.<br/>The work is organized in six chapters. Chapter one is the introductory chapter, comprising among other sub-themes, the purpose of the study, significance and methodology employed. Chapter two discusses the establishment of the local government. The third chapter examines Idemili North up to 1999, as well as pre-democratic activities that have been on up to 1999 when civil rule was restored in Nigeria following protracted years of military rule. Chapter four looks at the dividends of democracy 1999-2002. Chapter five discusses Idemili North under quasi-democracy 2002-2010, during which appointed local government chairmen held sway. Chapter six is the conclusion.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF IDEMILI NORTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, 1996-2010<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF IDEMILI NORTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, 1996-2010", "id": 67}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN ANALYSIS OF NIGERIA–CAMEROON RELATIONS 1999-2007<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            The major significance of this study is that it will examine and highlight Nigeria – Cameroon Relations from 1999 to 2004. It will also suggest how areas of conflict could be resolved by both countries. This project research also hopes to contribute to the academic literature on Nigeria’s foreign policy through coverage of a turbulent period in Nigeria – Cameroon history.<br/>            Following the judgement by the International Court of Justice that ceded 33 Nigerian villages around Lake Chad and some in the South-Eastern border with Cameroon which included Bakassi Peninsula, which is known to be very rich in oil, Nigeria – Cameroon relations have been affected by the judgement made by the International Court of Justice in 2003. The political relations between Nigeria and Cameroon since independence have been in a state of flux. The initial peace enjoyed by the two countries (Nigeria and Cameroon) as members of the Conservative Group of African States which formed the Monrovia Group in the years immediately after independence in 1960, soon shifted from periods of pretentious friendship and cooperation to cold war and even military confrontation. It has been underlined that by the virtue of a common border and the controversial boundary demarcation between Nigeria and Cameroon, the relationship between the two countries have been marred by constant and severe border conflicts.<br/>            Nigeria – Cameroon relations have been marred by border disputes which is a colonial creation. This does not mean that there was no frontier existing before the coming of the colonial powers, however, the border as we know it today evolved from the arbitrary manner in which African borders were created. The problems that bedevilled the creation of this border were neatly handed over to both countries at independence. What ensued after independence and the post-plebiscite era was constant border clashes. Consequently and in realization of the dangerous dimension the border clashes may lead to, the International Court of Justice judgement in 2003 has put settlement machinery into motion by both governments.<br/>CHAPTERIZATION<br/>In dealing with this research work, I will be focusing on four (4) chapters which are as follows:<br/>Chapter One:<br/>Introduction: Background to the Nigeria/Cameroon Crisis<br/>Chapter Two:<br/>Issues in the Nigeria-Cameroon Dispute<br/>Chapter Three:<br/>Resolution of the Nigeria–Cameroon Dispute (The ICJ Judgement<br/>Chapter Four: Conclusion<br/> TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE: <br/>Introduction: Background to the Nigerian-Cameroon<br/>Crisis             <br/>aims and objectives of the study<br/>scope of the study<br/>methodology<br/>Endnotes                  <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Issues in the Nigeria-Cameroon Dispute                       <br/>Endnotes      <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>Resolution of the Nigeria-Cameroon Dispute<br/>(The ICJ Judgement)                     <br/>Endnotes                  <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>Conclusion              <br/>Endnotes                  <br/>Bibliography<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION: <br/>BACKGROUND TO THE NIGERIA-CAMEROON CRISIS<br/>            The boundary dispute between Nigeria and the Cameroon Republic arising from their long, but ill-defined border (1680 kilometres or 1050 miles) is of colonial origin. However, it has remained a source of conflict in the direct bilateral relations of the two countries since their independence. In one form or the other, the dispute has engaged the attention of almost all Nigerian governments since 1960. Many informed Nigerians believe that the Balewa government in the First Republic lost an opportunity to resolve the dispute to Nigeria’s maximum satisfaction in 1960-1961. That opportunity, they claim, was lost because of a myopic and fratricidal conception of national interest in Nigeria’s domestic politics. That loss continues to haunt to date particularly with respect to the maritime section where its acclaimed vital security and strategic interest stand threatened, and also where Nigeria continues to suffer the humiliation of seeing the Cameroonian authorities administer a territory in the disputed area whose population is 90 percent Nigerian nationals.1 Ironically, what was considered a national blunder in the immediate independence period was almost re-enacted in 1975, this time more consciously, when the Gowon administration signed the Maroua agreement with president Ahidjo’s government in Cameroon, an agreement which, effectively would have ceded the channel of the Calabar River and a portion of the Cross River estuary to the Cameroon. As it turned out, the Maroua agreement is null and void in law as it was never ratified by the Nigeria, leaving open the prospect of new form of arrangement with the Cameroonians for solving the dispute in a mutually beneficial manner to both sides.2<br/>            The dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria over the Bakassi Peninsula has assumed great prominence because of its richness in oil. It is important to note, however, that the case of Bakassi is only one element in the dispute that extends to the land boundary between Nigeria and Cameroon from the Lake Chad region to the Coast. This long standing dispute over the ownership of the Bakassi Peninsula which was apparently laid to rest by the ruling of the International Court of Justice provides an example of judicial arbitration at the international level. The ownership of the Bakassi Peninsula was a protracted dispute that involved several attempts by leaders and representatives of both countries to resolve although without success. Indeed, such has been the doggedness of both countries to their claims that it witnessed the eruption of violence on a number of occasions.3<br/>            In terms of geography the Bakassi Peninsula, is a network of islands and creeks situated between latitudes 4,050 and 4,025 north. It is bounded to the North by the river Akpa Yafe. Its western limit lies at approximately 8043 East of Greenwich. To the west lies the estuary of the Cross River, into which flows the Akpa Yefe. To the East of Bakassi lies the Riodel Rey estuary. To the South of Bakassi lies the South Atlantic ocean, known in this region as the Gulf of Guinea, consisting of the Bight of Benin and the Bight of Bonny. The Bakassi Peninsula itself is transverse by numerous channels and creeks of varying sizes and navigability.4 Transportation around the peninsular is mainly by water. At its widest point the Bakassi is approximately 28 kilometres across. The total concluded by or under the authority of the British Consul, Edward Hewett.<br/>            The European imperial powers used the concept of “protectorate” as the legal basis for much of their activity in Africa, acquiring protectorates on the basis of treaties of protection between themselves and the kings and chiefs of the protected lands. This system effectively met the European power’s needs for a degree of control in their protectorates, which excluded that of their rivals, while at the same time leaving in place the local authority of the kings and chiefs within their territories. The traditional ruling class was a recognized feature of the pre-colonial Nigerian reality. The exact number of these pre-colonial empires, kingdoms, caliphates and autonomous communities cannot easily be determined, and varied from period to period. Furthermore, the size, character and form of these traditional political units were not uniform.5 Some were as large and populous as some African states today, while the influence and activities of others were limited. The kings and chiefs of old Calabar however, constituted a very powerful polity wielding considerable influence and authority extending even to Victoria in Cameroon. During the pre-colonial period, these traditional authorities exercised complete sovereign power over their people and territory. In some pre-colonial societies, political power was centralized in the office of the traditional ruler while in others it was dispersed to a variety of smaller units.<br/>            However, the dispute over the Bakassi peninsular is product of a number of contradictions. First, there is a clash between tradition and modernity. The pre-colonial history of the ancient kingdom of Calabar is haunting the post-colonial reality of contemporary Nigeria and Cameroon. Secondly, there is the tension between cartographical fact and cultural reality: the map is in conflict with the people. Third, there is conflict between the dictates of abstruse international law and the existential imperatives of struggling humanity. Fourth, there is a gap between the concept of citizens.6<br/>            In pre-colonial time Bakassi was under the ancient kingdom of Calabar which in 1914 became part Nigeria, under British rule. The people of the main settlement in the Bakassi peninsula owned allegiance to the Obong of Calabar. It was therefore, the Obong of Calabar that placed not only the kingdom of Calabar itself, but also Efiat and Idombi (in the peninsular) under British protectorate via a treaty of September 10, 1884. The chiefs of Efiat and Idombi were co-signatories to the treaty. However, subsequently, through a series of bilateral treaties and other legal instruments, the British ceded the territory first to Germany and then placed it under the mandate of the League of Nations and the trusteeship of the United Nations. Meanwhile, the British protectorates in Nigeria including the Kingdom of Calabar were merged with its colonies in the area, as one integrated British colony. Later, largely due to the political errors and indifference of Nigerian politicians, the Republic of Cameroon obtained the Bakassi peninsula in the process of a plebiscite conducted by the United Nations in 1959 and 1961.7 By the same process, Nigeria also obtained some territories which formerly belonged to Cameroon. In particular, the critical legal instruments that changed the status of the peninsula and its inhabitants were the following:<br/>1)         The agreement between the United Kingdom and Germany signed in London on March 11, 1913;<br/>2)         The Anglo-German protocol signed in Obokun, on April 12, 1913;<br/>3)         The exchange of letters between the British and German government on July 6, 1914; and<br/>4)         The endorsement in 1961, by both the United Nations General Assembly and the International Court of Justice, of the result of the plebiscites conducted in Northern and Southern Cameroon and February 11 and 12, 1961 and the diplomatic note accompanied by Nigeria, in 1962 accepting the result of the plebiscite.<br/>            Cameroon was a German territory ceded after the first World War to the League of Nations at the 1919 Versailles peace treaty that ended the first World War and later ceded to the United Nations in 1945 and the British. The Eastern part of Cameroon was administered by the French while the western part by the British.8 For administrative convenience the British government placed the western part under Nigerian colonial government before Nigerian independence. It started soon after Nigeria’s independence in 1960, over the exact location of the Northern borders, after the British Northern part of Western Cameroon (parts of the present Adamawa and Taraba States) had voted to join Nigeria and the Southern parts of the Western Cameroon voted to join French Cameroon.9<br/>Oil Factor: The discovery of oil in commercial quantities in Nigeria and particularly of offshore oil on the Nigerian side of the territorial waters in the Atlantic Ocean area called Bakassi peninsula, which is part of the Cross River State of Nigeria bordering Cameroon made Cameroonians envious of Nigeria’s oil wealth. The Cameroon Republic therefore, desperately started oil exploration along the borders, both on shore and offshore, and in so doing the Cameroonians started trespassing into Nigerian territory. Nigeria responded by establishing her boundaries on land and sea, and making firm arrangements for security of these boundaries through armed patrols. The boundary between Nigeria and Cameroon was seated between the British and German government since 1913 during the colonial days, even before the first World War started. Therefore the territorial waters of both countries were clearly defined and demarcated on a colonial map, which both Britain and Germany had endorsed. All independent African countries recognized at the level of OAU the inviolability of former colonial boundaries created by the European partition of Africa at the Berlin Conference of 1885.10<br/>            In any case the subsequent extension of territorial waters brought a new dimension of the problem of maritime international boundaries. The Nigeria-Cameroon border dispute was aggravated in this case by the discovery of large deposits of oil under the sea in the Bakassi Peninsula area. The Bakassi Peninsula has always been rich in maritime resources and with the discovery of oil, the territory assumes a portion of land worth dying for. Cameroon however, took advantage of Nigeria’s pro-occupation with the civil war between 1967 and 1970 to start drilling for offshore oil in the disputed area in the Atlantic sea along the Nigerian border in the Bakassi peninsula. After the end of the civil war the two countries made efforts to settle the dispute when General Yakubu Gowon visited Cameroon in 1970 to discuss the issue with the former president Ahidjo of Cameroon. As a minister in the Gowon administration and an eye witness to the agreement former president Shehu Shagari said:<br/>The two leaders (General Yakubu Gowon and president Ahidjo) discussed the matter of border dispute between themselves behind closed doors, only the chief surveyors of Nigeria and Cameroon were invited in the secret meeting between the two presidents or heads of state. At the end of the negotiations the two leaders signed a communiqué and initiated a MDP which showed the boundary lines agreed by both of them with the understanding that the details were to be worked out later, it was not until 1975 that General Gowon met with president Ahidjo at Maroua in Cameroon when the final agreement on what was known as the Coker/Ngoh line were finally agreed upon and initiated by the two leaders.11<br/>             It was understood that the agreement signed in 1975 by the two leaders would become law only after it was ratified by both countries  legislature. In the case of Nigeria the legislature at that time was the supreme military council under Gowon, but in the case of Cameroon, the elected legislature took no time in ratifying the agreement since it was mostly in their favour. The Nigerian Supreme Military Council under Gowon refused to ratify the agreement because it noticed serious anomalities in the agreement which gave away substantial part of what should have been Nigerian territory to Cameroon on the ground that Cameroon had already got some oil rigs placed in the territorial waters of the disputed area which Cameroon was not prepared to remove. It is believed that that General Gowon made this generous concession to the Cameroon in recognition of and appreciation of Cameroons stand behind Nigeria during the difficult period of the Nigerian civil war. However, members of the supreme military council, in the Gowon’s Administration believed that he ought to have shown Nigeria’s appreciation to Cameroon in some other ways, instead of surrendering (Gave Away) Nigerian’s rights and those of further generations to Cameroon.12<br/>            The Nigeria –Cameroon border is the most sensitive security zone of all our neighbours, because of this unresolved border problems in the Bakassi peninsula and is also potentially very explosive issue in the relationship of the two countries, because Nigeria shares ethnic affinity in both the north and south west of Cameroon. For instance, 98 percent of the people who live in the Bakassi peninsula are Nigerians from the Cross River State. Access to Calabar port to the southern eastern coast of Nigeria is controlled by the Bakassi peninsula. The port serves both merchant and Naval shipping, which makes it strategically important to Nigeria. On many occasions the Cameroonian security guards the Gendarmes have killed Nigerians in the surrounding villages of the Bakassi peninsula.<br/>            However, the dispute over the Bakassi peninsular is not only the product of redefinition of boundary by the colonial powers but more so a product of resource allocation and clash of tradition and modernity in which the pre-colonial history of the ancient kingdom of Calabar haunted the post-colonial reality of contemporary Nigeria and Cameroon. In pre-colonial times, the ancient kingdom of Calabar became part of Nigeria in 1914 under British rule. Among the many factors that contributed to the Nigeria – Cameroon conflict was the legacy of both the imperialist colonial rule and the neo-colonial regimes in African at the time, the imperialist-capitalist and the colonial masters like Portugal, German, France and Britain and their shrewd and selfish economic, political and strategic co-operations of the 19th Century acted as nursery for future African conflict. The ground work for such future conflicts in the region were laid through things like the divide and rule system of administration and the partitioning of African States and its peoples irrespective of the damage it caused to the peoples language, socio-political life and cultural affiliations and ancestral lineage. This selfish behaviour divided ethnic groups into territories controlled by the colonial lords and then stifled the reign of peace in the region as divided families opposed the system and fought for the unity of their families and friends. This response became rampart across the board in Africa as people objected the cruel and selfish destruction of their culture caused by the colonial masters. This selfish, mean and sneaky behaviour ignited many African conflicts especially the Bakassi peninsula case study. It is important to note that the primary cause of the conflict between Nigeria and Cameroon was the discovery of natural crude oils in the region. It is interesting to say that long before the discovery of oil in Bakassi, Cameroonians and Nigerians in the region lived in harmony although few squabbles were registered here and there. The reason both countries did not pay attention to Bakassi is in part because it was a remote area inhabited by people considered to be non-consequential. Notwithstanding, when oil and other natural resources and minerals were discovered in the peninsula, attention from both countries and also from their colonial connections was ignited, thus creating tension, argument and in some cases death. This is sad and really hypocritical because if oils was never discovered in this region, both regimes would have cared less about the region with its poor, remote, marshy and non-consequential inhabitants.13<br/>            However, this boundary is a product of the Anglo-German treaties and agreement 1885 and 1913: and Anglo French agreement during the mandate and trusteeship period.<br/>THE ANGLO-GERMAN BORDER ARRANGEMENT<br/>The foundation of the conflict: Much of the current border between Nigeria and Cameroon was determined in a series of accords and agreement between the British and Germans, beginning with the accord of April – June 1885 that defined the German and British spheres of influence from the coast of the Gulf of Guinea. This agreement placed the dividing line on the right bank of the Riodel-Ray, which reaches the sea between 8042 East and 8046 east.<br/>            In a bid to correct these flaws, the Germans and the British signed yet another agreement in 1890, which further modified the boundary. This time the Anglo-German spheres of influence were defined by a provisionary line from the head of Rio-del-Rey creek to a point on the British Admiralty chat at about longitude 808 East. On 14th April another Anglo-German accord was signed with the aim of clarifying the ambiguities of the previous one. It clearly stipulated the boundary between the British Cross River protectorate and the German Cameroons. In November 1893 a further agreement was reached that extended the border up to Lake Chad, and in March 1906 another accord was signed which defined the frontiers from Yola to Chad.14<br/>            Despite the multiplicity of agreements, Britain and Germany failed to agree on a satisfactory border. While the Germans who had realised the coastlines strategic importance, insisted that the Akpa-Yafe River was the ideal natural dividing line, the British preferred Ndian River. As far as the British were concerned, the latter River formed the natural boundary between the Bantu peoples of the Cameroons and the Efiks of Nigeria. After a long negotiation the British reluctantly accepted the German preference, which was formalized in an agreement signed on 20 April 1906. The starting point of the new coastal boundary was the intersection of the channel linking king point with Bakassi point and the Akwa-Yafe River. Between may 1907 and October 1909, Britain and Germany exchanged a series of notes, giving more precision to the borders of their colonial possessions of Cameroon and Nigeria, from Yola to the Atlantic Ocean.15<br/>            The last and probably most important border agreement was signed on 11 March 1913. It is particularly significant for at least three reasons. It was purportedly signed to correct the short comings of all the earlier agreements, as a result of the outbreak and outcome of World War II, this agreement turned out to be the last between the British and the Germans, and it has played a key role in all subsequent border negotiations and tensions between the two territories.<br/>            Some key clauses of the 1913 agreement were specifically aimed at addressing sensitive issues surrounding the volatile maritime portions of the border, particularly relevant are articles 18, 19, 20, 21, 27 and 29. Article 18 defined the boundary line at the coast as follows: it follows the thalweg of Akpakorum River dividing the mangrove islands near iKang... It then follows the thalweg of the Akwa-Yafe as far as a straight line joining Bakassi point and king point.<br/>            Conscious that the river might change its course article 19 stated that: should the thalweg of the lower Akwa-Yafe, upstream from the line Bakassi point, change its position in such a way as to affect the relative positions of the thalweg and the mangrove islands, a new adjustment of the boundary shall be made on the bases of the new positions as determined by a map to be made for this purpose. By establishing the thalweg of the Akpa-Yafe as the new maritime boundary between the two colonies, article 18 and 27-29 placed the Bakassi peninsula under German jurisdiction. However, there was uncertainty over the ownership of the peninsula should be lower course of the Akpa-Yafe River change.16<br/>            This ambiguity was addressed by article 20, which stipulated that: should the lower course of the Akpe-Yafe so change its mouth as to transfer its waters to the Rio-del-Rey, it is agreed that the area now known as the Bakassi peninsula shall still remain German territory. The same condition applies to any portion of the territory now agreed to is being British, which may be cut off in a similar way.<br/>            Article 21 further clarified the definition of the maritime boundary by stating that: from the centre of the navigable channel on a line joining Bakassi point and king point: the boundary shall follow the centre of the navigable channel of the Akpa-Yafe River as far as a three-mile limit of territorial jurisdiction. For the purposes of defining the boundary, the navigable channel of the Akpa-Yafe River shall be considered to lie whooly to the East of the navigable channels of the Cross and Calabar River.17<br/>            Article 23 provided for free navigation between the open sea and the Akpa-Yafe, while article 25 gave Britain the right to develop the navigable channels of the Cross and Calabar Rivers from a three-mile limit landward. Article 36, on the other hand, protected the fishing rights of the native populations on the Bakassi Peninsula without however, diminishing German jurisdiction over the Peninsula.<br/>            More importantly, the nationality of the border populations as affected by these boundary adjustments was addressed by article 27, which stipulated that: it is agreed that within six months form the data of marking the boundary, natives living near the boundary line may if they so desire, cross over to live on the other side, and may take with them their portable property and harvesting crops.<br/>            This was the state of the Cameroon-Nigeria – a border when World War I broke out in 1914. Despite the apparently detailed nature of the Anglo-German treaty of 1913, the border was still ill-defined, which made the agreement difficult to implement. Arguably, the origins of the Cameroon-Nigeria border question could be traced back to the failure of the British and the Germans (who first colonized the area) to create a well defined and conflict free boundary. Following the war, the Cameroons were taken over by the British and the French. This led to new boundary arrangements between Cameroon and Nigeria.<br/>THE ANGLO-FRENCH BORDER ARRANGEMENT<br/>            After Germany’s defeat, Lancelot Oliphant and George’s picot, representing the British and French Governments respectively, partitioned the former German Cameroon in February 1916, with France claiming four fifths and the British barely one fifth of the territory. This arrangement was formalized in March 1916 in what became known as the picots partition. Meanwhile on 17 March 1916, General Dobell “unilaterally” issued proclamation No. 10 that determined the boundary between the British and the French zones. On 10th July 1919 the British security of state for colonies, Lord Alfred Milner, and the French Minister of Colonies, Henry Simon, signed an agreement that essentially confirmed the accord of 4th March 1916. And in 1922 the League of Nations accepted the Anglo-French arrangement over former German Cameroon.<br/>            The various Anglo-French accords from 1916 to 1919 did not alter the Cameroon-Nigeria border as laid down in the 1913 Anglo-German treaty, especially in respect of the maritime portions. Border discussion between London and Paris from 1919 to 1960 were largely limited to tiding the partition line between the British and French Cameroons. As regards the British Colony of Nigeria and British Cameroon, a kind of “no boundary mentality,” prevailed for much of this period. This was especially so as the British for the purposes of administrative convenience administered their portion of the Cameroon as an appendage to eastern Nigeria.<br/>            In the minds of the British, Southern Cameroon was ethnologically part of the eastern region of Nigeria. And, to borrow from Adener, “the British acquired Southern Cameroon in order to extend the Eastern Nigeria boundary Eastwards, and in the process, fill the missing links of Eastern Nigeria. However, the plebiscite in the British Cameroons on 11 February 1961 revived the importance of ascertaining the Cameroon-Nigeria border, it brought about the first major change in the boundary line between Cameroon and Nigeria since the 1913 agreement. While the northern portion of British Cameroons became an integral part of the independent Federal Republic of Nigeria, the Southern part was reunited with the French speaking parts, however this did not affect the coastal boundary line between Nigeria and Cameroon Treaty of 1913.18<br/>POST-INDEPENDENCE BOUNDARY ARRANGEMENT (1961-75)<br/>            Although Cameroon and Nigeria subscribed to the principle of the inviolability of colonially inherited boundaries, as prescribed by departing colonial powers and formalised in the OAU Charter, the governments of the two contiguous states were aware that their border constituted a potent seed of discord, especially in the aftermath of the controversial plebiscite in southern Cameroon in 1961. To forestall any dispute, a joint Cameroon-Nigerian border commission was created in 1965, shortly after independence. However, the commission had hardly begun its work when the Nigerian civil war broke out in 1966. It resumed its activities after the war, arriving at a number of landmark declarations on the border question.19<br/>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>            The aims and objectives of this project work are listed as follows:<br/>To analyze Nigeria – Cameroon relations under President Olusegun Obasanjo’s administration;<br/>To examine the International Court of Justice judgement and its impact on Nigeria – Cameroon relations;<br/>To examine issues that led to the settling up of a joint commission between Nigeria and Cameroon;<br/>To examine the impact of the 1913 Anglo-German Agreement on Nigeria and Cameroon; and<br/>To make appropriate recommendations in which Nigeria – Cameroon relations could be improved.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This research work will be limited to the issue of the Nigerian foreign policy towards Cameroon. For a time frame, I will be locating my research on from 1999 to 2007. In other to achieve an objective, unbiased and an elaborate analysis, this research limits it indepth analysis of the Nigerian foreign policy towards Cameroon.<br/>METHODOLOGY<br/>            By the nature of this study, the historical and descriptive analytical approach will be used. Emphasis would be placed on the use of secondary source, not for the fact that primary source is not important in this study. The use of historical approach is predicated on the grounds that the very nature of this study makes it indispensible for a historical investigation into the evolution of the Nigeria – Cameroon relations while recognizing the importance of historicity every modest attempt will be made to be descriptive.

This observation came on the heels of incessant crisis which the region have been witnessing for decades but which took alarming dimension in loosing years of the 1990’s and the opening years of the new millennium. The region from one decade to another has witnessed unprecedented crisis which revolve round political and most importantly economic factors. Also from one decade to another the nature and dynamics of crisis in the region have changed, the transformations which the crisis took from the one period to another have paved way for its institutionalization in the history of the region and Nigeria in general.1 If the institutionalization in the history of the Niger Delta crisis in the politics and economy of the country is something to discuss, the threat which it has been posing and still posing to domestic and international security of the Nigerian nation state is an aspect which requires critical academic enquiry.<br/>A systematic analysis of the crisis is informed by my intention to identify the changing dynamics of what constitutes national security over the years and how the nation state of Nigeria have been contending with the threat which the Niger Delta crisis is posing to the so called national security. National security questions is a complex of political, legal, social, economic, ideological and military problems that arises in the course of a people struggling for political and economic independence and for the establishment of equal and friendly relations with other people in the bilateral and international affairs.<br/>It is imperative to see how regional based crisis affect the survival of the entire country and how the political entity called Nigeria have been dealing with the changing dynamics of the crisis, the current study therefore understands that the concept of national security is fluid and dynamic. All nations of the world contend and will continue to contend with the challenges arising from the national security. To Nigeria, the complicated nature of the Niger Delta crisis poses serious and enduring threat to the fragile nature of Nigerian democracy and the ever volatile national security.<br/>What this work explores is the complexity involved in the maintenance of national security which arose as a result of the crisis in the Niger Delta. For the purpose of this research, the concept of National Security questions and the contributions of Niger Delta crisis are both international and domestic in nature.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS<br/>In this work, I attempt to answer the entire questions of the place of crude oil in the escalation and the reduction of the Niger Delta crisis. The significance of the other exigencies or factors in the crisis? The contributions of the Multinational Corporation and different political ferments in the region? The Niger Delta crisis cannot be understood without a critical understanding of the relationship between individual communities on the one hand and with the federal government on the other hand which revolve round the control of resources and retarded infrastructural, economic and social development in the region.<br/>To what extents have the crisis constitutes threats to national security? Put differently, what is the threat which the crisis is posing to the Nigeria’s nascent democracy? How crisis have metamorphosed in the all-embracing concept of national security is also analyzed and the entire attempts made by the federal government to preserve legitimacy in the name of the fundamental national security are not left undiscussed.<br/>Niger Delta crisis at every point in time have threatened the primacy responsibility of the government in terms of security of lives and properties and the preservation of oneness of Nigeria as a single political entity.2 National security transcends the primary role of the government in the protection of lives and properties. It also involves the international security and sovereignty. The gagging question is: is the Niger Delta crisis posing any threat to the international security and sovereignty of the Nigerian nation?<br/>1.3       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>National security questions and the role played by the Niger Delta crisis is theme which requires adequate scholarly attention.<br/>The objective of this study therefore are<br/>1.   To look at how the Niger Delta crisis affects Nigerian national security.<br/>2.   To locate the impact of the Niger Delta crisis within the framework of its implication of national security.<br/>3.   To see how regional based crisis affect the survival of the entire country.<br/>4.   To identify the changing dynamics and what constitutes nationals security over the years and how the nation state of Nigeria has been contending with the crisis.<br/>5.   The place of rude oil in the escalation and in the reduction of the Niger Delta crisis.<br/>6.   The significance of the other exigencies or factors in the crisis.<br/>7.   The contribution of the multination corporation and different political ferments in the regions.<br/>1.4       JUSTIFICATION<br/>The justification for this work can best be appreciated from two major perspectives namely, the need to carryout a critical academic analysis of he origin of the Nigeria Delta Crisis and an appraisal of the impact of the Niger Delta Crisis on national security, hence the changing dynamics of the crisis and the high degree of internationalization which its taken in recent years. The internationalization of the Niger Delta Crisis is as old as the history of the crisis itself; however, in recent years the concern of the international community is getting higher and higher.<br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE NIGER DELTA CRISIS: IT'S IMPACT ON NIGERIAN'S NATIONAL SECURITY <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE NIGER DELTA CRISIS: IT'S IMPACT ON NIGERIAN'S NATIONAL SECURITY ", "id": 69}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>NIGERIA ROLES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN AFRICA<br/>A CASE STUDY OF ECOWAS<br/> TABLE OF CONTENTS </b><br/>         CHAPTER ONE<br/>Introduction                                                <br/> CHAPTER TWO <br/>Nigeria’s Role in the Establishment of International Organizations                                                                <br/> CHAPTER THREE <br/>Origin and Establishment of ECOWAS                      <br/>CHAPTER FOUR <br/>Conclusion                                                          <br/> Bibliography                                                                         <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Nigeria lies between latitudes 40N and 140N and Longitudes 20 east and 150 east of the Greenwich Meridian. This is an area of 922,200 square kilometers (356,000 square miles). To travel from the west to the east is a distance of 1,120 kilometers (700 miles) from the south to north of the country about 1,040 kilometers (650 miles). It is bounded in the north by the Sahara Desert and in the south by the Gulf of Guinea, an arm of the Atlantic Ocean. <br/>Seen on a map, Nigeria can best be described as an approximately square expanse of vast territory divided into three unequal parts by a rough letter Y, which is formed by the confluence of that majestic African river, the Niger, with its chief tributary, the Benue, on its coastward journey to the Atlantic Ocean, into which it merges in the mangrove forests that line the intricate network of the Niger Delta.2<br/>Nigeria, being the most populous country in Africa, has been described as “the giant of Africa, benevolent hegemony”, etc. Nigeria with a population of approximately 150 million divided among three hundred and fifty ethnic groups practicing the two dominant monotheistic religions of Islam and Christianity and with a few still devoted to their African gods.3<br/>Nigeria is also phenomenally endowed country with billions of barrels of crude petroleum and huge gas deposits, one of the largest in the world, abundant agricultural land and sunshine, untapped solid mineral of all kinds, coal rivers that are harnessed for hydro-electricity and above al, a virile and highly sophisticated and educated people. <br/>Nigeria is indeed a land inhabited by a people of varied ethnic origin and culture, whose ancestors settled in the area that is now known as Nigeria in successive waves over many centuries. Among the chief ethnic groups that occupy Nigeria are the Hausa, Yoruba, Ibo, Kanuri, Fulani, Ibibio, Tiv, Ijaw, Edo, Efik, Nupe, Urhobo, Ekoi, Borgu and a host of other smaller groups each with its own tongue and specific cultural practices. However, underlying the diversity of the various group/peoples of Nigeria, is the deep current of cultural unity characteristic of all black Africa. <br/>At the north, east and west borders of Nigeria are Nigeria, Cameroon/Chad and Benin Republic respectively. <br/>Aggressive coastal erosion and flooding of the coastal villages and towns, a ravaging gully and bad land erosion of the eastern region characterized the land mass. There is aggressive desert encroachment from the north due to climatic changes and human activities (such as deforestation from fuel wood and overgrazing). <br/>There is frequent flooding when rivers overflow their banks. Reservoir flooding is also a common occurrence. Besides, Nigeria gained independence in October 1st 1960. Since the first coup d’ et al in 1966, the country has been unstable, with so many coups. <br/>However, Nigeria was divided into four main geographical zones: Zone 1 is along the coast where rainfall mostly of swamps. The area is served by many rivers and creeks. Rainfall is high and spread over about eight (8) months in the year; Zone 2 is the forest region where rainfall is also heavy and the vegetation is made up mostly of the thick forest; Zone 3 is the semi-Savanna Zone which lies between the forest Zone and; Zone 4 the true Savanna Zone, in the north. Here the main geographical features are grassland and the low incidence of rainfall. The Sahara desert is not far away. <br/>It is important to note at this juncture, however, the special position which the River Niger has held in the country. It is not surprising that the country has taken its name from the river. We must note that the river is unlikely to have taken its name from the colour, black or niger, used to describe Simeon of the period of the Apostles (Acts 13:1), or from the Afro-Americans carried across the Atlantic as human cargoes.4<br/>It was once suggested that the river had been called Nigeir or Nigir from the second century and derived from the Latin word “black”. Other suggestions have been that Nijer was the name given by an African community to the river, or that the Greek word for river is Naghar. <br/>Whatever the root of the word “Niger”, it is sufficient for us to note that the word Nigeria was first used to describe the country by a British Lady, Flora Shaw. <br/>Needless to say, the peoples of Nigeria have a history which stretches far back into the past; in the Savannah Lands and plains north and west of the river Nigeri, the Kanuri, Hausa, Fulani, Borgu, Nupe, Jukun and Yoruba people evolved well organized states of varying size, while the powerful Benin state lay in the forest lands immediately west of the Niger, and the Ibos, the Efiks and the people of the Niger Delta occupied the eastern bank of the Niger in political units of varied nature and size. <br/>One of the greatest medieval empires to establish itself in the grassland of the western Sudan was that of Kanem-Bornu, which was first, establish in the Lake Chad region towards the eight century, and whose latter-day rulers, the Kanuri, now live mostly in the north eastern part of Nigeria. Bornu’s position at the receiving end of one of the most ancient trade routes across the Sahara from Cairo through the Fezzan to Lake Chad enabled it to develop rapidly as a leading commercial and political centre. Several centuries of development under the able leadership of Shehu El Kanemi in the nineteenth century, Bornu was the only major state in northern Nigeria to withstand the Fulani Jihad of Usman Dan Fodio. <br/>To the west of Bornu were the seven Hausa states – Daura, Kano, Zau Zau (Zaria), Gobir, Katsina, Rano and Biram which had a history only a little less ancient than that of Bornu itself. Each of the Hausa states traced its origin to a common ancestor, called Bayajidda (or Abuyazidu) who is said to have come across the desert to Bornu from Arabia and gone from thence to Daura where he killed a sacred snake that had long prevented the people of Daura from drawing water from the local well. The queen of Daura married him and bore him a son, Bawo, who in turn had six sons who became the Kings of Daura, Kano, Zau Zau, Gobir, Katsina and Rano. These were known as the Hausa Bakwai (the seven Hausa states), the seventh being Biram. There is however no doubt that the history of the Hausa – speaking peoples stretches much further back than this, and it would appear that Hausa states had been in existence for a long time before the advent of Bayajidda. Although there are considerable ethnic and cultural differences among the various Hausa speaking groups, the seven Hausa states developed a common language, Hausa, and retained a close form of association in which the western state of Gobir was entrusted with the task of defending of other states from invasions from the west, while Kano, Katsina Rano and to a lesser extent Daura were commercial and industrial centres and Zaria was to guard Hausa land against the pagan people to the South. In addition, the Hausa believe that a number of other states, to which they refer as Banza Bakwai (illegitimate Hausa) and which are listed as Kebbi, Nupe, Gwari, Yauri, Yoruba and Kwararafa (Jukun) have related origins to the Hausa states. One source even identifies the Queen of Daura who married Abuyazziri as a decedent of Lamurudu, who is the father of the legendary ancestor of the Yoruba people. In the nineteenth century, the Fulani, a pastoral people partly settled in Hausa land, rose in a holy war against the Habe ruler of the Hausa states, and under the inspired leadership of Othman Dan Fodio succeeded in conquering all of Hausa land which they welded into a vast empire that the descendants of Othman Dan Fodio ruled from the new capital of Sokoto.5<br/>To the south were the Yoruba kingdoms, also with a very long historical past. The Yorubas would appear to be the descendants of two main groups of people, one, an older indigenous stock whose religious centre was the city of Ife, and the other of the name stock as the founders of Bornu and the Hausa states. A myth of origin which reflects the latter element states that the Yoruba kingdoms were founded by Oduduwa, son of an Arabian or Nubian king name Lamurudu. As a result of internal strife, Oduduwa was driven out of his father’s kingdom in the east (possibly in the region of Nubia). After long wandering, he conquered the people of Ife and settled there. Out of his seven children, six became the crowned rulers of Yoruba land and another, the ancestor of the rulers of Benin. by the sixteenth century, the Yoruba kingdom had developed into a highly organized empire under the sway of the state of Oyo, and at its height this empire covered an area reaching from the banks of the Niger to the present boundaries of Togo. In the nineteenth century the Yoruba kingdoms fell victim to civil-wars and suffered immensely from the demand of the slave trade, while part of the northern reaches of the Empire were conquered by the Fulanis. Further south in the first hands, the kingdom of Benin which claimed relations to the Yorubas, had also developed into a highly organized state in medieval times. Benin was one of the first Nigerian state to visited by the Portuguese, and the Oba of Benin sent an ambassador to the court of Portugal early in the sixteenth century.6<br/>All the states whose history we have briefly discussed, as well as a host of others including Nupe, Borgu, and Jukun people, as well as the Ibo – Benin States of Onitsha and Asaba on the River Niger attained a high level of material property and cultural development. Thus, although present-day Nigeria is a new country with arbitrarily carved out frontiers, it is by no means an agglomeration of petty tribes with few relations between each other, but on the contrary contains people with a long historical past who had achieved remarkable political organization in the past and had long been in contact with each other. <br/>History is essentially a dynamic and continuous process. The West Africa we observe today represent a specific moment in time, just as a photograph of athletes in the middle of a race freezes the runners in one specific moment in time. We may admire the photograph and the attitude of the athletes caught in that moment of time but it is not complete by itself and can only be fully appreciated if one knows that the athletes are in the middle of a race at that given moment and have not been standing all their lives in the position in which the photograph was taken. Similarly, West Africa has a long history behind it and the physiognomy we observe at present is by no means a frozen reality, but a moment in the flow of history.7<br/>Africa has known in the past great nations and empires that brought together within their fold a wide variety of peoples. The nation-building process continued over several centuries before the European conquest. One after the other, the great empires of Ghana, Mali and Songhai had brought together many of the peoples of the Western Sudan in one single political entity. Askia Mohammed Toure, the greatest of the Songhai emperors, ruled over an empire that covers virtually the whole of West Africa from the Atlantic Coast in the West to Northern Nigeria as far as Agades in the East. Even as late at the Nineteen century, the Fulani Jihad had unified the Hausa speaking peoples of northern Nigeria in a vast empire ruled from Sokoto which extended as far south as the northern fringes of Yoruba land westward into the northern part of present-day Dahomey. British colonization of Nigeria was only different from the past attempts at setting up large-size nations in that the unifying element came from an external force, but this is by itself nothing new in history. <br/>A nation may be formed in two ways: internal conquest by one group which imposes its rule on the other component groups and than evolves a unified political entity with their participation, or external conquest by an outside group which forces the dominated groups into a new political entity forming part of its empire. The former may be said to be a case in countries like Japan, China or Russia, while the latter is true of countries like Britian or India. The British colonization may best be described as a unifying element which, although provided by an external factor, nevertheless had the result of welding the peoples of Nigeria into a single political unit. The point that must be stressed here is that although no Africa disputes the fact that the present boundaries of African states are in a sense artificial, the general desire is to break down these barriers to form larger units, not to regress by falling back into a multitude of mini-states. The apparent diversity of Africa ethnic groups is fundamentally misleading: underlying this apparent diversity there is in fact a very deep cultural unity. Within Nigeria itself, we have seen has in the Hausa myth of origin a number of other Nigerian peoples ranging from the Yoruba to the Jukun, the Nupe, etc, are said to be an offshoot of the Hausa-speaking tribes, while the Benin ruling dynasties are of Yoruba origin. Similarly, some of the Ijaw people in the Niger Delta claim to have come from Ife, the Yoruba spiritual home, while the Onitsha and Asaba Ibos claim to have originated from Benin. Many of the Nigerian languages belong to the same language groups, and animist, religious practices are basically similar all over Africa. It is against this background of deep cultural unity that the apparent diversity of African peoples must be viewed: Africa is in fact fundamental one.8<br/>Be that as it may, its role in the development of international organizations in Africa cannot be over emphasized.  Nigeria over the years, have been an active player in the development of international organizations in Africa and in other parts of the globe and in conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa and the rest of the world despite the myriads criticisms from many countries including those in Africa and their non-appreciation of the role of Nigeria in the development of Africa, and their claims that Nigeria is playing host to many contradictions, socially, politically and economically, to the extent that Nigeria’s quest for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council is seen as inconsistent with the domestic situation Nigeria has been championing the case of the whole of Africa. The survival and the development of international organization would have been futile without Nigeria as catalytic agent. <br/>Nigeria’s contributions and her role in the reversal of the phantom coup in Sao Tome and principle during the Leon Sullivan Summit in Abuja in 2003 is a case in point. Emphasis must also be made on her role under the fourth republic, as well as the critical areas of Nigeria’s intervention, such as the Chairmanship of the African Union (AU) under President Olusegun Obasanjo, Africa Peer Review Mechanism, coverage of the African Union in the Nigerian press, peacemaking and peacekeeping among others. <br/>To understand Nigeria’s decision to promote the establishment of a West African Economic Community and other organisations, one must first understand the evolution of Nigeria’s foreign policy since independent. <br/>Nigeria played a crucial, if not critical role in the movement that culminated in the establishment of ECOWAS. The motivation for this commitment to a West African Economic Community lies more in politics than in economics in the short run. Although the economic gains of integration are not discounted, it appears the diplomatic leverage have in what was perceived as an increasingly polycentric world, featured more in the calculations of those who actively championed the establishment of ECOWAS. <br/>By the time of her independence, Nigeria’s foreign policy guidelines had been formulated by the departing colonial power. These were embodied in a maiden foreign policy statement made by the first civilian prime minister on 20 August 1960 just a few months before formal independence. According to him, Nigeria would follow an independent policy founded on Nigeria’s interest and consistent with the moral and democratic principles on which our constitution is based. <br/>Paradoxically, it is Nigeria’s own dominant position in the region and the implication of her leader’s commitment to the western model of development in circumstances (National as well as Global) hostile to such a course that may well be the most formidable obstacle to the emergence of the community. <br/>Indeed, it can be argued that ECOWAS drew considerable strength from the successful negotiation which had been concluded by the EEC with the combined representatives of African, Caribbean and Pacific states as contained in the Lome convention. This unity in the face of a strong and equality United Europe (not withstanding some minor differences within the EEC) impressed, Nigerian leaders in a way that an Economic Community of West Africa, modeled after the European Economic Community, was an immediate imperative.<br/>This conviction led Nigeria to expand a lot of her resources in the campaign for the establishment of ECOWAS. <br/>   <br/><br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nNIGERIA ROLES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN AFRICA A CASE STUDY OF ECOWAS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " NIGERIA ROLES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN AFRICA A CASE STUDY OF ECOWAS", "id": 70}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL AND THE CHALLENGES OF CORRUPT PRACTICES IN NIGERIA 1993 – 1998<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF GENERAL SANI ABACHA)<br/>  ABSTRACT</b><br/>          The main objective of this work is to access and evaluate how corruption has eaten deep into the economy of Nigeria.

The organisation, their role, their main function and goals, financing and organisation and also history of corruption and it’s definitions. <br/> BACKGROUND AND HISTORY OF TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL (TI).<br/>Transparency international, briefly (TI), is a non-governmental organsiation with seat, acting world-wide, in Berlin which engages itself in national and international people and economical corruption fight and raising the awareness of it. This includes, but not limited to political corruption, it publishes yearly its corruption perception index, a comparative listing of corruption worldwide.<br/> Transparency international were created in 1993 in Berlin friends from all over the world engaged by the former director of world Bank Peter Eigen and developed in shortest time to one most influential non-profit and partly-political independent movement of the most recent time, which can be compared concerning it political influence, for instance with Attac or Amnesty international. The head office of Transparency international and Transparency International Germany are in Berlin1. <br/>          The cause for the establishment of the organisation was the idea, the world corruption, which had accepted unbelievable extents and effect in the time of the cold war to fight by independent influencing control of an outstanding and particularly control instance standing for itself. <br/>The worldwide reasonance on the establishment of transparency international in the year 1993 was unexpected. The historical framework offered a favourable surrounding field. The old iron curtain was with the German  unit  finally  pleases,  the  core  of  the  European  union joined <br/> themselves straight, the Gulf was in Iran and Iraq,  the  civil  war  in Yugoslavia humans for justice had sensitized and frame the U.S.A, “blew the democratic wind” the Clinton era. Much was ready in paying a new. The idea of transparency international fell on fruitful soil, however in response also defense and criticism provoked. <br/> PHILOSOPHY OF THE MOVEMENT AND IT’S PROCEEDINGS <br/>Transparency International already carry the basic concept in the name. In the variety of the different kind of corruption is according to the principles of the organisation as large common denominator, when solution, to prevent simple transparency in handling the things crucially, which it make possible, corruption leads into constructional courses. Because so paradoxically has from the point of view of this system also jedwede corruption in society and economics their sense. It is the symptoms for a malfunction in the system and if one liked to fight corruption, one must extract their fertile soil from her:<br/>●  by consistent disclosure and transparency of the things and linear path by current control by independent supervision<br/>●        by persuasive power and acceptance opposite concerning and authors.<br/>●        by careful selection and rotation of the personnel within the ranges concerned.<br/>Multi-eye principle with financial effective control decision Complete documentation, particularly in the assignment and procurement area. <br/>          Most corruption accusation take place under poverty suffer on international level in state (south America, Africa). One of these states formed a proper vicious circle from poverty and corruption, which from own Kraft of the states hardly more is to be broken through and it makes susceptible thereby for outside political influencing control. When the fact appear particularly paradoxical that a certain “corruption impact is already presupposed” in investment funds (usually 10% of the sum total). <br/>Financed in development assistance project usually from tax funds to be the same country the corruption again. Hence, it most often in interest of foreign ruling powers or companies to promote the corruption in a country to induce if not straight, in order to enrich itself. <br/>The beginning of transparency international is not confrontative but consenstative contrary to Amnesty international of Green peace, D. H. the government or to stand comparing head as supporters and aids on an equal footing in things corruption to the side and meet them with reason and understanding. A beginning that always does not become and pretty often in the cross fire of the criticism was gladly seen stands. Straight of others non-governmental organisation (NGO), like Attac or Green peace, those their popularity from the power of the mass and the road refer. Peter Eigen justifies this proceeding with his origin. <br/>Someone like the director of the world Bank within the range East Africa nearly 25 years “more over the top” in the political, social and economic High Society operated, could demonstrate badly also over 60 years again with a protest poster before company building. <br/>It had to continue, where it had stopped. Above in the executive floor, in addition, this explains the success of transparency international. Before scarcely 15 years in particularly citizen of Berlin Manson as bare vision based, applies for transparency international today as one of most successfully anti-corruption movement of the world, which operate in the meantime offices in over 90 states locally established national and chapters information. The work beginning of Transparency International is to work “from above” itself thus with the powerful ones made of government to set economics and society to a table and to convince it from the sinnhaftigkeit  the non-corruption to. At the soundest one thing is that corruption is simply expensive the argument convenience so far most frequently to co-operate in the context of the transparency international consultation with the responsible anti-corruption expert2.<br/>ORGANISATION AND ROLE<br/>Transparency International (TI) as a group of some 100 national chapters, with an international secretariat in Berlin, Germany originally  founded in Germany in May 1993 as a not for profit organisation TI is now an international non-governmental organisation (NGO’s) and claims to be moving towards a completely democratic structure TI say  of itself. <br/>Transparency international is a global network, civil organisation leading the fight against corruption it brings people together in a powerful worldwide coalition to end the devastating impact of corruption on men, women and children around the world. TI’s mission is to “create change toward a world free of corruption”.<br/>Transparency international as a global network fighting corruption in national arena in number of ways. They bring together relevant player from government civil society, business and the media to promote transparency in elections, in public administration in procurement and in business. TI global network of chapters and contact also use advocacy campaign to lobby governments to implement anti-corruption reforms. <br/>Politically non-partisan, TI does not undertake investigation of alleged  corruption  or  expose  individual  cases,  but  as time were work in coalition  with  organizations that do. It  develop tools in fighting corruption and work with other civil society organizations, companies and government to implement them. TI is a non-partisan and to build coalition against corruption. Transparency international has the skills tools, expertise and broad participation to fight corruption on the ground as well as though global and regional initiative.<br/> MAIN FUNCTIONS AND GOALS<br/>1.       it help design and implement system for financial and administrative oversight of grants and project of the Americas Department (one country and multi-country) and provides administrative and logistical support to two senior programmed  co-ordinators;<br/>2.       being the lead co-ordinator, including financial and administrative management and monitoring of activities and result of the grants provided to TI nations in the Americas through the TI Anti-corruption. Delivery change (AD:DC) global programmes; and<br/>3.       Provide lead logistical supervision and co-ordination of key regional meetings.<br/>The works of Transparency International is around and demand in population; enterprises and politics. In order to arrange for example the annual corruption index of the countries questionnaires provided with questions how; Which sector are according to their opinion affected particularly by corruption? (with a valuation of 1 (corrupt free) to 5 (particularly corrupt) as strongly their life is affected by corruption? (with valuation scale 1 (not at all) totally).<br/>Credit it or a member of their household in the last 12 months in any form bribe paid? (Answer Yes or No). On the basis of these data monthly to be different topic diagrams for the different nations. In transparency international quarterly news type character (TIQ    ) are the intermediate result as well as other messages to seen order than booklet from TI to refer free of charge event and results approximately around the world to the homepage. <br/>In the Annual report (annual report) the analyses and research result are combined into the previous year. Additionally single results are published about special (bribe payers survey corruption special brochure) separately. <br/>FINANCING AND ORGANISATION<br/>The foreign officers are subject to bilateral and multilateral financing and organisation. The parent company transparency international attaches importance to the fact that the daughter offices as selfly-sufficient as possible in its respective homeland or operational areas to become active to be able to sense from country to country and from culture to culture other rules must be considered and be supposed. Also, the definition of corruption is individually made in each country. <br/>Transparency international sub-divide it national offices (national chapters) in groups as regional and working groups which can act drop referred also independently. TI avoids it to interfere directly into the interest of the national chapters and depends on their international work exclusive of their structural so the local civilian – social forces are to be mobilize and promoted. <br/>Transparency and success<br/>The principal purpose is the idealistic vision of total and world wide eliminating of corruption. On the way to this vision TI could already obtain some success and partial success. <br/>International (except) <br/>Change of consciousness with worldwide organisation such as the world bank to prevent completely particularly advanced by their new president. Wolfson worldwide convention against corruption at the United Nation’s (presented 2003 in Mexico)<br/>OEDC convention against the bribery of foreign sovereignty carrier of 1997, in which 34 hands  oneself export countries obligate, the bribery abroad by their export. Convention of the laws to national right can be accussed in Germany for a bribery abroad taken place and condemned also valuably.National (except) Development of evaluation of the OECD convention in German right and demand of the development and application of anti-corruption laws. Thus TI Germany submitted a detail statement June 2003 for the phase II of monitoring process and fighting corruption conditions. <br/>Influencing control on the formulation of the tax adjustment law TI pursues the goal that the practice of fiscal authorities follow clear the will of legislator and de-facto-removability of bribe payment is not waited at home and aboard. <br/>Since the beginning of year 1999 opposite TI and TI-Germany the OECD, the European Union and the federal Government was active, in order to reach the export credit and institutions for export insurance of the OECD member states (the ECAS) may not have cover export traders, if they care by bribe payments or corruption for a long time is tried to obtain by clear regulations for the public export credit promotion an internationally effective basis3. <br/>Transparency international’s biggest success has been to put the topic of corruption on the world’s agenda international institution such as the world Bank and the international monetary fund (IMF) now view corruption as one of the main obstacle for development, whereas prior to the 1990’s this topic was broadly discussed. TI furthermore, played a vital role in the introduction of the United Nation convention against corruption and the OECD Anti-Bribery convention4 .<br/> CORRUPTION PERCEPTION INDEX (CPI) <br/>The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) besides the world Bank corruption index is the most commonly used measured for corruption in countries worldwide. To form this index, Transparency international complies survey’s that ask businessman and analysists book in and outside the countries their analyzing, their perceptions of how a country is. Relying on he numbers of actual corruption cases would not work since law and enforcement of law differ significantly from country to country. <br/>HISTORY OF CORRUPTION<br/>The history of corruption is as old as the world because ancient civilization have traces of widespread illegality and corruption thus, lipset and Lenz5 (2000) not that” corruption has been ubiquitous in complex societies from ancient Egypt, Israel and Greece down to the present”. Corruption is also believed to be in any continent, region, and ethnic group. It cut across faith religious denominations and all system and affects both young and old, man and woman alike. Corruption is found in democracy and dictatorial politics feudal, capitalist and socialist economics, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist culture are equally bedeviled by corruption. This does not, however mean that the incidence and magnitude of corrupt activities are the same in every society. Some countries are more corrupt than others. “As George Orwell notes in his read book, Animals farm. All animals are equals, but some animals are more equal than others6. Though, (corruption) seen as global phenomenon but it is more devastating to the developing economic and to the so-call “Third world”.  However, corruption is pandemic in Nigeria and in many other African and Asian Countries, their leaders as well as the followers are corrupt. The problem of corruption is traceable to the debauchery of colonial rule (Ekeh 1975, 1985 Osaghare 1988) <br/>Among the theories of Africa politics that has help to understand the predicament and more importantly the issue of endemic corruption, include theory of two publics developed by Peter Eke. Prebandalism popularized by Richard Joseph and Gurnal Myrdals soft state thesis. Others have captured Africa as a rentier, patrimonial and neopatrimonial state. These theories are important not only to understand the predicament in Africa countries but also providing explanation for the pandemic corruption ravaging Africa countries. <br/>Ekeh (1975, 1985), argued that one most striking impacts of colonialism was the emergence of two public realm. The primordial and civil public realism which related differently with the private realm in terms of morality. For Nigeria, Eke (1975) argued: only right i.e. benefits<br/>are expected from the state by its citizens who own duties or responsibilities to a native sector. The former forms the basis of an amoral civil public realm and the later a public was concerned with illegitimate and exploitative colonial rule and had no moral linkages with the private realms. It was an amoral public realm in which cheating the system was considered a patriotic duty (Ifidon 1996; 162). Let consider the word corruption and what do we mean by corruption? <br/>Peter (1978) identified three dimensional approaches to the definition. These are definitions based on legal criteria, public opinion and public interest. From the legal perspective, political corruption is connected to any behaviour that violates some formal standard or rule of behaviour set down by a political system for its public officials. For example 8Nye (1967:419) conceives political to mean an act which “deviates” from the formal duties of public role because of private regarding (personal, close family, clique)  pecuniary  or  status  gains; or violates rule  against  the  exercise of  certain  types  of  private  role-<br/>regarding influence”. This definition includes behaviour such as bribery (use to prevent the judgment of a person into a position of trust)’ nepotism (bestowal of purpose reason of inscriptive relationship rather than merit and the misappropriation (illegal appropriation of public resources for private uses. ( Banfield 1961). <br/>Another classic perception of corruption is that of Rogow and Laswell (1963: 132-133) for them corruption is taken to be a violation of the public interest. The definition is also lacken to ambiquitous because public interest like public opinion is difficult to determine.<br/>          Brinkerhoff (2000:241) see “corruption as subsuming wide variety of illegal, illicit, irregular and/or unprincipled activities and behaviours”. From this perspective, corruption then is importantly a moral, political and legal issue.<br/>In this context, corruption is a multi-conceptual that has legal, social, political, economic and ethnical connotations. It comes in various forms, it simply conceived in this as misuse, or improper use of power and influence, deliberately and consciously for personal aggrandizement <br/>or group advantage. In this sense, corruption connotes the abuse of public role or resources or the use of illegitimate forms of political power and influence by public or private practice. Conceived in this manner, corruption is inextricably tied (but not limitedly) to politics, more especially i.e. politics defined from Harold Lasswell tradition of “who get what when and how” and perhaps how much. The struggle over resources otherwise known as” National cake: in the Nigeria society has taken a debilitating approach permitting all forms of corruptions. The idea that the “national cake” is meant to be shared rather than baked, by the various ethnic group that constitute Nigeria Federation provides a fertile group for the kleptomaniac elites to siphon the public fund9.<br/>          Corruption has been a major cause of injustice in society, where greedy and selfish people pervert the norms of society, that guider its well-being. Recent world attention on corruption is due to evidence abounding that corruption damaged the fabric of society in many ways. It makes governments and communities uneconomic, unstable and unsafe. Most crisis in Africa is caused as a result of corruption, Nigeria in Particular is embedded by corruption. Bribery which is the most popular form of corruption has rendered government uneconomic and ungovernable. Bribery encourages unfair advantages and renders competition, a features of democratic struggle invalid. By receiving bribes. People in authority abuse trust. In some countries in Africa, bribery is so rampant that it has gain social acceptance as a way of doing business. In other countries like Nigeria bribery has become endemic and a (necessary) way of life, for public officials as a way of earning additional incomes. This has led to extortion of bribes from the public and people need to pay these extortion bribes to pursue business or personal well-being10. <br/>By far the most destructive form of corruption in Africa is perpetrated by the rich who seek excessive riches and adopt extravagant lifestyle to the extent that it significantly affects the well-being of society.  It  is  this  type of  corruption  that African leaders have  been  identified  with  and  which has worsened their human crisis <br/>situation;. By making the leaders self-centered, greedy and insensitive to the needs of their people, who daily grapple with poverty, disease, violent, starvation, war and death. <br/>CONCLUSION<br/>In conclusion, transparency international that was founded in Berlin in 1993, has been able to tackle corruption through its various network in the national and international arena, it has been able to bring people together in a powerful worldwide coalition to end the devastating impact of corruption on man, women children around the world free pf corruption.<br/>Corruption breeds poverty, sickness low life and unequal distribution of income and wealth. This face produced by corruption wish was formerly the face of the third world and much more the portrait of Africa can now be seen all over the world. Corruption is therefore a global phenomenon, yet the poor are mostly victims as their poverty is created by the greed of others. Corruption and poverty go hand-in-hand.<br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nTRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL AND THE CHALLENGES OF CORRUPT PRACTICES IN NIGERIA 1993 - 1998 (A CASE STUDY OF GENERAL SANI ABACHA)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL AND THE CHALLENGES OF CORRUPT PRACTICES IN NIGERIA 1993 - 1998 (A CASE STUDY OF GENERAL SANI ABACHA)", "id": 71}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>MEANING OF ORGANISATION CONFLICT<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>1.0       INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>1.4       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>1.5       RESEARCH QUESTION <br/>1.6       RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS <br/>1.7       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>1.8       LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>REFERENCES <br/> CHAPTER  TWO <br/>2.0       LITERATURE REVIEW <br/>2.1       MEANIG OF CONFLICT IN ORGANISATION <br/>2.         CAUSES AND SOURCES OF CONFLICTS <br/>2.3       TYPES OF CONFLICTS <br/>2.4       APPROACHES TOMANAGEMENT OF CONFLICT<br/> 2.5      MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FIRST BANK <br/>REFERENCES <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.1         RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY <br/>3.2         AREA OF THE STUDY<br/>3.3         POPULATION OF THE STUDY<br/>3.4         SAMPLE AND SAMPLING PROCEDURE TECHNIQUE<br/>3.5         INSTRUMENT FOR DATA COLLECTION <br/>3.6         VALIDATION OF THE INSTRUMENT <br/>3.7         RELIABILITY OF THE INSTRUMENT <br/>3.8         METHOD OF DATA COLLECTION <br/>3.9         METHOD OF DATA ANALYSIS <br/>3.10      PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF DATA <br/>3.11      SUMMARY OF RESULTS<br/>3.12      FINDINGS<br/>3.13      CONCLUSION<br/>3.14      IMPLICATIONS OF THE RESEARCH FINDINGS <br/>RECOMMENDATIONS<br/>SUGGESTION FOR FURTHER RESEARCH <br/>  CHAPTER ONE <br/>1.0       INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY                       <br/>Ours is an age of rapid change, unrest and conflicting ideologies. Society is unsettled and individuals are apprehensive as group, nations and organized groups within the nation struggle for power and control over material resources and man’s mind. It is in such a world setting of tension and clearage that we view the present day relationship between labour and management in Nigeria.<br/>In an organization, there are the owners of business who’s primary goal and or objective is to maximize profit at all cost while on the other hand, there are workers whose only weapon is this labour power with which they earn some reward usually monetarily. In other words, these two groups (the owners and workers) here their own are interest which might differ. Nevertheless they are bound to co-operate in other to maintain and sustain the system of going concern. However, where there is co-operation, there will be conflict can be described as a situation of disagreement between employees and employer e.t.c. it could also be seen as the total range of behaviour and express opposition and divergent orientation between owners and managers on the hand and workers and the organization on the other hand.<br/>Organization conflict is therefore a familiar characteristic of organization life. Its fundament cause is the self-interest of individuals in the organization, a self-interest which frequently manifests itself a self-in competing objectives, philosophies or method and in associated struggles of one or more level or department to dominate the other. The presence of conflict brings a change in an organization. If the change is in line with organization objective then the conflict is beneficial (functional) to the organization, but if on the other hand, the conflict create disunity among functionaries in the organization this deviation from the stated organization objective then such a conflict is dysfunctional.<br/>Conflict can be main tested inform of discount struggle, quarrel, opposition, disagreement, clash of interest and ever fighting. It can range from industrial strike to competition, to simple dislike among individuals in an organization. It many occur or sub-groups departments sub-system, authority relationship, individuals and even sub-organization in there guest to either incompatible goals in the face of the resources.<br/>The first Bank PLC as financial (service) organization is not an exception to the inherent problem posed by conflict. The inability of the management to be effectively by handle conflicts has led to a considerable wastage of human and material resources heading some times to a partial or non-fulfillment of the stated organization goals and objectives.<br/>Considering the vital position which first Bank (Nig.) Plc occupies in the nation as one of the three major financial institution teeholis and supports the economic. It therefore become important using first Bank Plc as a focal point since the financial performance or non-performance of the bank will directly have a great impact on the nation economy.<br/>The research work I undertaken so as to enable the organization to understand and appreciate this in her sent nature of conflict and how researching it will result to an improvement of the organizational efficiency.<br/> 1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The increased interest gap between the employer and employee is becoming to devastating in our present by organizations. A lot of firms are collapsing due to increasing pressure from owners or the workers.<br/>This project work in effect tends to address the following problems.<br/>1.         The problems arising from the inefficiency of the workers caused by the organizational inability to meet their needs.<br/> 2.         The problems associated with the increasing labour conflicts in our organization.<br/> 3.         The problems associated with inconsistent grievance  handling.<br/> 4.         The problems usually encountered in trying grievance and dispute procedure.             <br/> 1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>Since conflict is inevitable in work organization, a career – minded person must learn practically, uncomplicated ways of resolving with the people to enhance efficiency.<br/>In regard, this study aims at examining impact of trade union and industrial conflict with reference to:<br/>(a)          The causes of conflicts <br/>(b)          The mechanism that have been put in place for its resolution by the organization.<br/>(c)          Examining the attitude of management towards conflict resolution.<br/>(d)          To identify how efficiency can be increases in an organization though proper appreciation of causes and mechanisms for conflict resolution.<br/>(e)          It hopes to suggest to organization functionaries how to manage positive and negative conflicts in order to accomplish organizational goals and objectives.<br/> 1.4       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This research work is supposed to survey many business organizations in Nigeria but for some constitution, which makes it impossible to cover the entire population, a sample was therefore chosen.<br/>In doing this first bank and Nigeria Plc Enugu was used as the case study. In concluding the survey, questionnaires and interviews were used.<br/>A sample size that will reflect the population of the bank selected and the data collected was analyzed using the simple percentage and table.<br/>1.5       RESEARCH QUESTION <br/>The following are some of the research question used during this research work. <br/>(a)          Do you consider conflict as one of an organization life?<br/>(b)          How do you feel when there is a conflict in your working environment?<br/>(c)          How do you feel when conflict is not rather suppresses?<br/>(d)          How do you feel conflict is either resolved in favour or against you?<br/>(e)          How effective is the management mechanism no building conflicts?<br/>(f)           What do you think that are responsible for conflict in your organization?             <br/>(g)          How often does conflict arise in the organization?<br/>(h)          How often does management succeed in resolving rather than suppressing it?<br/>(i)            How can effective handling of conflict improve organizational goals and objectives?<br/>1.6       RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS<br/>(a)       Hi:        Conflict is considered as part of organizational life.<br/>            Ho:       Conflict is not considered as part of organizational life.<br/> (b)       Hi:        Conflict in any working environment, promotes organizational efficiency.<br/>            Ho:       Conflict in any working environment does not promotes organizational efficiency.<br/> (c)        Hi:        The management mechanism in building conflict is effective <br/>            Ho:       The management mechanism in building conflict is not Effective.<br/> (e)       Hi:        The industrial relations climate is depended on the grievance and conflict resolution procedure.<br/>            Ho:       The industrial relations climate is not depended on the <br/>grievance and conflict resolution procedure.<br/> 1.7         SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This research work is aimed at giving an insight into the conflict and grievance handling procedure as it operates in First Bank Nigeria Plc.<br/>It should also help the bank to isolate those factors that causes conflict in the organization or to reduce conflict in labour management.

This definition is in line with the explanation offered by a South American Jurist more than 30 years ago, according to him “Terrorism consists of acts that are in themselves may be classic-crimes, murder, arson, the use of explosives, but that differ from classic crimes in that they are excited with the deliberate intention of causing panic and terror within an arranged or organized society1. It is the use of violence and most especially the fear it causes among people for political objectives.2<br/>It was also defined by the Terrorism Research Center as “the systematic use of physical violence against non combatants but with an audience greater than the immediate victim in mind to create a general climate of fear in a large population in order to affect some kind of political and social changes”3.<br/>The United States Federal Bureau of investigation (FBI) defines terrorism as “the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimate or coerce a government, the population or any segment thereof in furtherance of political and social objectives”4. In basic terms, terrorism is an act of inflicting terror upon the people in the process of achieving personal or political objectives5.<br/>Although from the above definitions, it can be rightly concluded that there is no precise or widely accepted definition of the concept of terrorism, it is generally believed that terrorism is the use of covert violent actions in order to achieve certain objectives. It is a form of covert attack directed at targets that are outside a certain range of clearly military targets. Though the terrorist attack on the world trade centre in New York and the Pentagon in Washington DC constitute a prime case, most terrorist attack are aimed at domestic regimes or other targets within the terrorist own country7. <br/>Terrorism is not new on the world stage. Northern Ireland had been dealing with terrorists for more than forty years, Israel with Palestinian terrorists for much the same period and Spain with Basque terrorists.<br/>Although the use of terrorism as a political tool extends far back into history, recent decades have seen a rise in the practice for several reasons. One is the overwhelming advantage in weapons that governments usually have over dissident groups. Because many governments are armed with aircraft and other high tech weapons that are unavailable to opposition forces, it has often become nearly suicidal for armed dissidents to use conventional tactics. <br/>Second, terrorists’ targets are now more readily available than in the past: people are more concentrated in urban areas and even in large buildings; there are countless airline flights, and more and more people travel abroad. Third, the mass availability of instant visual news through television and satellite communications makes it easy for terrorists to gain an audience. This is important because terrorism is not usually directed at its victims as such; rather it is intended to frighten others. Fourth, technology has led to the creation of increasingly lethal weapons that terrorists can use to kill and injure large numbers of people. These technological “advances” include biological, chemical, nuclear, and radiological weapons7.<br/>Terrorists attacks are relatively regular event. In 2000 there were 423 international terrorist attacks – many of these carried out across national borders and there were many other incidents of domestic terrorism. However, through this time, Americans worried little about terrorism for example, in a survey conducted in 1999 that asked Americans to name two or three top foreign policy concerns, only 12 percent of the respondents mentioned terrorism as a worry.8<br/>This American’s sense of security was shattered by the September 11, 2001 terrorists attacks which included the destruction of the World trade Center, major damage to the pentagon, the crash of a hijacked airliner in Pennsylvania, and the deaths of over 3,000 people. <br/>Soon thereafter President George W. Bush responded by announcing a war on terrorism9. An American led coalition of forces intervened in Afghanistan, toppling the Taliban government that had supported Al Qaeda and attacking Al Qaeda forces in the country. Later President Bush charged that Iraq, Iran and North Korea constituted an “axis of evil” that, among other things were guilty of state terrorism. In March 2003, the United States, in alliance with Great Britain and other countries known as the coalition of the Willing attacked Iraq, arguing in part that Iraq’s support of terrorism made it an international threat and an outlaw nation.10<br/>Terrorist make use of various means in achieving their aims, irrespective of whether it is individual group or state sponsored terrors. Some of which are briefly stated as follows:<br/>Kidnapping: Seizure of one or more victims are then moved to a hideout. This method is regularly abducted by the Niger Delta Terrorists Movements.<br/>Barricade Hostage: Seizure of a facility with whatever hostages available, these is made cotangent on meeting terrorist demand.<br/>Bombing: Major bombing is the use of any type of explosives or device for terrorist purposes, including those delivered through mail when sufficient demand or casualties occurs, the terrorists group claims responsibility. Example Commuter bombing in 2004 March that killed 191 people and wounded 1,8000. and July 7: London bombings – Bombs explode on one double-decker bus and three London Underground trains, killing 56 people and injuring over 700, occurring on the first day of the 31st G8 Conference. The attacks are the first suicide bombings in Western Europe.<br/>Hijacking: An attempt to seize an airplane, ship or other vehicle with whatever hostage maybe in it, to force some actions or movement to another country upon an agreement by authorities involved to terrorists demand.<br/>Armed attack: An attempt to seize or damage facility with no intent to hold for negotiating purposes.<br/>Assassination: An attempt whether successful or not to kill a pre selected victim usually with small arms or letter bombs, are executed form this small category, in many cases, there is a specific intended victim.<br/>Sabotage: this is willful destruction of properties by any means including bombing.<br/>Exotic Pollution: The use of exotic substances such as atomic, chemical or biological to contaminate materials of the targeted state. For example, the introduction of mercury into orange shipped form Israel.<br/>Threat for hoax: The stated intent by a terrorist group to carry out an attack or a false alert of authorities about the coming of terrorists attack by a named group.<br/>Most of these means terrorists adopt in carrying out their activities are becoming obsolete because of the fact that most governments that are more effective in combating terrorist elements.<br/>Few governments are as inclined as they were some years ago to release captured terrorists simply to avoid further terrorists attacks. Most government have adopted non concessions, non negotiations politics in dealing with hostage cases or situation.11<br/>Physical security around likely target has increased for example, it has become more difficult now, although it is still possible to smuggle weapons abroad through airlines. Embassies are becoming virtual fortress (especially after the terrorists attack on the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998).<br/>Diplomatic and top executives often travel in armored limousines with armed body guards (for example, the coming of former United States President Bill Clinton into Nigeria and Ghana with armored limousines and several CIA and FBI agents). But despite these undeniable achievements, the total volume of terrorist’s activities in the world has increased. At the same time terrorism has become bloodier and the terrorist seem to be less reluctant to inflict casualties. The latest fear exercise after the September 11th incident is the fear of terrorist making use of instruments of mass destruction in achieving their aims12.<br/>One aspects of the problem of definition of the term terrorism is the difficulty in distinguishing between terrorism and a freedom fighter for example, the man who attacks a plane and proceeds to kill some or all the passengers. <br/>The man who wrap bomb around his waist and drives into a shopping mall causing maximum damages of government may well be a freedom fighter to his kith and kin.<br/><br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nTERRORISM AND ITS IMPLICATION ON GLOBAL SECURITY IN THE 21ST CENTURY (THE MIDDLE EAST EXPERIENCE 1990-2007)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " TERRORISM AND ITS IMPLICATION ON GLOBAL SECURITY IN THE 21ST CENTURY (THE MIDDLE EAST EXPERIENCE 1990-2007)", "id": 73}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>UNITED NATIONS AND CONFLICT MANAGEMENT OF THE CIVIL WAR IN LIBERIA<br/> TABLE OF CONTENT </b><br/>Chapter One <br/>Background to the Outbreak of Civil War in Liberia <br/> Chapter Two <br/>The Limitation of ECOWAS and OAU Instrument of Conflict Resolution <br/> Chapter Three <br/>The United Nations Intervention in the Liberian Conflict <br/> Chapter Four<br/>The United Nations Agenda In Resolving The Liberian Conflict<br/>Chapter Five<br/>Conclusion<br/> Bibliography<br/>  CHAPTER ONE<br/> BACKGROUND TO THE OUTBREAK OF <br/>CIVIL WAR IN LIBERIA<br/>Liberia became independent on duly 26, 1847 as a small republic of immigrant Americans on the coast traditionally called the “Grain Coast”.  Thus it is considered the oldest African independent State except Ethiopia. Liberia is the only state in Sub-Sahara Africa that was never subject to colonial rule1. <br/>Before the immigration, which led to the creation of Liberia, the largely forested area now covered by the Liberia state was people by various Ethnic groups that form the overwhelming majority of the population today.  Monrovia was founded in 1822 by black America colonists sent by the American colonization society. Monrovia and other settlements founded by the American colonization society were never ruled by the U.S government.<br/>The American Liberia fought war for nearly a century with indigenous people, whom they called “Aborigines or Tribesmen”.  Among the America Liberians there was a power struggle between the “Mulatoes” or people of partly white birth, of whom president Roberts and Tubman was the leading members and those of pure African dissent2.<br/>In 1944 William U.S. Tubman (1895-1971) a lawyer and senator, became president.  He held office for 27 years.  President Tubman made considerable progress towards reducing the legal and effective discrimination between America Liberians and “Tribesmen”.  Political rights were extended to the latter.  But under Tubman the supreme power of America Liberia of their few Aristocratic families, and of the True Wig Party (TWP was left unchanged).  There were very few tribe ministers under him.<br/>Tubman died in Britain on July 23 1971 he was strongly anti Communist, though he allowed the opening of relations with the USSR in 1956.<br/>On the death of Tubman, Vice President William Tolbert automatically succeeded him.  He was re-elected in 1975 and 1979.  But announced that he would not stand again in 1983.  President Tolbert frequently showed concern for the ordinary people. Among the many official slogans which were a distinguishing features of his regime was “Mat to Mattresses”3.<br/>In 1979 Dr Tolbert showed the fairness and sense of justice for which he has come to be reputed by refusing to grant reprieve to two men of top America Liberian elite, son of true Wig Party (TWP) Chairman James Anderson and of former Vice President Yancy Sentenced to death.<br/>From 1977 the close relations between Liberia and Sierra Leone were strengthened by the Mano River Union, under which major projects were agreed on to develop closer link.  In 1975 Joined the new Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS).  A Liberian Dr A Romeo Horton was managing Director of ECOWAS fund.<br/>Relations with other countries were little changed under President Tolbert close relations with the U.S.A were illustrated by the big reception given to president carter on his visit in May 1978.<br/>The 1970 was one such period of economic difficulty it was also a decade that witnessed the initiation of a national discussion of issues of social justice and equality and of the imperatives of democracy.  Inquiring opposition groups emerged to engage the government.  .  The leadership of President Tolbert (1971 – 80) was problematic oscillating between a disposition to change and the maintenance of the status quo.  A political vacuum was created.<br/>On April 12 1980, a military coup was staged under the leadership of Samuel Doe, and for the first time the indigenous groups were in power.  President Doe filled his ranks with people from his own ethnic group, the Krahns4.<br/>Given the unprecedented nature of the coup and the excesses of its violence, as well as the unwillingness of the conservative elements of the old order to accept change, there were many observers who concluded that the act was revolutionary and that a profound social transformation would be sent in train.  Others asserted that Liberia has experienced de-colonization from “black colonialism”.  The meaning of this admittedly historic event was that the way was now clear for the replacement of settler minority rule by indigenous majority rule.5<br/>But such a hopeful prospect was not to be, Liberia was too heavy with history to conform to what has proven to be simplistic assumption about it politics and society.  Following a period of initial uncertainty by an inexperience military government and it civilian political enablers (the movement for justice in Africa (MOJA) and people progressive party (PPP).<br/>The process of sorting out the imperative of a return to civilian rule was soon under way.  Largely in response to pressure from the U.S government which was bankrolling the military regime in keeping with America Cold War requirement, a new constitution was drafted, approved through referendum, and under it election was held on the 15th October 19856.  There is ample documentation that the elections were rigged and that the incumbent military leader, Doe, who was declared the winner of the presidency actually stole the election.<br/>With the elections fraud endorsed by the American administration on the protest that such was the way of Africa politics.7.<br/>Deep disappointment set in.  General Quinwonkpa attempted his coup and its failure cost him his life, Brutal and massive repression ensued Liberia of Wimba Origin bore the brunt of Does brutality because of the slaine General Quinwonkpa’s country of origin8.  <br/>On December 24 1989 a small group of rebels attacked the border town of Butuo in Nimba County as a first step towards the overthrow of the Doe government.  The rebels were the National patriotic front of Liberia (NPFL) headed by Charles Taylor.<br/>In February, a split led by Prince Y Johnson a military veteran and a number of the Gio tribe developed with the NPFL. Declaring that he did not want power.  Johnson formed independent National patriotic front of Liberia and accused Taylor of being a socialist backed by Libya.<br/>All move to peace talks achieve nothing.  The NPFL vowed there would be no cease fire nor ECOWAS peace keeping in Liberia until Doe resigns9.<br/>Dr Amos Sawger former professor of the University of Liberia was elected Interim president.  Taylor (along with other Liberian forces) refused to work with the interim government and continued fighting. Johnson forces captured and killed Doe on September 9, 1990, while paying visit to general Quinoo at Monrovia freepot.<br/>The initial insurgency developed shortly there after into large – scale gang warfare, where groups fought to control the rich mineral resources of the country.  Such as timber, diamonds, gold and Iron ore.  The warlords used those resources to enrich themselves and the continue access to the resources also enable them to continue waging war.  There were eight main factors involved in the civil war, which came to involve intra fractional fighting and splits with several warring factions, all this added to the complexity of this conflicts10.  However efforts were made to resolve the conflict, and no fewer than fourteen peace agreements were signed in the period 1990 and onwards.  The Abuja 11 peace agreement was the fourteen and was to settle the conflict.<br/>Election followed in 1997 and the former warlord Charles Taylor won over 75 percent of the vote and was elected President of Liberia.<br/>However, the period preceding the election was fraught with uncertainty and there have been reports that people were threatened with reprisals if they did not vote for Taylor.  In addition Taylor was in control of the only media station in the country, which made it difficult for the political opposition to make it voice heard.  He was also in a strong army, which gave the capacity to continue war if it were to lose.  One explanation put forward for the massive support given to Taylor in election is that the people of Liberia were war weary after seven years of civil war and gently seeking peace.  It is perhaps telling that Taylor in his election campaign successfully used the slogans “He kill my Ma, he killed my Pa, but I will vote for him11.  While the elections were reported to have been free and fair according to international observers, voices have been raised claiming that the election process was flawed, and in the post civil war period there have been continue allegation of Taylor striking to his practices of warlordism.<br/>As mentioned above although the civil war ended and Taylor came to power, Liberia continued to experience armed conflict.  Taylor’s AFL are engaged in fighting with the rebel group LURD.  <br/>Ever since dissident of the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) launched an attack, to topple the government of Liberia, the whole region was again put on edge.  The rebels sprung their invasion from neighbour Guinea, occupying towns and villages in the boarder country of Lofa and giving government forces troops a blood nose. <br/>Government of rebel – turned – president Charles Taylor has been faced with growing casualties.  The embattled president called on all able bodied Liberians to take up arms and defend the state against it enemies.  The call was partly headed by Taylor’s loyalist.<br/>The leader of LURD has been identified as Mohammed Siaboso Jumandy, a Liberian business man whose father is Mandingo and mother Khran, both ethnic groups which are fiercely opposed to Taylor’s regime.  LURD members say Jumandy is the movement chairman12.<br/>Taylor has ruled Liberia with an Iron fist.  His special security services and anti-terrorist unit have terrorized actual and perceived opponents, and many of these cases have been documented by human rights watch and amnesty international. Political opponents have either been killed or forced into exile.<br/>But the trouble for Taylor was far Fran over.  Apart from the internal conflict that threatens his administration, the Liberian leader was under international to stop his backing of the RUF13.  RUF is a rebel force in Liberia, which traded diamond for weapons and manpower, keep the war going in Sierra Leone.<br/>And also there was called for the imposition of travel ban on members of Taylor’s government as well as the freezing of overseas accounts.14<br/>On August 11, 2003 under intense U.S and international pressure President Taylor resigned office and departed in exile in Nigeria.  On October 11, 2005 presidential and legislative elections and subsequent November 8, 2005 election were held Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.15<br/> <br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nUNITED NATIONS AND CONFLICT MANAGEMENT OF THE CIVIL WAR IN LIBERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " UNITED NATIONS AND CONFLICT MANAGEMENT OF THE CIVIL WAR IN LIBERIA", "id": 74}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN AFRICA: THE ROLE OF THE CIVIL SOCIETY<br/> TABLE OF CONTENTS</b>                                                        <br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>The Concept of Conflict and Conflict Management<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>The Phenomenon of Conflict in Africa   <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>Civil Society and Conflicts Management<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>Conclusion                          <br/>Bibliography                                   <br/>  CHAPTER ONE <br/>THE CONCEPT OF CONFLICT AND <br/>CONFLICT MANAGEMENT<br/>Conflict is the incompability of goals and values between two or more parties in a relationship, combined with the attempt to control each other and antagonistic feelings towards each other. It is a state of discord caused by the actual or perceived opposition of needs, values and interests.1 It exist whenever incompatible activities occur. An activity that is incompatible with another is one that prevents, blocks or interferes with the occurrence or effectiveness of the second activity. <br/>The incompabitlity or differences may exist in reality or may only be perceived by the parties involved. Nonetheless, the opposing actions and the hostile emotions are very real hallmark between people in all kind of human relationship and in al social settings. As a result of the wide range of potential differences between people, the absence of conflict usually signals the absence of meaningful interaction2. A conflict can be as small as a perceived disagreement or as large as war. It can originate in the person, between two or more people or between two or more groups. Conflict by itself is neither good nor bad but the manner in which conflict is handled determines whether it is constructive or destructive. <br/>A conflict is different from competition and cooperation because in competitive situations, the two or more individuals or parties have mutually inconsistent goals as either party tries to reach its goals, it undermine the attempt of the others to reach theirs. Therefore, competitive situations will by their nature cause conflict. Conflict can also occur in cooperative situation, in which two or more individuals or parties have consistent goals because the manner in which one party tries to reach its goal may undermine the other individual or party.3 <br/>A clash of interests, values, action or directions often sparks a conflict and conflict is also seen as the existence of the clash. The world ‘conflict’ is applicable from the instant the clash occurs. Even when it is described as a potential conflict, it is implying that there is already conflict of direction even though a clash has not occurred. As a result, conflict can occur whenever there is interaction. Leo Otoide describe this situation in the international system thus: <br/>When states interact there is competition for power and prestige and in the process, the international system elicits a picture of perpetual conflict, of survival of the fittest, where the desire for power and influence determines the attitudes of states and the course of events.4<br/>Conflict occurs in different levels. The first is interpersonal conflict. Interpersonal conflict is when two people have incompatible needs; goals, or approaches in their relationship.5 Communication breakdown is often an important source of interpersonal conflict and learning communication skills is valuable in preventing and resolving such difficulties. At the same time, very real differences occur between people that cannot be resolved by any amount of improved communication. Personality conflict refers to very strong differences in motives, values or styles in dealing with people that are not resolvable. For instance, if both parties in a relationship have a high need for power and both want to be dominant in the relationship, there is no way for both to be satisfied, and a power struggle ensures common tactics used in interpersonal power struggles includes the exaggerated used of reward and punishments, deception and evasion, threats and emotional blackmail and flattery or integration. Unresolved power conflict usually recycles and escalates to the point of relationship breakdown and termination.6<br/>The next level of conflict is intergroup conflict. It occurs between collections of people such as ethnic or racial groups. It can also be a conflict between departments or levels of decision making in the same organizations. Another common source of inter-group conflict is the competition for scarce resources between groups in a nation or between union and management staff of the same organization.7 One characteristics of intergroup conflict is that group members tend to develop stereotypes beliefs of the opposing group. They also tends to blame them for their problems and lastly, tends to practice discrimination against them.8 These classic symptom of intergroup conflict is especially tenced and prone to escalation and intractability when group identities are threatened.9<br/>Another level of conflict is multi-party conflict. It occurs in society when different interest groups and organizations have varying priorities over resource management and control as well as policy development. These complex conflict typically involve a combination of economic, value and power sources. This complexity is often beyond the reach of traditional authoritative or adversarial procedures, and more collaborative approaches to building consensus are required for solution.10 <br/>The last level of conflict is supranational conflicts. These are conflicts that involves states or in which one of the parties is a state. There are three common types of supranational conflicts, they include conflict involving maritime boundaries, dispute involving land and investor-state conflict also known as investment treaty dispute. <br/>In resolving supranational conflict, it is important to bear in mind that unlike other conflicts, it is likely to arise out of a treaty. For example a maritime delimitation disputes may be govern by the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS III) or an investor-state dispute which is guided by the international settlement of the investment dispute convention. The court is also to apply international conventions, international customs and the general principles of laws recognized by the nations or parties in question.11 <br/>Regardless of the level of conflict, there are different approaches to deal with the incompabilities that exist between the parties. If conflicts are managed creatively, solutions that are mutually satisfactory to both parties are attainable. It may involve a new distribution of resources or forms of influence than before. Creative outcome are more probable when the parties are inter-dependent, that is each having some degree of independence or autonomy from which to influence one another, rather than one party being primarily dependent on the other.12 Given inter-dependence, three general strategies have been identified that one parties make take towards dealing with their conflict. These include win-lose, lose-lose, and win-win. <br/>The win-lose approach is a strategy that forced the other side to capitulate. Sometimes, this is done through socially acceptable mechanisms such as majority vote, the authority of the leader, or the determination of a judge. Sometimes, it involves secret strategies, threat, innuendo – whatever works is acceptable that is Mechanuallian principle in which the end justify the means. The value outcome is to have a victor who is superior and vanquished who withdraw in shame.13 <br/>The lose-lose strategy is exemplified by smoothing over conflict or by reaching the simplest of compromises. In neither case is the creative potential of productive resolution realized or explored. This is base on the notion that disagreement is inevitable and thus is the better to split the differences or smooth over difficulties in a painless a way as possible. Each party gets some of what it want. <br/>The win-win approach is a conscious and systematic attempt to maximize the goals of both parties  through collaborative problem solving. The conflict is seen as a problem to be solved rather that war to be won. This method focus on one problem from the perspective of both parties and the needs as well as constraints of both parities rather short term accommodations. Communication is open and direct rather than selective and calculating. Attitudes and behaviours are directed toward an increase of trust and acceptance rather than an escalation or suspicion and hostilities.14 <br/>There are two methods of conflict resolution – the authoritative and the alternative methods. <br/>The first approach under the authoritative methods of conflict resolution is the use of power. The stronger side promotes its interest by force regardless of interests of the other parties. There is another case of use of power in conflict resolution. In this case, some issues are won by one side while other issues are won by one other sides, both parties make no agreement but push through their interest forcefully regardless of interest of each other.15 <br/>Decision made by authority is another strategic under the authoritative methods of conflict resolution. In this system, an authority interferes in a conflict and makes a decision based on his judgement of what is the best solution for the conflicting parties.16 In many cases such solution also satisfy the interest of that authority. This is different from arbitrage. The role of the arbiter is to work as an independent third party, who hear both conflicting sides, finds legally correct solution based on valid legislation and then communicate such decisions to the disputants.17 Lastly under the authoritative methods of conflict resolution is the decision of a court. Under this, a judge or jury decide a solution to a conflict based on evidence supplied by attorneys representing both conflicting sides of the issue. The judge or jury then interpret the law and use it as a basis for their decision which both parities will be forced to respect, the jury is composed of either laymen or professional judges. <br/>First, under the alternative methods of conflict resolution is facilitation.18 In this process, a facilitator works as an impartial third party person who helps two conflicting parties direct their discussion in order to reach an agreement satisfactory to both side according to previously agreed rules. The Latin world facilatare means to ease. Therefore, the role of a facilitator is to provide both side with such methods and guidelines for discussion which will ease their communication. In mediation, the mediator is a third party and primarily a facilitator who seeks to established or restore communication between feuding parties. The mediator strives to bring the parties face to face to negotiate and this constitutes a vital objective of his endeavous, the mediator must have good influence, credibility and good standing with the parties. Above all, he must have good diplomatic skill.19<br/>Another method of conflict resolution is conciliation which is similar to mediation except for the legal distinction that the third party is a commission or an international body whose aid has been sought in finding a solution satisfactory to the disputants. <br/>Arbitration is a step further tan a fact finding mission since it involves the practical examination of the issues involved in a crisis and the decision is binding on the parties. Often a tribunal is set up to examine the issues and make recommendation to a superior body.20<br/>Adjudication or judicial settlement is a process of submitting to an international covert for decision. Unlike arbitration, the covert is subjected to no preliminary litigations upon its procedures, evidence to be considered or legal principles to be applied except those stated at the statute by which it was created.21<br/> <br/><br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nCONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN AFRICA: THE ROLE OF THE CIVIL SOCIETY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN AFRICA: THE ROLE OF THE CIVIL SOCIETY", "id": 75}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CONFLICT AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS<br/>A CASE STUDY OF THE BAKASSI PENINSULA<br/> TABLE OF CONTENTS </b>                                                                             <br/>   CHAPTER ONE <br/>Understanding Conflict and Conflict Resolution<br/> CHAPTER TWO<br/>The Genesis of the Nigerian – Cameroon Boundary Dispute<br/> CHAPTER THREE <br/>The ICJ Judgment                                                <br/> CHAPTER FOUR<br/>Conclusion                                          <br/> Bibliography                                            <br/>  CHAPTER ONE <br/>UNDERSTANDING CONFLICT AND <br/>CONFLICT RESOLUTION<br/>The focus of this work is on conflict and conflict resolution in international relations. It examines the Bakassi Peninsular disputes as a case study of supranational conflicts and conflict resolution in international system.  This chapter examines the concept of conflict, its various causes and what makes it a permanent feature of the human society and the international system. It defines supranational conflicts, its types and the various machineries that are in place in the international system for the resolution of international dispute. Lastly, the chapter identifies and explains the various methods of dispute resolution. <br/>Conflict is a state of discord caused by the actual or perceived opposition of needs, values and interests. It exist whenever incompatible activities occurs.1 An activity that is incompatible with another is one that prevents, blocks, or interferes with the occurrence or effectiveness of the second activity. Conflict has also be defined as “when two or more parties, with perceived incompatible goals seeks to undermine each other’s goal seeking capacity”.2 Conflict is different from competition and co-operation because in competitive situations, the two or more individuals or parties have mutually inconsistent goals, as either party tries to reach it goals it undermine the attempt of the others to reach others. Therefore, competitive situations will, by their nature, caused conflict.3 Conflict can also occur in cooperative situations, in which two or more individuals or parties have consistent goals because the manner in which one party tries to reach its goal may undermine the other individual or party. <br/>A clash of interest, values, actions or directions often spark a conflict and conflict is also seen as the existence of the clash.4 Psychologically, a conflict exists when the reduction of one motivating stimulus involves an increase in another. The word ‘conflict’ is applicable from the instant the clash occurs. Even when it is described as a potential conflict, it is implying that there is already a conflict of direction even though a clash has not occurred.5 As a result conflict can occur whenever there is interaction. Leo Otoide describes this situation in the international system thus: <br/>…when states interact there is competition for power and prestige and in the process, the international system elicits a picture of perpetual conflict, of survival of the fittest, where the desire for power and influence determines the attitudes of states and the course of events.<br/> Consequently, conflict can been seen as part of human society and the international system at large. <br/>Conflict is also the incompability of goals or values between two or more parties in a relationship, combined with the attempts to control each other and antagonistic feelings towards each other. The incompability or difference may exist in reality or may only be perceived by the parties involved. Nonetheless, the opposing actions and the hostile emotions are very real hallmarks of human conflict.7 Conflict occurs between people in all kind of human relationships and in all social settings. As a result of the wide range of potential differences between people, the absence of conflict usually signals the absence of meaningful interaction.8 A conflict can be as small as a perceived disagreement or as large as war. It can originate in the person, between two or more people, or between two or more groups. Conflict by itself it neither good nor bad but the manner in which conflict is handled determines whether it is constructive or destructive. <br/>There are many sources of conflict, the most common of these sources is the struggle for economic gains. This occurs in a situation where there are competing motive to attain scarce resources. Each party wants to get the most that it can and the behaviour and emotions of each party are directed towards maximizing its gain.9 The Nigerian-Cameroon boundary dispute where each party tries to gain the peninsular is an example of economic conflict. Another example is workers’ union and management conflict. Conflicts can also be caused by value when incompability in ways of life, ideologies – the preferences, principles and practices that people believe in. This was the case in the cold war which has a strong value component, wherein each side asserts the rightness and superiority of its way of life and its political economic system. <br/>Power conflict occurs when each party wishes to maintain or maximize the amount of influence that it exerts in the relationship and the social setting.10 It is impossible for one party to be stronger without the other being weaker in terms of influence over each other. Power conflict ensures which party usually end in a defeat. It can occur between individuals, between groups or nations, whenever one or both parties choose to take a power approach to the relationship. Power also enters into all conflict since the parties are attempting to control each other. Also, it must be noted that most conflicts are not of a pure type, but involve a mixture of sources. For example, union-management conflict often involves different ideologies or political values in addition to the economic competition at the background. The more sources that are involved, the more intense and intractable the conflict usually is. <br/>Miscommunication and misunderstanding can create conflict even when there are no basic incompabilities. In addition, parties may have different perceptions as to what the facts are in a situation and until they share information and clarify their perceptions, resolution is impossible. Self-conteredness, secretive perception, emotional, prejudices are all forces that lead one to perceived situations very differently from the other party. Lack of skill in communicating what we really in a clear and respective fashion often result in confusion, hurt and anger, all of which simply feed the conflict process by making it more complex.11<br/>Conflict have a definite tendency to escalate that is, to be come more intense and hostile and to develop more issues on what the parties say the conflict is about. Escalating conflicts becomes more difficult to manage. The process of escalation feed on fear and defensiveness. Threat leads to counter threat and the self-fulfilling prophecy comes into play: <br/>Each party believes in the evil intentions of the other and inevitability of disagreement, and therefore taken precautionary actions which signal mistrust and competitiveness. When the other party then responds with a counter action, this is perceived as justifying the initial precautionary measure, and a new spiral of action and counter-action begins through the norm of reciprocity, stronger attempts to control are met only with stronger resistance, but more contentious attempts to gain the upper hand.12  <br/> With each succeeding spiral of conflict, polarization grows and the parties becomes more adamant and intransigent in their approach to the situation. Even though the intensity of the conflict may moderate for the periods of time, the issues remain, and triggering events induces conflictual behaviour with negative consequences, and the conflicts make one more step up the escalation staircase.13 When party becomes locked in a conflict they are usually unable to get out by themselves, and the intervention of a third party to play the role of arbitrator, mediator or consultant may be required. <br/>Supranational conflicts are conflicts that involved states or in which one of the parties is a state. There are three common types of supranational disputes: disputes involving maritime boundaries, disputes involving land and investor-state dispute also known as investment treaty disputes.14 These disputes are different from commercial disputes in many ways. <br/>First, supranational disputes are likely to be death with by special tribunals that deal with international conflict resolution and settlement such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the Permanent Court of Arbitration (FCA), The International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) or the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).15 Pure Commercial dispute, on the other hand, are likely to be death with in national courts or by international commercial arbitral bodies such as the International Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSED) and the New York Convention on Commercial disputes. <br/>In resolving supranational conflicts, it is important to bear in mind that, unlike other conflicts, it is likely to arise out of a treaty. For example, a maritime delimitation disputes may be governed by the 1982 law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS III) or an investor-state dispute by the international settlement of investment dispute convention and the court is to apply international conventions, international customs and the general principles of laws recognized by the nations in question. <br/>Anthony Connerty summarized the special characteristics that make supranational dispute different from commercial dispute: <br/>…they are likely to be heard by one of the supranational dispute resolution bodies such as the ICJ: the issues may require to be decided in accordance with the provisions of a treaty; the principles of international law are likely to be applied, and, in the case of an ICSID award, the provision of the New York Convention are not relevant to enforcement.16 <br/> There are various methods of dispute resolution. The most common among them is negotiation. Negotiation consist of discussion between officially designated representatives designed to achieved the formal agreement of other governments in an issues that is either shared concern or in dispute between them. Negotiation has been divided into three distinct stages: pre-negotiation, formal negotiation and agreement.17<br/>Good offices is another method of conflict resolution it involves the assistance of a third party or state not a party to the dispute. The third party in adhering strictly to the limits of good offices, may offer only a channel of communications or facilities for the use of parties but may not offer any suggestions for terms of settlements.18 It promotes a settlements without getting involved in the issues at stake. <br/>Inquiring is another methods of conflict resolution. It is the process of fact-finding by a neutral team of investigators. Often the fact underlying a particular conflict are in dispute among the parties and a clarification by an impartial commission will facilitate settlement. <br/>In mediation, the mediator is a third party and primarily a facilitator who seeks to established or restore communication between feuding parties. The mediator strives to bring the parties face to face to negotiate and this constitutes a vital objective of his endeavous, the mediator must have good influence, credibility and good standing with the parties. Above all, he must have good diplomatic skill.19<br/>Another method of conflict resolution is conciliation which is similar to mediation except for the legal distinction that the third party is a commission or an international body whose aid has been sought in finding a solution satisfactory to the disputants. <br/>Arbitration is a step further tan a fact finding mission since it involves the practical examination of the issues involved in a crisis and the decision is binding on the parties. Often a tribunal is set up to examine the issues and make recommendation to a superior body.20<br/>Adjudication or judicial settlement is a process of submitting to an international covert for decision. Unlike arbitration, the covert is subjected to no preliminary litigations upon its procedures, evidence to be considered or legal principles to be applied except those stated at the statute by which it was created.21<br/>  <br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/>\n\nCONFLICT AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: A CASE STUDY OF THE BAKASSI PENINSULA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONFLICT AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: A CASE STUDY OF THE BAKASSI PENINSULA", "id": 76}]
