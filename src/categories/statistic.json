Some types would be multiple choice test, or a weekly spelling test. While it is commonly used interchangeable with assessment, or even evaluation,it can be distinguished by the fact that a test is one form of an assessment (Overton, 2012).In other words, testing consists of a set of uniform questions or tasks to which a student is to respond independently and the result of which can be treated in such a way as to provide a quantitative comparison of the performance in different students.  Omorogiuwa (2010) defines test as an item or set of items presented to an individual or set of individuals to which they are expected to respond under specific conditions, with the intent to determine the extent to which such traits are present or absent in the respondent(s).According to Anigbo (2006), test is any kind of device or procedure for measuring ability, achievement, interest and other traits. In essence, a test is supposed to measure student’s/examinees’ ability/performance or other traits irrespective of certain factors like gender, ethnicity, geographical locality, social status and others. More so testing is done to determine whether or not an objective or goal has been obtained. In other words, testing concerns specific achievement of a student in terms of a given objective. <br/>By Item Response Theory (IRT) standards, test items should not depend on the characteristics of the sample. By the use of Item Response Theory (IRT) framework, in the analysis of test items, psychometricians have found that some items in a test may have functions different from what the test is meant for. It means that such items have interactions with the characteristics of the sample (examinees/students) taking the test. This describes such items as having differential functions.Item response theory assumes there is a mathematical function that relates the probability of a correct response on an item to an examinee’s ability (Osteen, 2010).<br/>The practice of testing has become increasingly common and the reliance on information gained from test scores to make decision has made an indelible mark on our culture. The entire educational system in Nigeria today is highly concerned with the design and development of the tests, the procedures of testing, instruments for measuring data, and the methodology to understand and evaluate the results (Erguven, 2014). In theory of measurement in education and psychology there are two competing measurement frameworks, namely Classical Test Theory (CTT) and Item Response Theory (IRT). The techniques of the two frameworks are applied in assessment situations to improve test analysis and test refinement procedures. <br/>          Assessment of students learning is very important in education. The assessment of students’ cognitive abilities, academic skills and intellectual development involves certain techniques employed to sample students’ performance on a particular learning outcome targeted by the instructional objectives one of that techniques is test, the test is expected to sample students’ behaviors. Thus creating quality tests is very important in assessing the students’ performance; many indices have been developed in order to construct valid and reliable items during test development. These indices developed mostly rely on the two popular statistical frameworks Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory. The two frameworks are associated with the item development process in the field of educational and psychological test. These frameworks are widely been used in test development to ensure quality of measuring instruments and discuss in various literatures in the field of psychological and educational measurements on their suitability and effectiveness in test development process. <br/>In the theories, the models associated with each have been described and compared, and the ways in which test development generally proceeds within each frameworks have be demonstrated (Fan, 2008)<br/>Theoretically, IRT overcomes the major weakness of CTT, that is, the circular dependency of CTT’s item statistics (Fan, 2008).As a result, in theory, IRT models produce item statistics independent of examinee samples and person statistics independent of the particular set of items administered.. <br/>Statement of the Problem<br/>Despite the number of empirical studies conducted to directly or indirectly provide empirical evidences of the relationship between CTT and IRT, there are not enough studies that provide evidence theoretical superiority of IRT over CTT. This inability of the studies to provide a clear distinction between the two measurement frameworks as theoretically been established leaves much to be ask as relate to the suitability of the tools used in the studies.<br/>        A test is supposed to measure students/examinees ability/performance or other traits of interest irrespective of certain factors such as gender, ethnicity, geographical location, social status and others. In other words, a test item by IRT standards is supposed to be invariant in nature. This is not always the case for psychometricains have often found some test items to have interactions with the characteristics of the sample (examinee/students). This study sought to compare the item statistics of senior school certificates in Biology administered by the West African Examination Council (WAEC), using classical test theory and items response theory<br/>Research Questions<br/>Deriving from the stated problems, the following research questions have been formulated to guide the direction of this study:<br/>(1)How comparable are CTT and IRT based item parameters?<br/>(2)How invariant are CTT and IRT based item parameters across different item sets?<br/>(3)How invariant are CTT and IRT based item parameters across different participant group?(4) Is Item Response Theory (IRT) more superior to the Classical Test Theory (CTT) as an important framework for test construction?<br/>Hypotheses<br/>The following research hypotheses stated in the null form would be tested:<br/>1. There is no significant difference between CTT and IRT based item parameters.   <br/>2. There is no significant invariant between CTT and IRT based item parameters across different item sets. <br/>3. There is no significant invariant between CTT and IRT based item parameters across different participant group.<br/>4. There is no significant statistical comparability in Item Response Theory (IRT) and Classical Test Theory (CTT) selected items.<br/>Purpose of the Study<br/>            The main objective of the study is to compare the item statistics of senior school certificates in Biology. The specific objectives of the study are to:<br/>(1) ascertain the extent to which CTT and IRT based item parameters are comparable.   <br/>(2) investigate the degree to which CTT and IRT based item parameters across different item sets are invariant <br/> (3) determine the extent to which CTT and IRT based item parameters across different participant group are invariant<br/>(4) establish whether Item Response Theory (IRT) is more superior to the Classical Test Theory (CTT) as an important framework for test construction.<br/>Significance of the Study<br/>The results from this study will provide measurement specialists, test developers and the researchers with information regarding the suitability and comparability of the two frameworks from the practical point of view and provide basis for further research to improve measurement practice<br/>Scope and Delimitation of the Study<br/>This study describes the application of Classical Test Theory (CTT) and Item Response Theory (IRT) to compare the item statistics of senior school certificates in biology. The biology WAEC question for the year 2015 will be used. The choice of the sample period is dictated by the desire to take a short-term trend in item statistics of senior school certificates in biology comparison.<br/>In this research work, the area of study is Edo State, Nigeria. Edo State is within the South-South zone of Nigeria. It is made up of 18 local government areas. The study will be delimited to the students in Edo State<br/><br/>\n\nAN EMPIRICAL COMPARISON OF ITEM RESPONSE THEORY AND CLASSICAL TEST THEORY: CASE STUDY SELECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA IN EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN EMPIRICAL COMPARISON OF ITEM RESPONSE THEORY AND CLASSICAL TEST THEORY: CASE STUDY SELECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA IN EDO STATE", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EFFECT OF MALARIA ON MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE IN NIGERIA <br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    Background of the study<br/>Among the most severe public health problems worldwide is malaria. In many developing countries, especially those in the sub Saharan region, malaria is a leading cause of mortality.<br/>Malaria is a febrile illness characterized by fever and related symptoms. It is caused by plasmodia species of which four are important in human disease. As noted by Abatan (2014), each of the four species exhibit slightly different symptoms in the infected patients. Among these four species, is Plasmodium falciparum which is the deadliest and the main specie causing malaria in tropical Africa. Patients infected with plasmodium falciparum show the following signs of infection: Dizziness, fatigue, abdominal pain, muscle pain, enlargement of the spleen, back pain, joint aches, seizures, vomiting, fever, severe anemia, headache, etc (Abatan, Afolabi, 2015)<br/>Malaria parasites are mostly transmitted through the bite of female anopheles mosquitoes (Jiliana and Nawal, 2009). On other occasions, it could be transmitted by design or action. The term design or action refers to transmission of malaria from an infected party.<br/>The rate of malaria infection is higher in pregnant women because of their decreased immunity. Studies have shown that infection rates are highest in first and second parity women with lower rates in later pregnancies (Steketee 2001, Duffy 2005). Plasmodium falciparum, which was earlier said to be the main cause of malaria in tropical Africa, is generally accepted as a leading cause of anaemia in pregnant women (Guyatt, Snow, 2001). It is estimated that anaemia causes as many as 10,000 maternal deaths each year (Steketee, 2001).<br/>Adolescent girls are particularly vulnerable to malaria. In many sub-Saharan African settings, adolescents are often parasitaemic and anaemic when they first become pregnant. (Brabin, Brabin, 2005). Every minute in the world, 380 women become pregnant and 190 face an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy (Garg, 2006). <br/>Malaria is a global health challenge and remains a cause of mortality. In Nigeria, malaria is a major public health problem. It accounts for more cases and deaths than any other country in the world. According to Kelsey (2001), despite Nigeria’s deep involvement in the safe motherhood initiative which was launched in 1987, there is no strong evidence to demonstrate that much of the good ideas, good intentions and good work done over the years have yielded any positive results. This is due to the increase in the death rate of the women giving birth over the same period.<br/>The WHO Factsheet (2008) indicates that globally, among the indirect causes of maternal deaths are diseases that complicate pregnancy such as malaria, anaemia, sickle cell anaemia etc. Poverty was also indirectly pointed as one of the causes of maternal mortality as Omoruyi (2008) opined that poor access to and utilization of quality reproductive  health services contribute significantly to the high maternal mortality level in the country (Sabrina, 2012). Many pregnant women mostly in rural areas in Nigeria, do not receive the care they need either as a result of absence of services where they live or as a result of inability to afford the services because they are too expensive or reaching them is too costly. <br/>Formerly, when Millennium Development Goal was still considered, Mairiga (2008) opined that the world’s maternal mortality ratio i.e. the number of maternal deaths per 10,000 live births was declining too slowly to meet up with the Millennium Development Goal 5target. The aim of this target was to reduce the number of women who die in pregnancy and childbirth by three quarters by the year 2015. The figures released by WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and the World Bank show an annual decline of less than 1 per cent in the world. This does not meet up to the annual decline of 5.5 per cent in maternal mortality ratio between 1990 and 2015 which is required to achieve the millennium Development Goal 5 (Mojekwu, Ibekwe, 2012).<br/>By the year 2007, it was reported that more than one hundred and thirty four thousand women died from pregnancy complications (David 2016).<br/>It should however be noted that although attempt have been made in the past aimed at reducing maternal mortality in Nigeria, such attempts especially by the state and federal governments, have generally not proved very successful in achieving the desired results (Mojekwu, Ibekwe, 2012).<br/>So far, the relationship between malaria and maternal mortality is only an illusion. No known concrete evidence as to the impact of one against the other has been established functionally. Thus, this study is poised to examine this functional relationship between the two.<br/>1.2    Statement Of The Research Problem<br/>One of the serious problems in less developed countries is maternal mortality. In a bid to improve child and infant care in the past, mothers have been neglected. Chibuzo (2011) carried out a study on the socio-cultural factors influencing maternal mortality. The study is of the view that factors such as poverty and gender inequality contributed to the increase in the maternal mortality rate. <br/>Breman , Eagan and Keusch (2001) opined that malaria and poverty are intimately connected. Their study was on “The Economic Burden of Malaria”. The study showed that in the year 1995, countries with intensive malaria had income levels of only 33% that of countries without malaria. A Nobel laureate in medicine, Weller 1958 in Breman 2001, noted that it had been recognized that a malarious community is an impoverished community.<br/>In a study carried out by David (2016) on the Impact of Government Expenditure on Health on Infant mortality, he opined that an increase in government expenditure on health will reduce the infant mortality rate.<br/>In 1990, 19% of the maternal deaths were attributed to anemia. Anand (1995) noted that the total iron needed during pregnancy is about 1000mg and the daily requirements for iron, as well as folate, are 6 times greater for a woman in the last trimester of pregnancy than for a woman who is not pregnant. The study also pointed out that lack of iron directly affects the immune system. This actually culminates into inadequate feeding or nourishment that gives room to weak resistance to infection and hence anemia.<br/>Nazarene examined “The Effect of Illiteracy on the Prevalence of Malaria in Yekebe Liberia”. Results showed that both the literate and illiterate population had some knowledge on malaria, its effects, treatment, cure and possible eradication. While the literate population applied their knowledge to the prevention and treatment of the disease, the illiterate population did not.<br/>All these studies mentioned above, though similar are different from this study in that the main focus of this study is the relationship between malaria and maternal mortality rate. Anemia may be a cause of maternal mortality but malaria is a disease that can bring about anemia. Poverty, illiteracy and government expenditure can also been seen as indirect causes of maternal mortality. Thus, the following research questions are raised.  <br/>1.    What is the relationship between Malaria and Maternal Mortality Rate?<br/>2.    Is there a significant relationship between literacy rate and Maternal Mortality Rate?<br/>3.    What is the relationship between poverty rate and Maternal Mortality Rate?<br/>4.    What is the relationship between government health expenditure and Maternal Mortality Rate?<br/>1.3    Objectives Of The Study<br/>The broad objective of the study is to examine the impact of malaria cases on maternal mortality rate.<br/>The specific objectives are;<br/>1.    To determine the relationship between malaria cases and maternal mortality rate.<br/>2.    To verify the relationship between literacy rate and maternal mortality rate.<br/>3.    To examine the relationship between poverty rate and maternal mortality rate.<br/>4.    To determine the relationship between government health expenditure and maternal mortality rate.<br/>1.4    Research Hypothesis<br/>The following hypothesis will be tested in the course of this study.<br/>HYPOTHESIS I<br/>H0: There is no significant relationship between malaria cases and maternal mortality rate.<br/>HYPOTHESIS II<br/>H0: There is no significant relationship between literacy rate and maternal mortality rate.<br/>HYPOTHESIS III<br/>H0: There is no significant relationship between poverty rate and maternal mortality rate.<br/>HYPOTHESIS IV<br/>HO: There is no significant relationship between government health expenditure and maternal mortality rate.<br/>1.5    Scope of the Study<br/>This study is undertaken to examine the effect of malaria on maternal mortality rate. Relevant data shall be sourced from 1980 to 2014. This period is chosen because it marks the period when several regimes of governmentinitiated and implemented a number of health policies towards reducing malaria and maternal mortality. It is expedient to examine how much these effects have yielded.<br/>1.6Significance of the Study<br/>It is expected that this study would unite with existing literature on the issues surrounding the relationship between malaria and maternal mortality. This study would also enhance the examination of the effect of literacy rate, poverty rate and government health expenditure on maternal mortality rate and thus improving the empirical evidence from Nigeria.<br/>Due to the empirical nature of the study, the outcome of the study would help policy makers and bodies in charge of regulations. It will also help policy simulation with respect to the variables assessed in the study.<br/>The result of the study would be of importance to health institutions in examining the impact of malaria on maternal mortality rate.<br/>Finally, this study will add to the available literature on the areas of study while also serving as a platform for researchers who may want to further this study.<br/>1.7Limitation of the Study<br/>This study makes use of time series data.

In adequately studying economic growth and development, a lot of predictors or determinants must be studied as well to have a comprehensive grip on the socio economic development of the nation. Two cardinal factors that may influence the socio economic development of any nation, Nigeria inclusive are the birth and death rates. The performance of the economy of any nation to a very large extent hinges on these two factors. Increased or decreased birth or death rates have its implications on the socio economic development of a country. Countries that want to be wealthy must not joke or toil with the study of birth and death rates in relationship to their economy.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>BIRTH RATE</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The birth rate; in Nigeria was last measured at 41.24 in 2013, according to the World Bank. Crude birth rate indicates the number of live births occurring during the year, per 1,000 populations estimated at midyear or quarterly. Subtracting the death rate from the birth rate provides the rate of natural increase, which is equal to the rate of population change in the absence of migration.</p> <p>The birth rate (technically, births/population rate) is the total number of live births per 1,000 of a population in a year. The rate of births in a population is calculated in several ways: live births from a universal registration system for births, deaths, and marriages; population counts from a census, and estimation through specialized demographic techniques. The birth rate (along with mortality and migration rate) is used to calculate population and economic growth.In 2012 the average global birth rate was 19.15 births per 1,000 total populations, compared to 20.09 per 1,000 total populations in 2007.</p> <p>The raw birth rate is 4.3 births/second for the world (2014 EST.).</p> <p><b>DEATH RATE</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Death rate can be said to be the ratio of total deaths to total population in a specified community or area over a specified period of time. The death rate is often expressed as the number of deaths per 1,000 of the population per year. </p> <p>It can also be said to be a measure of the number of deaths (in general, or due to a specific cause) in a particular population, scaled to the size of that population, per unit of time. Mortality rate is typically expressed in units of deaths per 1,000 individuals per year; thus, a mortality rate of 9.5 (out of 1,000) in a population of 1,000 would mean 9.5 deaths per year in that entire population, or 0.95% out of the total. It is distinct from the so-called \"morbidity rate\" (a vague term sometimes used to refer to either the prevalence or incidence of a disease), and also from the incidence rate (the number of newly appearing cases of the disease per unit of time).</p> <p>Ordinarily speaking, we can say that birth rate can be a number that shows how many people died in a particular place or during a particular time or the number of deaths from a specific cause in a particular area during a particular time period.</p> <p><b>1.2.    </b><b>Statement of the general problem</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The performance inconsistency of the economy of Nigeria has led us to this research.

From the available statistical data the evidence have been showing alarming rate of sexually transmitted diseases every day as mankind gets more civilized.  The sexually transmitted diseases can be categorized into three: the first category are referred to as the first category are referred to as the first generation, these are gonorrhea, syphilis, and chancroid.  The second generation includes hympho granuloma venereum and granuloma ingunale.  The third generation which is Aids  (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). These sexually transmitted disease have become a major public health problem to most countries of the world, including Nigeria on the account of their frequency, their impact on maternal and infant health and their special consequences as well as their economic cost in terms of health expenditure and cost of productivity.  It has a serious effect on pregnancy, and new borns are seriously affected which may lead to miscarriage, failure of development of new baby, blindness congenital defects etc.   The implication in woman such as pekvic inflammatory disease ectopic pregnancy, infertility and chronic ill health are caused by sexual transmitted diseases where the incidence of undiagnosed or poor treated cases is very high.  </p> <p>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            The disease, sexually transmitted disease (STDS) is an old strong disease that was discovered before the amalgamation of Nigeria in the year 1914 by a great medical scientist known as lordchester field, in the year 1985.  this disease has killed very many paple, yet, as at that time people doesn’t believe it, not until a good number of research work was carried out in the laboratory and evidence showed that it is a communicable disease that can be contracted from one person to another through  predominantly sexual contact; such as gonorrhea, syphilis enters the body veins through blood and weakens or makes the white blood cell known as lymphocyte inactive to attack the disease of the sexual transmitted disease and this deadly disease will dry the victim to the extent that you will be able to count the bones and extent that you will be able to count the bones and ribs of the patient.  But some people are still doubting the existence of the deadly disease STDS while statistical data table shows that 7,548 people was a victim within the year of 1985 to 1990.  But the recent data collected shows that 17,277 people were infected as it was recorded at the Federal Medical Centre Umuahia.  In addition, the above collected data will help the masses to reduce the rate of sexual act and sexual promiscuity.  The federal ministry of health warns that total abstinence and mutual fidelity remains the best protective measure for or against sexually  transmitted disease (STDS)  such as  gonorrhea, syphilis etc.  That is why the federal government supported the introduction of sex education and the use of condom as a program in most of our media, such as newspaper, radio, television etc.  In order to educate the poor masses on the subject matter and how to avoid contacting the deadly disease (STDS).</p> <p>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>            The rapid spreading of these deadly diseases (STDS) does not mean that both the internal and external bodies’ even corporate organizations are not working to remedy the issue.  But we should not unemphasize the problem facing the efforts. Some of this problems includes inadequate central surveillance system from which all of us will be getting the information that we carry and reply in our program, because what we get now in Nigeria is information that is fragment not reconcilable.  Even when there is seeming different, there are not other third sources of reference to cross check.  Here the problem of finance contributed to the collapse of the efforts been made.  Take for instance, the latest inhibitors introduced by Hoffmann – LaRoche of the Switzerland Eortovase and Viracept cannot be obtained by poor countries like Nigeria.</p> <p>            We know that it will sound unbelievable even at the moment to some people mainly the youths of today that kept adamant on the warnings and dangers of being a prostitute, a homosexual, a Hetero Sexual and equally having unprotected sexual intercourse.  All that the World Health Organization (WHO) had warned that partners should be truthful to themselves and take preventive measures.</p> <p>1.3       AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</p> <p>i.                    To know how far people have known about existence of the sexually transmitted disease.</p> <p>ii.                  To know whether the rate at which male are infected is the same at which the females are infected.</p> <p>iii.                To recommend preventive measures on how to avoid contacting the sexually transmitted diseases and give appropriate treatment to avoid rapid spread of the deadly disease.</p> <p>iv.                To specify the age group that is mostly affected.</p> <p>v.                  Finally, the objective of this study is in picking the types of sexually transmitted diseases under study one by one and uses statistical methods predicting what their incidence rate will be in the year 2005 and 2006.</p> <p>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            The study has revealed that the awareness of the existence of sexual transmitted disease.  Through this study, their causes, sources and mode of transmission have been have been highlighted.  Having known all these a greater result can be achieved by embarking on the program against sexually transmitted disease, such as making use of condom as one of the preventive measures and total abstinence as another measure.  Another important significance is that, the health standard of the people is improved, while the death effect and other consequences of sexually transmitted diseases are minimized by profiling good medical attention and the use of skilled practitioners.</p> <p>            Finally, by achieving all these goals, we can have a good social economic planning for the present and future generation.</p> <p>1.5       SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS</p> <p>            The Federal Medical Centre Umuahia (FMC) is my scope of study.  It has ten wards (10) two medical ward on each for male and female, two surgical wards one each for male and female, two surgical wards one each for male and female, maternity wards with eighty (80) beds, one ward with forty (40) beds for booked patients while the other is for unbooked patients. Other are the pediatrics ward with twenty (20) beds and a gynecological ward with fourty (40) beds.  But my area of concentration is based on the steadily increase of the sexually transmitted diseases (STDS).  And we are taking a more look at the four varieties of sexually transmitted diseases (STDS).  And we are taking a more look at the four varieties of sexually transmitted disease (STDS) such as gonorrhea, syphilis, arthritis and Aids.  This study is faced with a lot of limitations and some problems encountered din the project research must not be overlooked.  Some problems as: problem of finance, a lot of expense was made on the process of collecting the data.  Time factor is another problem that delays the collection of data.</p> <p>            In addition, the duplication of the data and the production of this project work also included.  On this note I was to study records from the year 1995 – 2002.  This further more confined to the statistical analysis only, which has to do with the incidence rate of the sexually transmitted disease under study as arranged or grouped into sex, age groups and years.  There will also be some forecast or production of the type of sexually transmitted disease under study in a specifically year to come.</p> <p>1.6       FOR THE HYPOTHESIS</p> <p>i.                    The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between age group.  This means that the incident rate of age group is the same.  The alternative hypothesis is that the incident rate of age group differ which reconcile that the incident rate is not he same.</p> <p>ii.                  The null hypothesis is also used for the incident rate sex that means that there is no difference between incident rate of sex then.  The alternative hypothesis is that the incident rate of sex is differ which states that the incident rate of sex is not the same.</p> <p>1.7       ASSUMPTIONS</p> <p>i.                    That is an existence of sexually transmitted

<p>Recommendation</p> <p>References</p> CHAPTER ONE <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>            National income is the sum of the money value of all the commodities and services produced in a country within a particular period of time usually one year.</p> <p>            The question of how an economy grows could come to mind at this juncture.  It the amount of goods and services produced by an economy increases.  If it does not increase yearly, it is not growing, even if it is growing, the rate of growth may not be uniform among years.  Therefore it may not be possible to determine the condition of the economy.</p> <p>            In any case, an economy needs an indicator for measuring economy growth, this indicator is the monetary summation at all the commodities and service produced in an economy within a particular period of time usually a year.</p> <p>            To get national income of a country like Nigeria for instance, we take the list of the goods and services produced in the country during the year, assign values to them and add up.  If we can do this year after year, we shall be able to make comparison of activities of Nigeria year after year.  Then we can decisively determine whether the economy of Nigeria is growing, declining or stagnant.  It is growing if the National income increases year after year, declining, if the National income is decreasing and stagnant it there is no difference in the National Income for years.</p> <p>            In measuring National Income, an indicator called Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is used at current price.  It is therefore quite important here to point out the role that prices could play in the measurement of National Income.  Prices of goods and services changes from time to time.  These changes can affect any attempted estimates.  Considerably.  Therefore to get an idea of the real physical change in National Income from year to year, effect of price changes must be removed.</p> <p>            National Income should be measured in real terms and allow for changes in price levels.  For instance whenever the economy experiences inflation, price rises while the quantities of goods and services may remain constant.  Let us say that 2000, the total units of the go0ods and services realized in Nigeria amounted to 50,000 units and also 50,000 units in 2001.  Let us further assume that the average per unit in 2000 was N10.00 while the price in 2001 was N15,000.</p> <p>            Nigeria’s income with GDP as an indicator for 2000 was 50,000 units X N10.00 = N5000,000 Nigeria’s income with GDP as an indicator for 2001 was 50,000 units X N15.00 = N750,000.</p> <p>            If the two figures were presented to a layman as final products of overall estimates for 2000 and 2001, he would be tempted to say that the National income for 2001 was higher than that of 2000.  This is so monetarily but really the income for both year are equal.  The difference in value was due to rise in p rice in 2001 while the quantities of goods and services were the same in both years.</p> <p>            The same thing can be applicable when a country experience deflation or depression.  Therefore in measuring national income for different years using gross domestic product as an indicator effects of price changes must be given the normal due.  In so doing the changes in economy can be determined appropriately.</p> STATEMENT OF PROBLEM/MOTIVATION <p>            As a result of poor economic condition in Nigeria relevant information is of great interest to me for investigation if viable economic solution can be revealed.</p> <p>            Nigeria considered as one of the third world countries is been assessed by their income yearly.  It is a simple logic of our living that it country’s income is high with considerable population, the enjoyment of the citizens of that country would be high, while the enjoyment is low with low national income.  It is on this point that I find it very expedient to analyze the national income of Nigeria and make necessary recommendation for the improvement of the economy for the betterment of the citizenry.</p> AIMS AND OBJECTIVES <p>            In view of Nigeria’s economic predicament, the project is aimed at investigating the relationship existing between disposable income, savings and government final expenditure for the purpose of suggesting solutions to our economic problems.</p> <p>            After the regression analysis had been carried out, it will supply solution to the following questions:</p> <p>1.                  Is any linear relationship between the variables listed?</p> <p>2.                  How reliable is our regression coefficient?</p> <p>3.                  Can we predict the future value of dependent variable?</p> <p>4.                  How reliable will be our estimate?</p> SCOPE OF THE STUDY <p>            The study is centre on “National Income, Savings and Government Final Consumption Expenditure Covering the period of six years 1998 – 2003.</p> <p>            The raw data used are collected as primary data by federal office of statistics” publication and Federal Ministry of Finance Publication.  The data are collected as primary data by federal office of statistics and used as secondary data in this project which centered on national Accounts.  Some of these National Accounts Aggregates Include Gross Domestic Product (GDP) final consumption expenditure, exports and imports.</p> <p>            National Accounts data presents the record of economic transaction of the economic in a systematic manner and show the relationship between the various components of the economy.  Economic transaction cover all the activities of an entity (Household, government, firm, financial institution) that are of economic nature (production, consumption distribution, savings and foreign exchange transactions.  These economic transactions of all the entiti8tes and combined together ad presented inform of account.</p> <p>            Data collected for analysis in this study center on:-</p> <p>1.                  Appropriation of disposable income as dependent variable.</p> <p>2.                  Savings as one of the independent variable</p> <p>3.                  Government final consumption expenditure as another independent variable.</p> SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <p>            The study will help to know the status of Nigeria economy.  The knowledge of the status will help to make necessary recommendation in order to revitalize the poor economic condition of the country for the better future.</p> <p>            The study will also create avenue for future research.</p>  DEFINITION OF CONCEPTS <p>Gross Domestic Product (GDP):     This is the sum of the money value of all locally produced goods and services.  It does not include international transaction.  GDP does not make allowance for depreciation of capital.</p> <p>Gross National Product (GNP):      This is the total money value of current market prices of all final goods and services produced by the nationals during a specific period.  It includes net income from abroad in respect of the country’s nationals without any consideration for depreciation of capital.</p> National Domestic Product (NDP): This is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a period of time.  It exclude the value of the net earnings and incomes from abroad.  An allowance being made for depreciation of capital. <p>Net National Product (NNP):           This is the monetary value of all goods and services produced within the country during a specific period.  It includes net incomes and earning from abroad and provision being made for the replacement of depreciation of capital.</p> <p>Disposable Income (DPI):     This is the amount of money per year that private sector are free to spend when depreciation of capital, all taxes, all net profits made by firms but not paid out as divided are added to the disposable and transfer payment subtracted.  We arrive at gross national product.</p> <p>Net Economic Welfare (NEW):                   This examines those factors not considered when calculating the Gross National Product (GNP).  Such factors include social cost 9pollution) and leisure time the net economic welfare tend to remove the product (GNP).  A nation might have a very high GNP at a very great social cost as pollution, rising crime etc.</p> <p>Per Capita Income (PCI) This is the gross domestic product divided by the population of the country. Per capita income can be calculated once the population and gross domestic product are known. So that P.C.I = GDP</p> </div>\n\nREGRESSION ANALYSIS ON NATIONAL INCOME FROM 1998 – 2003<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\"

Group started operation in 1963 under the name “Turners Asbestos Cement Company Nigeria Limited: The company was incorporated in 1961 with registration number RC 2712.</p> <p>            The group came to Nigeria with the establishment of her first of four companies in Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria Limited.  The other three are Eternite Limited, Sapele, Giwarite Limited, Kano and Emenite Limited, Enugu.</p> <p>            Emenite Limited after being established have to following as shareholders.</p> <p>Turners &amp; Newall Ltd                         -           80%</p> <p>Government of Eastern Nigeria                      -           20%</p> <p>            As a result of the indigenization decree of 1973, the shareholders of the company changed as follows</p> <p>            Turners &amp; Newall Ltd                                     -           60%</p> <p>            Government of Eastern Nigeria                      -           40%</p> <p>With the name of the company changing to Turners Building Product (Emene) Limited.</p> <p>            Due to dwindling fortunes of the company, in March 24, 1988 Turners and Newall Ltd divested its interest in the company and transferred 51% of its shareholding to Eteroutremer Societe Anonyme of Belgium (now Etex Group S.A) and the balance of 49% went to the then Anambra and Imo State; now Anambra, Enugu, Imo, Abia and Ebonyi States.  As a result of the new shareholding arrangement, the company changed its name to Emenite Limited as its presently known.</p> <p>            Emenite Limited after being established in 1963 rolled out her first finished sheets in December that year.  The company has a total workforce as at its establishment of 67 staff, its second machine was installed in 1979 while the third was installed in 1983.  From a workforce of 67 to 225 staff, from one shift machine to three, from 14,000 tonnes of roofing and ceiling sheets to 50,000 tonnes per year.  The company has continued to grow tremendously.</p> <p>            The company has made considerable progress in terms of product development in the market.  It operates in the roofing and ceiling market, its range of products include: Bigsix &amp; standard ultimate corrugated sheets of different colours (Grey, Red &amp; Green), prestige concrete tile, Emcee flat sheet, duraceile decorative ceiling, Emlux decorative ceiling as well as Qualitile decorative ceiling and a new product called duratile.  These products are sold through a wide range of distribution network located in such a place that they will be close to project sites.  Emenite is 150 certified, 150 9002 in 1998, 180 9001 in 2002.</p> <p>            It is the company’s quality policy to provide high quality building products to the markets.  But much recently there have been complaints from building and construction companies over the quality durability of her products.  It is in view of this problem this research work is being undertaken.</p> <p>1.2       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            Consumers of goods and services rely on quality standard products displayed for consumers.  What is responsible for this trend?  Is statistical

total expenditure of an individual, government or an organization.</p> <p>            Having said this, government can spend money for projects like building of schools, construction of roads, establishments of electricity, etc and these erupt development in our country.  Parents also later for the need of their children and enrich them with huge sums of money as pocket money.  Some of the student’s need which propel them to spend could be enumerated thus: school fees, hotel fees, feeding, transport fares, drinks and educational materials, etc.</p> <p>            Taking you years backs, Nigeria had a good economy.  Government and parents spent much of their money without any pains.  Students and that time used money recklessly because there was a good economy and balanced with monetary value in the market.</p> <p>            From 1980 till now, we have been experiencing our increasing an unexpected inflation of goods</p> <p>1.3       DEFINITION OF TERMS AND CONCEPTS

From the available statistical data the evidence have been showing alarming rate of sexually transmitted diseases every day as mankind gets more civilized.  The sexually transmitted diseases can be categorized into three: the first category are referred to as the first category are referred to as the first generation, these are gonorrhea, syphilis, and chancroid.  The second generation includes hympho granuloma venereum and granuloma ingunale.  The third generation which is Aids  (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). These sexually transmitted disease have become a major public health problem to most countries of the world, including Nigeria on the account of their frequency, their impact on maternal and infant health and their special consequences as well as their economic cost in terms of health expenditure and cost of productivity.  It has a serious effect on pregnancy, and new borns are seriously affected which may lead to miscarriage, failure of development of new baby, blindness congenital defects etc.   The implication in woman such as pekvic inflammatory disease ectopic pregnancy, infertility and chronic ill health are caused by sexual transmitted diseases where the incidence of undiagnosed or poor treated cases is very high.  </p> <p>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            The disease, sexually transmitted disease (STDS) is an old strong disease that was discovered before the amalgamation of Nigeria in the year 1914 by a great medical scientist known as lordchester field, in the year 1985.  this disease has killed very many paple, yet, as at that time people doesn’t believe it, not until a good number of research work was carried out in the laboratory and evidence showed that it is a communicable disease that can be contracted from one person to another through  predominantly sexual contact; such as gonorrhea, syphilis enters the body veins through blood and weakens or makes the white blood cell known as lymphocyte inactive to attack the disease of the sexual transmitted disease and this deadly disease will dry the victim to the extent that you will be able to count the bones and extent that you will be able to count the bones and ribs of the patient.  But some people are still doubting the existence of the deadly disease STDS while statistical data table shows that 7,548 people was a victim within the year of 1985 to 1990.  But the recent data collected shows that 17,277 people were infected as it was recorded at the Federal Medical Centre Umuahia.  In addition, the above collected data will help the masses to reduce the rate of sexual act and sexual promiscuity.  The federal ministry of health warns that total abstinence and mutual fidelity remains the best protective measure for or against sexually  transmitted disease (STDS)  such as  gonorrhea, syphilis etc.  That is why the federal government supported the introduction of sex education and the use of condom as a program in most of our media, such as newspaper, radio, television etc.  In order to educate the poor masses on the subject matter and how to avoid contacting the deadly disease (STDS).</p> <p>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>            The rapid spreading of these deadly diseases (STDS) does not mean that both the internal and external bodies’ even corporate organizations are not working to remedy the issue.  But we should not unemphasize the problem facing the efforts. Some of this problems includes inadequate central surveillance system from which all of us will be getting the information that we carry and reply in our program, because what we get now in Nigeria is information that is fragment not reconcilable.  Even when there is seeming different, there are not other third sources of reference to cross check.  Here the problem of finance contributed to the collapse of the efforts been made.  Take for instance, the latest inhibitors introduced by Hoffmann – LaRoche of the Switzerland Eortovase and Viracept cannot be obtained by poor countries like Nigeria.</p> <p>            We know that it will sound unbelievable even at the moment to some people mainly the youths of today that kept adamant on the warnings and dangers of being a prostitute, a homosexual, a Hetero Sexual and equally having unprotected sexual intercourse.  All that the World Health Organization (WHO) had warned that partners should be truthful to themselves and take preventive measures.</p> <p>1.3       AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</p> <p>i.                    To know how far people have known about existence of the sexually transmitted disease.</p> <p>ii.                  To know whether the rate at which male are infected is the same at which the females are infected.</p> <p>iii.                To recommend preventive measures on how to avoid contacting the sexually transmitted diseases and give appropriate treatment to avoid rapid spread of the deadly disease.</p> <p>iv.                To specify the age group that is mostly affected.</p> <p>v.                  Finally, the objective of this study is in picking the types of sexually transmitted diseases under study one by one and uses statistical methods predicting what their incidence rate will be in the year 2005 and 2006.</p> <p>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            The study has revealed that the awareness of the existence of sexual transmitted disease.  Through this study, their causes, sources and mode of transmission have been have been highlighted.  Having known all these a greater result can be achieved by embarking on the program against sexually transmitted disease, such as making use of condom as one of the preventive measures and total abstinence as another measure.  Another important significance is that, the health standard of the people is improved, while the death effect and other consequences of sexually transmitted diseases are minimized by profiling good medical attention and the use of skilled practitioners.</p> <p>            Finally, by achieving all these goals, we can have a good social economic planning for the present and future generation.</p> <p>1.5       SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS</p> <p>            The Federal Medical Centre Umuahia (FMC) is my scope of study.  It has ten wards (10) two medical ward on each for male and female, two surgical wards one each for male and female, two surgical wards one each for male and female, maternity wards with eighty (80) beds, one ward with forty (40) beds for booked patients while the other is for unbooked patients. Other are the pediatrics ward with twenty (20) beds and a gynecological ward with fourty (40) beds.  But my area of concentration is based on the steadily increase of the sexually transmitted diseases (STDS).  And we are taking a more look at the four varieties of sexually transmitted diseases (STDS).  And we are taking a more look at the four varieties of sexually transmitted disease (STDS) such as gonorrhea, syphilis, arthritis and Aids.  This study is faced with a lot of limitations and some problems encountered din the project research must not be overlooked.  Some problems as: problem of finance, a lot of expense was made on the process of collecting the data.  Time factor is another problem that delays the collection of data.</p> <p>            In addition, the duplication of the data and the production of this project work also included.  On this note I was to study records from the year 1995 – 2002.  This further more confined to the statistical analysis only, which has to do with the incidence rate of the sexually transmitted disease under study as arranged or grouped into sex, age groups and years.  There will also be some forecast or production of the type of sexually transmitted disease under study in a specifically year to come.</p> <p>1.6       FOR THE HYPOTHESIS</p> <p>i.                    The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between age group.  This means that the incident rate of age group is the same.  The alternative hypothesis is that the incident rate of age group differ which reconcile that the incident rate is not he same.</p> <p>ii.                  The null hypothesis is also used for the incident rate sex that means that there is no difference between incident rate of sex then.  The alternative hypothesis is that the incident rate of sex is differ which states that the incident rate of sex is not the same.</p> <p>1.7       ASSUMPTIONS</p> <p>i.                    That is an existence of sexually transmitted disease (STDS) virus</p> <p>ii.                  Attempts on how to prevent or cure the sexually transmitted diseases (STDS) have been made.</p> <p>iii.                Maximum cooperation is needed

Owerri.<br/>The study used a primary data collected by means of mail questionnaire of 15 questions.<br/>A sample size of 206 students out of a population of 425 students determined by Yamani’s approach was used for this study which was selected by means of stratified random sampling.<br/>It was noticed from the data analysis that students strongly support Industrial Training and that the performance of HND I students depend on the Industrial Training, showing that the positive effects of the one-year Industrial Training on HND I students are greater than those of the negative effects.<br/>Conclusively, the research recommended some crucial matters that demand the attention of the government, the institution and the students. </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY</strong></em>.<br/>It is an indisputable fact that education is a no do without in the development of a nation’s economy. But a perfect and complete education is achieved when ones head, heart and hands are trained. Meanwhile among all these, the most important is the training of the hands because with that of the head and heart but without the one of hands, one cannot display. Secondly, it is what the nation needs to develop its economy to a state of self-reliance, independence on foreign expertise and be industrialized which is the heart cry of every nation.<br/>But what go on in the tertiary institutions are the training of ht head and heart. Thus the introductions of industrial training (I.T) which will help actualize the training of the hands and make the students competent enough in facing the tasks ahead.<br/>Moreover, industrial training (I.T) participation has become a necessary pre-condition for the award of diploma in the polytechnic set up.</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</em></strong><br/>Not until dissatisfaction and doubt is raised and solution needed, a problem is not said to be recognized.<br/>There has been this wrong motives and lack of interest recognized among students who are due for one-year industrial training, consequently upon the like and dislike they have for it. This is due to the positive and negative effects they have found this I.T to have on them.<br/>Therefore the emergence of this study- the effects of Industrial Training (I.T) on HND I students (a finding on whether the positive effects are greater than the negative effects or otherwise)</p> <p><strong><em>1</em></strong><em><strong>.3 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES </strong></em><br/>In the course of this study, I intend to achieve the following:<br/>1. Find out what the students feel about the one-year industrial training (I.T).<br/>2. Find out whether the positive effects of one-year industrial training are greater than those of its negative.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY.</em></strong><br/>This study will be beneficial to the students, industries, institution, government and society.<br/>If the study shows that the positive effects are greater than the negative effects, then the students will go for I.T with right motives thereby being useful to the industries, representing the institution well (even in future), fulfilling the desire of the government and meeting the needs of the poor masses (society).<br/>But if otherwise, then it should be looked into whether to scrap it and provide an alternative measure or not.</p> <p><strong><em>1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY.</em></strong><br/>For the effectiveness of this study, I have wished to carryout this research in one department in each of the schools of the institution – Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Owerri.<br/>That is, the population consists of:<br/> One department in School of Industrial and Applied Sciences.<br/> One department is School of Engineering Technology.<br/> One department in School of Environmental Technology<br/> One department in School of Business.<br/>The period considered in the study is 2007/2008 academic session.</p> <p><strong><em>1.6 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>Some weaknesses tried to hinder me form carrying out this study. But with more effort, I was able to do my best. <br/>The difficulties resulted from financial constraints, material limitation (i.e. unavailability of materials) and lack of time due to the shortness of the semester and other works on the table.</p>\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECTS OF INDUSTRIAL TRAINING (I.T) ON HND I STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECTS OF INDUSTRIAL TRAINING (I.T) ON HND I STUDENTS", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The success or failure and effectiveness or ineffectiveness of any banking or financial sector depends on extent of customer’s patronage and the financial resources available to form and procure the required service oriented facilities. In Nigeria, there are lots of problems associated with banking. The problems include in adequate financial capacity, that is weak capital base, lack of sound technical planning, bad implementation of formulated policies linking the banking operations, inadequate supervision and monitoring of economic changes and large scale financial embezzlement. Due to these problems, many financial firms are distressed and subsequently are closed up. The study therefore examined the cash deposits pattern of commercial banks for the past 10 years with fidelity bank Plc, Owerri as a case study. Data used for this technical research were obtained from secondary source these data were out-puts of cash deposits of customers patronizing fidelity bank plc Owerri from 1998-2007. The data was systematically analyzed using time series models. The study found that there is an annual decrease in the rate of cash deposit patterns in fidelity bank plc Owerri as a study unit of commercial banks. Finally, the study suggested some solutions and also made some fine and worthy recommendations.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong><em>1.0 INTRODUCTION</em></strong><br/>The need to monitor, evaluate and make adequate plans for the future compels managers, scientist of various calling and researchers alike to collect data on regular basis on processes that vary as time passes. Observations on such processes when arranged in chronological order (in time sequence) are called time series. A time series is a group of data that has been collected successively over a period of time. Some examples of time series are: the daily cash-deposits of customers, the weekly recorded cash-deposits of the bank, and the weekly or monthly stock levels of a company, the number of patients treated by a particular hospital per annum.<br/>The method of analyzing and interpreting these data is referred to as time series analysis. Time series analysis is very important in business and economic for forecasting purposes.� <br/>As we tend to base our forecast of cash-deposit results on what has happened in the past. The statistical series which tells us how data has been behaving in the past is the time series. It gives us the values of variable we are considering at various points in time each year for the last ten years. Time series may be classified as follows:<br/><strong><em>SECULAR TREND:� </em></strong>This is refers to the general direction in which the figures appears to the going over a long interval of time. It is important to distinguish between trends resulting from cyclical influence on the economy. Example, a change in task of customers buying habits. The observation of a secular trend might show an upward trend or downward trend or a steady trend.<br/><strong><em>SEASONAL VARIATIONS:</em></strong>� It is a common knowledge and a clear view to all that the value of many variables depends partly on the time of the year in question, every one knows that the rate of cash-deposits of customers is usually high in the month of March to November, during which customers stock their cash in banks, that is in order of months.<br/><strong><em>CYCLICAL VARIATION:� </em></strong>As the economy expands during the period of boom, we would expect to find that such data like cash-deposits, cash withdrawals or customers expenditure and sells rate will show a rising trend, and during the period of slump, we would expect them to show downward trend. Thus a wave-like motion may be observed in the pattern of our data.<br/><strong><em>IRREGULAR VARIATION:</em></strong>� These are random external events which affects our variables. May are also referred to as random variations because they result from sporadic events such as strikes, earth-quakes, floods, fire disaster, riots and this events are unpredictable.<br/>It is very clear that time series analysis will help in finding the trend to guide this industry or sector in forecasting and other management decisions that pertain to competition. In order to create a conducive condition or climate favourable for business, sponsoring the national football league and all national volley ball league or basket ball league is just a few. Their management slogan is “We keep our word”.</p> <p><em><strong>1.1 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></em><br/>Cash-deposits and withdrawals are the main determinant of banks financial status. In a highly competitive industry like the banking sector, this issue posses some serious challenges and responsibilities to baking sector which also the fidelity bank plc Owerri is a victim.<br/>What is their recorded cash-deposit level and level of financial base? Do these records not measure up to the standard that merited them their position in the financial or banking sector? Analysis made on the cash-deposits transactions are only information services, and as such must be conditioned by the process to which they are applied unless that may only lead to false sense in the industries. It is in the light of these questions that I wish to carry out this research.</p> <p><em><strong>1.2 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>The purpose of the study is due to the growing need to monitor the performance of an economy. Time series analysis is used to determine, the trend of deposit which might be use to forecast or predict future results.<br/>Managers and governments need an understanding of the past and current pattern of change in the cash-deposit rates and provide clues about future patterns to aid in forecasting.<br/>This study is initiated out of the desire to provide to those who may need it, as a basis for forecasting and decision making, which are tools for economy growth and standardization.</p> <p><em><strong>1.3 STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></em><br/>A study of this nature of phenomena will require stating some hypothesis.<br/>Hypothesis is a statement which stands to be opposed or supported depending on the outcome of the result of the analysis.<br/><strong><em>H0:</em></strong>� There is no significant difference on cash-deposits for the past ten years.<br/><strong><em>H1:</em></strong>� There is significant difference on cash-deposits for the past ten years.<br/><strong><em>H0:</em></strong>� There is no growth in the cash-deposits rate.<br/><strong><em>H1:</em></strong>� There is growth in the cash-deposits rate.<br/><strong><em>Ho:</em></strong>� There is no significant change on the cash deposit output rate in time series data.<br/><strong><em>H1:</em></strong>� There is significant change on the cash deposit output rate in time series data.</p> <p><strong><em>1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</em></strong><br/>This study is limited to the cash-deposits made at fidelity bank Plc, Owerri and it covers a period of ten (10) years from 1998 to 2007.</p> <p><em><strong>1.5 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>The financial or banking sector has been characterized by strict and uncompromising competition and rivalry. Due to this, basic information relating to cash-deposits and withdrawal are always treated in strict confidence. This is one of the set backs or problems encountered in the course of the data collection from the sector.<br/>Management uneasy compliance to release the authentic data for the fear of other sister industries having knowledge of their financial performance and level of their been patronized by customers since they are in a competitive environment, contributed a hydra-headed limitation to this research.</p> <p><em><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>The significance of this great effort is to examine the rate of cash-deposits in the Fidelity Bank Plc, Owerri, it is very relevant to both management and staff of the company. It is believed that it will help management and staff to plan effectively for desirable change and improvement geared towards accessing and revealing the strength and weakness of the cash-deposits segment of fidelity Bank Plc, Owerri.</p> <p><em><strong>1.7 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></em><br/>To examine the cash-deposits pattern of fidelity bank, which forms the basis for its growth?� <br/>To determine the trend of its cash-deposits rate and use it to forecast future estimates.� <br/>To deseasonalize the data on cash-deposits recorded from 1998-2007.<br/>To offer suggestions and remedies for improvement on banking.</p> <p><em><strong>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></em><br/>Cash deposit here refers to the action of bank customers putting their money into their bank accounts for safe keeping and other numerous purposes.<br/>Traditionally, the term “Cash-deposits” refers to the act of financial collection and recording by financial institutions. Banks use these deposits collected from customers for business such as lending out money to both governmental bodies and non-governmental bodies and in return creates more money due to the interest rate attached to the loan, etc.<br/>For the purpose of this work, a “time series” refers to record of the values or a collection of observations of a random process made sequentially in time. Usually at equal interval.</p>\n\nANALYSIS OF CASH DEPOSITS PATTERN IN COMMERCIAL BANKS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANALYSIS OF CASH DEPOSITS PATTERN IN COMMERCIAL BANKS", "id": 12}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This research work was conducted to ascertain the comparative analysis of academic performance in English language and computer science in junior secondary school, Enugu North Educational Zone. A survey design was adopted for the study. A sample of 42 teachers both English language and computer science 110 students were drawn from 7 (seven) junior secondary schools in Enugu North. A structured Questionnaire was used to collect data and data collected were analyzed using frequency and percentage. The finding of the study showed that lack of quality instructional materials in the school can cause poor performance of students, inability of a teacher to give test and assignment to student will make student dull in their study, effectiveness of note making and note taking by the student will activate their attitude of learning, continuous assessment tasks practicing will embark on the academic performance and government should make incentive regular payment of salaries and allowances to the teacher to motivate them into effective teaching. </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Comparative analysis; Is an over view means of examining two or more things to discover the differences and similarities, in order to understand it more. Therefore, the emphasis of English language and computer education has been greatly stressed in this paper, to obtained details studies relatively. However, English language has bee seen as a very vital skill for live long education. Also English language is paramount important in every academic discipline and over all the social, political and economic development in the society. <br/>However, computer science education is imperative in technological development of any country of the world, and Nigeria as a growing country needs technological transformation for the enhancement of the nation. Furthermore, it is important for us to described comparative education as Nicholas (1996) view it, as an attempt to discover the differences in the forces and causes that produce different educational systems, and the underlying principles which govern the development of the National system of education with modifications and changes which the circumstances provide a wealth of information and never analytical approaches to system of education and show case the performance of students in different subjects like English language and computer science which are medium for communication in everywhere in the world.<br/>English Language and computer science education can be viewed as the two faces of a coin, as computer in the areas of communication appear to the sector where its use, is most prevalent, the efficiency of any communication process lies in its speed and accuracy, which implies that one cannot communicate with computer without the use of English language. On the other hand, the English language as a central subject for every academic level quietly agree with Uchechukwu (2008)’s view. He further stated that, English is a medium of instruction for all other subjects which depend in co-operation with other subjects like computer science in order to achieve learning outcome, computer as medium for Information Communication Technology (ICT) can not work with out the support of low level language and communication skills of English language, and will be difficult as the learners without the use of English.<br/>English language as a means of communication is one of the unique qualities possessed by the human species, it the means by which thoughts of ideas, feeling, relationship between the teacher and the learner are expressed. It is the most important subject in secondary school curriculum. It is through English language that computer information, concepts and skills are transmitted.<br/>The basic principles of learning English language in schools and home should be considered according to Gregor (1996) therefore, it is important to note that, an environment should be a great influence of learning experience. Though this situation is very difficult to achieve in Nigeria schools because, a greater percentage of Nigerian families fall within the lower class. It is important to note that, regular use of English both teachers and learners should made possible in our daily activities; Also Gregor (1995) emphasis that, the language task and all the learning materials such as books, charts, records, films and a host of others should be carefully graded and within the level of skilled already possessed.<br/>Uchechukwu (2008) noted that, learning of English language requires a lot of time and patience on the part of the teachers, so as to ensure much more direct learning contact between teachers and learners which can exist for practicing, listening and speaking skills particular. The aim of the subject is to provide students with basic information as a medium and also as important to note that, English language is not only instrumental in communication and education, but it is also seen as a symbol of cultural distinctiveness, a mark of political unit and a means of identification for education, and also computer not just a medium of communication but also very vital in technological development.<br/>Computer Education is very essential in all human endeavour. As omegboji (1997), referred computer as a system science corroborates in integration of knowledge and computer does the job of sharpening, harnessing, refining and restricting the intellectual fault of the people in their different levels and position.<br/>The most obvious reason for introducing computer science education in secondary schools is to equip students with the knowledge of computer in order to live as useful and effective member of the society. Descarfer (1997) stated that, if knowledge of science can not be transformed into computer language, that language is of inferior type which implies that they work hand in hand.<br/>According to Bamiro (1996) advocated that computer is a machine that can process information to produce information at a speed and accuracy that are humanly impossible. Laksebikan (1996) also view computer as a machine which accepts data from an input device, processes that data by performing arithmetic/logical operation and later supplies the result of the processed data as information through an output device.<br/>In the area of student’s performance, Chukwuemeka and Otiji (2008) are of the opinion that, the ability of a student to interact and relate or work with order people helps students to develop skills that help them to be useful in their school and society at large. A student who don’t possess the ability to communicate well either in computer or English through their writing and reading, and speaking are not likely to perform well. <br/>To be academically well in this form of education a student must be extremely self-motivated and self-disciplined. Before a student should have academic balance he/she needs a great deal of commitment and discipline that most student do not have unit in the process of their education.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEEM </strong><br/>The emphasis has been laid on the issue of academic performance of students in English language and computer science.<br/>The key to success or failure in today’s world is the ability to communicate with spoken word and written words, as more as routine tasks are performed by computer and robots. However, because of technological development, the job assigned to students required a more sophisticated ability to understand and transmit information. <br/>The emphasis in the work is to discover the extent of the student’s ability to function in the society. In view of Ifeyinwa (2002) noted that, many students have poor background of knowledge of English language at primary level of education because of unqualified teachers that might be allocated to teach English language, in view of what Ifeyinwa said, that there is a need to improve our teaching method to enable student acquire good knowledge in English language in order to be useful in the society. <br/>Also, Fermat (1997) view computer science as bedrock of any nation’s development, it has in recent days witnessed a downward trend and negative attitudes of students in secondary schools of Enugu North L.G.A of Enugu State. Despite the fact that there has been a lot of hues and cries and consistent call to improve teaching and learning of computer to enhance student achievement in schools, most of the course done in secondary schools, like English, mathematics and other science subject can be taught using computer system; the use of computer games which are being played with computer system help to arouse students interest and create a congenial atmosphere for learning.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The purpose of the study is to find out the difference and similarities of the student’s performance in English language and computer science in junior secondary school in Enugu North. <br/>The objective of this research is to enable students to learn, develop and deploy communication skills in English language and computer science.<br/><br/>The following objective includes:<br/>• To use ranking methods of influencing factors in predicting student’s academic performances in learning of computer science and English language.<br/>• To enhance and determine the academic performances of the students by effective use of instructional materials of English language and computer science.<br/>• To state the measure in identify the academic performance of students in computer science and English language.<br/>• To find the cause of poor performance of students in teaching and learning of English language and computer science and how to reduce it.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The research work is aimed at investigating the academic performance of junior secondary school students in English language and computer science. <br/>The project report is limited to the following areas:<br/> Enugu North Local Government Area.<br/> Limited for only junior students in the secondary schools.<br/> Facilities (Laboratory and Equipment).<br/> Qualification<br/> Finding (Government, Private)<br/> Students and Parents.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The result of this study will help teachers in Enugu North Local Government Area to know the area of much emphasis in their teaching methods. This study would provide the Ministry of Education with useful information based on poor or good performance of students in English language and computer science and so many examination bodies, which would make teachers of English language and computer science and also establish computer laboratory for effective practical work on computer studies.<br/>The officials of education services and curriculum planners in this area of English language and computer science would benefit from the findings of this study. They would be provided with some information on the need to inculcate effective communication of English language and computer science by the students.</p> <p><strong>1.6 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>How could we utilize ranking method of influencing factors in predicting students’ academic performance in learning of computer science and English language:<br/>To what extent should instructional materials be utilized to determine the academic performance of students?<br/>State the measure in identifying the academic performance of students on computer science and English language?<br/>What are the causes of poor performances of students in teaching and learning of English language and computer science?</p>\n\nCOMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN JUNIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN JUNIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL", "id": 13}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Samples of water from the different hostels in campus II and other source of water production namely Ajali-owa water, from bore hole 9th mile and spring water from GRA water board were water collected and analyzed using total plate count and multiple tube fermentation techniques coliform.

It consist of two atoms of hydrogen combined with one atom of oxygen. Water is a tasteless, odourless and colourless mobile liquid except in large volume where it appears blue. It has a melting point of OoC (320f) and a boiling point of 1000C (2120f). water is a basic necessity of life, in the absence higher animals survive only but a few hours or days. It has several uses such as washing cooking, food processing ,swimming, and among others. Out of these uses, drinking of water seems to be the most sensitive as it could have a direct deleterious impact on health of human beings. <br/>Therefore, drinking water should be potable free diseases, or toxic substance (Beren 1991) .<br/>Water is portable when it is colourless. Odourless, or tasteless and also free from poisonous, corroding, staining substances as well as disease casuiong oirganisms (Cruich 1972). The problem of providing safe and adequate water is as old as life on earth. Water can be made unifit or unsafe for drinking it contamination occurs either by nature or activities of human beings. <br/>Perhaps the greatest danger associated with drinking water is contamination by human excrement (Forest 1979). In most cases, the pollution/contamination is hardly severe and is not particularly detrimental to health. <br/>Thus a few substances and microbes that are health hazard do occur in water, and can cause illness or even death. From microbiological point of view, the pathogens most frequently transmitted through water supply ranges from ultrasmall virus to the microspic bacteria and relatively large cysts entemoeba instolytica. These organism cense infectrons of intestinal trach, when consumed censing amebic dysentery, and Gardia lamblia is a protozoa responsible for Giadiasis. Defective plumbing for example was the cause of out break during the world fair in Chicago 1933 (Garelick 1987) water borne disease cause acute diarrhoe, often last 2-3 months. The most common water borne disease can be by bacteria includes typhoid fever, paratyphoid. Asiatic cholera and bacteria dysentery.<br/>Other disease that may be transmitted by water include brucellosis, shige /losis, these disease are consuming. Untreated water (Hetolett 1921) various countries of the world and the world Health organisation (WHO) has set up standards for water quality against which the level of pollution can be assessed. The world Health organization (WHO) National Agency for food and Drug Administration control (NAFDAC), standard for potable water include the following, that in 100ml of water coliform bacteria should be absent, total plate count of bacteria growth should be 100 CFU/ML of water. Hence the sanitary Quality of water should not be over looked since contaminated water can cause health hazards when consumed. <br/>According to guideline for drinking water quality of WHO (1998)<br/>TABLE 1<br/>WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION STANDARD FOR DRINKING WATER</p> <p>PH 5.0 – 9.0<br/>COLOUR 15 Hazen unit<br/>Dissolved solids 500 mg/l<br/>Total Hardness 500 mg/l<br/>Calcium 75 mg/l<br/>Iron 0.3 mg/l<br/>Chloride 200 mg/l<br/>Nitrate 45 mg/l<br/>Coliform 10 colonies</p> <p><strong>1.1 AIMS / OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The objective of this projects is to make comparative analysis of Enugu state water cooperation provide against supplies.<br/>To identify contamination microbial advice on measures to control pollution of water bodies etc.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong><br/>The treated water produced by Enugu state water co-operation could be contaminated by defective plumbing which cause the rush of water out of the pipe forming pull mixed with sewage matters.

This was approved statistically with the chi-square test techniques. <br/>It was also discovered that fraudulent practices are a big causes of financial distress in Nigeria banking sector. <br/>Based on the presentation of data and chi-square techniques conducted the researcher was right. Furthermore, it was observed that financial distress in Nigerian banking sector has an adverse effect on the economy of Nigeria as a whole. <br/>Finally, it was equally observed that loan mistnaches contributed to the financial distress in Nigeria banking sector.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong><br/>The importance of capital as a necessity though not sufficient condition for economic growth is recognized in development economy where it is believed that the position of adequate financial resources is a pre-requisite for industrial transformation.<br/>Experiences in some countries notably Japan, India and Germany have shown that banks if sufficiently in their respective countries could serve as an engine of growth to greatly assist the promotion of rapid economic transformation of any nation. Banks all over the world occupy a strategic and lending position in financial sector. Many Nigerians see banks as places nobody can mess up. Hence, their accepting institutions as the safety place for depositing their money. It is equally because of the confidence they have in the industry as a whole that over the years, many of them imbedded this habit of savings, which in turn is very necessary of positive economic development of the nation. <br/>Ekechi (1995) said that confidence is a pre-requisite for economic recovery and sustained growth, but confidence is not a gift. It must be earned through the adjustment effort or rather confidence is rented because it is never yours and because it can be taken away anytime. The adjustable effort has to go on each and everyday”.<br/>One legacy the structural adjustment programme (SAP) left on its trials is the increase in the number of banks in the country before the introduction of SAP in 1986. The number rose to about 127 as at August 1995. This phenomenal growth of banks was initially hailed as a healthy development in the economy because it was to spread the resources in the economy. <br/>Because of the importance of banks monetary authorities pay great attention to the banking industry. In this process, they are sometimes faced with the problems of how best to handle financial distress in Nigeria banking sector. Financial distress in Nigerian banking sector date back to 1930 when the industrial and commercial bank, (ICB) failed one year after its established.<br/>As Hornby defined distress as “great pains, discomfort of sorrow caused by wants of money or other necessary things. <br/>John Ebhodaghe in explaining financial distress “two major problems are usually of serious concern. These are liquidity and insolvency”. He went further to explain liquidity as the inability of banks to meet its inabilities as they mature for payment while insolvent when the value of its realizable asset is less than the total value of liabilities. <br/>The reasons for early distress of banks are summarized in the following features, which characterized the banks since during the period. <br/>1. Foreign banks domination of deposit base, credit availability. <br/>2. Banks services tailored to the needs of the expatriates. <br/>3. Indigenous bank boom and failure resulting from under capitalization and poor quality management. <br/>4. Lack of banking, control and direction.<br/>Recently, it was realized that the development of statistical based, early warning system for problem banks identification would greatly assist regulators on classifying banks into sound and unsound categories. Worthy of notes is Decree No. 26 of August 1992 that prescribed the following for banks to be adjusted healthy.<br/>1. Specified cash reserve <br/>2. Specified liquidity ration<br/>3. Adherence to prudential guidelines <br/>4. Statutory minimum paid up capital requirement Adequate capital ration <br/>5. Sound management. <br/>Any bank, which did not satisfy any or all the listed factors, is adjudged unhealthy. It must be expressed here that there exist a thin dividing line between a distressed and unhealthy banks. This is because a bank, which is unhealthy in the short-run, may become distress in the long run. At the core of distressed bank, are twos basic problems compared to liquidity the later could not be neglected because it is an ominous sign of insolvency. <br/>Therefore, in assessing the financial condition of a bank, it is customary to use the CAMEL framework. Also ownership structure and types of banks are important factors on explaining the financial condition of a bank. The recent NDIC report revealed that ownership structure was used to explain the degree of financial distress seven out of eight banks, that were financially distressed were either owned or controlled by the state government. <br/>Another indicator of a distressed bank used in most countries of the world is classified assets that exceeds 100 percent of shareholders fund. Following from above, it is therefore reasonable to conclude that a distressed bank is one tht is technically insolvent the financial distress is caused by a number of factors including macro-economic conditions, the inhibitive policy of government capital adequacy, wide spread incidence of frauds, non-performing loans, unbraided risk by banks and so on. The effect of financial distress in Nigerian banking sector is a distressed economy. The causes and problems and the ways out of this financial distress will be discussed in details in this work.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </strong><br/>Financial distress in Nigerian banking sector dates back to colonial era. One of the early Nigerian indigenous banks, the industrial and commercial banks, the industrial and commercial banks (ICB) failed in the early 1930’s and between 1992 – 1994, the central bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) were face with the problems on how best to prevent the financial distress in the banking sector. Within this period, more than thirty banks had been adjudged financially distressed. <br/>The question remains what are the causes of these financial distresses in the banking sector? According to Charles worth, research arises when there is problem to solve, peculiarities or puzzle about a phenomena or the question to attaching meaning to identify and examine the causes and problems of financial distress in Nigerian banking sector.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>in writing this project, the researcher had certain objectives in mind. In line wit this following are the objectives of this write up.<br/>1. To identify the extent to which low capital base has contributed to the financial distress in Nigerian, banking sector. <br/>2. To identify to the extent to which multiplicity of banks has contributed to the financial distress in Nigerian baking sector.<br/>3. To ascertain how inefficient management has contributed to financial distress in Nigerian banking sector. <br/>4. To identify to a large extent how fraudulent practices has contributed to the financial distress in Nigerian banking sector. <br/>5. To identify the effects of financial distress in Nigerian banking sector. <br/>6. To recommend possible ways of preventing financial distress in Nigerian banking sector.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study will be immense benefits to the Nigerian banking sector. This will enable them to know the causes of financial distress in Nigerian banking sector, and based on the recommendation of this study, they will know how to prevent financial distress. <br/>Government will also benefit. As the operators of the economy, they will know the causes and effects of financial distress in the economy. Likewise, the depositors and potential investors will also benefits. There is a need for a development conscious country like Nigeria, to evaluate the performance of her financial sectors so as not to jeopardize her development efforts. It is helped that these findings will add to existing literature on causes and problems of financial distress in Nigerian banking sector.</p> <p><strong>1.5 STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS </strong><br/>To come out with a reliable result, the following hypothesis were formulated and tested statistically. <br/>1. Ho: Low capital base has not contributed to the financial distress in Nigerian banking sector. <br/>Hi: Low capital base has contributed to the financial distress in Nigerian banking sector. <br/>2. Ho: Inefficient management has not contributed to the financial distress in Nigerian banking sector. <br/>Hi: Inefficient management has contributed to the financial distress in Nigerian banking sector. <br/>3. Ho: Fraudulent practices have not contributed to the financial distress in Nigerian banking sector. <br/>Hi: Fraudulent practices have contributed to the financial distress in Nigerian banking sector.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>This research work covers the causes and problems of financial distress in Nigerian banking sector with reference to AFEX Bank Plc. In the cause of this study, the researcher could not carry out the work extensively due to the following constraints. <br/>TIME CONSTRAINTS: Time was my greatest enemy as I had to cope with my class work, assignments, home work, and the project work at the same time, and more over, most of the materials for the project work are not located in one place. <br/>FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS: Finance was my major constraints since I don’t have enough fund for running around and this hindered the full coverage of the work.</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS </strong><br/>BANKS: Banks are financial institutions, which hold themselves out to the public (individuals, firms, organization, and governments) by accepting deposits and giving out advances as well as performing other customers. <br/>FRAUDS: Fraud is intentional distorting twisting or changing of financial statement or using criminal deception to deceive someone in order to achieve illegal advantage<br/>LIQUIDITY: Liquidity is inability of a bank to meet its liabilities as they mature for payment. <br/>INSOLVENCY: Insolvency is when the value of realizable assets of a bank is less than the total value of its liabilities. <br/>CAPITAL ADEQUACY: Capital adequacy is when banks through proper fund management has enough capital to serve as a fall back and at course, shock absorber in the event of losses resulting from business transactions. <br/>SHAREHOLDERS: shareholders are the owners of the bank, whose names were described to the memorandum of the bank when the bank is registered. This is done through the purchase of the bank’s shares. <br/>PAID UP CAPITAL: This refers to that part of the issued capital, which has been paid-up.<br/>DISTRESS: This means great pains; discomfort or sorrow caused by wants money or other necessary things.</p> <p><strong>REFERENCES </strong><br/>CharlesWorth, J.C (1967), contemporary political Analysis New York Free Press, P. 281 <br/>Ebhodaghe, J.A (1999), Agenda for the prevention of bank distress, Ibadan; African FEB publication Ltd, P. 153. <br/>Ekechi, A.

The importance of the US dollars to a mono economy and import dependent nation like that of Nigeria cannot be over emphasized in that most notable transactions that takes place in any economic process must have a direct or indirect connection with the dollars. </p> <p>In the  economic analysis of any developing country like that of Nigeria, the increase or decrease of the dollars has a corresponding effect on the economy and by extension influences development.</p> <p>The increment of the dollars amid crisis can lead to severe economic consequences. The economic history of Nigeria has helped to buttress this fact.</p> <p>Certainly, the consequences for dollar increment or devaluating the naira can have both a long and short term effect. F or a country like Nigeria for instance, an increase in currency depreciation or dollar increment would immediately hit consumer purchasing power while at the same time reduces the value of wages that was hitertho before now valuable. Since Nigeria is an import dependent Nation, purchases of foreign goods quickly fall because prices of foreign goods would geometrically rise, this would lead to lack of small and medium enterprises growth and businesses would suffer which by extension affects the speedy growth and development of the economy. The pace of economic adjustment will depend on how quickly domestic industries/companies respond toward import replacement and exporting.</p> <p>The exchange rate policy is what must be discussed in the increment or decrement of the dollar in Nigeria. Exchange rate policy simply entails the value of a unit of the naira to the dollar (Obadan, 1996). Exchange rate policy is therefore a critical component in the increament of the dollar and how it influences the economy. Specifically internal balances mean the level of economic activity that is consistent with the satisfactory control of inflation. On the contrary, external or sustainable current account deficit financed on lasting basis expected capital inflow. It is important to know that economic objectives are usually the main consideration in determining the exchange control which influences the the increment of the united state dollar. For instance from 1982 – 1983, the Nigerian currency was pegged to the US dollar on a 1.1 ration. Before then, the Nigerian naira has been devalued by 10% which had its corresponding consequences on the economy of Nigeria. Apart from this policy measures discussed above, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) applied the basket of currencies approach from 1979 as the guide in determining the exchange rate was determined by the relative strength of the currencies of the country’s trading partner and the volume of trade with such countries. Specifically weights were attached to these countries with the American dollars and British pound sterling on the exchange rate mechanism (CBN, 1994). One of the objectives of the various macro – economic policies adopted under the structural adjustment programme (SPA) in July, 1986 was to establish a realistic and sustainable exchange rate for the naira, this policy was recommended in 1986 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p> <p>The inconsistency in policies and lack of continuity in exchange rate policies aggregated unstable nature of the naira rate against the dollar. (Gbosi, 1994:70). This has led to the economic inconsistencies in Nigeria in recent times.</p> <p>When the value for the dollar increase which simultaneously devaluates the Naira, domestic firms and households can no longer afford to buy domestic goods and services, and foreigners aren't interested in buying overpriced goods and labour. So companies go broke or cash trapped and unemployment rises because more people would be layed off. With lots of unused industrial capacity and crowds of unemployed workers, prices and wages slowly decline. More flexible labour markets with lots of room for productivity growth will adjust faster than less flexible economies like that of Nigeria.</p> <ol><li><strong>Statement of the general problem</strong></li> </ol> <p>The dollar rate when compared with the Naira has been stable between the 1973 and 1979 which were the oil boom era. This was also the case before 1990 when Nigeria generated huge gross domestic product (GDP) from the agricultural sector unlike now where the agricultural sector has gone nearly comatose of not been able to account up to 5% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) owing to the discovery and development of the oil sector.</p> <p>The problem of the alarming increase of the dollar when compared to the naira has been a cause for a serious concern and has led to the depreciation of the economy.  Small scale enterprises has been discouraged as a result of the increment of the dollar, imports reduce significantly and having known that the small enterprises are the bedrock of any economy and for any economy to thrive, the small scale businesses must be encouraged and supported but this has regrettably not been the case in recent times.</p> <ol><li><strong>Aims and objectives of the study</strong></li> </ol> <p>The major aim of this study is examine the effect of dollar increment on the economy of Nigeria.

This survey investigates the contribution of time spent on the internet by students to academic achievement. The performance of students’ overtime has witnessed a constant depreciation. Many scholars see this as a direct consequence of governments neglect on education; some others say the students should share a large part of the blame. There is no doubt that spending time on the internet helps to improve ones intelligent quotient and ultimately make one conversant with happenings around him/her but doing this to the detriment of one’s studies has done more harm than good in our society. Ezeife 2008 opined that for students to be able to do academically well, they have spent little or no time on the internet. But doing this according to oluwatobi 2013 could as well be detrimental to students’ academic performance. it is no longer news that Nigerian students have so taken to the internet that do spend little or no time in their studies and these have to the decline of education in Nigeria.  In sum, this study may help to develop a conceptual framework for guiding efforts to improve academic performance, as it relates to time used on the internet.  </p>\n\nA REGRESSION ANALYSIS ON THE HOURS SPENT ON THE INTERNET AND TIME SPENT TO STUDY ON ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A REGRESSION ANALYSIS ON THE HOURS SPENT ON THE INTERNET AND TIME SPENT TO STUDY ON ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS", "id": 17}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The issue of malnutrition has become a household name among families with children from zero to five years. It is evident that the nutritional status of children is widely regarded as one of the well-known indicators of economic development of that particular region in question.</p> <p>There has been high level of neglect of children by most parents’ reason being as a result of low family income, lack of parent exposure and poor implementation of infrastructural facilities such as good hospital that sees for children like of pipe borne water etc.</p> <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that malnutrition accounts for 54 percent of child mortality worldwide, about 1 million children. Another estimate also by WHO states that childhood underweight is the cause for about 35% of all deaths of children under the age of five years worldwide. The main causes are unsafe water, inadequate sanitation or insufficient hygiene, factors related to society and poverty, diseases, maternal factors, gender issues and overall poverty (Bhutta et al, 2008). The nutritional status of children under five (5) years of age is usually measured as weight-for-age, weight for height and height for age indexes. The common nutritional status of children under 5 years old in each region such as underweight, stunning and wasting are considered as nutritional disorders.</p> <p>The evaluation of these criteria reflects the general health status of that region. Malnutrition is a clinical syndrome which the infant or child deviates from the main pattern of growth, the growth curve is downward and constantly locates under the curve of 3% of the height and weight (Nakhshab M, Nasiri H, 2009).</p> <p>The malnutrition often occurs in the first years of life when the caloric intake is not able to provide the metabolic needs of the body. Consequently, the stored nutrients in the tissues will be consumed to preserve the life (Arezomaniance S, 2005). In children, protein-energy malnutrition is defined by measurements that fall below 2 standard deviations under the normal weight for age (underweight), height for age (stunting) and weight for height (wasting). Wasting indicates recent weight loss, whereas stunting usually results from chronic weight loss.</p> <p>The primary malnutrition in children occurs due to socioeconomic factors and lack of food. The secondary malnutrition is associated with the diseases with increased need for calories, calorie loss, and reduction of calorie intake or a combination of these three modes. It may be caused by low food intake or impaired absorption of nutrients.</p> <p>Prenatal malnutrition and early life growth patterns can alter metabolism and physiological patterns and have lifelong effects on the risk of cardiovascular disease. Children who are undernourished are more likely to be short in adulthood, have lower educational achievement and economic status, and give birth to smaller infants (Bhutta et al, 2008). Children often face malnutrition during the age of rapid development, which can have long-lasting impacts on health.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation estimated in 2008 that globally, half of all cases of malnutrition in children under five were caused by inadequate food intake, unsafe water, inadequate sanitation or insufficient hygiene. This link is often due to repeated diarrhoea and intestinal worm infections as a result of inadequate sanitation. However, the relative contribution of diarrhea to malnutrition and in turn stunting remains controversial. In almost all countries, the poorest quintile of children has the highest rate of malnutrition. However, inequalities in malnutrition between children of poor and rich families vary from country to country, with studies finding large gaps in Peru and very small gaps in Egypt. In 2000, rates of child malnutrition were much higher in low income countries (36 percent) compared to middle income countries (12 percent) and the United States (1 percent). Studies in Bangladesh in 2009 found that the mother’s literacy, low household income, higher number of siblings, less access to mass media, less supplementation of diets, unhygienic water and sanitation are associated with chronic and severe malnutrition in children.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>What really instigated the study was the increased mortality of children under the ages of five (5) as a result of malnutrition; about 50 percent of the citizens in Nigeria are low income earners, it is evident from World Bank found that, from 1970 to 2000, the number of malnourished children decreased by 20 percent in developing countries. Some the other problems discovered are in the areas of lack of iodine intake by pregnant mothers before child birth, lack of minerals, calcium vitamins has seen to be a major clog on the wheels of child growth and development. In Nigeria today, there has been lack of nutritional education in most of the hospitals to educate pregnant mothers on how to feed before child birth.</p> <p><strong>1.3 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main aim of the research work is to carry out a statistical analysis of the prevalence of malnutrition on children Zero to five years. Other specific aims of the study include:</p> <ol><li>To examine the effect and causes of malnutrition among children from Zero to Five years of age</li> <li>To examine the relationship between malnutrition and child mortality rate in Nigeria</li> <li>To identify the strategies for reducing malnutrition in children from zero to five years</li> <li>To examine the effect of parent income on child care and malnutrition among children from Zero to Five years old</li> <li>To proffer solution to the above stated problems</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The study came up with research questions so as to be able to ascertain the above stated objectives. The specific research questions are stated below as follows:</p> <ol><li>What is the effect and causes of malnutrition among children from Zero to Five years of age?</li> <li>What is the relationship between malnutrition and child mortality rate in Nigeria?</li> <li>What are the strategies for reducing malnutrition in children from zero to five years?</li> <li>Does parent income have any effect on child care and malnutrition among children from Zero to Five years old?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5 STATEMENT OF RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p><strong>H0</strong>: there is no significant relationship between malnutrition and child mortality rate in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>H1</strong>: there is significant relationship between malnutrition and child mortality rate in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>H0</strong>: length for age and weight for age does not influence mortality rate among children from Zero to Five years as a result of malnutrition</p> <p><strong>H1</strong>: length for age and weight for age influences mortality rate among children from Zero to Five years as a result of malnutrition</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study on the prevalence of malnutrition on children Zero to five years will be of immense benefit to the entire pregnant mothers in Nigeria as it will educate them on the effect of malnutrition on child mortality rate. The study will also educate them on how to take care of their child at the early age of growth and development. The study will educate on the causes, prevalence and strategies for reducing malnutrition in children from zero to five years. Finally the study will be a contribution to the body of literature in the area of the effect of personality trait on student’s academic performance, thereby constituting the empirical literature for future research in the subject area.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study on prevalence of malnutrition on children Zero to five years will cover areas on the causes and the prevalence of malnutrition in children. It will also cover the strategies for reducing malnutrition in children from zero to five years of age</p> <p><strong>1.8 LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>Financial constraint</strong>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).</p> <p><strong>Time constraint</strong>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

Most of these illnesses may be as a result of unhealthy lifestyles and habits. Amongst this various unhealthy lifestyles and habits are smoking, lacks of exercise, weight, poor dietary just to mention but a few. In Nigeria specifically, a lot has been said about smoking and lack of exercise. Smokers as they say are liable to die young, though a lot of publicity has gone out to this regard, most smokers have rather not taken heed to this meaning but have rather seen it as a normal jingle without really pondering over it them to make changes in their life styles and bad habits.</p> <p>Lack of exercise “as deadly as smoking” is now causing as many deaths as smoking in Nigeria and across the world.This has also contributed to the unprecedented rise in illness across Nigeria.</p> <p>Strong evidence shows that lack of exercise which leads to physical inactivity increases the risk of many major adverse health conditions including:</p> <p>Death (from any cause), coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, metabolic syndrome (including obesity and abnormal blood cholesterol levels), breast and colon cancer, depression etc.</p> <p>It estimated that overall, physical inactivity which is caused by lack of exercise caused more than 5.3 million of the 57 million deaths that occurred worldwide in 2008 which Nigeria is not excluded. The researchers suggest this is equivalent to the 5 million deaths attributed to smoking in 2000 (Kingsley 2012: 42).</p> <p>It is generally believed that a regular exercise helps to</p> <ul><li>reduce the risk of falling ill</li> <li>controls your weight<br/>Improve your mental health and mood</li> <li> Improve your ability to do daily activities<br/>Increase your chances of liing longer etc</li> </ul> <p>There may also be a relationship between the weight of a person and the propensity to fall ill. This study helps to explore those unique relationship between the various parameters mentioned earlier in this study.</p> <p><strong>1.2. Aims and objectives of the study</strong></p> <p>The following are the objectives of the study:</p> <ol><li>To know if there is a relationship between smokers and their weight.</li> <li>To study the impact of smoking and lack of exercise on health conditions of patients.</li> <li>To know the nature of relationship between smoking, weight, level of exercise on the medical cost of patients.</li> <li>To study the relationship between weight and health care cost of patients.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.3. Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>The importance of this study seeks to unveil the impact of smoking, level of exercise, and weight on medical cost of patients in Nigeria. With the view of advising the generality of Nigeria based on the statistical discoveries made from the study.</p> <p>This study also seeks to study the relationship between weight of patients on medical cost of patients, smokers and their medical cost and level of exercise of patients and their corresponding medical cost. All these would assist in advising smokers and people who don’t exercise based on the findings from the study.</p> <p><strong>1.4. Scope of the study</strong></p> <p>The scope of this study is centered on the impact of smoking, less exercising on the weight and health care cost of patients using the federal medical center Owerri Imo state as a case study.</p> <p><strong>1.5. Limitation of the study</strong></p> <p><strong>Time constraint</strong></p> <p> The major limitation of the study is the time constraint; the researcher was inhibited by time as there was no enough time to cover all patients in the hospital.</p> <p><strong>Financial constraint</strong></p> <p>Another constraint of this study is financial constraints, lack of adequate finances in printing enough questionnaires for the patients and to equally interview the health practitioners.</p> <p><strong>1.6. Research Questions</strong></p> <p>1. Is smoking dangerous to health?</p> <p>2. Is there a relationship between smoking and poor health condition.</p> <p>3. Is there a relationship between lack of exercise and poor health condition?</p> <p>4. Do you think that smoking, lack of regular exercise affect the weight and health condition adversely?</p> <p>5. Suggest ways of making smokers quit smoking.</p> <p><strong>1.7. Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 1</strong></p> <p>H0: there is no relationship between smoking and medical cost of patients.</p> <p>H0: there is a relationship between smoking and medical cost of patients.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 2</strong></p> <p>H0: there is no relationship between lack of regular exercise andmedical cost of patients.</p> <p>H0: there is a relationship between lack of regular exercise and medical cost of patients.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 3</strong></p> <p>H0: there is no relationship between smoking, lack of regular exercise and medical cost of patients</p> <p>H0: there is a relationship between smoking, lack of regular exercise and medical cost of patients</p> <p><strong>1.8.

ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>          National income is the sum of the money value of all the commodities and services produced in a country within a particular period of time usually one year.</p> <p>          The question of how an economy grows could come to mind at this juncture.  It the amount of goods and services produced by an economy increases.  If it does not increase yearly, it is not growing, even if it is growing, the rate of growth may not be uniform among years.  Therefore it may not be possible to determine the condition of the economy.</p> <p>          In any case, an economy needs an indicator for measuring economy growth, this indicator is the monetary summation at all the commodities and service produced in an economy within a particular period of time usually a year.</p> <p>          To get national income of a country like Nigeria for instance, we take the list of the goods and services produced in the country during the year, assign values to them and add up.  If we can do this year after year, we shall be able to make comparison of activities of Nigeria year after year.  Then we can decisively determine whether the economy of Nigeria is growing, declining or stagnant.  It is growing if the National income increases year after year, declining, if the National income is decreasing and stagnant it there is no difference in the National Income for years.</p> <p>          In measuring National Income, an indicator called Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is used at current price.  It is therefore quite important here to point out the role that prices could play in the measurement of National Income.  Prices of goods and services changes from time to time.  These changes can affect any attempted estimates.  Considerably.  Therefore to get an idea of the real physical change in National Income from year to year, effect of price changes must be removed.</p> <p>          National Income should be measured in real terms and allow for changes in price levels.  For instance whenever the economy experiences inflation, price rises while the quantities of goods and services may remain constant.  Let us say that 2000, the total units of the go0ods and services realized in Nigeria amounted to 50,000 units and also 50,000 units in 2001.  Let us further assume that the average per unit in 2000 was N10.00 while the price in 2001 was N15,000.</p> <p>          Nigeria’s income with GDP as an indicator for 2000 was 50,000 units X N10.00 = N5000,000 Nigeria’s income with GDP as an indicator for 2001 was 50,000 units X N15.00 = N750,000.</p> <p>          If the two figures were presented to a layman as final products of overall estimates for 2000 and 2001, he would be tempted to say that the National income for 2001 was higher than that of 2000.  This is so monetarily but really the income for both year are equal.  The difference in value was due to rise in p rice in 2001 while the quantities of goods and services were the same in both years.</p> <p>          The same thing can be applicable when a country experience deflation or depression.  Therefore in measuring national income for different years using gross domestic product as an indicator effects of price changes must be given the normal due.  In so doing the changes in economy can be determined appropriately.</p> <p>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM/MOTIVATION</p> <p>          As a result of poor economic condition in Nigeria relevant information is of great interest to me for investigation if viable economic solution can be revealed.</p> <p>          Nigeria considered as one of the third world countries is been assessed by their income yearly.  It is a simple logic of our living that it country’s income is high with considerable population, the enjoyment of the citizens of that country would be high, while the enjoyment is low with low national income.  It is on this point that I find it very expedient to analyze the national income of Nigeria and make necessary recommendation for the improvement of the economy for the betterment of the citizenry.</p> <p>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</p> <p>          In view of Nigeria’s economic predicament, the project is aimed at investigating the relationship existing between disposable income, savings and government final expenditure for the purpose of suggesting solutions to our economic problems.</p> <p>          After the regression analysis had been carried out, it will supply solution to the following questions:</p> <ol><li>Is any linear relationship between the variables listed?</li> <li>How reliable is our regression coefficient?</li> <li>Can we predict the future value of dependent variable?</li> <li>How reliable will be our estimate?</li> </ol> <p>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>          The study is centre on “National Income, Savings and Government Final Consumption Expenditure Covering the period of six years 1998 – 2003.</p> <p>          The raw data used are collected as primary data by federal office of statistics” publication and Federal Ministry of Finance Publication.  The data are collected as primary data by federal office of statistics and used as secondary data in this project which centered on national Accounts.  Some of these National Accounts Aggregates Include Gross Domestic Product (GDP) final consumption expenditure, exports and imports.</p> <p>          National Accounts data presents the record of economic transaction of the economic in a systematic manner and show the relationship between the various components of the economy.  Economic transaction cover all the activities of an entity (Household, government, firm, financial institution) that are of economic nature (production, consumption distribution, savings and foreign exchange transactions.  These economic transactions of all the entiti8tes and combined together ad presented inform of account.</p> <p>          Data collected for analysis in this study center on:-</p> <ol><li>Appropriation of disposable income as dependent variable.</li> <li>Savings as one of the independent variable</li> <li>Government final consumption expenditure as another independent variable.</li> </ol> <p>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>          The study will help to know the status of Nigeria economy.  The knowledge of the status will help to make necessary recommendation in order to revitalize the poor economic condition of the country for the better future.</p> <p>          The study will also create avenue for future research.</p> <p>DEFINITION OF CONCEPTS</p> <p><strong>Gross Domestic Product (GDP):      </strong>This is the sum of the money value of all locally produced goods and services.  It does not include international transaction.  GDP does not make allowance for depreciation of capital.</p> <p><strong>Gross National Product (GNP):</strong>      This is the total money value of current market prices of all final goods and services produced by the nationals during a specific period.  It includes net income from abroad in respect of the country’s nationals without any consideration for depreciation of capital.</p> <p>National Domestic Product (NDP): This is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a period of time.  It exclude the value of the net earnings and incomes from abroad.  An allowance being made for depreciation of capital.</p> <p><strong>Net National Product (NNP):</strong> This is the monetary value of all goods and services produced within the country during a specific period.  It includes net incomes and earning from abroad and provision being made for the replacement of depreciation of capital.</p> <p><strong>Disposable Income (DPI):      </strong>This is the amount of money per year that private sector are free to spend when depreciation of capital, all taxes, all net profits made by firms but not paid out as divided are added to the disposable and transfer payment subtracted.  We arrive at gross national product.</p> <p><strong>Net Economic Welfare (NEW):                 </strong>This examines those factors not considered when calculating the Gross National Product (GNP).  Such factors include social cost 9pollution) and leisure time the net economic welfare tend to remove the product (GNP).  A nation might have a very high GNP at a very great social cost as pollution, rising crime etc.</p> <p><strong>Per Capita Income (PCI)        </strong>This is the gross domestic product divided by the population of the country.  Per capita income can be calculated once the population and gross domestic product are known.  So that P.C.I = GDP</p> <p>   P</p>\n\nREGRESSION ANALYSIS ON NATIONAL INCOME (FROM 1999 –

children attracts concern from every Nigerian.</p> <p>          It is clear that the only way to wipe out a race is to cut its means of future reproduction which is the children and this children are believed to be our future presidents, governors etc and the ensure older generation of a better tomorrow.</p> <p>          Infant morality have a considerable significance on demography.</p> <p>          The level of death rate in early life has been described as a crucial test of the health service and special progress of a country.</p> <p>          The young child’s life is wholly dependent on the care of mothers.  It is base on this that the government through the ministry of health fights to ensure that all the preventable childhood disease that leads to infant deaths the reduced to most minimal level.  This gave way to the introduction of Expanded programme on immunization (EPI) and ORAL Dehydration Therapy (ORT).  These programmes are aimed at teaching parents on how to make salt, sugar, water as oral drip to cure diarrhea and to immunize poliomyelitis, small pox, chicken pox, whooping cough and tuberculosis.</p> <p>          Ever since the introduction of these programmes, great lots have been achieved by reducing the number of infants death.  This instigated my writing this project.</p> <p>          With the data I collected from park-lane general hospital, Enugu on the number of infants death and sex distribution.</p> <p> CHAPTER ONE </p> <p><strong>1.0     INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Infant mortality is mostly caused by diseases and these diseases are due to the prevalence of parasite hosts in certain areas.  It is believed that year, thousands of children are born in this country and thousands of these children die from diseases such as diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, poliomyelitis, measles and childhood tuberculosis.</p> <p>          This is stated in a pamphlet on Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) published by the Federal Epidemiological unit, Federal Ministry of Health, Lagos, 1981.</p> <p>          Children’s development and survival are influenced by a number of factors which include environmental sanitation, most of all nutrition and parents lack of awareness some children are malnourished due to the fact that their parents do not know what constitutes a balanced diet for.  They lack the knowledge of what helps the children to grow normally and build up strong immunity against such diseases that emanate from under – nourished diet.  Some parents are illiterate and ignorant, that is why in some remote areas of the country children die out of carelessness and parent ignorance.</p> <p>          Ignorance, in the sense that some parents do not know or observe the programme introduced by the ministry of Health to ward – off those six killer diseases which is Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), presently, the government of Nigeria has carried out a national expanded programme on immunization (EPI) to control these six childhood diseases throughout the federation.</p> <p>          Although, Nigeria has been declared small pox free surveillance against the disease is still being maintained.  Government should be commended on their efforts to create awareness on the side of the parent and their effort to ward off these diseases, thereby reducing the infant deaths in the country.</p> <p>          More can be done also by educating the parents o how to maintain good environmental hygiene ad nutritional standard of their diet so as to rear healthy children.</p> <p>          Actually, the rate of infant mortality motivated me to carry out a research on this project topic and also suggest ways which can reduce the rate of infant mortality.</p> <p><strong>1.1     AIMS AND OBEJCTIVES</strong></p> <p>The aims and objectives of this project are as following</p> <p>1.       To determine the ratio of males to females death, among infants less than 1 year.</p> <p>2.       To determine whether infant mortality is greater tan the standard range for infant, mortality which is (10-55) deaths per every 1000.</p> <p>3.       To determine if mortality is independent of sex of a child.</p> <p>4.       To determine if the mean mortality for male and female infants are the same.</p> <p>5.       To suggest possible preventive measures to reduce the number of infant deaths that occur.</p>\n\nANALYSIS OF THE RATE OF INFANT MORTALITY FROM I MONTH TO I YEAR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\"

STUDY</strong></p> <p>       Typhoid Fever is a world wide disease which creates a very serious public healthy problem. In many under develop countries; the word health organization (WHO) estimated that about one person out of ever hundred (100) is suffering from typhoid fever. The also identify typhoid as a serious public health problem which incidence is highest in children and young adults between 5-19 years old.</p> <p>       Typhoid fever is a systematic disease caused by dissemination of salmonella typhoid or salmonella paratyphoid mainly characterized by fever was called because of it’s common similarity to typhus. It was clearly defined pathologically as a unique disease of it’s own, it is a common world wide illness, transmitted by the ingestion of food or water contaminated with the faces of an infected person, which contain the bacterium salmonella enterica. The bacteria then perforate through the intestinal wall and are phagocytosed by macrophages.</p> <p>       According to medial dictionary (Budelka, K.G. 1971), which reveals the typhoid fever as an infection which is usually spread by contamination of food, milk or water supply with salmonella typhi (S. typhil), either directly by sewage or indirectly by flies or by faulty personal hygiene. Symptomless carries harbouring the germ in the gall bladder and excreting it in their stools are the main sources of  out breaks of disease in this country. The average incubation period is 10-14 days. A progressive fedric illness marks the onset of disease which develops as the germ invades tymphoid tissues, including that of the small intestine (peyers patches) to profuse diarrhocal (pea soup) stools which may become frankly haemorrhagic, ultimate recovery usually begins at the end of the third week. A rose coloured rash may appear on the upper abdomen and back at the end of the first week.</p> <p><strong>1.2  STATE OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>       Over the last decade, there has been alarming increase in the rate of recorded cases of typhoid fever in our various hospitals especially in Abia state. This has led to a very serious questions on the minds of the citizenry in particular and the professionals in our medical field in general.

West Africa includes the most endemic areas in the world; Nigeria being one of the largest countries in West Africa has been reported to have a high incidence of onchocerciasis infection with 7 million people with the disease and 40 million at risk. Onchocerciasis is the world’s second leading infectious cause of blindness. It is not the nematode, but its endosymbiont, Wolbachia pipientis that causes the severe inflammatory response that leaves many blind. An estimated 18 million people suffer from Onchocerciasis, world wide. Onchocerciasis is a chronic parasitic infection caused by the filarial nematode, onchocerca volvulus. This disease is transmitted from one individual to another through the bites of black fly simulium damnosum of the family simulidae (Nwoke et al, 1991) normally found near streams and rivers (giving disease its common name River Blindness).Sometimes, the bite transmits parasitic worms into the body. As they spread, they cause terrible itching, muscle pains and weakness. Eventually when the worms reach the adult stage, they attack the eyes leading to permanent blindness. The entire process may take up to 30 years from the first bite.  </p> <p>        One can ask, how common is Onchocercasis (River Blindness)? Currently 35 countries around the world are affected by Onchocerciasis. It is an ancient disease of Africa and accordingly, 28 of the affected countries and over 90% of all infected people are in Africa. With the rest occurring in 6 countries in Latin America at in Yemen and the Arabian Peninsula. In some communities in Africa, 50% of the men over age 40 have been blinded by Onchocerciasis. It is found in rural often poor populations living near fast flowing rivers, rapid and other turbulent waters where the black fly vector breeds. While the women draw water from village wells the men often fish and farm near the fast flowing rivers.</p> <p>        Onchocerciasis has become endemic in central and South America as well, affecting 70,000 people in Guatemala and Mexico alone. Other small isolated endemic foci occur in Venezuela, Colombia, and Brazil, Ecuador. The prevalence of infection is nearly zero at birth, since Onchocercasis can but seldom does; undergo intrauterine transmission and increases with age to a high plateau later in life reaching 100% in hyperedemic areas. Similarly, intensity of infection increases with age to a plateau between age 30 and 50 years. </p> <p>Geographical differences in the disease manifestation may result from variations in;</p> <p>a.  Different forms of species of the vector with different life cycle and habits.</p> <p>b.  Different parasite strains with varying pathology and antigenic make up.</p> <p>c.   The degree of the host(s) susceptibility</p> <p><strong>1.1 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>The last two decades have seen a re-emergence of river blindness in Nigeria due to increasing poverty and insufficient social amenities in the rural areas.  Nigeria is made up of 36 states plus F.C.T, 18 out of this number representing 49 percent of the states are river blindness prone states. They include Abia, Anambra, Benue, Cross-River, Ebonyi, Enugu, Ekiti, Edo, F.C.T, Imo, Kano, Kwara, Niger, Ogun, Osun, Oyo, Taraba and Zamfara. Out of these affected states, Ebonyi State has the highest case in the South-East zone.</p> <p>        The presence of Onchcercal skin lesions is unsightly and has a psychosocial effect on the affected. Onchocerciasis is among the five neglected disease in Nigeria (i.e. Guinea worm, River Blindness, Elephantiasis, Bilharzias and leprosy).</p> <p>      From 1969-1970 several African countries including Nigeria applied for aid from, World Bank, UNDP, WHO and USAID in launching control programs. July 1970 a meeting in Geneva set up an international study mission to collect and access epidemiological economic and other data in preparation for a multinational control program on river-blindness. They found out that about 90% of onchocerciasis cases occur in Africa. Onchocercasis is endemic in 28 African countries including Nigeria.</p> <p>        Of recent Ebonyi state government enacted a program that in every year there must be a workshop in the state in general in which citizens shall be educated particular on the issue of Onchocerciasis as one of its strategies for mass mobilization cause. But then the disease seems to be stubborn and obstinate. The Federal Government in conjunction with the state government and the NGO’s established the primary health care program the disease proved the program null and void. The number of Onchocerciasis cases in Ebonyi state keeps on increasing by the day.  </p> <p>      The improvement in the health status of the citizens is a significant co-factor in the poverty reduction efforts. Nevertheless, with all these failure, anxieties of the incessant increase of Onchocerciasis cases in our society today were the bases of this study. This study is also designed to find out the causes, control activities and solutions to eradicate onchocerciasis within the shorted period.</p> <p><strong>1.2 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The general objectives of this research are to carry out a statistical analysis on the reported case of River Blindness (Onchocerciasis from 2000-2011 using).

The data collected for this study may or may not indicates the total number of Onchocerciasis patients but the number of its occurrences within a given locality on a specified period as they have been recorded in the hospitals record.</p> <p>        Coming to the materials like chemicals, apparatus, specimen plus other laboratory agents and catalyst, that are involved in the River blindness test or diagnosis is some how beyond the scope of this research work. Although it is necessary, but is was limited due to the statistical approach. For more information, the bibliography in chapter five of this work highlights you more in the stated field.</p> <p><strong>1.6 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>         The problems associated with the data collection are as follows</p> <p>ØThe data was not originally collected and kept for the purpose of this study. This made the researcher to spend a lot of time arranging the data in order to suit his work.</p> <p>ØThe data was only released on request, after the researcher must have gone through series of interrogations. it was difficult to collect this data due to what the officials termed confidentiality.</p> <p>ØThe transportation fare associated with the collection of the data cannot be overemphasized, plus the  unbearable altitude of the primary users</p> <p>ØThe reliability of the data is yet another problem associated with the data. However, most onchocerciasis patients at times do not report or complain to the public so that any person who hears it can forward its solution or control techniques. Thus their cases might not be recorded. Secondly ,those who made known their cases to the public sometimes may not get an answer , rather they take their cases to the native doctors, who may not brig an answer to their problems or keep record of such cases</p> <p>ØWith all these therefore this research is based on reported cases of river blindness in Ebonyi State</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Blindness:</strong> the condition of lacking visual perception due to physiological or neurological factors.</p> <p><strong>Epidemiology:</strong> the scientific study of the spread and control of diseases.</p>\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE REPORTED CASES OF ONCHOCERCIASIS (RIVER BLINDNESS) DISEASE FROM 2000-2011<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE REPORTED CASES OF ONCHOCERCIASIS (RIVER BLINDNESS) DISEASE FROM 2000-2011", "id": 23}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This research was carried out to study the effects of Industrial Training on HND I students, Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Owerri.</p> <p>The study used a primary data collected by means of mail questionnaire of 15 questions.</p> <p>A sample size of 206 students out of a population of 425 students determined by Yamani’s approach was used for this study which was selected by means of stratified random sampling.</p> <p>It was noticed from the data analysis that students strongly support Industrial Training and that the performance of HND I students depend on the Industrial Training, showing that the positive effects of the one-year Industrial Training on HND I students are greater than those of the negative effects.</p> <p>Conclusively, the research recommended some crucial matters that demand the attention of the government, the institution and the students. </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0   INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY.</strong></p> <p>It is an indisputable fact that education is a no do without in the development of a nation’s economy.

The supermarkets include Noble supermarket, Pick ‘n’ smile supermarket and Maris supermarket as a case study. We take their inventory on Candid Red Wine, So Klin Detergent (900g sachet) and Peak Milk Powder. In this research work, data for the observation were collected and analyzed using statistical inventory control models. The inventory models used here were Single item static model (with shortages not allowed) and single item static model (with shortages Allowed). These models are used to dictate shortcomings of the management and control of inventory in the supermarkets on these three goods.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>         Inventory control involves provision for a flow of goods in and out of a business organization. Inventory control improves the marketing system by checking discrepancies and enabling effective planning. It is also applied to all production activities. Therefore, inventory control is quite useful in a marketing organization. It is very important to marketing process. Considerable attention has been given in recent years to viewing manufacturing facilities as production/inventory system. The framework reorganizes the importance of inventory.</p> <p>However, it sometimes happens that the organization will find itself with more items in inventory than that maximum that is to say with an excessive inventory. The management of inventory systems typically involves keeping track of thousands of stock keeping units. Since competitive and economic advantages exist from efficient control of inventories, inventory control models have been developed to assist inventory management.</p> <p>Inventory control system is based on recorded or theoretical (not actual) stock levels to determine a set of parameters that optimize inventory control. These parameters affect both operational and financial decisions. A recorded stock level, is considered accurate when the recorded level agrees with the actual stock level, otherwise there is an error. Inaccurate inventory records may result in out-of-stock condition that lower the service level and lead to loss of goodwill production time or sales.</p> <p>The main objective of inventory control is to maintain a system which will minimize total cost and determine the optimum quantity of commodity to order for and when best to make the order. The two major systems are the “Re-order level system” and the periodic review system.</p> <p>Re-order level system: This is the most commonly used to set quantity of stock for each item. This system which is more responsive to fluctuations in demand compared with periodic review system sets the value of three important level of stock as either check or trigger for management. The three important level of stock are as follows:</p> <p>i.       Re-order level    = Maximum usage (per period) x maximum lead time.</p> <p>ii.      Minimum Level (Lmin) = Re-order level - normal usage average lead time.</p> <p>iii.     Maximum level (Lmax) = Re-order level + Economic order quantity (EOQ) – (Minimum usage x minimum lead time) where EOQ is associated with cost of ordering inventory.</p> <p>Periodic Review system: This system sets a review period for each stock item at the end of which the stock level of the item is brought up to a predetermine value. The cost would be saved and profit is increased, when many items are ordered at the same time or in the same sequence. There is little or no chance of stock becoming obsolete since it is reviewed periodically.</p> <p><strong>INVENTORY GRAPH</strong></p> <p>Inventory control can be represented graphically relatively to the information obtained during inventory control system.</p> <p> </p> <div> <p>B</p> </div><p>       </p> <div> <p>A</p> </div><p>     </p> <p> </p> <div> <p>O</p> </div><p>     </p> <p> </p> <div> <p>q1</p> </div><p>       </p> <div> <p>Q1</p> </div><p>     </p> <p>Fig. 1.1 </p> <p>                           </p> <div> <p>C</p> </div><p>                   </p> <div> <p>t2</p> </div><p>           </p> <div> <p>T</p> </div><p>         </p> <p>Inventory graph here, represents the control of the stock from the stores at a steady rate of q1 per T.

The demand may be deterministic (known with certainty) or probabilistic (described by probability density). Inventory model includes the following:</p> <p>a.      Single item static model (shortages not allowed)</p> <p>b.      Single item static model (Shortages allowed</p> <p>c.      Adapted model with gradual replenishment.</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The inventory control system has been undermined by supermarkets and other business organizations, which has created room for loss of goods or products and improper record keeping (stock keeping). As a result the following problems arise:</p> <p>1.      Lack of inventory control in the supermarkets and other business organizations.</p> <p>2.      Lack of optimum quantity of commodity to be ordered for and when best to make the order.</p> <p>3.      Improper management of stock in the supermarkets and other business organizations.</p> <p>1.3    <strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVE</strong></p> <p>         The aims and objective of the study are:</p> <p>i.            To examine the nature of stock control measures applied by the three supermarkets.</p> <p>ii.          To attempt to provide alternative strategies on effective management of stock, where necessary in the supermarkets.</p> <p>iii.        To determine the optimum quantity of commodity to order for and when best to make the order.</p> <p>iv.         To maintain a system that will minimize total cost</p> <p>1.4    <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Managing huge stock of a product is one of the most important jobs of wholesalers. A business must have enough space for storage purposes, together with a supply management system in place.</p> <p>a.      The study will help to prevent or check fraudulent activities in the business.</p> <p>b.      it will help to maintain accurate stock records</p> <p>c.      It will help in checking the expiry date management of the goods.</p> <p>d.      It will help in determine when the goods are to be replenished.</p> <p>e.      It help to determine product that is selling well and which stock of items that need to be reduced.</p> <p>1.5    <strong>SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is limited to three supermarkets in Owerri urban, Pick n’ Smile, Noble and Maris supermarkets. These are market oriented establishment and their sole operation is the purchase and resale of local and foreign products. These supermarkets are the points of sales where the demand volumes of customers are relatively high to other retailers in the markets.</p> <p>1.6    <strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>There are some terms that are used in inventory control, these includes:</p> <p>-       Lead time or Delivery lags: This is the time between the placement of an order and its receipt. Order for replenishment must be placed when inventory falls to the level of lead-time demand.</p> <p>-       Economic order quantity (EOQ): This is the external quantity ordered for which minimize total inventory cost.</p> <p>-       Safety stock: This is the stock held to cover possible change in demand or supply during the lead time. It is also known as minimum stock.</p> <p>-       Maximum stock: This is a level, as an indicator above which stock are too high.</p> <p>-       Re-order level Quantity: This is the actual stock level that when reached causes an order to be placed.</p> <p>-       Re-order quantity: This is the amount of stock that is ordered through the reorder level. It is normally the Economic order quantity or Economic basic quantity.</p> <p>-       Inventory Cycle: This is the part of an inventory graph that regularly repeats itself.</p> <p>-       Length of Inventory: This is the length of time over which an inventory cycle is extended.</p> <p><strong>Notations For The Models</strong></p> <p>D =   Demand rate (quantity demanded per period)</p> <p>Q =   Quantity ordered per cycle</p> <p>C  =  Production cost per item</p> <p>Co =  Set up cost (cost for ordering unit of item per period)</p> <p>T  =   Run time</p> <p>Ch =  Holding cost per item per unit time</p> <p>Cp =  Purchase cost per cycle</p> <p>to =   Inventory cycle length</p> <p>I =</p>\n\nINVENTORY CONTROL SYSTEM ON THREE PRODUCTS OF THREE SUPERMARKETS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INVENTORY CONTROL SYSTEM ON THREE PRODUCTS OF THREE SUPERMARKETS", "id": 25}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT </p> <p>The entire project work/study talks about the full meaning of the STDS.  The causes of the sexually transmitted diseases were found out to be virus and bacteria which can be transmitted from one person to another predominantly through sexual contact.  The scope of the study was also special and federal medical center Umuahia (FMC) was used as a case study.  One of the studies carried out by Dr. A.U.

From the available statistical data the evidence have been showing alarming rate of sexually transmitted diseases every day as mankind gets more civilized.  The sexually transmitted diseases can be categorized into three: the first category are referred to as the first category are referred to as the first generation, these are gonorrhea, syphilis, and chancroid.  The second generation includes hympho granuloma venereum and granuloma ingunale.  The third generation which is Aids  (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). These sexually transmitted disease have become a major public health problem to most countries of the world, including Nigeria on the account of their frequency, their impact on maternal and infant health and their special consequences as well as their economic cost in terms of health expenditure and cost of productivity.  It has a serious effect on pregnancy, and new borns are seriously affected which may lead to miscarriage, failure of development of new baby, blindness congenital defects etc.   The implication in woman such as pekvic inflammatory disease ectopic pregnancy, infertility and chronic ill health are caused by sexual transmitted diseases where the incidence of undiagnosed or poor treated cases is very high.  </p> <p><strong>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The disease, sexually transmitted disease (STDS) is an old strong disease that was discovered before the amalgamation of Nigeria in the year 1914 by a great medical scientist known as lordchester field, in the year 1985.  this disease has killed very many paple, yet, as at that time people doesn’t believe it, not until a good number of research work was carried out in the laboratory and evidence showed that it is a communicable disease that can be contracted from one person to another through  predominantly sexual contact; such as gonorrhea, syphilis enters the body veins through blood and weakens or makes the white blood cell known as lymphocyte inactive to attack the disease of the sexual transmitted disease and this deadly disease will dry the victim to the extent that you will be able to count the bones and extent that you will be able to count the bones and ribs of the patient.  But some people are still doubting the existence of the deadly disease STDS while statistical data table shows that 7,548 people was a victim within the year of 1985 to 1990.  But the recent data collected shows that 17,277 people were infected as it was recorded at the Federal Medical Centre Umuahia.  In addition, the above collected data will help the masses to reduce the rate of sexual act and sexual promiscuity.  The federal ministry of health warns that total abstinence and mutual fidelity remains the best protective measure for or against sexually  transmitted disease (STDS)  such as  gonorrhea, syphilis etc.  That is why the federal government supported the introduction of sex education and the use of condom as a program in most of our media, such as newspaper, radio, television etc.  In order to educate the poor masses on the subject matter and how to avoid contacting the deadly disease (STDS).</p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The rapid spreading of these deadly diseases (STDS) does not mean that both the internal and external bodies’ even corporate organizations are not working to remedy the issue.  But we should not unemphasize the problem facing the efforts. Some of this problems includes inadequate central surveillance system from which all of us will be getting the information that we carry and reply in our program, because what we get now in Nigeria is information that is fragment not reconcilable.  Even when there is seeming different, there are not other third sources of reference to cross check.  Here the problem of finance contributed to the collapse of the efforts been made.  Take for instance, the latest inhibitors introduced by Hoffmann – LaRoche of the Switzerland Eortovase and Viracept cannot be obtained by poor countries like Nigeria.</p> <p>          We know that it will sound unbelievable even at the moment to some people mainly the youths of today that kept adamant on the warnings and dangers of being a prostitute, a homosexual, a Hetero Sexual and equally having unprotected sexual intercourse.  All that the World Health Organization (WHO) had warned that partners should be truthful to themselves and take preventive measures.</p> <p><strong>1.3     AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>i.                To know how far people have known about existence of the sexually transmitted disease.</p> <p>ii.              To know whether the rate at which male are infected is the same at which the females are infected.</p> <p>iii.            To recommend preventive measures on how to avoid contacting the sexually transmitted diseases and give appropriate treatment to avoid rapid spread of the deadly disease.</p> <p>iv.            To specify the age group that is mostly affected.</p> <p>v.              Finally, the objective of this study is in picking the types of sexually transmitted diseases under study one by one and uses statistical methods predicting what their incidence rate will be in the year 2005 and 2006.</p> <p><strong>1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The study has revealed that the awareness of the existence of sexual transmitted disease.  Through this study, their causes, sources and mode of transmission have been have been highlighted.  Having known all these a greater result can be achieved by embarking on the program against sexually transmitted disease, such as making use of condom as one of the preventive measures and total abstinence as another measure.  Another important significance is that, the health standard of the people is improved, while the death effect and other consequences of sexually transmitted diseases are minimized by profiling good medical attention and the use of skilled practitioners.</p> <p>          Finally, by achieving all these goals, we can have a good social economic planning for the present and future generation.</p> <p><strong>1.5     SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS</strong></p> <p>The Federal Medical Centre Umuahia (FMC) is my scope of study.  It has ten wards (10) two medical ward on each for male and female, two surgical wards one each for male and female, two surgical wards one each for male and female, maternity wards with eighty (80) beds, one ward with forty (40) beds for booked patients while the other is for unbooked patients. Other are the pediatrics ward with twenty (20) beds and a gynecological ward with fourty (40) beds. But my area of concentration is based on the steadily increase of the sexually transmitted diseases (STDS).  And we are taking a more look at the four varieties of sexually transmitted diseases (STDS).  And we are taking a more look at the four varieties of sexually transmitted disease (STDS) such as gonorrhea, syphilis, arthritis and Aids.  This study is faced with a lot of limitations and some problems encountered din the project research must not be overlooked.  Some problems as: problem of finance, a lot of expense was made on the process of collecting the data.  Time factor is another problem that delays the collection of data.</p> <p>          In addition, the duplication of the data and the production of this project work also included.  On this note I was to study records from the year 1995 – 2002.  This further more confined to the statistical analysis only, which has to do with the incidence rate of the sexually transmitted disease under study as arranged or grouped into sex, age groups and years. There will also be some forecast or production of the type of sexually transmitted disease under study in a specifically year to come.</p> <p><strong>1.5     SCOPE AND LIMITATION</strong></p> <p>The Federal      Medical Centre Umuahia (FMC) is my scope of study.   It has

A current rate of growth. The world population as at 21 May, 2010; the human population of the world is estimated by the United State Census Bureau to be 6822, 200,000.</p> <p>Annual birth have leveled at about 134 million per year since their peak at 163 million in the late 1990’s and an expected to remain constant. However, deaths are only around 57 million per year and are expected to increase to 90 million by 2050, because births out number deaths, the world’s population are expected to reach 90 million between 2040 and 2050.</p> <p>The rapid increase in human population over the course of the 20th Century has raised concerns about whether earth is experiencing over population and scientific consensus that is the current population expansion and accompanying increases in usage of resources are linked to threats to the ecosystem. Since as rising level of atmosphere Carbon oxide, global warming and pollution.    </p> <p>Due to this pace of growth, strategies were undertaken to curb the problem. This led to the emergency of “Contraceptive” drug. Other terms commonly used includes birth control, fertility regulation, Planned Parenthood and responsive parenthood, Huge amount have been spent on family planning and family planning programs just in a bid to popularize its importance and adoption in tertiary institution. Therefore, it is expected that there is a widespread knowledge of contraceptive drug among adolescent especially female student.</p> <p>Although, the adoption of there information varies, some have interesting and positive attitude due to passive orientation while others see the usefulness and go a head to practice it. Sexual activity is particularly high among unmarried youth and those who happen to use contraceptive and those who did not use with social concern in mind but more for personal reasons such as to avoid illegitimate births.</p> <p>Contraceptive drugs should not only be seen in the view of population reduction alone but also in line with the misfortune that is associated with indiscriminate sexual intercourse. A growing population of adolescent not only initiates sexual intercourse at early stages, but also engages in having multiple sexual partners. Hence a high incidence of illegally induced abortion. In most cases, restrictions on abortion force women to rely on illegal abortion and as most young people are poor, they often use unqualified abortimist, which leads to frequent severer health consequence such as sterility and death.</p> <p>It is therefore time for the society to recognize that the health and even the lives of its young ladies must not be scarified in an attempt in an attempt to prevent their sexual activity. In most developing countries young ladies get married later and more start sex before marriage. This exposing them to the risk of unwanted pregnancy and unwanted sexually transmitted diseases (STD’s) including HIV/AIDS. In these countries 20% to 60% of young women pregnancies and births are unwanted most coming sooner than planned. These pregnancies put young women health at risk through child bearing or unsafe abortion. Increasingly, early parenthood means lost education as will as with life long loss of earnings. Evidence in Nigeria shows that induced abortion increasing and is considered to be a major cause of material mortality which quite high in Nigeria.</p> <p>The question to ask ourselves now is, has the introduction of contraceptive use in any way helped to stem the rate of unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases (STD’s) among women especially female student in the tertiary institution? The answer to this question abore is not affirmative.</p> <p><strong>1.1       BACKGROUND OF SURVEY AREA</strong></p> <p>The Osun State Polytechnic, Iree was established on 12th October, 1992. it was one of the satellite campuses of the Polytechnic Ibadan before it become an autonomous institution. Faculty of science was one of the structures inherited from the Polytechnic Ibadan before being developed to meet its present status.</p> <p>At the inception, the faculty consists of the following these departments namely;</p> <p>-               Science Laboratory Technology</p> <p>-               Computer Science  </p> <p>-               Mathematics and Statistics  </p> <p>Later Food Science and technology and Applied Science were established but very recently, the computer science department was reshuffled to another newly created faculty, the faculty of information and communication technology.</p> <p>It is however pertinent to state that faculty of science is one of the oldest faculties in the institution and its importance to the polytechnic system is undoubtfully enormous. It is robust intellectually socially and politically. Faculty of science is the oldest faculty of the six existing faculties in the institution; the faculty is playing an important role in the institution and the nation as a whole because of its contribution to academic and technological advancements. The faculty consists of five departments, namely Department of Applied science, Food science and technology, Mathematics and statistical, Micro biology and Department of science laboratory technology.</p> <p><strong>1.2       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>1.         To determine if there exists a linear correlation among the different department of faculty of science and the use of contraceptive.</p> <p>2.         To know the best method to be used between the measure of central tendency and the stratified techniques.</p> <p>3.         To test for the significant different that exists between student and the attitude towards the contraceptives use.</p> <p><strong>1.3       PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED DURING DATA COLLECTION</strong></p> <p>At the inception of this work, I envisaged little problem to arise knowing that the people deal with are highly educated ones. The major problem that was encountered was resistance from few ones to fill the questionnaire but due to a little encouragement and enlightment some saw the topic as very interesting, while some still showed embarrassment. A few numbers of respondents gave religions reason for the non-response to some questions. Some female respondents, especially some ignore at some of the questions because of their personal nature.  </p> <p>Another major problem that was encountered includes those of non-response and missing questionnaire. Having follow them up for about 4 days in their department to retrieve the questionnaire but due to carelessness on their part explained how it got miss during rush hours of classed and lecture period. Although I anticipated a 5% loss. However, many of these constraints were overcome by patience and humility on the part of the researcher to ensure that we can be sure of a reliable and scientific enterprise.</p> <p><strong>1.4       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY                 </strong></p> <p>The purpose of embanking on this project is for the benefit of the student, society, government etc. This motivated me to do work on sample survey to show that survey work is good in enumerating the number of student that is using contraceptive drugs among female student especially excerpt people that is use it in the faculty of science.</p> <p><strong>1.5       DATA COLLECTION TECHNIQUES</strong></p> <p>In eliciting for information, the method used was the questionnaire. A core comparable questions already developed and tested in the form of a questionnaire was employed.</p> <p>One hundred copies of the questionnaire were printed and administered in different department of faculty of science in the polytechnic. These included, departments of mathematics &amp; statistics, food science technology, micro biology, Applied chemistry and science laboratory technology. The distribution of the questionnaire was mostly done by the researcher himself, although with the help of two of his friends.</p> <p>The questionnaire contained 31 questions which was divided into 2 main section, personal data and knowledge or altitude of student towards contraceptive. About 13 of the questions were closed ended and 15 open ended. This was inevitable due to the nature of the research in studying their attitude toward contractive drugs. To ensure that respondents fill free to answer the question the name of the respondents was not required.</p> <p><strong>1.6       JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Contraceptive as a method or means of reducing family size is an issue that almost everybody knows about. To ensure that every grown up man and woman use it will be nothing but hyperbolizing the concept. The knowledge of contraceptive does not however lead invariably to adoption of contraception. It is therefore essential to develop effective programs that provide accurate reproductive health information and useful services to young people who have been largely left out of the family planning revolution.</p> <p>Young ladies therefore should both be guided and encouraged to postpone sex or provide them necessary effective method of contraceptive. Although many people think that providing family planning services to youth will promote promiscuity. There is no evidence for that yet. The high incidence of premarital sexuality is attributable to increasing moral attitudes and the slacking blocking of traditional requirement for premarital casualty. An ever increasing number of adolescent migrate from rural homes to urban centres in search of job opportunities for higher learning or apprenticeship, this breaking away from constraints traditionally applied by family members and village communicates, evidence from the 2009 (Nigeria Demographical Health Survey (NDHS) has not only confirmed the high incidence of premarital sexuality in urban centres but also has revealed that the incidence of premarital sexual behaviour is not limited to urban centres. These youth typically engage in sexual relations with out contemplating the dangerous consequences which include unwanted pregnancies, abortions, AID (Acquired Immunes Deficiency Syndrome) and other sexuality transmitted diseases.</p> <p>In response of these issues the International community at the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in 2009, for the trust time recognized formally that adolescent reproductive and sexual health involves a specific set of needs distinct from adult needs. The ICPD also stressed that previously health service has largely ignored young people need consequently the programme of action emphasized that young people of both sexes are typically poorly informed about how to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancies and sexuality transmitted diseases as mentioned earlier.</p> <p>Therefore, this suggests the need to provide young people with comprehensive information and access to services in the country. It is however on this bases that this research was designed to indeptly study the positive and negative attitude of students have towards the use of contraceptives drugs.</p> <p><strong>1.7       DEFINITION OF TERMS USED IN THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p><strong>Stratified Sampling:</strong> - It cab be explain as random sample, is one obtained by separately the population elements or units into non-overlapping group culled strata and then selecting a simple random sample from each stratum.  </p> <p><strong>Multiple Correlations</strong>: - This is the degree of relationship that exists between three or more variable X1 X2 X3represent the variables under consideration. Then we can let X11 X12 X13 ……. Represent or denote the values assumed by the variable X1 and X21, X22, X23 denote the value assumed by the variables X2 and so on. With this notation a sum as X21 + X22 + X23 +, +, + , + X2N could be written ∑X2.</p> <p><strong>Analysis of Variance (AWOVA)</strong>: - Another important distribution is the F-distribution, named in honour of R.A Fisher, who first developed and describe it. The random variable F is also a test statistic and is define as the ratio if unbiased estimates of two population variances i.e. F = S  / S  . The F-distribution is used for inferences of this kind. The procedure of testing for the equality of three or more means is provided by statistical techniques which represent an important application of F-distribution or Analysis of variance.</p> <p><strong>Measure of Central Tendency:</strong> - A set of data has a number of important features. If the data set consists of number we are not often interested in two characteristics of the data. The first is a number that is considered most representative of the set e.g. mean, median and mode.</p> <p><strong>Measure of Dispersion:</strong> - These measures serve to locate the “center” of the distribution but they do not reveal how the items are spread out or scattered on each side of the centre. This later characteristic of a distribution is commonly referred to as the dispersion e.g. variance, standard deviation.</p> <p><br/><br/></p>                                                         \n\nSAMPLE SURVEY ON THE USE OF CONTRACEPTIVES DRUGS AMONG FEMALE STUDENT OF FACULTY OF SCIENCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SAMPLE SURVEY ON THE USE OF CONTRACEPTIVES DRUGS AMONG FEMALE STUDENT OF FACULTY OF SCIENCE", "id": 28}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This project has the aim of studying the fertility and mortality rate in Osogbo Local Government.  The study employed the use of statistical methods like moving Average, least square and Demography analysis.  The result of the analysis shows that there is relationship between fertility and mortality.

Formally dealing only with affair of the state and this account for its name statistics.   </p> <p>The influence of statistics is now spread to manufacturing companies, agricultural sectors, bank, business communication, economic, education, political science, psychology, sociology and other numerous held of life. It’s therefore, a body of scientific method and theory of collecting, organizing, presenting and analyzing of data as well as drawing valid conclusion and making a reasonable decision.

According to (UNCTAD 2012) Nigeria received a net inflow of US$85.73. Unlike other studies this research extended the period of investigation to 2013 given that the Nigeria economic environment under investigation most likely has changed over the years.</em></p> <p><em>The research employed ordinary least square (OLS) regression technique to analyze the time series data from 1980 – 2013, GDP and CPNG where used as the dependent variable, while interest rate, balance of payment, exchange rate and foreign direct investment where used as the independent variables. The unit root test showed that all the series where stationary after their first difference, and the cointegration test showed that there exist a long run relationship between the variables. The regression results revealed a positive relationship between FDI and GDP, and as well FDI and CPNG. In conclusion the research recommends that there should be provision of adequate infrastructure and good government policies that will attract more foreign investment into the country for sustainable growth and development of the economy.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.0    <strong>Background Information</strong></p> <p>Foreign direct investment (FDI) are investments from other countries i.e (abroad), it has been described  as investment made so as to acquire lasting management interest, for example, 10% equity share in an enterprise operating in another country other than the investors country (Mwilliama, 2003 and World Bank, 2007 ). In other word, foreign direct investment implies foreign private investment. Foreign investment can be defined as the package of foreign resources comprising equity capital, reinvested earnings, or net borrowing of subsidiaries of foreign companies from their parents companies or affiliates.</p> <p>In Nigeria, FDI is defined as an investment undertaken by an enterprise that is either wholly or partly foreign owned. Foreign investment inflow, particularly foreign direct investment (FDI) is perceived to have positive impact on economic growth on the host country through various direct and indirect channels. Some of the positive impact of foreign direct investment in a country like Nigeria is in the area of employment creation, transfer of technology, increased domestic competition and other positive externalities (Anyanwala, 2007).</p> <p>FDI augments domestic investment which is crucial to the attainment of sustained economic growth and development. Nigeria is one of the greatest economies with great demand for goods and services and has attracted some FDI over the past decades. In Nigeria foreign direct investment increased from less than US$1billiion in 1990 to US$1.2 billion in 2000, US$1.9 billion in 2004, US$2.3 billion in 2005 and US$4.5 billion in 2006 according to United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD, 2007) and (CBN, 2006). As percentage of GDP, there has been a remarkable increase in FDI in recent times. The portfolio investment has also followed in the same direction, growing from US$0.2 billion in 2003 to US$0.92 billion in 2006 (UNCTAD 2007). Economic reforms and the resulting of macroeconomic stability have been adduced as reason for this, all leading to high confidence in Nigeria economy.</p> <p>According to (UNCTAD, 2012), Nigeria received a net inflow of US$85.73 billion of foreign direct investment (FDI), much of which were from Nigerians in the Diaspora. Most FDI was directed towards energy and banking sectors.</p> <p>The Nigeria Enterprise Promotion (NEP) Decree in 1972 (reviewed in 1977) was intended to reduced foreign direct investment in the Nigeria economy, this type of policy was not relevant in an economy with a rapidly growing force. Although one may accept the rationale for the promulgation of that decree, however, any exchange control policy that has the potential to discourage foreign investment will counter productivity under this present economic situation of the country. Hence the abrogation of the NEP decree was therefore a step in the right direction.</p> <p>Foreign direct investment (FDI) is arguably an important source of employment opportunities for developing countries like Nigeria; hence it is imperative that the federal government promote a healthy private sector that can earn a reasonable rate of return.</p> <p>Developing countries that wish to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow should consider measures such as establishing a transparent legal framework that does not discriminate between local and foreign investors, adopting liberal foreign regime e.g. regime without large gaps between official and market rates, creating simple investment friendly regulations and institutions and effective administering them such that the rate of FDI inflow into the country will improve appreciably.</p> <p>1.1    <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>One of the major economic problems in less developed countries (LCD) is low capital formation to finance the necessary investments for economic growth and as such there is need to analyze the impact of FDI on economic growth in Nigeria.</p> <p>Although there have been a good number of studies on foreign direct investment and economic growth in Nigeria but the existing empirical evidence on their long-run relationship has been inconclusive and as such there is no consensus among researchers in relation to the period under review, it is against this backdrop that this project work is being proposed.</p> <p>The research questions under consideration are:</p> <ol><li>What is the significant impact of FDI on Nigeria’s economic growth?</li> <li>What are the measure that could facilitate the steady inflow of FDI into the Nigeria economy?</li> <li>What is the long-term relationship between FDI and economic growth in Nigeria?</li> </ol> <p>1.2    <strong>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>The statistical technique that was employed in this study is regression analysis using time series data from 1980 – 2013.</p> <p>1.3    <strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The general objective of this work is to assess the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the economic growth of Nigeria. Other specific objectives are:</p> <ol><li>To ascertain the impact of FDI on oil and gas sector of Nigeria economy.</li> <li>To determine the impact of FDI on balance of payment and exchange rate in the Nigeria economy.</li> <li>To suggest measures for facilitating the steady inflow of FDI into Nigerian economy.</li> </ol> <p>1.4    <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The research work will be a source of information to policy makers; will broaden the knowledge of researchers as well as contribute to the existing literature on the subject matter by providing an expository analysis of the pattern of FDI in Nigeria economy. This will enhance policy formulation and also address some of our economic challenges in general. It will also be an invaluable tool for students, academics, institutions and individuals that want to know more about the relationship between foreign direct investment and economic growth.</p> <p>1.5    <strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The research work focused on the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the economic growth of Nigeria only, using time series data for a period of 34 years i.e (1980 – 2013) and FDI, GDP, BOP, and EXR as macroeconomic variable for the analysis.</p> <p>1.6    <strong>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>An academic research of this nature is bound to be constrained by a number of factors, such factors are as follows:</p> <p>i.      Financial constraint</p> <p>ii.      Time factor</p> <p>In general this study is limited in scope to Nigeria alone, as it only focuses on the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the growth of Nigeria economy, it is also limited in temporal scope to 34 years during the period of 1988 – 2013, the model estimated in this research work, made use of FDI, EXR, and BOP as the only independent variables while GDP and % of oil and gas in GDP are used as the dependent variable. If there was enough time and resources, the researcher would also examine the effect of FDI on economy of other nations of the world in other to have a cross country analysis.</p> <p>1.7    <strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>The main argument of the study here was synthesized into the following hypotheses and the analysis was carried out based on them:</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 1</strong></p> <p><strong>H0:</strong>    Foreign direct investment (FDI) has no significant impact on the growth of Nigeria economy.  </p> <p><strong>H1:</strong>   Foreign direct investment (FDI) has relative impact on the growth of the Nigeria economy.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 2</strong></p> <p><strong>H0:</strong>   The level of balance of payment (BOP) Interest rate (INTR) and exchange rate (EXR) have no significant impact on the growth of the economy.</p> <p><strong>H1:</strong>   The level of balance of payment (BOP) interest rate (INTR) and exchange rate (EXR) have relative impact on the development of the Nigerian economy.</p> <p>1.8    <strong>Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>1.8.1 <strong>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI):</strong> Foreign direct investment is described as investment made so as to acquire lasting management interest for example 10% equity share in an enterprise operating in another country other than the investors country (Mwilliama, 2003).</p> <p>1.7.2 <strong>Gross Domestic Product (GDP):</strong> Gross domestic product is the total value of all final goods and services produced in a country in a given year.</p> <p>1.7.3 <strong>Balance of Payment (BOP):</strong> It is a record of transaction between residents of a country and the rest of the world.</p> <p>1.7.4 <strong>Exchange Rate (EXR):</strong> It is the charge for exchanging currency of one country for the currency of another.</p> <p>1.7.4 <strong>Interest Rate (INTR): </strong>Interest rate is the rate at which interest is paid by borrowers (debtors) for the use of money that they borrow from lenders (creditors).</p>\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) ON NIGERIA’S ECONOMIC GROWTH (1980 – 2012)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) ON NIGERIA’S ECONOMIC GROWTH (1980 – 2012)", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The usefulness of statistical tools for analysis has become invaluable in recent years. Nowadays, it has become an indispensable tool of investigation and research in virtually every day of human activities. Most statistical analysis methods are concerned with making inference from the observed data.  That is, drawing valid conclusion using sample information.</p> <p><strong>1.1             BACKGROUND INFORMATION</strong></p> <p>The small and medium enterprises development of Nigeria (SMEDAN) is a major structure designed to provide institutional support for Small and Medium scale industries. It was established in Nigeria in 2003.</p> <p><strong>Responsibilities of SMEDAN </strong></p> <ul><li>Initiating and articulating ideas for SME’s policy thrust</li> <li>Overseeing, monitoring and co-coordinating the development of the SME sector.</li> <li> Promoting and providing access to industrial infrastructure such as layouts.</li> <li> Policy development.</li> </ul> <p>The dearth and paucity of credible and reliable MSME database is one of the main constraints to evolving a strategic action plan towards an efficient and sustainable MSME sector.</p> <p>This survey conducted by the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency Of Nigeria in collaboration with National Bureau Of Statistics covers business enterprises in Nigeria employing below 200 persons (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises). The survey was conducted in all the 36 States of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The pre-test was conducted in Lagos and Kano states. For micro enterprises (employing 1-9 persons) data were canvassed through the National Integrated Survey of Household (NISH) Schedule. Also rural and urban areas where small (employing 10-49 persons) and medium (employing 50-199 persons) enterprises are located were covered through the National Integrated Survey of Establishment (NISE) Module.</p> <p>Thirty Enumeration Areas comprising of 3 replicates in which each replicates contain 10 Enumeration Areas were selected per state and FCT, Abuja. These replicates are subsets of twenty (20) with each state of the Federation and FCT, Abuja having Ten micro enterprises which were systematically selected per Enumeration, Area making a total of 300 micro enterprises visited in each state and FCT, Abuja.</p> <p><strong>1.2             STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong></p> <p><strong>The research question from the above experience is thus</strong>; with the enumerated benefits of SMEDAN, has it contributed significantly to the small and medium scale entrepreneurs across the 36 states? This is to checkmate their contribute to the economic growth in Nigeria?</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY. </strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study is to apply statistical techniques in examining the benefit of Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) on entrepreneurs across 36 states. This is in order to ascertain how small and medium scale enterprises have contributed using the available services which SMEDAN has made available with a view to achieve gradual formalization in the quest for National Economic growth. Meanwhile, the specific objectives are:</p> <p>a. To determine the level of benefit from SMEDAN services across the Nigerian states.</p> <p>b. To examine the effect of poor financing/monitoring of small and medium scale enterprises on the Nigerian State.</p> <p>c. To suggest possible measures that will aid the growth of MSMEs in rural/urban areas.</p> <p><strong>1.4 STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS. </strong></p> <p>For the purpose of this study, the research developed the following hypothesis.</p> <p>H0: There is no significant difference in the level of benefit from SMEDAN  services to entrepreneurs in the Nigerian states.</p> <p>H1:  There is a significant difference in the level of benefit from SMEDAN  services to entrepreneurs in Nigerian states.  </p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>The significance of the study is to establish an extent of growth and development and to expose the immense benefit derivable from small and medium scale industries.</p> <p>Also, this study will help to redress the belief of the society that small and medium scale industries can bring about economic and development in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6     SCOPE OF THE STUDY. </strong></p> <p>The study will broaden the knowledge of the researcher as well as contribute to the existing literature on the subject matter, by providing an expository analysis of the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency Of Nigeria (SMEDAN) and its benefit as a Government institution to the economic growth of Nigeria. This will in turn enhance policy formation in the country as well as address economic challenges of MSMEs in general.</p> <p>It will also be an individual tool for students, academic institutions and individuals who wish to know more about the roles, contributions and benefits of SMEDAN on the Nigeria economy in the 36 states of the federation.  This project is not beyond the data collected from the National Bureau Of Statistics.</p> <p><strong>1.7     DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>SME           - Small and medium enterprise</p> <p>SMEDAN   -Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency of Nigeria</p> <p>MSME        -Micro,hhhhhh Small and Medium Enterprise</p> <p>NBS            -National Bureau of Statistics</p> <p>NISH          -National Integrated Survey of Household</p> <p>NISE           -National Integrated Survey of Establishment</p> <p>EA              -Enumeration Area</p> <p>SMIDA       -Small and Medium Industry Development Agency</p> <p>NERFUND -National Economic Reconstruction Fund</p> <p>NEXIM       -Nigerian Export Import Bank</p> <p>BSCs          -Business Support Centres</p> <p>BICs           -Business Information Centres</p> <p>NOTAP      -National Office for Technology Acquisition Promotion</p> <p>NEPC          -National Export Promotion Council</p>\n\nAPPLICATION OF STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES IN EXAMINING THE BENEFIT OF SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY OF NIGERIA (SMEDAN) ON ENTREPRENEURS ACROSS 36 STATES OF NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " APPLICATION OF STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES IN EXAMINING THE BENEFIT OF SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY OF NIGERIA (SMEDAN) ON ENTREPRENEURS ACROSS 36 STATES OF NIGERIA", "id": 31}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT<br/></strong></p> <p>This study examined the birth pattern in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) using the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital (UATH) as a case study. Data was collected on two hundred (200) neonates from the hospital. The research studied the effect of some factors on  birth weight of neonates, the factors includes the age of the mother, parity, mother’s height, gestation period and mother’s weight at gestation. A regression model was also estimated which was used to forecast. The study showed that the gestation period has a positive linear relationship with the birth weight judging by the correlation value between the two variables at 0.434. The birth weight of a child also showed dependency on the weight of the mother at gestation. The forecast generated also showed that an increment in the gestational period of a child brings about an increase in birth weight and same thing goes for the maternal weight. Based on the outcome of the research, it was recommended that the government should try to create awareness for the Nigeria populace especially the expectant mothers to visit the maternity homes more often for pre-natal and ante-natal care.</p> <p> <strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0     BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In 1948, the first World Health Assembly adopted an international definition of prematurity as birth weight of 2.5kilograms or less (UN (2004)). It was however discovered that in developing countries the use of this standard resulted in an unusually high proportion of `premature' babies most of who were not born prematurely (Yilgwanet.al. ,2004). The World Health Organization (WHO) in 1994 then conducted a study on eighteen different countries at different stages of development. This revealed that babies could be classified into three main groups based on their birth weight and gestational age: Small for gestational age, appropriate for age, large for age. Low birth weight was then defined as those babies weighing less than 2.5kilograms within twenty four hours of birth. This group of babies can either be small for age or appropriate for age and they are usually at high risk of dying in their first twenty eight days of life from factors like hypoglycaemia, sepsis, respiratory distress, prematurity etc. In Nigeria, neonatal death (death of an infant in the first twenty eight days of live) contributes about 25% of the total infant mortality with prematurity and low birth weight being the main contributor to these high neonatal deaths(Grange, 2006).</p> <p>A reduction of at least one-third in the proportion of infants with low birth weight is one of the seven major goals for the current decade of the “A World Fit for Children” programme of the United Nations. Moreover, nutritional deprivation — the major determinant of low birth weight — is a clear obstacle to the attainment of many of the Millennium Development Goals. Monitoring improvements in low birth weight is thus being given high priority within the UN system, as well as by national governments and the international nutrition community.</p> <p>Although the significance and interpretation of low birth weight has recently been debated, most experts agree that weight at birth is an indicator of a new born's chances for survival, growth, long-term health and psychosocial development. Babies whose birth weight is low as a result of undernourishment face a greatly increased risk of death during their first months and years of life (Bale et.al.,2003, UN, 2000, Allen &amp; Gillespie, 2001). The evidence also suggests that those children who do survive may be more likely to experience health problems throughout their lives; these include impaired cognitive development, as well as diabetes and coronary heart disease in adulthood (Bhargavaet.al., 2004, Barker, 2003). Low birth weight in developing countries occurs primarily because of poor maternal health and nutrition. A variety of socioeconomic, medical, and psychosocial factors are known to increase the risk of low birth weight, but prevention programs aimed at primarily high-risk subgroups have been largely ineffective.</p> <p>In addition, diseases such as diarrhoea, malaria and respiratory infections, which are common in many developing countries, can significantly impair foetal growth when women become infected during pregnancy (Bale et.al.2003, UN 2000). In Nigeria just like in many developing countries, low birth weight is a significant contributor to the overall infant mortality rate and a major factor in the high neonatal mortality rate currently seen.</p> <p>This research work however seeks to check for the dependence of birth weight on some factors which may affect it such as parity, maternal height, maternal age, gestation period, and gestation weight using the Chi-Square test of independence, regression analysis to see possible statistical relationships if any exists among the variables in question.</p> <p><strong>1.1     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This current study will be conducted with the sole aim of assessing the impact of:</p> <p>                               i.            Birth-weight on maternal age</p> <p>                             ii.            Birth-weight on Parity</p> <p>                          iii.            Birth weight on Gestational age</p> <p>                           iv.            Birth-weight on Maternal weight</p> <p>                             v.            Birth weight on Maternal height</p> <p>                           vi.            And finally, to estimate a model which will be able to predict an infant’s birth weight from afore mentioned factors.</p> <p><strong>1.2     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work explores the dependency of child’s birth weight on some factors which may affect it, therefore it will be significant to medical practitioners, maternity specialists and potential parents. It will also be of great benefits to future researchers who wish to explore issues concerning birth weight of a child.</p> <p><strong>1.3     SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The prevalence of low birth weight in Nigeria has been put previously at 16%, 9% and 12% (UNICEF 2001, 2003). Every single day, Nigeria loses about 2,300 under-five year olds. This may be associated with the incidence of low birth weight in the country, thus making the country the second largest contributor to under-five mortality in the whole world (UNICEF, 2008).</p> <p>Hence, the importance of this study cannot be overemphasized; this research paper seeks to investigate some factors which may affect the birth weight from the statistical perspective.</p> <p>This research is however limited to data obtained from the University of Abuja teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada, Abuja.</p> <p><strong>1.4     DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <ul><li>Neonates: This refers to an infant in its first twenty eight (28) days or less than a month.</li> <li>Birth Weight: This is the body weight of a baby at birth or just after birth.</li> <li>Gestation Period: this is the time in which the foetus develops in the womb, beginning at fertilization and ending at birth</li> <li>Preterm Birth: This is the birth of a baby of less than 37 weeks gestationa age.</li> <li>Posterm: This is a pregnancy that extends to 42 weeks and above.</li> <li>Premature Birth: this is the birth of a baby before the developing organs are mature enough to allow normal postnatal survival.</li> <li>Mortality: This is the state of being mortal or being susceptible to birth.</li> <li>Parity: This is the state of having borne off springs or the number of times a female has given birth.</li> <li>Morbidity: This is an incidence of ill health, or the rate at which a person falls ill.</li> </ul>\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF BIRTH PATTERN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF BIRTH PATTERN", "id": 32}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE<br/> 1.1 INTRODUCTION </p> <p> Education is an instrument for developing the nation. It is also an instrument for developing hidden talents in an individual. It is the only means of eliminating illiteracy in any society. The importance of education to the development of individual and the national cannot be over emphasized. It is a great investment any country can make for accelerating development of its technology, economic and human resources. Isife and Ogakwe (2012) explained that education is a powerful tool or weapon that can be used to eradicate ignorance, poverty, diseases and produce individual that can function effectively in the society. Onwuka (2012) pointed out that education is the instrument that is used to free people from incapacitation and exclusion. When an individual is freed from incapacitation and exclusion or illiteracy, there is usually a change in that person’s behavior. This change influences the person’s attitude and his whole life (Apebende, 2013).</p> <p>In a bid to achieve a paradigm shift in the country’s educational system, The Federal Polytechnic Statue enacted Decree No. 33 of 1979 as amended by Decree No. 5 of 1993, to give legal basis for the establishment of Federal Polytechnics in Nigeria. The principal aim for the establishment of Polytechnics in Nigeria is to turnout the middle-level manpower needed for industrial and technological development of the country. <br/> No meaningful national development could be achieved by any nation without sound and qualitative technical education. <br/> No wonder, Prof. Uba Nwuba, one time Rector, Federal Polytechnic, Oko posited that the bedrock of technical emancipation for Nigeria is centred on Polytechnics education. Polytechnics offer highly technical, scientific as well as research-oriented education to students. It is disheartening to observe today that these citadels of learning which were once cynosure of all eyes in developed economies of the world, has been relegated to the background in Nigeria. Nearly all the State-owned Polytechnics are just a little above the secondary school level, infrastructural wise, due to lack of adequate funding by successive administrations. Most Nigerian Polytechnics are synonymous with structural decay occasioned by neglect and misplaced priority on the part of the government on one hand and society on the other. </p> <p>1.2 BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/></p> <p>Drop out of school among polytechnic students means Basic technology students withdrawing from school before graduation due to some factors. Hornby (2000) explained drop out of school as a process whereby a person leaves school before he completes the study. He went further to define drop out of school as a situation by which a person rejects the ideas and way of behaving that are accepted by the rest of the society. United Nation Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) (2008) said that drop out of school is those who could not complete a particular level of schooling. Similarly, a school dropout is a learner who discontinues from school at any level of the educational process. The research seeks to investigate the statistical analysis on the rate of student withdrawal in polytechnic.</p> <p>1.3  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/></p> <p>The principal aim for the establishment of Polytechnics in Nigeria is to turnout the middle-level manpower needed for industrial and technological development of the country. <br/> No meaningful national development could be achieved by any nation without sound and qualitative technical education. <br/> No wonder, Prof. Uba Nwuba, one time Rector, Federal Polytechnic, Oko posited that the bedrock of technical emancipation for Nigeria is centred on Polytechnics education.

The continuous road traffic congestion in Nigerian cities especially in Lagos which started from the 1980s immediately after Udeoji award which enhanced household income and resulted to increased desire for both private and commercial vehicle ownership is intensifying on daily basis. The daily movement of people in Nigerian cities is becoming more difficult and complex.<br/> Lagos state being the most populated state in Nigeria according to the national population commission has been engulfed in traffic congestion this may be due to population explosion and urban migration which has increased the pressure on the available infrastructure. This is reflected in the increasing bumper-to-bumper traffic being experienced in the major cities during the morning (7:00am – 9:00am) and afternoon (3:00pm – 6:00pm) peak hours (Okpala, 1981:46). In some cases, such as in Lagos, road traffic congestion is being experienced throughout the day from 8:00am – 9:00pm which can even extend into the dead of the night on occasions. In Lagos state especially, it is not uncommon for commuters to spend more than two hours enroute to work, school, market, hospital etc. or back home even when to and fro distance is not much. According to Okpala (1998: 23), the situation has become so common that it even appears that traffic hold-ups are becoming acceptable excuses for late attendance to work or even formal and informal meetings. This malady in most of the Nigerian cities has been causing people a lot of concern (Oyefesobi, 1981:35). It is posing formidable challenges to both state governments, Local government Councils, researchers and particularly the city residents.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>The search for an enduring solution to the traffic problems will necessarily commence with thorough investigation that will unveil the factors responsible for such problems.

In adequately studying economic growth and development, a lot of predictors or determinants must be studied as well to have a comprehensive grip on the socio economic development of the nation. Two cardinal factors that may influence the socio economic development of any nation, Nigeria inclusive are the birth and death rates. The performance of the economy of any nation to a very large extent hinges on these two factors. Increased or decreased birth or death rates have its implications on the socio economic development of a country. Countries that want to be wealthy must not joke or toil with the study of birth and death rates in relationship to their economy.</p> <p>The birth rate; in Nigeria was last measured at 41.24 in 2013, according to the World Bank. Crude birth rate indicates the number of live births occurring during the year, per 1,000 populations estimated at midyear or quarterly. Subtracting the death rate from the birth rate provides the rate of natural increase, which is equal to the rate of population change in the absence of migration.</p> <p>The birth rate (technically, births/population rate) is the total number of live births per 1,000 of a population in a year. The rate of births in a population is calculated in several ways: live births from a universal registration system for births, deaths, and marriages; population counts from a census, and estimation through specialized demographic techniques. The birth rate (along with mortality and migration rate) is used to calculate population and economic growth. In 2012 the average global birth rate was 19.15 births per 1,000 total populations, compared to 20.09 per 1,000 total populations in 2007. The raw birth rate is 4.3 births/second for the world (2014 EST).</p> <p>Death rate can be said to be the ratio of total deaths to total population in a specified community or area over a specified period of time. The death rate is often expressed as the number of deaths per 1,000 of the population per year.</p> <p>It can also be said to be a measure of the number of deaths (in general, or due to a specific cause) in a particular population, scaled to the size of that population, per unit of time. Mortality rate is typically expressed in units of deaths per 1,000 individuals per year; thus, a mortality rate of 9.5 (out of 1,000) in a population of 1,000 would mean 9.5 deaths per year in that entire population, or 0.95% out of the total. It is distinct from the so-called “morbidity rate” (a vague term sometimes used to refer to either the prevalence or incidence of a disease), and also from the incidence rate (the number of newly appearing cases of the disease per unit of time).</p> <p>Ordinarily speaking, we can say that birth rate can be a number that shows how many people died in a particular place or during a particular time or the number of deaths from a specific cause in a particular area during a particular time period.</p> <p>1.2  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>The performance inconsistency of the economy of Nigeria has led us to this research. Nigeria’s economy may have over the period neglected these two important factors in being able to predict the economy in the coming years. Lack of proper documentation of the birth and death rate in Nigeria which has led to the inadequate economic planning has also been a major problem confronting Nigeria.</p> <p>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The main objective of the study is to examine the impact of birth rate and death rate on Nigeria’s Economy. The specific objectives are as follows:</p> <ol><li>To know if there is a relationship between birth rate and the economy of Nigeria.</li> <li>To know if there is a relationship between death rate and the economy of Nigeria.</li> </ol> <ul><li>To predict the economy of Nigeria using the birth and death rates.</li> </ul> <ol><li>To know the nature of the relationship that exists amongst birth rate, death rate and the economy of Nigeria.</li> </ol> <p>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <ol><li>Is there any relationship between birth rate and the economy of Nigeria?</li> <li>Does any relationship exist between death rate and the economy of Nigeria?</li> </ol> <ul><li>Can the economy of the Nigeria be predicted using the birth and death rates?</li> </ul> <ol><li>To know the nature of the relationship that exists amongst birth rate, death rate and the economy of Nigeria.</li> </ol> <p>1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</p> <p>H01: There is no relationship between birth rate and the economy of Nigeria.</p> <p>HI1: There is a relationship between birth rate and the economy of Nigeria.</p> <p>H02: There is no relationship between death rate and the economy of Nigeria.</p> <p>HI2: There is a relationship between death rate and the economy of Nigeria.</p> <p>H03: There is no relationship between death rate, birth rate and the economy of Nigeria.</p> <p>HI3: There is a relationship between death rate, birth rate and the economy of Nigeria.</p> <p>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The significance of this study is to educate researchers firms, hospitals, families and other related organizations on the need to ensure adequate documentation of the birth and death rates as it helps in effective economic planning of Nigeria.</p> <p>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This study is restricted to the impact of birth and death rates on the socio economic development of  Nigeria with reference to Braithwaite Memorial Hospital (BMH) Port Harcourt, Rivers State.</p> <p>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>Birth rate: The number of births every year for every 1000 people in the population of a place.</p> <p>Death rate: The number of deaths every year for every 1000 people in the population of a place.</p> <p>Economy: The relationship between production, trade and the supply of money in a particular country or region.</p>\n\nSTATISITICAL ANALYSIS ON THE IMPACT OF BIRTH AND DEATH RATE ON NIGERIA ECONOMY FROM 2000-2015<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STATISITICAL ANALYSIS ON THE IMPACT OF BIRTH AND DEATH RATE ON NIGERIA ECONOMY FROM 2000-2015", "id": 35}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Crime is any act that is contrary to the law, which can lead one to punish accordingly.  Nigeria is a country where things work on a reversible order. Some crimes are punishable by law, depend on the country. In our state (Enugu) to be precisely, some offences like cheating, rigging of election, stealing, advance free frauds (419), and many more are tend to be in reverse other.Any citizen that fall under crime may be punish depend on how the state used to punish their offenders, due to neglection. The rate of crime in Nigeria is a nagging one, such that it will be difficult to known the real criminals. However the word crime compasses the acts which are contrary to the law and the principle of National Justice, since the society has streamline crime to only armed robbery.</p> <ol><li>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</li> </ol> <p>It is the reported case of crime committed in the country, recorded.

Growth is positively affected by the stock of infrastructure assets of all the development that has taken place in Nigeria since political independence, perhaps none has been more striking and indeed more fascinating than that in the area of infrastructures process of Nigeria.</p> <p>In the view, it beat observers imagination that decades after Nigeria self rule or political freedom from Britain, the government and its people still battle with twin problems of finding infrastructural development and imminent decay that set in soon after they are commissioned for use.</p> <p>In most countries of the world especially the less developed countries, there exist varying degree of economic inequalities while the urban area benefit and indeed show the presence of political administration, infrastructural facilities, high rate of poverty, ignorance, diseases, huger arising from economic neglect rural urban migration. There is no gain saying that the rural areas have enough infrastructural facilities.</p> <p>Infrastructures are basic essential, service that should be put in a place to enable development to occur. Socio-economic development can be facilitated and accelerated at all levels in Nigeria by the presence of social and economic infrastructures. The neglect of socio-economic development had led the country to heart acting poverty which has increased poverty rate.</p> <p>According to Busari Ayansola (2012), if socio-economic infrastructures are not in place, development will be very difficult and infant can liken a very scarce commodity that can only be secured at a very high price and cost.</p> <p>The development of rural areas entails adequate provision of infrastructure. Because higher productivity and competitiveness requires higher level of infrastructural provision, development is driven by infrastructural provision, for eradication of problems of poverty, frustration, ignorance, diseases, crimes and rural urban migration which dominates rural areas. Successive administrations have in one way or the other made some concerted effort towards infrastructural development in the rural areas to solve the domestic socio-economic problems which have reflected in the main objectives of the rural development in Nigeria.</p> <p>It is clear that infrastructural development cannot be neglected in the socio-economic development of Khana Local Government Area. To prove the standard of living and it improve on their facilities.</p> <p>Angaye (1995), states that development should be seen as improvement in the mental, physical, spiritual materials and more qualities of life, resulting from real income provision of food, shelter, education and reduction of poverty.</p> <p>Base on the fact that infrastructure has developed a greater quantum in development of the nation, the research developed interest in ascertaining the effects of poor infrastructural facilities on the socio-economic development of Khana Local Government Area.<br/><br/></p> <p>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>Today, poor infrastructural facilities are identified as a problem. It is important to know that most of the poor people live in the rural areas including Khana Local Government Area which is characterized by lack or poor infrastructural facilities such as electricity and good road, portable drinking water, good communication system, health centres, leisure parks and so on. The absence of the facilities makes life miserable and unattractive in rural areas. There is massive rural-urban migration, mass death and increased diseases of kind because of non – provision of facilities and the consequences is low productivity and therefore hinders socio-economic development.</p> <p>Due to lack of transportation and means of communication, sources of income like weaving of mat, fishing, carving and tools making, taping, poultry and small scale business which if pursued in the earnest could form the corner stone of mini-industries in the rural areas have suffered. The craft trades and farming are left in the hand of the old and weak who lacks the capacity skills and energy to turn them into the resource revenue earning.</p> <p>Poor Health Centres, leisure parks has also increased mortality rate, depression, poor health, emotional imbalance which reduces life span.</p> <p>Due to poor infrastructural, development have affected other sectors of Nigeria economics like political, medical, education and agricultural sector.</p> <p>There are no enough infrastructural facilities in Khana Local Government Area, no more significant effort has been made by Government, voluntary agencies and concerned citizens to provide much needed infrastructure in most rural area in Nigeria.<br/><br/></p> <p>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The study seeks to determine the effect of poor infrastructural facilities on socio-economic development of Khana Local Government Area. In pursuant to this goal, the specific objectives of this study are to determine.</p> <p>       The role infrastructural facilities play on the socio-economic development.</p> <p>       The effort by the government in the provision of infrastructural facilities in Khana Local Government Area.</p> <p>       The effects of poor infrastructural facilities on the socio-economic development of Khana Local Government Area.<br/><br/></p> <p>1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>       The importance of the research study cannot be overemphasized. Hence the study is carried out in other than the result of it will serve as reference point to the future researchers who can have access to it.</p> <p>       It will also avail accessible sociologist, rural planners Non Governmental organization, opportunity of appreciating the likely enormous contributions of rural area to the overall development of the society.</p> <p>       The study will enable us know the need (importance) of infrastructural facilities in the socio-economic life of our people especially Khana Local Government Area.</p> <p>       The study will also create awareness of the effects as a result of poor facilities in Khana Local Government Area.<br/><br/></p> <p>1.5     SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This study covered Khana Local Government Area in Rivers State and focus on the effect of poor infrastructural facilities on socio-economic development of Khana Local Government Area.</p> <p>It content, the work of limited to poor infrastructural facilities in the rural areas, particularly in Khana Local Government Area. It is a view of the consequences of non availability of infrastructural facilities in the Local Government Area that motivated the researcher to develop interest in this research topic.<br/><br/></p> <p>1.6     RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>There are questions raised by the researcher expecting the answers to such questions which lead to the solution of the research study (Uwazie, 2008), based on the above view, this study raised the following research question to guide the study.</p> <p>       What are the infrastructural facilities needed for the socio-development of Khana Local Government Area?</p> <p>       What are the effects of poor infrastructural facilities of Khana Local Government Area?</p> <p>       What is the role of infrastructural facilities in socio-economic development of Khana Local Government Area?</p>                                                         \n\nTHE EFFECTS OF POOR INFRASTRUCTURAL FACILITIES ON SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECTS OF POOR INFRASTRUCTURAL FACILITIES ON SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT", "id": 37}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This research work is aimed at establishing and testing for existing relationship between the Nigerian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the indicators of the Nigerian Stock Market.

In the mid- 1970s it became a major political issue with regard to the use of CFCs in aerosol spray cans, and in 1978 the United States banned the nonessential use of CFCs as aerosol propellants. Efforts at ne¬gotiating an international agreement controlling CFC use began in the 1980s and culminated in the 1987 Montreal Protocol. This paper traces the evolution of policy responses to stratospheric ozone de¬pletion. The evolution of stratospheric ozone depletion policy can best be understood as a two-stage process. The first stage involves the emergence of stratospheric ozone depletion as a domestic issue in the United States and several other countries in the 1970s, while the second stage focuses on its transformation to an international issue in the 1980s. In addition to the emergence of stratospheric ozone depletion as an international political issue, three other factors are important in understanding the sources of the Montreal Protocol: (/) the evolving scientific understanding of the problem, (2) increas¬ing public concern over the problem based on the threat of skin cancer and the discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole, and (3) the availability of acceptable substitutes for CFCs.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>Representatives from 24 nations, meeting in Montreal in September 1987, signed the \"Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer,\"1 an international agreement designed to reduce the world¬wide production and use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). This protocol is the result of years of negotiation fostered by the United Nations En¬vironment Programme (UNEP) among the major CFC producing coun¬tries. Its formulation was a response to a growing international consensus on the need to protect stratospheric ozone from depletion by CFCs. The Montreal Protocol is a landmark agreement in that it is the first inter¬national treaty for mitigating a global atmospheric problem before serious environmental impacts have been conclusively detected. As such, the Montreal Protocol has stirred much interest, and both scientists and pol¬icymakers have suggested that it can be used as a model for international agreements on other global environmentalproblems, especially the prob¬lem of CO2 and trace-gas induced global warming.<br/>Before such a comparison to other environmental problems can be made, however, it is useful to understand the Montreal Protocol in its historical and political context. Depletion of stratospheric ozone is an example of both the complicated and the global nature of contemporary environmental problems, and the Montreal Protocol shows that innovative approaches to such global environmental problems are possible. During the past two decades concern over stratospheric ozone has evolved from a fringe environmental issue to a major policy issue of national and international importance. An analysis of this evolution is important for understanding both the value of the Montreal Protocol and its implications for other global atmospheric problems.<br/>The evolution of stratospheric ozone policy can be understood as a two-stage process: (1) the development of domestic regulations controlling CFC use in aerosol spray cans in the United States and several other countries in the mid- and late-1970s, and (II) the development of an international policy response to the problem of global stratospheric ozone depletion in the 1980s. These are not separate issues. The development of an international response clearly followed from the concern raised in the United States, Canada, Sweden, and other countries which had taken unilateral action to control CFCs in the 1970s. However, many important differences between stage 1 and II make this distinction a useful tool for analysis. I argue that four key factors are important in understanding the evolution of stratospheric ozone policy: (1) the recognition that ozone depletion is a global problem requiring an international response; (2) the evolving scientific understanding of stratospheric ozone depletion and its influence on policymakers; (3) increasing public concern based on the threat of skin cancer and the perception of the potential for global catas¬trophe associated with the discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole; and (4) the availability of acceptable substitutes for CFCs.<br/>This paper analyzes the evolution of stratospheric ozone policy. The first section reviews the science behind the problem of CFC-induced stratospheric ozone depletion. The next two sections discuss the emerg¬ence of stratospheric ozone depletion as a national political issue in the United States during stage I, and its evolution to an international political issue during stage II. This is followed by a discussion of how the evolving scientific understanding of the problem, the catastrophic nature of the risks, and the availability of alternatives to CFCs influenced the final negotiations on an international agreement. The last section examines the Montreal Protocol and discusses its prospects for success.<br/>CFCs AND THE OZONE LAYER<br/>Chlorofluorocarbons are a group of inert, nontoxic, and nonflammable synthetic chemical compounds used as aerosol propellants, in refrigeration and air conditioning, in plastic foams for insulation and packaging, and as solvents for cleaning electrical components. There are many varieties of CFCs; CFC-11 and -12 are the most common compounds and CFC- 113 has important industrial applications as a solvent. Production of CFCs has increased significantly since the 1960s, reaching a peak in 1974 before declining as a result of the decreasing use of CFCs as aerosol propellants. However, nonaerosol use continued to increase and by the mid-1980s CFC production again reached mid-1970 levels (see Figure 1). Atmo-<br/>spheric concentrations of CFC have also been increasing (see Figure 2). Once in the atmosphere, CFCs have a lifetime of about 100 years. It is this long lifetime that is the root of the problem with CFCs.<br/>Initially, it was believed that these compounds were environmentally safe, but in the early 1970s independent research efforts pointed to a potentially serious problem connecting CFCs with stratospheric ozone depletion. Molina and Rowland first suggested that CFCs might play a role in depleting ozone in the stratosphere, the region of the atmosphere at altitudes from about 12 to 50 km. Ozone (03) in the stratosphere (commonly referred to as the ozone layer) shields the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Molina and Rowland's theory suggested that CFCs diffuse upward into the stratosphere, where they are broken down by ultraviolet radiation, releasing free chlorine which reacts catalytically with ozone and results in its significant depletion. Recent research continues to point to the role of CFCs in depleting stratospheric ozone. In addition, other synthetic chemicals have been identified as potential stratospheric ozone depleters: most notable are the halons used in fire extinguishers.The stratospheric ozone layer shields the earth from harmful UV-B radiation. An increase in the amount of UV-B radiation reaching the surface of the earth could have significant negative effects on human health, plants, and aquatic ecosystems. The most significant human health effect is an increase in the incidence of skin cancer. The U.S. Environ¬mental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that a one percent decrease in ozone could result in a two percent increase in UV-B, and a one percent increase in UV-B could result in a two to five percent increase in the rate of non-melanoma skin cancers.® In addition, increased UV-B may also result in an increase in the rarer but more deadly malignant melanoma skin cancers. The EPA has estimated that if CFC use continues to grow at 2.5 percent a year until 2050, an additional 150 million skin cancer cases could result, causing more than 3 million deaths in the U.S. pop¬ulation born before 2075. Other potential health effects include suppres¬sion of the immune system leading to a higher incidence of some infectious diseases, and eye disorders such as cataracts or retinal damage.\" Table 1 summarizes the potential human health effects of increased UV-B ra¬diation. Research also suggests that increased UV-B radiation could result in decreased crop production, and change in the species composition of natural aquatic ecosystems resulting in more unstable ecosystems.<br/>In addition, CFCs are also an effective greenhouse gas in the lower atmosphere. Recent assessments conclude that, together, greenhouse<br/>TABLE 1.Effects of Ultraviolet Radiation on Human Health.<br/>Acute Sunburn<br/>Thickening of the skin<br/>Chronic<br/>Aging of skin, thinning of epidermis<br/>Carcinogenic<br/>Nonmelanoma skin cancer Basal cell carcinoma Squamous cell carcinoma Malignant melanoma<br/>Eye disorders Cataracts (probable relationship) Retinal damage Cornealtumors<br/>Acute photokeratitis (\"snow blindness\")<br/>Immunosuppression (possible) Infectious diseases of the skin (e.g., Herpes simplex)<br/>Conditions aggravated by UV exposure Genetic sensitivity to sun-induced cancers Nutritional deficiences (kwashiorkor, pellagra) Infectious diseases (e.g., Herpes simplex)<br/>Autoimmune disorders (e.g., lupus erythematosus)    <br/>Source: Emmett, Health Effects of Ultraviolet Radiation, Effects of Changes in Strato¬spheric Ozone and Global Climate (J.

Of these other trace gases, CFCs are a significant contributor to the greenhouse effect. Table 2 lists the key greenhouse gases and their current rate of increase. Given the present rate of increase of all greenhouse gases, the radiative equivalent of a doubling of C02 (an average global warming of 1.5-4.5 degrees C) could be reached by<br/>TABLE 2.Important Greenhouse Trace Gases and Their Rate of Increase.<br/>Gas    Concentration    Rate of Increase<br/>Carbon dioxide    345 ppm    0.4% per yr.<br/>Methane    1.65 ppm    1.1% per yr.<br/>Nitrous oxide    305 ppb    0.2% per yr.<br/>CFC-11    220 ppt    5% per yr.<br/>CFC-12    380 ppt    5% per yr.<br/> Source: NRC, Current Issues in Atmospheric Change (1987).<br/> as early as 2030. Any action taken to control CFCs in order to protect the ozone layer also acts to contain global wanning.<br/>Of recent concern has been the appearance of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica during the spring. In 1985, a team of British researchers, using data from the British station at Halley Bay, reported that a massive reduction in the concentration of ozone was occurring over Antarctica during September and October. Data from 1984 indicated as much as a 40 percent loss of ozone as compared to measurements taken 20 years earlier. Satellite data supported these findings and indicated substantial reductions since the late 1970s. Measurements from 1987 indicate the largest seasonal reduction yet—in excess of 50 percent overall and 95 percent at altitudes between 15 and 20 km.<br/>The Antarctic ozone hole stirred considerable interest among scientists because it had not been predicted by existing models of atmospheric chemistry. Several theories explaining the appearance of the ozone hole, based on both natural and anthropogenic sources, have been suggested.Data from 1987, released after the Montreal Protocol was signed, suggest that CFCs and other anthropogenic pollutants are responsible for the ozone hole. However, the magnitude of the problem is also due to meteorological conditions unique to the Antarctic. Despite continued debate about its specific cause, the ozone hole has focused world attention on CFCs and stratospheric ozone depletion.<br/>Ozone depletion has also been detected outside the Antarctic. Satellite data indicate a global reduction in ozone of about five percent since 1978, of which only half can be accounted for by current theories and models.However, the accuracy of these satellite measurements has been ques¬tioned. More recently, the Ozone Trends Panel using ground-based measurements for the period 1969-1986, has reported a global reduction of between 1.7 and 3.0 percent in the northern hemisphere for latitudes between 30 and 64 degrees. Decreases, however, have been as great as 6.2 percent during the winter months. The Ozone Trends Panel has at¬tributed this decrease to CFCs and other atmospheric trace gases. The Ozone Trends Panel also concludes that these findings are \"broadly con-sistent\" with model calculations. It is important to note, however, that the results of the Ozone Trends Panel were released six months after the Montreal Protocol was signed, and thus did not influence the outcome in Montreal.<br/>STAGE I: OZONE DEPLETION AS A NATIONAL ISSUE<br/>During stage 1 of the process of formulating stratospheric ozone policy in the early and mid-1970s, CFC-induced stratospheric ozone depletion emerged as a major environmental and political issue primarily in the United States. While other nations (Canada and the Scandinavian coun¬tries) were concerned about the problem, most European countries (par¬ticularly the EEC countries) showed little interest. There were several reasons for this difference. First, the threat of stratospheric ozone deple-tion from the proposed fleet of U.S. commercial supersonic transports was one of several potential environmental impacts that had been used by environmentalists to stop the project. Thus, the threat of stratospheric ozone depletion was already an environmental and political issue in the United States before the role of CFCs as ozone depleters was discovered. Second, U.S. public interest over the fate of the ozone layer was built both on the growing importance of environmental problems as political issues and on the growing public concern with cancer and the substances and activities that might cause it. Third, the Europeans were not convinced that a problem existed. Indeed, Britain and France questioned whether the United States was being motivated by economic concerns (the threat of European dominance in commercial supersonic flight) rather than en¬vironmental concerns, and were angered by what they saw as U.S. \"en¬vironmental neocolonialism.\"<br/>The Supersonic Transport<br/>Concern over the depletion of stratospheric ozone first centered on the issue of water vapor and nitrogen oxide (NO*) emissions from the pro¬posed high-flying fleet of commercial supersonic aircraft. During the 1960s, the Boeing Corporation, with the help of a large federal subsidy, was working on developing a commercial supersonic transport (SST). Similar projects, the joint British/French Concorde and the Soviet TU- 144, were under way in Europe. In the United States, it was widely believed at the highest level of government and industry that the future of the U.S. aircraft industry as well as the prestige and dominance of U.S. technology rest with the successful development of an SST. How¬ever, the project was controversial for economic and political reasons, and for other environmental problems (sonic booms and engine noise), long before the issue of stratospheric ozone depletion was raised. It was these other factors (most notably the question of federal subsidy) and not concern for the protection of the ozone layer that killed the U.S. SST program in 1971.<br/>It was not until 1970 that attention began to focus on the potential destruction of stratospheric ozone from NO, emissions from the SST.It was also hypothesized at this time that increased UV-B radiation re¬sulting from a decrease in stratospheric ozone could result in a higher incidence of skin cancer in humans. These hypotheses were widely disputed by proponents of the SST, who accused opponents of using unfounded predictions of doom and gloom to scare the public.<br/>Despite the fact that the U.S. SST program was put on hold in 1971, concern over the SST's potential impact on the stratosphere and on climate remained because Britain and France planned to continue the Concorde program, and the possibility remained that the U.S. program would be revived. As a result, in late 1971 Congress authorized the Department of Transportation (DOT) to investigate the potential environmental impacts of stratospheric flight. The mandate of DOT's Climate Impact Assessment<br/>Program (CIAP) was to assess the impacts that a fleet of high-flying SSTs might have on the ozone layer and on climate, to determine what regu¬latory measures might be necessary to protect the stratosphere, and to report its findings to Congress by 1974.<br/>CIAP was a major three-year research effort involving over 500 sci¬entists and costing over $20 million. The final output included a report of findings, six monographs, and the proceedings from four international conferences (totaling over 9,000 pages). In December 1974, when the conclusions of the project were released to the public and the press through a 23-page Executive Summary (before the full report was released), a great controversy erupted. Glantz explains that the scientists who had worked on the project objected to the \"tone\" of the summary, which differed from the tone of the more detailed Report of Findings. Many of these scientists charged that DOT's summary distorted their findings and ignored the potential impacts from a large, high-flying fleet of SSTs.<br/>Citing the Executive Summary and related press releases, the media widely reported that concern about adverse environmental impacts from the SST in the stratosphere were unfounded. This was clearly not the conclusion of CIAP, which supported the SST/ozone-depletion theory proposed by Johnston in 1970, and pointed to the potential skin-cancer hazard. In addition, a study by the National Academy of Sciences also supported the SST/ozone-depletion theory.<br/>The debate over the SST in the United States had important implications for the development of the joint British/French Concorde. In order to prove its economic viability, the Concorde needed access to the major U.S. markets. This was not an easy task—to begin with, there were the obvious environmental concerns, but more importantly, there were con¬cerns about long-term U.S. interests in developing an SST. The U.S. decision was to allow access by the original sixteen production models of the Concorde to thirteen U.S. airports, at the option of the airports.<br/>According to Ross this was a \"highly political compromise\" that said that \"the Concorde is to be tolerated but not encouraged. \" This decision and the problems that the United States had created in promoting super¬sonic flight left the British and French with a bad feeling that would later have implications for the CFC issue.<br/>The debate over developing a commercial SST was important to the issue of CFC-induced stratospheric ozone depletion not only because it identified the potential threat that human activity might pose to the ozone layer, but more generally because it marked the beginning of a period in which technological development would increasingly have to be balanced with other societal goals. Horwitch argues that \"the SST conflict was clearly both a catalyst and a harbinger of a new era.\" In this new era, technological development would be greeted with increasing public and political scrutiny, and environmental groups and the public would become key participants in the decisionmaking process.<br/>The Spray-Can Issue<br/>In 1974, as work on CIAP was nearing completion, the issue of CFCs was brought to the attention of the public. It was initially raised as a completely separate issue from CIAP and the SST debate. A principal difference between the SST and the CFC/spray-can issue was that the SST represented a potential threat while CFCs were an actual threat. The initial public debate was polarized between those who predicted catas¬trophe and those who thought such predictions were absurd. Not sur-prisingly, both manufacturers and users of CFCs opposed any effort to regulate CFCs in aerosol spray cans. They questioned the validity of the theory, pointing out the uncertainties and noting the lack of supporting evidence.<br/>In the political and public arenas, the CFC/spray can issue was taken seriously. The issue emerged not only against the background of the SST/ ozone issue, but also against the background of a rapidly expanding and increasingly powerful environmental movement and growing public con¬cern for and fear of environmental problems. The fear of skin cancer from the depletion of stratospheric ozone due to the use of CFCs as aerosol propellants in spray cans personalized the risks for many people.<br/>Through the media, the public learned that such nonessential products as aerosol hairsprays and deodorants could pose serious future environmental and health risks. The public came to view the risks of using CFC-based aerosols as unacceptable. As a result, even before the aerosol ban of 1978, the sale of aerosol products fell sharply. Industry, feeling invul¬nerable, was not prepared for such a strong public and political reaction.<br/>It was against this background that, in January 1975, an ad hoc Inter¬agency Task Force on Inadvertent Modification of the Stratosphere (IMOS) was established by the National Science Foundation and the Council on Environmental Quality to develop a coordinated plan of action for federal agencies. In addition to IMOS, the National Academy of Sciences in¬itiated an even more detailed study of the CFC problem. Both studies built upon the work from CIAP and the debate over the SST. Bastian comments that the rapid governmental assessment and response to the CFC issue \"would not have been possible without the earlier growth of a corps of scientists and policymakers who knew and cared about the stratosphere.\" It was upon the-recommendations of these studies and reports that a policy response would be formulated.<br/>The IMOS report, released in June 1975, while conservative in its assessment, supported the CFC/ozone depletion theory and its link to skin cancer. However, rather than endorsing a specific bill to regulate CFCs, IMOS supported the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA) that was being debated in Congress. The problem with formulating CFC regulations was that no single agency or law provided a comprehensive framework for implementing and enforcing regulations. Bastian notes that existing authority was \"overlapping and incomplete.\" TSCA would solve this problem. IMOS also recommended that if the NAS study supported the findings of IMOS, federal agencies should initiate rule¬making procedures for controlling CFC use.<br/>The NAS study, released in September 1976, supported Molina and Rowland's theory as well as the connection between ozone depletion and the increased incidence of skin cancer. The study also noted that existing legislation was inadequate for regulating CFC use and recommended that new legislation be enacted. In addition, the NAS study recommended selective regulation of CFC use if, after a period of further study of no more than two years, the threat of significant ozone depletion remained. With the conclusions of the NAS study in hand, IMOS issued a rec¬ommendation that federal agencies initiate rulemaking procedures. This was followed by announcements by the appropriate federal regulatory agencies—EPA, Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)—that they would initiate rule¬making procedures.<br/>The Aerosol Ban<br/>In October 1976, the Toxic Substance Control Act was passed giving the EPA broad regulatory authority over CFCs. In order to facilitate the rulemaking process, a multi-agency work group was formed under EPA's leadership. The work group proposed a two-phase effort: the first would focus on regulating nonessential uses of CFCs in aerosols under TSCA, and the second on regulating other uses of CFCs. In May 1977, EPA announced proposed regulations for controlling CFCs in aerosols, and in March 1978 final regulations banning the nonessential use of CFCs in aerosols were promulgated by EPA and FDA under TSCA and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The ban took effect in December 1978.<br/>In addition to TSCA, the 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Actprovided the EPA with an even broader mandate for protecting the strat¬osphere. Under the Clean Air Act Amendments, the EPA is required to regulate any activity that threatens the stratosphere and endangers public health. Despite this mandate and the goal for phase two of the multi- agency work group, however, no action was taken to regulate non-aerosol CFC uses. The multi-agency work group argued that with little interest and cooperation in regulating CFCs outside the United States, regulation of other uses of CFCs was not \"viable. \" However, other uses of CFCs, such as refrigeration, could not easily be described as nonessential, and the argument for readily available substitutes for non-aerosol uses of CFCs was not as strong. In addition, the chemical industry, reeling from the aerosol defeat, persuasively argued that time was needed to develop substitutes.<br/>The United States was not the only country to ban the use of CFCs in aerosols, although it was the only major producer/user to do so. Canada, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark also banned the use of CFCs in aerosols; the Netherlands (a major producer/user of CFCs) required warning labels on aerosol spray cans; and in West Germany (another large producer/user of CFCs) industry agreed to a one-third reduction in CFC use in aerosols.In addition, in 1980 the European Economic Community (EEC) required member nations not to increase CFC production and to reduce CFC use in aerosols by 30 percent from 1976 levels by the end of 1981; this act was mostly symbolic, since aerosol use in Europe had already declined significantly from 1976 levels, and European production was far below capacity.<br/>The greatest resistance to CFC regulations came from France and Brit¬ain, both major producers and users of CFCs, but both countries even¬tually adopted the EEC regulation for a 30 percent reduction in aerosol uses of CFCs. Downing and Kates argue that the reluctance of France and the Britain to regulate CFCs was due partly to the potential economic impact, the nature of their environmental decisionmaking process, and the fact that they were involved in developing a commercial SST. With the memory of the Concorde still fresh, the British and French were skeptical of U.S. motivations. In addition, the European countries in general were less inclined to take the threat seriously and to regulate CFCs without conclusive scientific evidence linking CFCs with ozone depletion.<br/>In summary, the process of formulating a policy response to CFC- induced stratospheric ozone depletion in the United States can be assessed as a three-step process: (1) assessment of the problem and the risks; (2) development of a regulatory authority; and (3) formulation and imple¬mentation of a regulation. By 1978, the issue of stratospheric ozone depletion had progressed through all of these steps. The action taken by the United States was both significant and remarkable. It had taken less than five years to move from the scientific discovery of a potentially serious environmental problem to the implementation of a major new regulation designed to resolve that problem.<br/>STAGE II: OZONE DEPLETION AS AN INTERNATIONAL ISSUE<br/>While ozone depletion had emerged as a major environmental policy issue in the United States and several other countries by the late-1970s, the issue was by no means resolved. Among the major CFC producer/ user nations, only the United States had taken substantial action, and then only concerning CFC use in aerosols. Ozone depletion was a global problem, and it was becoming increasingly clear that an effective response would have to be international. Between 1977 and 1985, the problem of stratospheric ozone depletion moved from the national to the international political arena. In 1985, the Vienna Convention legitimized stratospheric ozone depletion as an international political issue, and provided the frame¬work under which the Montreal Protocol would be negotiated. Yet final agreement in Montreal would require more than an emerging international consensus.<br/>UNEP and International Negotiations<br/>Stage II, the process of formulating an international response, had begun even before the U.S. aerosol ban in 1978. In addition to research and regulatory efforts by the United States and other countries, several international organizations became involved in the CFC/ozone issue in the mid-1970s, including UNEP, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the EEC. UNEP in particular has played a central role in coordinating international research efforts and in developing an interna¬tional response to the CFC/ozone problem, especially in terms of problem recognition and assessment, and the identification of policy alternatives.<br/>Many of the early efforts of UNEP and the other international orga¬nizations were aimed specifically at coordinating international research. For example, a WMO statement from a 1975 meeting of experts on stratospheric ozone stated the need for a coordinated international effort to monitor and study stratospheric ozone and the need for collaboration with other international organizations such as UNEP and the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). In 1976, the Governing Council of UNEP adopted a decision requesting that the executive director convene an international meeting on stratospheric ozone. This meeting was held in March 1977 in Washington, D.C. and assessed current research and future research needs. A second international meeting in April 1977, sponsored by EPA, assessed measures for protecting the ozone layer.73<br/>At UNEP's 1977 meeting, a World Plan of Action for the Ozone Layer was adopted. The plan outlined research needs in three areas: (1) the natural ozone layer; (2) impact of changes in the natural ozone layer; and (3) socio-economic aspects. It also recommended that UNEP exercise a \"coordinating and catalytic role\" in implementing the plan by estab¬lishing a Coordinating Committee on the Ozone Layer (CCOL). CCOL, whose membership includes representatives from national and interna¬tional agencies and from nongovernmental organizations, has been meet¬ing regularly since 1977. It assesses recent research results and data on impacts, makes recommendations relevant to implementing the World Plan of Action, and publishes the Ozone Layer Bulletin.<br/>In addition to its efforts at coordinating research, UNEP took on a second task: in May 1981, the governing council of UNEP formed an ad hoc legal and technical working group to draft a Global Framework Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer. The result was the \"Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer,\" adopted at a conference of 43 states in March 1985, which outlined the responsi¬bilities of states to protect \"human health and the environment against adverse effects resulting or likely to result from human activities which modify or are likely to modify the ozone layer.\" The convention also called for international cooperation in research, monitoring, and infor-mation exchange. It was designed as an \"umbrella treaty\" to be supple¬mented by more specific protocols and subtreaties. While an effort made to include a protocol on controlling CFC production and use with the convention failed, a Resolution on a Protocol Concerning Chlorofiuoro- carbons was adopted, calling for \"a protocol to control equitably global production, emissions and use of CFCs.\"<br/>No protocol on controlling CFC production and use was adopted at the Vienna Convention because of a dispute between the United States, Canada, Sweden, Norway, and Finland (often referred to as the Toronto Group) on one side and the EEC countries on the other. The EEC favored a production capacity cap and a 30 percent cut in nonessential aerosol use of CFCs, while the United States, Canada, and the Scandinavian countries (which had already banned nonessential aerosol use of CFCs) favored an 80 percent reduction or a complete ban in nonessential aerosol use of CFCs. The dispute centered on the fact that the Toronto Group countries had already banned aerosol use of CFCs while the EEC countries had not. Furthermore, the EEC countries were only producing at 65 percent of capacity and thus could still significantly increase production despite a capacity cap. The Toronto Group sought controls that would force the European countries to cut back on aerosol use of CFCs, while the EEC opposed being forced to adopt regulations already adopted by the Toronto Group countries. The dispute polarized the negotiations.<br/>The Vienna Convention was important because it represented a common ground on which international consensus had been reached, and also established the framework under which a protocol would be negotiated. Subsequently, the key question was not so much whether there would be a protocol, but rather how strong it would be.<br/><br/>\n\nDEPLETION OF STRATOSPHERIC OZONE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DEPLETION OF STRATOSPHERIC OZONE", "id": 39}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF INFANT AND CHILD MORTALITY<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Despite the global decline in under-five mortality rate from 90 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 48 in 2012, Nigeria has failed to record any substantial improvement.  Under-five mortality in Nigeria increased from 138 per 1,000 live births in 2007 to 158 per 1,000 live births in 2011 against the Millennium development Goal target of 71 per 1,000 live births.  The data used in this research is a secondary one; the data was fetched from the medical records department of the ABUTH, Zaria. The research was carried out to: test for the difference of two means between infant and child mortality rate; estimate infant and child mortality rate; estimate age specific fertility rate; and to determine the trend line and forecast of infant and child mortality. Descriptive statistics, Regression and Correlation analysis are the statistical techniques used for the study. From the regression analysis result obtained, it showed that both infant and child mortality rates has a direct relationship with delivery rates. The correlation analysis result showed that there is a very strong and positive relationship between mortality and delivery rates. The study revealed that infant and child mortality rates will continue to decrease if there can be improvement in the factors under study.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>Infant mortality refers to the death of a child born alive before its first birthday and child mortality is the death of a child aged between one and five years. Demographers have for a long time been interested in the study of mortality which is one of the components of population change. Infant and child mortality are among the best indicators of socioeconomic development because a society life expectancy at birth is determined by the survival chance of infants and children.<br/>Childhood mortality is an important indicator of all heath programs and policies; likewise it contributes to population projection. Childhood mortality measures also help identify specific population that are at increase in health risk. Several measures of childhood mortality are calculated using Demographic Health Survey (DHS) data. During the twentieth century almost all countries experienced decreases in child mortality rate. However, the timing and pace of the decline varied substantially. Sustained reductions in child mortality began in the nineteenth century in Europe, North America, and Japan and continued gradually throughout the twentieth century. Major declines in other parts of the world generally began only after World War II. Mortality reductions in Asia, Latin America and Africa were usually much more rapid that they had been in countries that began mortality declines earlier. By 1999 there were great variations in child mortality among countries for example, although less than 0.5 percent of children died before the fifth birthday in Iceland, more than 33 percent died by age five in Niger. Since the 1960s the decline in child mortality sometimes has appeared to have stagnated as was the period from 1975– 1985, when many poor countries experienced severe crises and other problems such as economic recovery from the 0.1 crisis of 1973 – 1974. Recent evidence suggests that child mortality has continued to decline in most countries since 1980. However, during the 1990s the HIV/AIDS epidemic halted or reversed declines in child mortality in some eastern and southern African countries. For example, in Zimbabwe in the period 1990 – 1994 there were 50 deaths under age five per 1,000 live births.<br/>Statistics therefore as the science of information analysis or scientific method of collecting, presenting or organizing and interpreting numerical data in such a way that valid and useful conclusion will be drawn to clear away uncertainties. It implies in many aspects of studies and life in general one of the aspects is demography. The demography means the study of human population and factors that affect it. These are fertility, morbidity mortality etc. but the scope of these project be centered on analyzing infant and child mortality rate among various age groups we shall consider how genders is also related to death in a particular age group.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>The incidence of infant and child mortality has been of great concern to both the government and individuals. The needs for policies that may adequately arrest the situation cannot be achieved without some in depth acquaintance with the available dates.

From the available statistical data the evidence have been showing alarming rate of sexually transmitted diseases every day as mankind gets more civilized.  The sexually transmitted diseases can be categorized into three: the first category are referred to as the first category are referred to as the first generation, these are gonorrhea, syphilis, and chancroid.  The second generation includes hympho granuloma venereum and granuloma ingunale.  The third generation which is Aids  (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). These sexually transmitted disease have become a major public health problem to most countries of the world, including Nigeria on the account of their frequency, their impact on maternal and infant health and their special consequences as well as their economic cost in terms of health expenditure and cost of productivity.  It has a serious effect on pregnancy, and new borns are seriously affected which may lead to miscarriage, failure of development of new baby, blindness congenital defects etc.   The implication in woman such as pekvic inflammatory disease ectopic pregnancy, infertility and chronic ill health are caused by sexual transmitted diseases where the incidence of undiagnosed or poor treated cases is very high.   <br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>            The disease, sexually transmitted disease (STDS) is an old strong disease that was discovered before the amalgamation of Nigeria in the year 1914 by a great medical scientist known as lordchester field, in the year 1985.  this disease has killed very many paple, yet, as at that time people doesn’t believe it, not until a good number of research work was carried out in the laboratory and evidence showed that it is a communicable disease that can be contracted from one person to another through  predominantly sexual contact; such as gonorrhea, syphilis enters the body veins through blood and weakens or makes the white blood cell known as lymphocyte inactive to attack the disease of the sexual transmitted disease and this deadly disease will dry the victim to the extent that you will be able to count the bones and extent that you will be able to count the bones and ribs of the patient.  But some people are still doubting the existence of the deadly disease STDS while statistical data table shows that 7,548 people was a victim within the year of 1985 to 1990.  But the recent data collected shows that 17,277 people were infected as it was recorded at the Federal Medical Centre Umuahia.  In addition, the above collected data will help the masses to reduce the rate of sexual act and sexual promiscuity.  The federal ministry of health warns that total abstinence and mutual fidelity remains the best protective measure for or against sexually  transmitted disease (STDS)  such as  gonorrhea, syphilis etc.  That is why the federal government supported the introduction of sex education and the use of condom as a program in most of our media, such as newspaper, radio, television etc.  In order to educate the poor masses on the subject matter and how to avoid contacting the deadly disease (STDS).<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>            The rapid spreading of these deadly diseases (STDS) does not mean that both the internal and external bodies’ even corporate organizations are not working to remedy the issue.  But we should not unemphasize the problem facing the efforts. Some of this problems includes inadequate central surveillance system from which all of us will be getting the information that we carry and reply in our program, because what we get now in Nigeria is information that is fragment not reconcilable.  Even when there is seeming different, there are not other third sources of reference to cross check.  Here the problem of finance contributed to the collapse of the efforts been made.  Take for instance, the latest inhibitors introduced by Hoffmann – LaRoche of the Switzerland Eortovase and Viracept cannot be obtained by poor countries like Nigeria.<br/>            We know that it will sound unbelievable even at the moment to some people mainly the youths of today that kept adamant on the warnings and dangers of being a prostitute, a homosexual, a Hetero Sexual and equally having unprotected sexual intercourse.  All that the World Health Organization (WHO) had warned that partners should be truthful to themselves and take preventive measures.<br/>1.3       AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>i.                    To know how far people have known about existence of the sexually transmitted disease.<br/>ii.                  To know whether the rate at which male are infected is the same at which the females are infected.<br/>iii.                To recommend preventive measures on how to avoid contacting the sexually transmitted diseases and give appropriate treatment to avoid rapid spread of the deadly disease.<br/>iv.                To specify the age group that is mostly affected.<br/>v.                  Finally, the objective of this study is in picking the types of sexually transmitted diseases under study one by one and uses statistical methods predicting what their incidence rate will be in the year 2005 and 2006.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The study has revealed that the awareness of the existence of sexual transmitted disease.  Through this study, their causes, sources and mode of transmission have been have been highlighted.  Having known all these a greater result can be achieved by embarking on the program against sexually transmitted disease, such as making use of condom as one of the preventive measures and total abstinence as another measure.  Another important significance is that, the health standard of the people is improved, while the death effect and other consequences of sexually transmitted diseases are minimized by profiling good medical attention and the use of skilled practitioners.<br/>            Finally, by achieving all these goals, we can have a good social economic planning for the present and future generation.<br/>1.5       SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS<br/>            The Federal Medical Centre Umuahia (FMC) is my scope of study.  It has ten wards (10) two medical ward on each for male and female, two surgical wards one each for male and female, two surgical wards one each for male and female, maternity wards with eighty (80) beds, one ward with forty (40) beds for booked patients while the other is for unbooked patients. Other are the pediatrics ward with twenty (20) beds and a gynecological ward with fourty (40) beds.  But my area of concentration is based on the steadily increase of the sexually transmitted diseases (STDS).  And we are taking a more look at the four varieties of sexually transmitted diseases (STDS).  And we are taking a more look at the four varieties of sexually transmitted disease (STDS) such as gonorrhea, syphilis, arthritis and Aids.  This study is faced with a lot of limitations and some problems encountered din the project research must not be overlooked.  Some problems as: problem of finance, a lot of expense was made on the process of collecting the data.  Time factor is another problem that delays the collection of data.<br/>            In addition, the duplication of the data and the production of this project work also included.  On this note I was to study records from the year 1995 – 2002.  This further more confined to the statistical analysis only, which has to do with the incidence rate of the sexually transmitted disease under study as arranged or grouped into sex, age groups and years.  There will also be some forecast or production of the type of sexually transmitted disease under study in a specifically year to come.<br/>1.6       FOR THE HYPOTHESIS<br/>i.                    The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between age group.  This means that the incident rate of age group is the same.  The alternative hypothesis is that the incident rate of age group differ which reconcile that the incident rate is not he same.<br/>ii.                  The null hypothesis is also used for the incident rate sex that means that there is no difference between incident rate of sex then.  The alternative hypothesis is that the incident rate of sex is differ which states that the incident rate of sex is not the same.<br/>1.7       ASSUMPTIONS<br/>i.                    That is an existence of sexually transmitted disease (STDS) virus<br/>ii.                  Attempts on how to prevent or cure the sexually transmitted diseases (STDS) have been made.<br/>iii.                Maximum cooperation is needed from all and sundry.<br/>1.8       DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>i.          STDS: Sexually Transmitted Diseases<br/>ii.         AIDS: Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome<br/>iii.        HIV:                Human Immunodeficiency Virus<br/>iv.        VIRUS:           Any living thing that is smaller than <br/>bacteria, that causes the spread of infections disease.  It can only be seen with the use of microscope.<br/>v.         SEROLOGICAL TEST FOR HIV:               Blood test <br/>that allows the presence of anti bodies to HIV in the body to be dictated.<br/>ABORTION:  Removal   of unwanted child out of her <br/>mothers’ womb <br/>IMPOTENCY:           Inability of a man to impregnate a <br/>woman due to the destruction of the manhood by sexually transmitted disease(s).<br/>PRE – MARITAL SEX:        Sex before marriage<br/>RACE:            Different type of people living in the world<br/>INFERTILITY:          Inability to bear a child or children.<br/>LYPHOCYTE:           A group of white blood cells that helps to <br/>prevent infections from spreading<br/>ANTI-BODY:            This is an organism that is not a part of <br/>the body but was being introduced to that body<br/>PERINATAL:            This simply means mother<br/>HOMO-SEXUALITY:          This is sexual intercourse between <br/>persons of the same sex e.g male to male.<br/>LESBIANISM:          Sexual intercourse between people of <br/>the same sex eg female to female<br/>HETERO SEXUALITY:       This is a sexual intercourse <br/>between persons of opposite sex, example female to male.<br/>INFECTION: An inversion of the body (entry) of a <br/>disease causing organism<br/>CONDOM:                 A preservative or “rubber” sheath <br/>(usually made of latex) used to cover the penis or virgin by women during sexual intercourse to prevent pregnancy or to protect against disease.<br/>WHO: WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION<br/>MOD OF TRANSMISSION:            This is simply the way at <br/>which a disease or disease can be transferred over from a carrier to a non carrier.      <br/><br/>\n\nA STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF REPORTED CASES OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITED DISEASE IN THE FEDERAL

gathered through the use of interview guide, questionnaire few books on the topic, and past studies directly related to the study.<br/>            It is  inferred from the study that a secretary cannot really perform effectively and efficiently without the use of modern communication equipment and as the case may be, office equipment has been developing since seventeenth century until now.<br/>            This study is intended to find out the modern office communication equipment in use in manufacturing firms, the job efficiency on the part of the secretary with the use of these equipment, the job satisfaction they give to secretaries, the challenges they pose, the problem encountered by secretaries on the usage and how far they have helped in enhancing the secretaries efficiency in the organization.<br/>Finally, five manufacturing firms based in Enugu State of Nigeria were selected for this study, while the population of this study comprises 60 secretaries and 40 Boss making it a total of 100 respondents used in this study.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>Chapter one                                       <br/>1.0                            Introduction

the impact of modern communication equipment on the secretarial performance in organizations; two factors are to be recognized. Technological growth and organizational structure.  Organisation here does not mean only structure but includes aspects of interactions between people and machines in achieving set organizational goals.<br/>            It is said that successes of any person or organisation depends largely on information available to a human person and the constant modification of modern communication equipment that is fully up-dated with modern information.<br/>            This ascertain brings us to the purpose of an office which includes the following:  Administration, clerical work, money handling information communication systems which is an embodiment of secretarial operations.  Office as a mini-social system according to farber and Barr 1979 plays important roles in defining responsibilities.  For the aforementioned reasons the secretary must be available to organize and run the office completely.  Here the secretary is seen as an executive assistant who has a mastery of <br/>office/organizational skills.  She has to be familiar with the manipulation of the modern communication equipment which is made to enhance his/her performance.<br/>            Office automation provides increased productivity through improved access to data, faster responses to customer demands and faster decision makings.  The invention of modern office equipment were necessitated as a result of the growth in large scale enterprises and also as a technological break through.  The office therefore relies much on sophisticated office equipment in order to cope with the ever-increasing activities in the organizations.<br/>            Like in Nigeria Breweries Plc. Which is one of the largest quoted company in Nigeria  stock market has successive  secretarial functions.  This company started in Nigeria in 1946 producing star larger and has witnessed a lot of human and technological transformations.  In their policies to keep a  healthy work force in personnel and machines they have taken their secretarial operations to greater heights.  This they were able to achieve through the  introduction of any equipment that will enhance the job of their secretaries and also customer service satisfaction.  Nigeria  Breweries believe in breaking into new areas.  They contend so much with the tomorrow of their business.  Strategically, actions, planning and implementation to ensure that tomorrow is achieved.  Nigerian breweries plc. is futuristic in their business approach made possible by the able and vision driven leadership of their past and immediate Directors/  Chief executives  that pilots the affairs of the business in conjunction with Heineken international.  Recently a multi-billion Naira ultra modern brewery has been cited in Enugu state with the slogan that it is a world class investment that can complete with another out-fit in any part of the world is modern communication and production and delivery equipment.  The introduction of modern office equipment in Nigerian Breweries plc mainly the computer in every office of the company also shows that the secretarial performance goes with the acquisition of these modern equipments.<br/>            It seems however, that although the higher levels of management might not make much direct use of modern office technology the secretary will.  This office automation for the secretarial is in providing the secretary with a system that meets the real need identified as being important rather than the ones of typing and stenography that are thoughts to be important.  As against the traditional office the modern office has a lot of activities to perform with the aid of modern equipment.<br/>            Nowadays, un-countable manufacturing industries have installed these equipments and the secretaries are present to manipulate them in discharging their duties efficiently and effectively.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The importance of efficiency in job performance can not be over- emphasized.  A case for the pursuit of increased efficiency/productivity can be made simply by looking at the categories of office work, the size of the size of the office work force and the impact of mechanization.<br/>The secretarial profession have witnessed a tremendous change in terms of technological advancement.   Modern office equipment has taken the toll of events with the growing rate of scientific and technology which are used in manufacturing industries to facilitate office work and reduce labour costs.  They include:  electronic typewriters, fax machines, telephone, computers, dictating machines and recording machines etc.<br/>1.3              THE OBJECTIVE OR PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>Therefore the purpose of this study is to identify the impact of modern office equipment on the job performances of secretaries in NB Plc – Enugu.<br/>1.                  The extent the modern office equipment enhances or has enhanced the job performance of secretaries in the discharge of her duties in NB-P Enugu.<br/>2.                  The accuracy of work done using these equipments.<br/>3.                  The quantity of time spent or needed to perform a task using these equipments.<br/>4.                  The reduction of cost brought about by the installation of these equipment<br/>5.                  The job satisfaction the secretary derives from the use of these equipment in performing her duties.<br/>6.                  The job security of secretaries with the acquisition of these modern office communication equipment<br/>1:4       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This  study is limited only to NB Plc  - Enugu and other manufacturing industries in Enugu state and seek to find out the effect of modern office equipment on the job performances of secretaries in manufacturing industries.  The category of people to be studies in NB plc Enugu are:<br/>1.                  Designated employed secretaries<br/>2.                  Clerks whose function has been enveloped by modern office equipment<br/>3.                  Managers<br/>4.                  Operatives.<br/>1.4              RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>The following questions were designed by the researcher to enable her reach conclusions such as:<br/>i.          How far as the modern office equipment enhanced efficiency in secretarial duties in manufacturing industries especially in NB plc-Enugu? <br/>ii.         To what extent has the use of these equipment assisted the secretary in the discharge of her duties?<br/>iii.        How accurate and qualitative is the work done using these equipment in manufacturing industries.<br/>iv.        What are the problems the secretaries encounters in the use of these modern office equipment.<br/>1.5              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study will be of great value to the professional secretaries and society in general as well as manufacturing firms like NB Plc – Enugu.  The knowledge exerted from the study will be beneficial to secretaries in the discharge of their duties and will definitely encourage new innovations in office automation and information technology on the part of the implementers.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF MODERN COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT ON THE SECRETARIAL PERFORMANCE. \r\n (A CASE STUDY OF NB PLC-ENUGU).\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECTS OF MODERN COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT ON THE SECRETARIAL PERFORMANCE. \r\n (A CASE STUDY OF NB PLC-ENUGU).\r\n", "id": 44}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN ANALYSE OF INFANT MORTALITY RATE IN ABIA STATE<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF FEDERAL MEDICAL CENTRE UMUAHIA FROM 1995 TO 2004)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            We had tried to study the rates of infant mortality in Abia State.  The aims of this study were to compare the mortality and birth rate of infants male and female in order to determine whether there is a significant yearly difference in their mortality and birth rate.  Also, to determine whether infant mortality in Abia State in independent of sex.

however, these advances may appear insignificant when compared to the magnitude of the problems still to be solved especially as it concerns infant diseases and infant mortality.<br/>            According to the Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary, Mortal means to die; that cannot live forever.  Encyclopedia Britannica expressed the state of being mortal as the state of temporalness of living, or not to live forever.<br/>            In these modern times there have been an increase in world population and stability ad decline in number would be regarded as abnormal.  As Berkley (1958) said, “modern phrase of recent origin started from the peiod of 1600; the growth is quite unprecedented in any comparable period”.  One can view from the above statement, that such changes in population are inherently transitory.<br/>            In countries of West Africa records of health did not start until orthodox medium arrived, but it was recognized prior to the arrival of the white men.  There were high incidence of killer diseases which affected maternal and infant health leading to high mortality of infants.  Moreover, the sanitary condition of our local populace, mode of feeding and general condition leaves much to be desired, also lack of health infrastructures created problems that led to high infant mortality.<br/>            Again, other causes of infant mortality are recognized killer childhood diseases viz; measles, malaria, small pox, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis, poliomyelitis, dyphytaria and jaundice.  In late 80’s government of Nigeria through the National Programme on Immunization and Expanded Programme on Immunization has achieved a lot to the improvement of infant health.<br/>            Now, according to recent health journals “Health care” the liming legs are fastly dis appearing, the plague of onchosochaisis caused by the black fly is gone.  Our children and infants are living today without it.  Poliomyelitis is about being kicked out from the shores of our country courtesy of the three months immunization programme of year 2000.<br/>1.1       HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>            The federal medical center Umuahia was built in the early 1950’s by the joint effort of the protestant churches, the Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian churches.  The three churches agree to build a joint hospital and work together as a means and avenue of a joint Christian medical services and Christian evangelism.  Trained and qualified competent Christian ladies were generally nurses and midwifery and this created an environment for true Christian gospel and evangelism.  The hospital was first named Union Mission Joint Training Hospital.  Nurses and student nurses were drawn from hospitals named by three denominations and located at Iyi Enu Ituk Mbang and Etinagi all in Calabar to run the hospital.  Later as a mark of appreciation and courtesy to Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain when she formally and officially opened the hospital in 1956, during the regime of his excellency the governor of the Eastern Region of Nigeria, Sir. Clement Plear, it was renamed Queen Elizabeth Hospital.<br/>            Soon after its establishment, the hospital gained popularity and reputation, but it suffered a set back during the Nigeria civil war from 1967 – 1970 when most of the medical equipments were looted.  Moreover, indigenous missionaries could not maintain the hospital after the departure of the foreign missionaries at the end of the war.<br/>            Consequently, it management was taken over by the government, which converted it to a sepcialsit hospital by the East Central State of Nigeria Edit No 6 of 1972: with the creation of the Imo State Government, she changed the name of Ramat specialist Hospital in honour of the later Head of State General Ramat Murtala Mohammed, under the direction of Navy Captain Ndubuisi Kanu, the then military governor.  I t reverted to Queen Elizabeth hospital o the 16th December 1983, sequel to a request by the people of old Imo State.  <br/>The hospital was again taken over by the Federal Government on 1st May, 1992 and was renamed Federal Medical Centre Umuahia.<br/>            The Federal Medical Centre Umuahia is located at Umuahia the capital of Abia State.  The hospital has ten wards, two medical wards on each for male and female, maternity wards, the pediatrics ward, two theatres, one for obstetrics and other for general surgery.  Other areas of the hospital includes: the Antenatal clinics, x – ray department, pharmacy and medical laboratories units, medical records/ statistics among others.  <br/>The hospital has two training schools, the school of Nursing and the school of midwifery.  It has a staff strength of about 720; made up of medical doctors, Nurses, House of Officers, Laboratory Technicians and Scientists, Accounting of Officers, records Officers, Pharmacists, Administrative Officers, Attendants, among others.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>            The researcher was very much worried and concerned about the alarming rate at which infants were dying in Abia State and the following statements and questions below prompted him to go into the study about the rate of infant mortality in Abia State.<br/>1.                  The rate of infant mortality in Abia State was alarming.<br/>2.                  The rate of infants mortality may have been more in a particular sex<br/>3.                  The rate of infant’s mortality may have been caused by many factors among which disease were the chief.<br/>4.                  The rate of infant’s mortality in Abia State should follow a particular trend over the years.<br/>5.                  There should be some preventive measures to reduce the number of infant’s death that may occur in Abia State.<br/>1.3       RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>1.                  What are the major causes of infant mortality in Abia State?<br/>2.                  Is there any means to compare mortality rate of infant male and female to know whether there is significant yearly difference in their mortality rate?<br/>3.                  Does infant mortality rate in Abia State dependent on sex?<br/>4.                  Can the trend of infant mortality in Abia State be established?<br/>5.                  Are there some preventive measures to reduce the number of infants death that may occur in Abia State?<br/>1.4       AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>1.                  To compare mortality rate of infant male and female in order to know whether there is significant yearly difference in their mortality rate.<br/>2.                  To determine whether infant mortality in Abia State is independent of sex.<br/>3.                  To suggest possible preventive measures to reduce the number of infant deaths that may occur.<br/>4.                  To determine the trend of the infant mortality rate.<br/>5.                  Based on the findings, recommendation will be made.<br/>1.5       STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESES<br/>            This study is testing for the following hypothesis:-<br/>H0:       There is significance difference in the yearly mortality rate of infants male and female.<br/>H1:       There is not significance difference in the yearly mortality rate of infants male and female.<br/>H0:       Infant mortality in Abia State is independent of sex<br/>H1:       Infant mortality in Abia State is not independent of sex.<br/>1.6       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This project work is restricted to the federal medical center, Umuahia in Abia State.  The study covers a period of ten years from 1995 to year 2004.<br/>1.8       DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>            The terms used in this study are all Demography terms and are peculiar t o the subject matter alone.<br/>            Below are some of the terms commonly used in this study, which constitute the reference terms and will aid data analysis.<br/>Demograph<br/>Mortality<br/>Neo-natal mortality<br/>Morbidity<br/>Disease<br/>Infants <br/>(i)         DEMOGRAPHY:     This is the study of human population and some of the factors that causes change in its composition and size.<br/>(ii)        MORTALITY:         The state of being mortal, mortal means that must die; that cannot live forever, a state of temporal living or existence.<br/>(iii)       NEO-NATAL MORTALITY:        This is the mortality of infants within the first 28 days of birth.  Some of which are caused by the circumstances of birth.<br/>(iv)       INFANT – MORTALITY RATE: Mortality rate is the index of death over the index of birth for a given period of at least one year.  Infant mortality can be defined as the number of death under one year over the number of live birth times 1000.<br/>i.e        D         x          K         Where D is the number of death in <br/>B                                 a particular year.<br/>B is the number of birth in the same year<br/>K is a constant and is equal to 1,000<br/> Which is No of death under one year             x          1000?<br/>                               No of live births<br/> This shows clearly the measures within a given year of chances of birth failing to survive in one year life time.<br/>To calculate separately for the sexes:<br/> Female =          No of female death     x          1000<br/>                                    No of female births<br/> Males   =          No of males death       x          1000<br/>                                    No of males birth<br/> (v)        MORBIDITY:           Morbidity involves the statistics of ill health of a population.  It includes the rate of illness, injuries, accidents etc.<br/>(vi)       DISEASE:     This is the state of being morbid, it is caused by infections or undergrowth.  There are air borne disease, water borne diseases, insect borne diseases, and sexually transmitted diseases.<br/>(a)        Water Borne Diseases:          These are caused by some aquatic living organisms which when they enter human body cause disease. They include some Fungi, Algae, bacteria etc.  Also bad source of water supply where sewage and refuse are badly disposed can lead to severe cause of water borne diseases.  These diseases include typhoid fever, cholera, diarrhea, dysentery etc.<br/>(b)       Air Borne Disease:    These are diseases which can be contacted or transmitted from a carrier to a healthy person through the air. Free-living bacteria or parasite transmits these diseases.  These diseases are coughs, measles, catarrh, whooping cough, chicken pox and polio.<br/>(c)        Insect Borne Diseases:          These are diseases carried by insect vectors.  These vectors visits and plague human environs disposing bacterium to their food.  Diseases like typhoid fever, diarrhea and cholera are carried by housefly.  Mosquitoes carry malaria parasite and trypanosomiasis is caused by tsetse fly, while onchosochaisis is caused by African black fly.<br/>(d)       Sexually Transmitted Diseases:        These are significantly important because some of them affects fertility rate, there are disease acquired through sexual intercourse between the victim and any member of the adult population.

Syndrome (AIDS) is the most unwelcome visitor of the 20th Century.  It has been disturbing and posing a great threat to human race and world population.  Since the discovery of AIDS in 1981 in America, there has been tremendous rise in the cases the number of deaths.  The prediction of doom by some local and international organization like the United Nations is turning into reality.  The future is so uncertain as to what will become of developing countries like Nigeria where the scourge is gradually taking its tell on the population.<br/>1.1.1    WHAT IS AIDS<br/>            AIDS is a very serious disease that affects the body’s ability of defend itself against certain other diseases.  It caused by virus HIV (Human Immune Deficiency Virus).  It is retrovirus which affects and takes over certain cells of the immune system.  The HIV virus penetrates immunity enhancing cells.  It then makes new copies of itself and from there, goes on infecting other immunity cell.  This causes the infected cell to function improperly and prematurely.  This leads to weakening of the immune system thereby permitting all kinds of infection.<br/>1.2                   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>1.2.1    THE ORIGIN OF AIDS<br/>            No one knows exactly where the AIDS virus came from but many scientist think it originated in Africa.  One theory is that AIDS virus evolved from a similar, through harmless virus found in African Green Monkey.  According to this theory, soemtime in the past, one of the monkey viruses underwent a change mutatim that enabled it to survive in the human body.  This mutation was passed on to the virus’s “offspring” and eventually same of the mutated viruses found their way into the human body, perhaps as a result of a person being bitten by a eating a monkey (monkey brains are popularly found in Africa).  Once inside the human body, the virus may have mutated further until it become the virus known today as the AIDS virus.  Regardless of exactly where it started, AIDS is now a world wide problem.<br/>AIDS was first discovered in America in the year 1981 by Dr. Montegor of the California University.  But today, AIDS has been reported in over 100 countries of the world.<br/> 1.2.2    CAUSES OF AIDS<br/>            Most scientists believe that AIDS is caused by a type of germ known as a virus.  The virus has been given a number of different scientific names including: HTL V – III, LAV, ARV and HIV.  The most commonly known among these is HIV.<br/>HIV stands for<br/>H         -           Human<br/>I           -           Immunodeficiency<br/>V         -           Virus<br/>1.2.3    SYMPTOMS OF AIDS<br/>            It depends on which disease the person develops as the immune system break down.<br/>Most common symptoms are:<br/>i.                    Prolonged diarrhea<br/>ii.                  Swollen Lymph glands in the neck, armpits or elsewhere<br/>iii.                Unexplained weight loss<br/>iv.                Persistent dry cough<br/>v.                  Severe skin rashes which comes and goes<br/>vi.                Night sweat<br/>vii.              Extreme tiredness<br/>viii.            White patches inside the mouth<br/>ix.                Shortness of breath<br/>x.                  Proneness to different kinds of diseases like tuberculosis, cancer, pneumonia, chest infection, Meningitis.<br/>1.2.4    MODE OF SPREAD OF AIDS<br/>i.                    Sexual Intercourse (homo, heterc)<br/>ii.                  Prenatal transmission from mother to new

FIVE<br/>Conclusion <br/>Recommendation<br/>References<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>            National income is the sum of the money value of all the commodities and services produced in a country within a particular period of time usually one year.<br/>            The question of how an economy grows could come to mind at this juncture.  It the amount of goods and services produced by an economy increases.  If it does not increase yearly, it is not growing, even if it is growing, the rate of growth may not be uniform among years.  Therefore it may not be possible to determine the condition of the economy.<br/>            In any case, an economy needs an indicator for measuring economy growth, this indicator is the monetary summation at all the commodities and service produced in an economy within a particular period of time usually a year.<br/>            To get national income of a country like Nigeria for instance, we take the list of the goods and services produced in the country during the year, assign values to them and add up.  If we can do this year after year, we shall be able to make comparison of activities of Nigeria year after year.  Then we can decisively determine whether the economy of Nigeria is growing, declining or stagnant.  It is growing if the National income increases year after year, declining, if the National income is decreasing and stagnant it there is no difference in the National Income for years.<br/>            In measuring National Income, an indicator called Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is used at current price.  It is therefore quite important here to point out the role that prices could play in the measurement of National Income.  Prices of goods and services changes from time to time.  These changes can affect any attempted estimates.  Considerably.  Therefore to get an idea of the real physical change in National Income from year to year, effect of price changes must be removed.<br/>            National Income should be measured in real terms and allow for changes in price levels.  For instance whenever the economy experiences inflation, price rises while the quantities of goods and services may remain constant.  Let us say that 2000, the total units of the go0ods and services realized in Nigeria amounted to 50,000 units and also 50,000 units in 2001.  Let us further assume that the average per unit in 2000 was N10.00 while the price in 2001 was N15,000.<br/>            Nigeria’s income with GDP as an indicator for 2000 was 50,000 units X N10.00 = N5000,000 Nigeria’s income with GDP as an indicator for 2001 was 50,000 units X N15.00 = N750,000.<br/>            If the two figures were presented to a layman as final products of overall estimates for 2000 and 2001, he would be tempted to say that the National income for 2001 was higher than that of 2000.  This is so monetarily but really the income for both year are equal.  The difference in value was due to rise in p rice in 2001 while the quantities of goods and services were the same in both years.<br/>            The same thing can be applicable when a country experience deflation or depression.  Therefore in measuring national income for different years using gross domestic product as an indicator effects of price changes must be given the normal due.  In so doing the changes in economy can be determined appropriately.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM/MOTIVATION<br/>            As a result of poor economic condition in Nigeria relevant information is of great interest to me for investigation if viable economic solution can be revealed.<br/>            Nigeria considered as one of the third world countries is been assessed by their income yearly.  It is a simple logic of our living that it country’s income is high with considerable population, the enjoyment of the citizens of that country would be high, while the enjoyment is low with low national income.  It is on this point that I find it very expedient to analyze the national income of Nigeria and make necessary recommendation for the improvement of the economy for the betterment of the citizenry.<br/>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES <br/>            In view of Nigeria’s economic predicament, the project is aimed at investigating the relationship existing between disposable income, savings and government final expenditure for the purpose of suggesting solutions to our economic problems.<br/>            After the regression analysis had been carried out, it will supply solution to the following questions:<br/>1.                  Is any linear relationship between the variables listed?<br/>2.                  How reliable is our regression coefficient?<br/>3.                  Can we predict the future value of dependent variable?<br/>4.                  How reliable will be our estimate?<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The study is centre on “National Income, Savings and Government Final Consumption Expenditure Covering the period of six years 1998 – 2003.<br/>            The raw data used are collected as primary data by federal office of statistics” publication and Federal Ministry of Finance Publication.  The data are collected as primary data by federal office of statistics and used as secondary data in this project which centered on national Accounts.  Some of these National Accounts Aggregates Include Gross Domestic Product (GDP) final consumption expenditure, exports and imports.<br/>            National Accounts data presents the record of economic transaction of the economic in a systematic manner and show the relationship between the various components of the economy.  Economic transaction cover all the activities of an entity (Household, government, firm, financial institution) that are of economic nature (production, consumption distribution, savings and foreign exchange transactions.  These economic transactions of all the entiti8tes and combined together ad presented inform of account.<br/>            Data collected for analysis in this study center on:-<br/>1.                  Appropriation of disposable income as dependent variable.<br/>2.                  Savings as one of the independent variable<br/>3.                  Government final consumption expenditure as another independent variable.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The study will help to know the status of Nigeria economy.  The knowledge of the status will help to make necessary recommendation in order to revitalize the poor economic condition of the country for the better future.<br/>            The study will also create avenue for future research.<br/> DEFINITION OF CONCEPTS<br/>Gross Domestic Product (GDP):     This is the sum of the money value of all locally produced goods and services.  It does not include international transaction.  GDP does not make allowance for depreciation of capital.<br/>Gross National Product (GNP):      This is the total money value of current market prices of all final goods and services produced by the nationals during a specific period.  It includes net income from abroad in respect of the country’s nationals without any consideration for depreciation of capital.<br/>National Domestic Product (NDP): This is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a period of time.  It exclude the value of the net earnings and incomes from abroad.  An allowance being made for depreciation of capital.<br/>Net National Product (NNP):           This is the monetary value of all goods and services produced within the country during a specific period.  It includes net incomes and earning from abroad and provision being made for the replacement of depreciation of capital.<br/>Disposable Income (DPI):     This is the amount of money per year that private sector are free to spend when depreciation of capital, all taxes, all net profits made by firms but not paid out as divided are added to the disposable and transfer payment subtracted.  We arrive at gross national product.<br/>Net Economic Welfare (NEW):                   This examines those factors not considered when calculating the Gross National Product (GNP).  Such factors include social cost 9pollution) and leisure time the net economic welfare tend to remove the product (GNP).  A nation might have a very high GNP at a very great social cost as pollution, rising crime etc.<br/>Per Capita Income (PCI) This is the gross domestic product divided by the population of the country. Per capita income can be calculated once the population and gross domestic product are known.

INTRODUCTION<br/>            Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is the most unwelcome visitor of the 20th Century.  It has been disturbing and posing a great threat to human race and world population.  Since the discovery of AIDS in 1981 in America, there has been tremendous rise in the cases the number of deaths.  The prediction of doom by some local and international organization like the United Nations is turning into reality.  The future is so uncertain as to what will become of developing countries like Nigeria where the scourge is gradually taking its tell on the population.<br/>1.1.1    WHAT IS AIDS<br/>            AIDS is a very serious disease that affects the body’s ability of defend itself against certain other diseases.  It caused by virus HIV (Human Immune Deficiency Virus).  It is retrovirus which affects and takes over certain cells of the immune system.  The HIV virus penetrates immunity enhancing cells.  It then makes new copies of itself and from there, goes on infecting other immunity cell.  This causes the infected cell to function improperly and prematurely.  This leads to weakening of the immune system thereby permitting all kinds of infection.<br/>1.2                   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>1.2.1    THE ORIGIN OF AIDS<br/>            No one knows exactly where the AIDS virus came from but many scientist think it originated in Africa.  One theory is that AIDS virus evolved from a similar, through harmless virus found in African Green Monkey.  According to this theory, soemtime in the past, one of the monkey viruses underwent a change mutatim that enabled it to survive in the human body.  This mutation was passed on to the virus’s “offspring” and eventually same of the mutated viruses found their way into the human body, perhaps as a result of a person being bitten by a eating a monkey (monkey brains are popularly found in Africa).  Once inside the human body, the virus may have mutated further until it become the virus known today as the AIDS virus.  Regardless of exactly where it started, AIDS is now a world wide problem.<br/>AIDS was first discovered in America in the year 1981 by Dr. Montegor of the California University.  But today, AIDS has been reported in over 100 countries of the world.<br/> 1.2.2    CAUSES OF AIDS<br/>            Most scientists believe that AIDS is caused by a type of germ known as a virus.  The virus has been given a number of different scientific names including: HTL V – III, LAV, ARV and HIV.  The most commonly known among these is HIV.<br/>HIV stands for<br/>H         -           Human<br/>I           -           Immunodeficiency<br/>V         -           Virus<br/>1.2.3    SYMPTOMS OF AIDS<br/>            It depends on which disease the person develops as the immune system break down.<br/>Most common symptoms are:<br/>i.                    Prolonged diarrhea<br/>ii.                  Swollen Lymph glands in the neck, armpits or elsewhere<br/>iii.                Unexplained weight loss<br/>iv.                Persistent dry cough<br/>v.                  Severe skin rashes which comes and goes<br/>vi.                Night sweat<br/>vii.              Extreme tiredness<br/>viii.            White patches inside the mouth<br/>ix.                Shortness of breath<br/>x.                  Proneness to different kinds of diseases like tuberculosis, cancer, pneumonia, chest infection, Meningitis.<br/>1.2.4    MODE OF SPREAD OF AIDS<br/>i.                    Sexual Intercourse (homo, heterc)<br/>ii.                  Prenatal transmission from mother to new born<br/>iii.                Blood transfusion<br/>iv.                Use of unsterilized equipment and contaminated needle<br/>v.                  Contact with blood of infected person<br/>1.2.5    HOW TO AVOID AIDS<br/>i.                    Avoid casual sex<br/>ii.                  Use condom if you must do it<br/>iii.                Treat sexually transmitted disease (STD) immediately<br/>iv.                Use screened blood and blood products<br/>v.                  Use sterilized equipment<br/>1.2.6    CURE FOR AIDS<br/>            Although a lot of claims have been made concerning discovery of cure of AIDS, there is AS YET, NO CURE OR VACCINE FOR AIDS. Only symptoms or diseases manifested by AIDS have cure that can prolong the life of the HIV Patient for a year or two.  But, they are extremely expensive, costing over $1,000 - $6,000 for a years does.  Thus, the way to combat AIDS is prevention through enlightenment.<br/>1.3       MOTIVATION<br/>            An epidemic is a disease out break for a period of time in a particular place or community.  And a pandemic is a disease outbreak across the globe.  HIV/AIDS is much worse than a pandemic.  An epidemic is controlled after sometime.  But even 241 years into the pandemic, the number of people affected by HIV/AIDS continues to grow at a phenomenal rate.

the company and transferred 51% of its shareholding to Eteroutremer Societe Anonyme of Belgium (now Etex Group S.A) and the balance of 49% went to the then Anambra and Imo State; now Anambra, Enugu, Imo, Abia and Ebonyi States.  As a result of the new shareholding arrangement, the company changed its name to Emenite Limited as its presently known.<br/>            Emenite Limited after being established in 1963 rolled out her first finished sheets in December that year.  The company has a total workforce as at its establishment of 67 staff, its second machine was installed in 1979 while the third was installed in 1983.  From a workforce of 67 to 225 staff, from one shift machine to three, from 14,000 tonnes of roofing and ceiling sheets to 50,000 tonnes per year.  The company has continued to grow tremendously.<br/>            The company has made considerable progress in terms of product development in the market.  It operates in the roofing and ceiling market, its range of products include: Bigsix &amp; standard ultimate corrugated sheets of different colours (Grey, Red &amp; Green), prestige concrete tile, Emcee flat sheet, duraceile decorative ceiling, Emlux decorative ceiling as well as Qualitile decorative ceiling and a new product called duratile.  These products are sold through a wide range of distribution network located in such a place that they will be close to project sites.  Emenite is 150 certified, 150 9002 in 1998, 180 9001 in 2002.<br/>            It is the company’s quality policy to provide high quality building products to the markets.  But much recently there have been complaints from building and construction companies over the quality durability of her products.  It is in view of this problem this research work is being undertaken.<br/>1.2       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            Consumers of goods and services rely on quality standard products displayed for consumers.  What is responsible for this trend?  Is statistical quality control standard still made use of in industries?  This are what this research project intend to solve and make appropriate recommendation.<br/>The project research will<br/>1.         Determine the process standards and establish the process capability<br/>2.         Check if the process average and variability are under control in respect of the measurement of flat sheet.<br/>3.         Check if the process average and variability are under control in respect of the measurement of corrugated sheets<br/>4.         Set up appropriate control charts for monitoring the future output of the process.<br/>1.3              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The significance of this research work is to provide information for the management to fine – tune its quality policy concerning their products as obtained in this analysis of this research work.  This will be of benefits t o the producers and consumers as well.<br/>1.4       STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM<br/>            There have been complaints and doubts that most asbestos roofing sheets in recent times full short of required standard, also whether established standardize are still maintained.  This was as a result of reported cases of easy damage and non-durable nature of these sheets.<br/>            In view of this, the researcher intends to carry out this research using Emenite Limited Enugu as a case study.<br/>1.5       RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS <br/>H0:       The process is under control in respect of the average and variability of the measurement of flat sheets.<br/>H1:     The process is not under control in respect of the average and variability of the measurement of flat sheets<br/>H0:     The process is under control in respect of the average and variability of the measurement of corrugated sheets<br/>H1:     The process is not under control in respect of the average and variability of the measurement of corrugated sheets.<br/>1.6      SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>           The scope of this study is limited to Emenite only in order to conclude the research work at the assigned period and the findings will be used to infer on the industry.<br/>1.7      DEFINITION OF KEY TERMS<br/>VARIATION:           This is a deviation from the normal standard or condition<br/>DATA:                      These are sets of figures, raw information that is yet to be processed.  e.g population data, employment data etc.<br/>CONTROL CHARTS:           It is the graphical display of the actual measurement of the characteristic on a chart showing limit which reflect the process capability on the particular quality characteristics.<br/>PROCESS CONTROL:         This is the act of observing the functions of each of the factors leading to the production of goods on a continuous basis to ensure the process or means of production are kept in optimum conditions.<br/>PRODUCT CONTROL:        Product control is the act of measuring or observing different attributes of quality specification of a product with the aim of ensuring that the product conform to specification.  This is done of taking a sample from a batch of inspection lot with the aim of accepting or rejecting it.<br/>STATISTICAL QUALITY CONTROL:      This is the technique of sampling at every stage of production and statistical inferences are taken about the variability of the product quality.<br/>PROCESS CAPABILITY:    This is the mini9mum spread of specific measurement variation which will include about 99.73% of all measurements from the process.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n\nA QUALITY ANALYSIS OF THE THICKNESS OF PART AND CORRUGATED ASBETES ROOFING SHEETS OF EMENITE LIMITED ENUGU<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary

we are living in a changing world is a popular statement which needs little explanation especially when the knowledge of today can be the fully of tomorrow or when a human being of today can oil to exist on the day that follows when such natural phenomena occur, one does not bother as to ask why these happen out when they are accompanied by abnormal happenings on become worried and asks why which he seldom finds and such is examination malpractice.<br/>            Examination malpractices in our tertiary institution have become a social molady which have adversely affected the have and have notes, the hardworking and society in general such corrupt practices have succeeded in tarnishing the past government and management of such institution employed different strategies to move up the shameful situation from our tertiary institution, but unfortunately all their efforts were uneventful or uncertainly.<br/> 1.2      BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/>            Some of the examination rules which one should not violate are.<br/>(a)                Avoiding conversation while examination is in progress<br/>(b)               Coming into the hall with you identity card <br/>(c)                Submitting answer script after proper endured before going out of the hall <br/>(d)               Refrain oneself from copying or writing for another obedience to the invigilator.<br/>(e)                Not coming to the hall with expected answer written as pieces of paper.<br/>As regards to these rules, one who violate them is likely to face the consequences for it by the committee.  The punishment depends on the magnitude of the offence. Some of the offence after being looked into by the committee one is asked to withdraw from the institution or stay back.  These culprit would not be caught without the proper vigilance of the invigilator or supervisor.  Therefore, having seen from above I can now say malpractice is legal action taken by a person in a position of trust.  This means when applied to examination situation that any contrary action performed by someone against certain examination regulation can be termed examination malpractice.<br/>Statistics has shown the examination malpractice became a very common they in early eighteen and as a result, the instant had to set up a coming that will have to be looking into these malpractice cases.  This committee was inaugurated in 1982/83 and was called “Examination Malpractice Committee”.<br/>This committee spells out the appropriate punishment for any culprits involve.<br/>According to the institution (IMT) academe and examination regulations prepared in June 1992, some of the regulation which candidates are required to comply with are. <br/>i.                    All students shall arrive at the designated examination hall thirty minutes before the scheduled time.<br/>ii.                  No student shall enter the hall unless they are asked to do so by the co-ordinator <br/>iii.                A student must enter examination hall with current original school fees receipt current identity card, pencil etc<br/>iv.                Calculator if required but not a programmable type<br/>v.                  Ruler and any other material table etc that may be permitted by the chief invigilator.<br/>vi.                If a candidate report to the examination without his/her I.D card, he/she should report to the chief – co-ordinators with a recent passport photograph endorsed by the it on<br/>If it is discovered that the person who wrote the examination is not the owner of the identity card, it became a case of impersonation.<br/>vii.              No candidate shall have other material in his/her possession, even a private letter, while he/she is inside the examination hall.<br/>viii.            No caps, head ties and sun-glasses shall be allowed and student writing the same paper shall not sit side by side.<br/>ix.                No candidate is allowed to enter the examination hall sixty 960) minutes after the examination hall is prohibited.<br/>x.                  Students are not allowed to tear any paper from either the question paper or answer script for any purpose including rough work.  All rough works must be done at the back of his/her answer scripts and then be cancelled.  No rough work is permitted on the question paper on the desk at his or palm or anything else other than the answer scrip.<br/>xi.                No student wishing to draw the attention            of invigilators to  any particular issue shall do only by raising his/her hand.<br/>xii.              No alteration or cancellation is allowed on the registration number and blank spaces must be ruled across by students.<br/>xiii.            All students in the examination hall entitled to sign the attendance shall I.D cards to the invigilator who will then sign your answer script indication that you are presence in the examination day.<br/>xiv.            Student shall ensure that they enter the question attempted in the appropriate columns on the front cover of the script.<br/>xv.              Student must rule across all blank spaces of the examination answer booklets used during the examination i.e. either by cheating, copying, using material etc other than the one specified.<br/>1.3       AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>The aims and objectives of this study are<br/>1.                  To find out whether examination malpractice depend on sex, school, academic level.<br/>2.                  To determine whether examination malpractice committee has helped to reduce examination malpractice in IMT.<br/>3.                  To know the commonest examination practice in IMT<br/>4.                  To determine the school/faculty that indulges most in examination malpractice in IMT and suggest why.<br/>5.                  To suggest its effect on the standard of education for example on IMT and to suggest ways of minimizing them.<br/>6.                  To find out whether lecturers has contributed to the examination.<br/>1.4       STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS<br/>1.         Null Hypothesis:         There is no significant different between exam misconduct and exam conduct.<br/>H1:       There is significant different between exam misconduct and exam conduct.<br/>2.         H0:       There is no significant different between examination and malpractice.<br/>            H1:       There is significant between examination and.<br/>1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            There are about thirty six (36) states in Nigeria including the Federal Capital Territory Abuja, however, the study was limited to Enugu State.  Enugu had been the capital of eastern region, and the economic operation that take place in other states of the federation is also carried out within the same socio – economic environment as a result, it was considered a fairly representative sample.<br/>            In other words as a result of the topic it serves that to some circumstances, 1 limited it to a particular school called IMT and limited to both female and male regular undergraduate.<br/>1.6       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            Examination malpractice can be seen as a short cut to academic glory and it can be seen as a good benefit to those whoever be involve in it.<br/>1.8       TERMINOLOGY ASSOCIATED WITH EXAM MALPRACTICE IN IMT <br/>EXAMINATION<br/>            A process of putting question forward in order to test knowledge or get information.<br/> IMPERSONATION<br/>            Impersonation is when somebody pretends to be or act the part of somebody else.<br/>            In this case of study, this simply means when a student that is convinced to be more intelligent enters into the examination hall to assist somebody that seems to be less privilege and regulation, governing examination.<br/>EXAM CONDUCT<br/>            Manner and ways exam are being scheduled and carried out effectively.  It is usually carried out at a given period according to the school calendar.<br/>MALPRACTICE COMMITTEE<br/>            These are set of people or group of people that are selected from various department which statistics is inclusive to into cases of people who view the case or different people.  This is as a result of new development from the accused that is not convincing enough to the management.<br/>EXAMS MISCONDUCT<br/>            This is going against the rules governing  an examination ie either by cheating, copying, using  material other than the one specified.<br/>SLANGS<br/>WHISTLING<br/>            Is another, which the candidate that is connects to exam malpractice adopts in drawing attention of his/her colleague to answer his/her demand base on the question on the exam paper which he know nothing or little about.<br/>            It happens that when this whistling occurs, the partner of the bearer is always alerted to supply any required material to satisfy the others need through any possible channel that is open him/her.<br/>BODY LANGUAGE OR SIGN LANGUAGE<br/>            This is a special act of examination malpractice which candidates commonly adopt during examination test.  This system of coding and decoding information through sign language and is widely spread out among students of exam malpractice in the examination hall believe that it is difficult understand what is happening in the examination premises.<br/>            Some of those signs could be raising up a finger tip of various types to indicate problems or translate reply information.<br/>RANXEROXING<br/>            Photocopying another candidates answer.<br/>GIRAFING<br/>            Elogation of one’s neck in order to copy another work.<br/>EXPO<br/>            A displayed answer to a question on a rough note or piece of paper, which have the contents of answering or relates ideas on any unknown examination question.<br/>GHOST CANDIDATE<br/>            It implies to a structure who appears to represent another with take identities with the claims of being the one partaking in examination on its own interest.<br/>MICROCHIPS                                                                <br/>            The most popular and most common cheating strategy is the possession of another person’s unauthorized material by somebody that relieve it or some body else is known as microchip otherwise known as “fast guy no be thief”.<br/>OMIKIRIKIRI<br/>            It is the act of using reminder.<br/>DIRECT ENTRY OR COUNTERFEIT FORMULA<br/>            It involves multiple registration, a situation where the student make dual registration, using a bongus number for the other.<br/>MASS

When is said voluntary I mean a condition where somebody chooses not to work because they have a means of support other than employment example is the idle rich man. On the other hand involuntary unemployment exists when persons who are willing to work at the prevailing rate of pay but unable to find work. (Anyanwu 1995).<br/>Balogun, (2003) also defined unemployment as the percentage of thelabour force that is without job, but is able and willing to work. In Nigeria however the ability and willingness to work is not sufficient. It is necessary for the unemployed to be registered with an employment bureau in order to be recognized as unemployed. Yet, from an economic viewpoint, the unregistered unemployed are part of the labour force and are, therefore, technically unemployed. In Nigeria, unemployment data are obtained through labour force sample surveys which ask if the respondent has worked in the week preceding the survey. However, the international labour organization (ILO), realizing the shortcomings of the labour survey as it affects developing economies, such as Nigeria, with a large informal sector, has encouraged a review of the methodology to incorporate further disaggregation of respondent responses to bring out the true rate of unemployment.<br/>In order to establish the type of unemployment existing in an economy, economists have classified unemployment as frictional, seasonal structural or cyclical.<br/>1. Frictional Unemployment occurs when people are temporarily out of work because they are changing jobs. This isunavoidable in an economy in which both the labour force and the jobs on offer are continually changing.<br/>2. Seasonal unemployment is said to occur in a situation in which people are laid off seasonally, due to the nature of the job they do, e.g. agriculture workers in developing countries may be laid off during the growing season.<br/>3. Structural unemployment is the unemployment that exists when an economy is in full employment. Structural unemployment occurs where employment in one or more declining industries is falling.<br/>It is as result of movement in the natural employment rate itself, which can result from changes in labour market institutions, demographic shifts etc. this situation is brought about by economic variables, such as the level of aggregate demand and the actual and/or expected real wage rate.<br/>4. Cyclical unemployment occurs as result of fluctuations around the natural employment rate, which can be attributed to changes in aggregate demand.<br/>Industrial relations refer to the process of conflict resolution, such as collective bargaining, between employers and employees in the course of fulfilling an employment contact. It could be achieved either by conquest (when one party overwhelms the other), or by mutual consent. The latter, preferred outcome is likely to result from collective bargaining. Continuous industrial harmony is, therefore, often the result of positive industrial relations.<br/>In Nigeria, unemployment is regarded as one of the most challenging economics problem facing the federal government. Although, there are variations in the measurement of unemployment, official estimates show their results as follows: from 1985-2003, the data shows a highly fluctuation trend from both the urban and rural sectors of the economy. From the data, the 1985 figure shows the percentage of the national urban and rural unemployment as follows: national 6.10%, urban 9.8% rural 5.2%and in year figure is as follows: national 3% urban 3.8% rural 2.7 %( CBN 2004).<br/>The rising rate of the population of the country which is faster than the job opportunities, a situation in which birth rate is rising, death rate falling and the population growth rate is between 2.5% and 3% unemployment is bound to exist. There had been also a total neglect of the agricultural sectors and other sectors that could have reduce the rate of unemployment in the country and consequent mass exodus of able bodied youths from the rural to urban areas in search of the non-existing white cooler jobs.<br/>This further reduces employment in agriculture and puts pressure on existing urban jobs (Anyanwu 1995).<br/>1.1 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Unemployment has reached a very alarming proportion in Nigeria, with a greater number of the unemployment being primary and secondary school leavers and university graduates. This situation has recently been compounded by the increasing unemployment of professionals such as bankers, engineers and doctors and other professions both skilled and unskilled persons.  The toll is within the productive segment of the Nigeria population (Vision 2010).<br/>The extent of unemployment in Nigeria is not justified by the available financial statistics phenomenon. This is because of the nature of unemployment in the country where many job seekers do not see the need for registration as unemployed persons necessary due to expression of futility in such exercise. This harnesses the sharp disparity between the official statistics on the phenomenon and the reality on ground (Bello 2003). Disguised unemployment otherwise known as concealedunemployment is a situation in which more people are available for work than is shown in the unemployment statistics (Bannock et el 1998).<br/>The problem of disguised unemployment is quite acute in Nigeria. This explains why official unemployment statistics sharply differs from the true state of employed or unofficial statistic available. The recorded figure unemployment significantly understates the number of people who are actually willing to work at the existing set of wage rate. Consequently, the unemployment figure in Nigeria is obtained through labour force sample survey, by asking if the person has worked in the past week preceding the survey.<br/>Obviously, because even a graduate whohawks around respond yes to the question, the unemployment rate will always be very low.<br/>Unemployment is a situation of a labourforce not having enough paid work or not doing work that makes full use of his skills and ability. It can be measured by the numbers of hours worked per week.<br/>Generally in Nigeria, the official period of working time per week is forty hours which manyworkers fall short of due to non–availability of work. In some instance available work is rationed especially among the low skilled and casual labourers in the formal sector tends to be worse (Bello 2003) therefore the major problem we have in Nigeria is the distinguished unemployment form. The official figures of the rate of unemployment fromDecember1998, a total of 66.3% of male and 62.0% of female unemployment were recorded at the urban centres while rural centreshad an estimate of 47.1% and 45%male and female job seekers respectively. As at December 1999, school leavers’unemployment rate had raised to 67.0% for males and 68.8% for females in the urban centres while the rural centres was as high as 59.1 and 55.7%. For male and female respectively (Bello 2003).For polytechnic and university graduates, the figures shows relatively low unemployment rate as compared to the school leavers experience. For instance, during the period under investigation a peak of 14.0% rate of unemployment was recorded for polytechnic female graduate in 1998 while the male graduate records had its peak in 1999 with 15.0% point in urban areas (Bello 2003). The graduate unemployment rate in the urban centres had 8.5 per cent record high in September 1999 for males and 4.5%in June 1999for female during the periods (Bello 2003).<br/>Many people are frustrated by lack of employmentsopportunities they include those without work and those who have jobs but want to work longer hours or more intensively. A considerable size of utilized and underutilized labour abounds in Nigeria and which ought to be brought into the circle. These shows that Nigeria’sunemployment problem has become chronic and should be a matter of utmost national concern.<br/> 1.2AIM AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The aim of the study is to ascertain the rate of unemployment in the country<br/>This current study will be conducted with the objective of:<br/>1. Determining the relationship between unemployment and economic growth in Nigeria.<br/>2. Ascertaining the magnitude of this relationship<br/>3. Determining if the unemployment rate is in an increasing trend or a decreasing trend.<br/>1.3 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>One of the macroeconomics goals of any country is the actualization of full employment. Therefore, unemployment in any system is seen as a policy failure and should be eradicated from the system. The significance of the study is as follows:<br/>The study will be of great importance to students in a way that it brings out the picture of unemployment in the country and make them think of better ways of being self-employed and employment creators instead of depending solely on the government for their employment.<br/>The study will be significant to the staff of Nigeria Bureau of Statistics (NBS) by showing clearly the trend of unemployment in Nigeria either in an increasing or reducing trend.<br/>The study will be significant to the general public because it will show clearly the rate of unemployment in the country so as to make the general public draft out alternatives means of creating jobs for themselves instead of relying solely on the government.<br/>The study will `be significance to the government by providing government with knowledge of the state of unemployment rate in the country so as to enable the government provide programmes and initiatives like poverty eradication progammes and other programmes to control and eradicate the rate of unemployment in the country.<br/>The study will also be of great significance to scholars and researchers because it will be as a guide to them to enhance further research on the topic.<br/>1.4    SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is carried out with a scope of data ranging from 1970-2010.<br/>The limitation of the study is the inability to get data before the scope date of 1970 which is as a result of lack of record keeping from the authorities responsible for record keeping and also data after the scope date of 2010 which is as a result of data coalition process.<br/>The second constraint to this research was finance and time. The time allowed for the completion of this work was short, coupled with the fact that other academic work were in progress. This research is however limited to data obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics headquarters Abuja.<br/>1.5DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Work force: It is the total number of people employed or seeking employment in a country or region.

ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>            National income is the sum of the money value of all the commodities and services produced in a country within a particular period of time usually one year.<br/>            The question of how an economy grows could come to mind at this juncture.  It the amount of goods and services produced by an economy increases.  If it does not increase yearly, it is not growing, even if it is growing, the rate of growth may not be uniform among years.  Therefore it may not be possible to determine the condition of the economy.<br/>            In any case, an economy needs an indicator for measuring economy growth, this indicator is the monetary summation at all the commodities and service produced in an economy within a particular period of time usually a year.<br/>            To get national income of a country like Nigeria for instance, we take the list of the goods and services produced in the country during the year, assign values to them and add up.  If we can do this year after year, we shall be able to make comparison of activities of Nigeria year after year.  Then we can decisively determine whether the economy of Nigeria is growing, declining or stagnant.  It is growing if the National income increases year after year, declining, if the National income is decreasing and stagnant it there is no difference in the National Income for years.<br/>            In measuring National Income, an indicator called Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is used at current price.  It is therefore quite important here to point out the role that prices could play in the measurement of National Income.  Prices of goods and services changes from time to time.  These changes can affect any attempted estimates.  Considerably.  Therefore to get an idea of the real physical change in National Income from year to year, effect of price changes must be removed.<br/>            National Income should be measured in real terms and allow for changes in price levels.  For instance whenever the economy experiences inflation, price rises while the quantities of goods and services may remain constant.  Let us say that 2000, the total units of the go0ods and services realized in Nigeria amounted to 50,000 units and also 50,000 units in 2001.  Let us further assume that the average per unit in 2000 was N10.00 while the price in 2001 was N15,000.<br/>            Nigeria’s income with GDP as an indicator for 2000 was 50,000 units X N10.00 = N5000,000 Nigeria’s income with GDP as an indicator for 2001 was 50,000 units X N15.00 = N750,000.<br/>            If the two figures were presented to a layman as final products of overall estimates for 2000 and 2001, he would be tempted to say that the National income for 2001 was higher than that of 2000.  This is so monetarily but really the income for both year are equal.  The difference in value was due to rise in p rice in 2001 while the quantities of goods and services were the same in both years.<br/>            The same thing can be applicable when a country experience deflation or depression.  Therefore in measuring national income for different years using gross domestic product as an indicator effects of price changes must be given the normal due.  In so doing the changes in economy can be determined appropriately.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM/MOTIVATION<br/>            As a result of poor economic condition in Nigeria relevant information is of great interest to me for investigation if viable economic solution can be revealed.<br/>            Nigeria considered as one of the third world countries is been assessed by their income yearly.  It is a simple logic of our living that it country’s income is high with considerable population, the enjoyment of the citizens of that country would be high, while the enjoyment is low with low national income.  It is on this point that I find it very expedient to analyze the national income of Nigeria and make necessary recommendation for the improvement of the economy for the betterment of the citizenry.<br/> AIMS AND OBJECTIVES <br/>            In view of Nigeria’s economic predicament, the project is aimed at investigating the relationship existing between disposable income, savings and government final expenditure for the purpose of suggesting solutions to our economic problems.<br/>            After the regression analysis had been carried out, it will supply solution to the following questions:<br/>1.                  Is any linear relationship between the variables listed?<br/>2.                  How reliable is our regression coefficient?<br/>3.                  Can we predict the future value of dependent variable?<br/>4.                  How reliable will be our estimate?<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The study is centre on “National Income, Savings and Government Final Consumption Expenditure Covering the period of six years 1998 – 2003.<br/>            The raw data used are collected as primary data by federal office of statistics” publication and Federal Ministry of Finance Publication.  The data are collected as primary data by federal office of statistics and used as secondary data in this project which centered on national Accounts.  Some of these National Accounts Aggregates Include Gross Domestic Product (GDP) final consumption expenditure, exports and imports.<br/>            National Accounts data presents the record of economic transaction of the economic in a systematic manner and show the relationship between the various components of the economy.  Economic transaction cover all the activities of an entity (Household, government, firm, financial institution) that are of economic nature (production, consumption distribution, savings and foreign exchange transactions.  These economic transactions of all the entiti8tes and combined together ad presented inform of account.<br/>            Data collected for analysis in this study center on:-<br/>1.                  Appropriation of disposable income as dependent variable.<br/>2.                  Savings as one of the independent variable<br/>3.                  Government final consumption expenditure as another independent variable.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The study will help to know the status of Nigeria economy.  The knowledge of the status will help to make necessary recommendation in order to revitalize the poor economic condition of the country for the better future.<br/>            The study will also create avenue for future research.<br/>DEFINITION OF CONCEPTS<br/>Gross Domestic Product (GDP):     This is the sum of the money value of all locally produced goods and services.  It does not include international transaction.  GDP does not make allowance for depreciation of capital.<br/>Gross National Product (GNP):      This is the total money value of current market prices of all final goods and services produced by the nationals during a specific period.  It includes net income from abroad in respect of the country’s nationals without any consideration for depreciation of capital.<br/>National Domestic Product (NDP): This is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a period of time.  It exclude the value of the net earnings and incomes from abroad.  An allowance being made for depreciation of capital.<br/>Net National Product (NNP):           This is the monetary value of all goods and services produced within the country during a specific period.  It includes net incomes and earning from abroad and provision being made for the replacement of depreciation of capital.<br/>Disposable Income (DPI):     This is the amount of money per year that private sector are free to spend when depreciation of capital, all taxes, all net profits made by firms but not paid out as divided are added to the disposable and transfer payment subtracted.  We arrive at gross national product.<br/>Net Economic Welfare (NEW):                   This examines those factors not considered when calculating the Gross National Product (GNP).  Such factors include social cost 9pollution) and leisure time the net economic welfare tend to remove the product (GNP).  A nation might have a very high GNP at a very great social cost as pollution, rising crime etc.<br/>Per Capita Income (PCI)      This is the gross domestic product divided by the population of the country.  Per capita income can be calculated once the population and gross domestic product are known.  So that P.C.I = GDP<br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nREGRESSION ANALYSIS ON NATIONAL INCOME (FROM 1998 - 2003) \r\n(A CASE OF FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF

The study adopted Analysis of variance Specification model.  the work shows that small scale industries significantly contributed to the economic growth in Nigeria despite lowbenefits from SMEDAN services and poor funding from banks in some states. The work recommends among others that government should improve its monetary policies so as to reduce to an acceptable level, the rate of interests charged by commercial banks as well as encouraging rural based industrialization, whereby investors are encouraged to establish small and medium scale industries that would be based entirely on local raw materials, machines and equipment.<br/>The research shows that there exist a margin between the number of micro enterprises which have benefited from SMEDAN services andnumber of micro enterprises which have not benefited from SMEDAN servicesas against  the total number of Small and Medium enterprises in the country within the period of this survey . This  indicates to a high extent that even with  the invention of BIC’s (Business Information Centres) in the 6 geopolitical zones.

Nowadays, it has become an indispensable tool of investigation and research in virtually every day of human activities. Most statistical analysis methods are concerned with making inference from the observed data.  That is, drawing valid conclusion using sample information.<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br/>The small and medium enterprises development of Nigeria (SMEDAN) is a major structure designed to provide institutional support for Small and Medium scale industries. It was established in Nigeria in 2003.<br/>Responsibilities of SMEDAN<br/>•       Initiating and articulating ideas for SME’s policy thrust<br/>•       Overseeing, monitoring and co-coordinating the development of the SME sector.<br/>•       Promoting and providing access to industrial infrastructure such as layouts.<br/>•       Policy development.<br/>The dearth and paucity of credible and reliable MSME database is one of the main constraints to evolving a strategic action plan towards an efficient and sustainable MSME sector.<br/>This survey conducted by the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency Of Nigeria in collaboration with National Bureau Of Statistics covers business enterprises in Nigeria employing below 200 persons (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises). The survey was conducted in all the 36 States of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The pre-test was conducted in Lagos and Kano states. For micro enterprises (employing 1-9 persons) data were canvassed through the National Integrated Survey of Household (NISH) Schedule. Also rural and urban areas where small (employing 10-49 persons) and medium (employing 50-199 persons) enterprises are located were covered through the National Integrated Survey of Establishment (NISE) Module.<br/>Thirty Enumeration Areas comprising of 3 replicates in which each replicates contain 10 Enumeration Areas were selected per state and FCT, Abuja. These replicates are subsets of twenty (20) with each state of the Federation and FCT, Abuja having Ten micro enterprises which were systematically selected per Enumeration, Area making a total of 300 micro enterprises visited in each state and FCT, Abuja.<br/> 1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The research question from the above experience is thus; with the enumerated benefits of SMEDAN, has it contributed significantly to the small and medium scale entrepreneurs across the 36 states? This is to checkmate their contribute to the economic growth in Nigeria?<br/>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY.<br/>The main objective of the study is to apply statistical techniques inexamining the benefit of Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN)on entrepreneurs across 36 states.This is in order to ascertain how small and medium scale enterprises have contributed using the available services which SMEDAN has made available with a view to achieve gradual formalization in the quest for National Economic growth. Meanwhile, the specific objectives are:<br/>a. To determine the level ofbenefit from SMEDAN services across the Nigerian states.<br/>b. To examine the effect of poor financing/monitoring of small and medium scale enterprises on the Nigerian State.<br/>c. To suggest possible measures that will aid the growth of MSMEs in rural/urban areas.<br/>1.4 STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS.<br/>For the purpose of this study, the research developed the following hypothesis.<br/>H0: There is no significant difference in the level of benefit from SMEDAN  services to entrepreneurs in the Nigerian states.<br/>H1: There is a significant difference in the level of benefit from SMEDAN  services to entrepreneurs in Nigerian states.<br/>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The significance of the study is to establish an extent of growth and development and to expose the immense benefit derivable from small and medium scale industries.<br/>Also, this study will help to redress the belief of the society that small and medium scale industries can bring about economic and development in Nigeria.<br/>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY.<br/>The study will broaden the knowledge of the researcher as well as contribute to the existing literature on the subject matter, by providing an expository analysis of the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency Of Nigeria (SMEDAN) and its benefit as a Government institution to the economic growth of Nigeria. This will in turn enhance policy formation in the country as well as address economic challenges of MSMEs in general.<br/>It will also be an individual tool for students, academic institutions and individuals who wish to know more about the roles, contributions and benefits of SMEDAN on the Nigeria economy in the 36 states of the federation.  This project is not beyond the data collected from the National Bureau Of Statistics.<br/> 1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>SME          -Small and medium enterprise<br/>SMEDAN    -Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency of

a member of the Beligian Etex Group started operation in 1963 under the name “Turners Asbestos Cement Company Nigeria Limited: The company was incorporated in 1961 with registration number RC 2712.<br/>            The group came to Nigeria with the establishment of her first of four companies in Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria Limited.  The other three are Eternite Limited, Sapele, Giwarite Limited, Kano and Emenite Limited, Enugu.<br/>            Emenite Limited after being established have to following as shareholders.<br/>Turners &amp; Newall Ltd                         -           80%<br/>Government of Eastern Nigeria                      -           20%<br/>             As a result of the indigenization decree of 1973, the shareholders of the company changed as follows<br/>            Turners &amp; Newall Ltd                                     -           60%<br/>            Government of Eastern Nigeria                      -           40%<br/>With the name of the company changing to Turners Building Product (Emene) Limited.<br/>            Due to dwindling fortunes of the company, in March 24, 1988 Turners and Newall Ltd divested its interest in the company and transferred 51% of its shareholding to Eteroutremer Societe Anonyme of Belgium (now Etex Group S.A) and the balance of 49% went to the then Anambra and Imo State; now Anambra, Enugu, Imo, Abia and Ebonyi States.  As a result of the new shareholding arrangement, the company changed its name to Emenite Limited as its presently known.<br/>            Emenite Limited after being established in 1963 rolled out her first finished sheets in December that year.  The company has a total workforce as at its establishment of 67 staff, its second machine was installed in 1979 while the third was installed in 1983.  From a workforce of 67 to 225 staff, from one shift machine to three, from 14,000 tonnes of roofing and ceiling sheets to 50,000 tonnes per year.  The company has continued to grow tremendously.<br/>            The company has made considerable progress in terms of product development in the market.  It operates in the roofing and ceiling market, its range of products include: Bigsix &amp; standard ultimate corrugated sheets of different colours (Grey, Red &amp; Green), prestige concrete tile, Emcee flat sheet, duraceile decorative ceiling, Emlux decorative ceiling as well as Qualitile decorative ceiling and a new product called duratile.  These products are sold through a wide range of distribution network located in such a place that they will be close to project sites.  Emenite is 150 certified, 150 9002 in 1998, 180 9001 in 2002.<br/>            It is the company’s quality policy to provide high quality building products to the markets.  But much recently there have been complaints from building and construction companies over the quality durability of her products.  It is in view of this problem this research work is being undertaken.<br/>1.2       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            Consumers of goods and services rely on quality standard products displayed for consumers.  What is responsible for this trend?  Is statistical quality control standard still made use of in industries?  This are what this research project intend to solve and make appropriate recommendation.<br/>The project research will<br/>1.         Determine the process standards and establish the process capability<br/>2.         Check if the process average and variability are under control in respect of the measurement of flat sheet.<br/>3.         Check if the process average and variability are under control in respect of the measurement of corrugated sheets<br/>4.         Set up appropriate control charts for monitoring the future output of the process.<br/>1.3              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The significance of this research work is to provide information for the management to fine – tune its quality policy concerning their products as obtained in this analysis of this research work.  This will be of benefits t o the producers and consumers as well.<br/>1.4       STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM<br/>            There have been complaints and doubts that most asbestos roofing sheets in recent times full short of required standard, also whether established standardize are still maintained.  This was as a result of reported cases of easy damage and non-durable nature of these sheets.<br/>            In view of this, the researcher intends to carry out this research using Emenite Limited Enugu as a case study.<br/>1.5       RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS <br/>H0:       The process is under control in respect of the average and variability of the measurement of flat

OF THE STUDY<br/>           The scope of this study is limited to Emenite only in order to conclude the research work at the assigned period and the findings will be used to infer on the industry.<br/>1.7      DEFINITION OF KEY TERMS<br/>VARIATION:           This is a deviation from the normal standard or condition<br/>DATA:                      These are sets of figures, raw information that is yet to be processed.  e.g population data, employment data etc.<br/>CONTROL CHARTS:           It is the graphical display of the actual measurement of the characteristic on a chart showing limit which reflect the process capability on the particular quality characteristics.<br/>PROCESS CONTROL:         This is the act of observing the functions of each of the factors leading to the production of goods on a continuous basis to ensure the process or means of production are kept in optimum conditions.<br/>PRODUCT CONTROL:        Product control is the act of measuring or observing different attributes of quality specification of a product with the aim of ensuring that the product conform to specification.  This is done of taking a sample from a batch of inspection lot with the aim of accepting or rejecting it.<br/>STATISTICAL QUALITY CONTROL:      This is the technique of sampling at every stage of production and statistical inferences are taken about the variability of the product quality.<br/>PROCESS CAPABILITY:    This is the mini9mum spread of specific measurement variation which will include about 99.73% of all measurements from the

STUDY)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This study examined the birth pattern in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) using the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital (UATH) as a case study. Data was collected on two hundred (200) neonates from the hospital. The research studied the effect of some factors on  birth weight of neonates, the factors includes the age of the mother, parity, mother’s height, gestation period and mother’s weight at gestation. A regression model was also estimated which was used to forecast. The study showed that the gestation period has a positive linear relationship with the birth weight judging by the correlation value between the two variables at 0.434. The birth weight of a child also showed dependency on the weight of the mother at gestation. The forecast generated also showed that an increment in the gestational period of a child brings about an increase in birth weight and same thing goes for the maternal weight. Based on the outcome of the research, it was recommended that the government should try to create awareness for the Nigeria populace especially the expectant mothers to visit the maternity homes more often for pre-natal and ante-natal care.<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0    BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>In 1948, the first World Health Assembly adopted an international definition of prematurity as birth weight of 2.5kilograms or less (UN (2004)). It was however discovered that in developing countries the use of this standard resulted in an unusually high proportion of `premature' babies most of who were not born prematurely (Yilgwanet.al. ,2004). The World Health Organization (WHO) in 1994 then conducted a study on eighteen different countries at different stages of development. This revealed that babies could be classified into three main groups based on their birth weight and gestational age: Small for gestational age, appropriate for age, large for age. Low birth weight was then defined as those babies weighing less than 2.5kilograms within twenty four hours of birth. This group of babies can either be small for age or appropriate for age and they are usually at high risk of dying in their first twenty eight days of life from factors like hypoglycaemia, sepsis, respiratory distress, prematurity etc. In Nigeria, neonatal death (death of an infant in the first twenty eight days of live) contributes about 25% of the total infant mortality with prematurity and low birth weight being the main contributor to these high neonatal deaths(Grange, 2006).<br/>A reduction of at least one-third in the proportion of infants with low birth weight is one of the seven major goals for the current decade of the “A World Fit for Children” programme of the United Nations. Moreover, nutritional deprivation — the major determinant of low birth weight — is a clear obstacle to the attainment of many of the Millennium Development Goals. Monitoring improvements in low birth weight is thus being given high priority within the UN system, as well as by national governments and the international nutrition community.<br/>Although the significance and interpretation of low birth weight has recently been debated, most experts agree that weight at birth is an indicator of a new born's chances for survival, growth, long-term health and psychosocial development. Babies whose birth weight is low as a result of undernourishment face a greatly increased risk of death during their first months and years of life(Bale et.al.,2003, UN, 2000, Allen &amp; Gillespie, 2001). The evidence also suggests that those children who do survive may be more likely to experience health problems throughout their lives; these include impaired cognitive development, as well as diabetes and coronary heart disease in adulthood(Bhargavaet.al., 2004, Barker, 2003). Low birth weight in developing countries occurs primarily because of poor maternal health and nutrition. A variety of socioeconomic, medical, and psychosocial factors are known to increase the risk of low birth weight, but prevention programs aimed at primarily high-risk subgroups have been largely ineffective.<br/>In addition, diseases such as diarrhoea, malaria and respiratory infections, which are common in many developing countries, can significantly impair foetal growth when women become infected during pregnancy (Bale et.al.2003, UN 2000). In Nigeria just like in many developing countries, low birth weight is a significant contributor to the overall infant mortality rate and a major factor in the high neonatal mortality rate currently seen.<br/>This research work however seeks to check for the dependence of birth weight on some factors which may affect it such as parity, maternal height, maternal age, gestation period, and gestation weight using the Chi-Square test of independence, regression analysis to see possible statistical relationships if any exists among the variables in question.<br/>1.1    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>This current study will be conducted with the sole aim of assessing the impact of:<br/>i.      Birth-weight on maternal age<br/>ii.      Birth-weight on Parity<br/>iii.     Birth weight on Gestational age<br/>iv.     Birth-weight on Maternal weight<br/>v.     Birth weight on Maternal height<br/>vi.     And finally, to estimate a model which will be able to predict an infant’s birth weight from afore mentioned factors.<br/>1.2    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This research work explores the dependency of child’s birth weight on some factors which may affect it, therefore it will be significant to medical practitioners, maternity specialists and potential parents. It will also be of great benefits to future researchers who wish to explore issues concerning birth weight of a child.<br/>1.3    SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>The prevalence of low birth weight in Nigeria has been put previously at 16%, 9% and 12% (UNICEF 2001, 2003). Every single day, Nigeria loses about 2,300 under-five year olds. This may be associated with the incidence of low birth weight in the country, thus making the country the second largest contributor to under-five mortality in the whole world (UNICEF, 2008).<br/>Hence, the importance of this study cannot be overemphasized; this research paper seeks to investigate some factors which may affect the birth weight from the statistical perspective.<br/>This research is however limited to data obtained from the University of Abuja teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada, Abuja.<br/>1.4    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>•       Neonates: This refers

According to (UNCTAD 2012) Nigeria received a net inflow of US$85.73. Unlike other studies this research extended the period of investigation to 2013 given that the Nigeria economic environment under investigation most likely has changed over the years.<br/>The research employed ordinary least square (OLS) regression technique to analyze the time series data from 1980 – 2013, GDP and CPNG where used as the dependent variable, while interest rate, balance of payment, exchange rate and foreign direct investment where used as the independent variables. The unit root test showed that all the series where stationary after their first difference, and the cointegration test showed that there exist a long run relationship between the variables. The regression results revealed a positive relationship between FDI and GDP, and as well FDI and CPNG. In conclusion the research recommends that there should be provision of adequate infrastructure and good government policies that will attract more foreign investment into the country for sustainable growth and development of the economy.<br/> TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE – INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0     Background Information<br/>1.1        Statement of the problem<br/>1.2        Research Methodology<br/>1.2.1  Model Specification<br/>1.3.    Objectives of the study<br/>1.4     Significance Of The Study<br/>1.5     Scope Of The Study<br/>1.6       Limitation of the study<br/>1.7       Research Hypothesis<br/>1.8       Definition of terms<br/>CHAPTER TWO – LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>2.0Introduction<br/>2.1 Review of Related Literature<br/>2.2   Factors Inhibiting Foreign Direct Investment Inflow into Nigeria<br/>2.3   Gains of Foreign Direct Investment<br/>CHAPTER THREE – RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>3.0     Introduction<br/>3.1     Model Specification<br/>3.2     Statistical Criterial<br/>3.3     Unit Root Test<br/>3.4     Cointegration Test<br/>3.5     Vector Error Correction Model<br/>3.6     Statistical package used<br/>3.7     Regression Analysis<br/>3.8     Multiple Linear Regression Model<br/>3.8.1 Basic Assumption of Multiple Linear Regression Model<br/>3.9     Estimate of Multiple Regression Equation<br/>3.10   Properties of Ordinary Least Square Estimator<br/>CHAPTER FOUR – DATA ANALYSIS, PRESENTATION OF RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION<br/>4.0     Introduction<br/>4.1     Presentation and Interpretation of Results<br/>4.2     Test for Stationarity<br/>4.3     Test for Cointegraton (Johansen Approach)<br/> 4.4    Vector Error Correction Model<br/>4.5     Residual Diagnostic Test<br/>4.6     Regression Results<br/>4.7     Test of Significance of the Parameters for Model I<br/>4.8     Test of Significance of the Parameters for Model II<br/>CHAPTER FIVE – SUMMARY OF RESULTS, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS<br/>5.0     Summary<br/>5.1     Conclusion<br/>5.3     Recommendations<br/>          Reference<br/>          Appendix I<br/>LIST OF TABLE<br/>1.

In other word, foreign direct investment implies foreign private investment. Foreign investment can be defined as the package of foreign resources comprising equity capital, reinvested earnings, or net borrowing of subsidiaries of foreign companies from their parents companies or affiliates.<br/>In Nigeria, FDI is defined as an investment undertaken by an enterprise that is either wholly or partly foreign owned. Foreign investment inflow, particularly foreign direct investment (FDI) is perceived to have positive impact on economic growth on the host country through various direct and indirect channels. Some of the positive impact of foreign direct investment in a country like Nigeria is in the area of employment creation, transfer of technology, increased domestic competition and other positive externalities (Anyanwala, 2007).<br/>FDI augments domestic investment which is crucial to the attainment of sustained economic growth and development. Nigeria is one of the greatest economies with great demand for goods and services and has attracted some FDI over the past decades. In Nigeria foreign direct investment increased from less than US$1billiion in 1990 to US$1.2 billion in 2000, US$1.9 billion in 2004, US$2.3 billion in 2005 and US$4.5 billion in 2006 according to United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD, 2007) and (CBN, 2006). As percentage of GDP, there has been a remarkable increase in FDI in recent times. The portfolio investment has also followed in the same direction, growing from US$0.2 billion in 2003 to US$0.92 billion in 2006 (UNCTAD 2007). Economic reforms and the resulting of macroeconomic stability have been adduced as reason for this, all leading to high confidence in Nigeria economy.<br/>According to (UNCTAD, 2012), Nigeria received a net inflow of US$85.73 billion of foreign direct investment (FDI), much of which were from Nigerians in the Diaspora. Most FDI was directed towards energy and banking sectors.<br/>The Nigeria Enterprise Promotion (NEP) Decree in 1972 (reviewed in 1977) was intended to reduced foreign direct investment in the Nigeria economy, this type of policy was not relevant in an economy with a rapidly growing force. Although one may accept the rationale for the promulgation of that decree, however, any exchange control policy that has the potential to discourage foreign investment will counter productivity under this present economic situation of the country. Hence the abrogation of the NEP decree was therefore a step in the right direction.<br/>Foreign direct investment (FDI) is arguably an important source of employment opportunities for developing countries like Nigeria; hence it is imperative that the federal government promote a healthy private sector that can earn a reasonable rate of return.<br/>Developing countries that wish to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow should consider measures such as establishing a transparent legal framework that does not discriminate between local and foreign investors, adopting liberal foreign regime e.g. regime without large gaps between official and market rates, creating simple investment friendly regulations and institutions and effective administering them such that the rate of FDI inflow into the country will improve appreciably.<br/>1.1     Statement of the Problem<br/>One of the major economic problems in less developed countries (LCD) is low capital formation to finance the necessary investments for economic growth and as such there is need to analyze the impact of FDI on economic growth in Nigeria.<br/>Although there have been a good number of studies on foreign direct investment and economic growth in Nigeria but the existing empirical evidence on their long-run relationship has been inconclusive and as such there is no consensus among researchers in relation to the period under review, it is against this backdrop that this project work is being proposed.<br/>The research questions under consideration are:<br/>1.       What is the significant impact of FDI on Nigeria’s economic growth?<br/>2.       What are the measure that could facilitate the steady inflow of FDI into the Nigeria economy?<br/>3.       What is the long-term relationship between FDI and economic growth in Nigeria?<br/> 1.2     RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>The statistical technique that was employed in this study is regression analysis using time series data from 1980 – 2013.<br/> 1.2.1  MODEL SPECIFICATION<br/> The model examined the relationship between FDI as it affects the economic growth of Nigeria between 1980 – 2013. GDP and CPNG were used as the dependent variable as a function of independent variables which are FDI, BOP, EXR and INTR.<br/>Model I<br/>GDP = F (FDI, BOP, EXR, INTR) -------------------------------------------(1.1)<br/>Yt = βo + β1X1t + β2X2t + β3X3t + β4X4t + ?t -------------------------------(1.2)<br/>Hence:         GDPt = βo + β1FDIt + β2BOPt + β3EXRt +β4INTRt +?t ----(1.3)<br/>GDP: Real Gross Domestic Product.<br/>FDI:   Foreign Direct Investment.<br/>BOP: Balance of Payment.<br/>EXR: Official Exchange Rate.<br/>INTR: Interest rate.<br/>?t: Error term.<br/>β0is the constant term and β1,β2, β3, β4 are the regression coefficients.<br/>The impact of FDI on oil and gas sector was also ascertained for the period under study.<br/>Model II<br/>CPNG = F (FDI, BOP, EXR, INTR) -----------------------------------------(1.4)<br/>Yt =  o +  1X1t +  2X2t +  3X3t +  4X4t + ?t -------------------------  (1.5)<br/>Hence:  CPNGt =  o +  1FDIt +  2BOPt +  3EXRt +  4INTRt + ?t -  (1.6)<br/>CPNG: Crude petroleum and Natural gas.<br/>FDI:   Foreign Direct Investment.<br/>BOP: Balance of Payment.<br/>EXR: Official Exchange Rate.<br/>INTR: Interest Rate.<br/>?t:      Error term.<br/> 0is the Constant term, and  1 2,  3and 4 are the regression coefficients.<br/>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/> The general objective of this work is to assess the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the economic growth of Nigeria. Other specific objectives are:<br/>1.       To ascertain the impact of FDI on oil and gas sector of Nigeria economy.<br/>2.       To determine the impact of FDI on balance of payment and exchange rate in the Nigeria economy.<br/>3.       To suggest measures for facilitating the steady inflow of FDI into Nigerian economy.<br/>1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The research work will be a source of information to policy makers; will broaden the knowledge of researchers as well as contribute to the existing literature on the subject matter by providing an expository analysis of the pattern of FDI in Nigeria economy. This will enhance policy formulation and also address some of our economic challenges in general. It will also be an invaluable tool for students, academics, institutions and individuals that want to know more about the relationship between foreign direct investment and economic growth.<br/>1.5     SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The research work focused on the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the economic growth of Nigeria only, using time series data for a period of 34years i.e (1980 – 2013) and FDI, GDP, BOP, and EXR as macroeconomic variable for the analysis.<br/>1.6     LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>An academic research of this nature is bound to be constrained by a number of factors, such factors are as follows:<br/>i.        Financial constraint<br/>ii.       Time factor<br/>In general this study is limited in scope to Nigeria alone, as it only focuses on the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the growth of Nigeria economy, it is also limited in temporal scope to 34 years during the period of 1988 – 2013, the model estimated in this research work, made use of FDI, EXR, and BOP as the only independent variables while GDP and % of oil and gas in GDP are used as the dependent variable. If there was enough time and resources, the researcher would also examine the effect of FDI on economy of other nations of the world in other to have a cross country analysis.<br/>1.7     RESEARCH HYPOTHESES<br/>The main argument of the study here was synthesized into the following hypotheses and the analysis was carried out based on them:<br/>Hypothesis 1<br/>H0:    Foreign direct investment (FDI) has no significant impact on the growth of Nigeria economy. <br/>H1:    Foreign direct investment (FDI) has relative impact on the growth of the Nigeria economy.<br/>Hypothesis 2<br/>H0:    The level of balance of payment (BOP) Interest rate (INTR) and exchange rate (EXR) have no significant impact on the growth of the economy.<br/>H1:    The level of balance of payment (BOP) interest rate (INTR) and exchange rate (EXR) have relative impact on the development of the Nigerian economy.<br/>1.8     Definition of Terms<br/>1.8.1  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): Foreign direct investment is described as investment made so as to acquire lasting management interest for example 10% equity share in an enterprise operating in another country other than the investors country (Mwilliama, 2003).<br/>1.7.2  Gross Domestic Product (GDP): Gross domestic product is the total value of all final goods and services produced in a country in a given year.<br/>1.7.3  Balance of Payment (BOP): It is a record of transaction between residents of a country and the rest of the world.<br/>1.7.4  Exchange Rate (EXR): It is the charge for exchanging currency of one country for the currency of another.<br/>1.7.4  Interest Rate (INTR):Interest rate is the rate at which interest is paid by borrowers (debtors) for the use of money that they borrow from lenders (creditors).<br/><br/><br/>\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) ON NIGERIA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH (1980 - 2012)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) ON NIGERIA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH (1980 - 2012)", "id": 57}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>TREND ANALYSIS OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA RECURRENT EXPENDITURE ON EDUCATION<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The important of Education in national development cannot be overemphasized hence its cardinal position in various objectives of most developing countries.  In Nigeria over the years, elements of uncertainty have beclouded this sector both in nominal and real terms. Incessant strikes, closure of schools and other vices account for poor quality teaching and quality of products. The objective of this study is to examine the profile of Educational Expenditure in Nigeria (1966-2013).The data presented was collected primarily from the federal ministry of Education and can also be found in central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) statistical Bulletin 2013 appendix A, it will be analyzed using SPSS (statistical package for social science) and the result also will be used to forecast future expenditure on Education. The study findings dwelt upon various problems, based on this finding recommendation are made, adequate planning of funding the Nigerian Education should be made ahead of time and actual budgetary expenditure should be backed by fund release and other sources of financing Education should be encouraged. The fact remains that higher education in Nigerian has been experiencing loss of facility, deterioration of equipment and plans, and uncompleted projects as a result of finical crises facing the system. When all these pressures are obvious, less increase in efficiency and pronouncing and diminish quality and output (i.e. teaching, scholarship and service, diminished working and living condition for professional staffs and students alike). Other contributory factors to the under-funding of Nigerian universities include lack of adequate planning.<br/>               TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0          INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1          PROBLEM STATEMENT<br/>1.2          AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>1.3                          SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY<br/>1.4          SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>1.5                          RESEACH QUESTION<br/>1.6          PROBLEM ENCOUNTED<br/>1.7          DEFINATION OF TERMS<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0.

O INTRODUCTION<br/>It is widely accepted that education creates improved citizens and helps to upgrade the general standard of living in a society. Therefore, a positive social change is likely to be associated with the production of qualitative citizenry. It would seems to follow naturally that if more individuals are educated, the wealth of the nations will rise, since more education attracts higher wages and aggregative higher nation income and if there are positive externalities of education, national income would increase by even more than the sum of the individuals benefits.<br/>   An inquiry into the fiscal operations and development of Nigeria revealed that federal government expenditure on education is categorized under the social and community services sector. The implication is that education is an impure good.[Orubu,1989].<br/>The important of education is reminiscent in its role as a means of understanding, controlling, altering and redesigning of human environment [C.B.N 2000]. Education also improves health, productivity and access to paid employment [Anyanwu et al. 1999]. Education has a link with economic development. As once remarks by Ola [1998; 14] ‘’if you see any economic that is not doing well, find out what is spent on education’’.psacharopoulos[1973]<br/>Combs [1985] and Aborubo [1999] have all revealed that increase in national income and per capita income is a function of education and that differences among nations can better be explained by differences in the endowment of human, rather than physical capital. The underscores the reason why the Asian tigers in the past three decades allocated between 25-35% of their annually budgets to their education sector [Aboubo, 1999:61] in most developing countries improving the widens access to education especially basic education is a cardinal objective of their government. Education is seen as a right and responsibility to be guaranteed to all generations.[Anyanwu et al; 1999].<br/>  The increasing faith in education as an agent of change in many developing countries including Nigeria has held to a heavy investment in it, and thus the delegation of manpower development to the schools. The pressure from developing countries that undoubtedly been helped by public perception of financial reward from pursuing such education.<br/>1.1          Problem statement<br/>Nigeria education is currently in crises. There is less money to spend on secondary, tertiary education and primary education. Education sector complains of under-funding while the government accuses the sector of inefficient Revitalization of African higher Education utilization of available resources. The donors argue that public spending on education should be reduced.<br/>At the same time there is growing changes at the educational level. Moreover, there are increasing complains about poor standard of education at a period when globalization demands much from the educational system in terms of preparation of skillful labor force.<br/>1.2          . Aim and objectives.<br/>1.            The objective of this study is to examine the profile of educational expenditure in Nigeria for the period of 1966-2013.<br/>2.            To investigate the variation present in the data within the period under review.<br/>3.            To recommend to the government on the better way of their budget on education.<br/>4.            To predict and forecast for the future Expenditure of government on education.<br/>1.3. Significance of the study<br/>The project work, should by the end of the study of reveal the following.<br/>1.            The future of expenditure will be known, thereby giving them advantages to plan better.<br/>2.            It will service as an advantages to individuals and corporate bodies.<br/>3.            To show the variation present in the data within the period under investigation and study.<br/>1.4. Scope of the study<br/>This is limited to the data collected from the C.B.N. statistical bulletin over the period of 1966-2013.<br/>1.5. Research question<br/>The questions for this research are as follows;<br/>What was disbursed to the education sector between 1966-2013?<br/>1.            What was the total federal allocation to education between 1966-2013?<br/>2.            Is there any variation present in the data?<br/>1.6.         Problem encountered<br/>2.            There were much financial constrain during the cause of the execution of this project work.<br/>3.            Collection of data from the federal ministry of education was not easy due to official bottle necks in the organization.<br/> 1.7. Definitions of terms<br/>1. Education: Education is the act or process of imparting or acquiring general knowledge, developing the powers of reasoning and judgment and it is also an enlightens experience.<br/> 2. Times series: Time series is an ordered sequence of values of a variable at equally spaced time intervals, it occurs frequently when looking at industrial data.<br/>3. Forecasting: prediction of future events and conditions are called forecast, and the act of making such prediction is called forecasting.<br/>4. Time plot: There are basically four components of time series data long term trend, circular, seasonal variation. To identify these components we need to plot the time series graph known as time plot or histogram, it is a graph that plot the time series against its time period.<br/>5. Additive model:  This comes to play when the variation in time series data are of the same equal band width it is useful where the variation or movement around the trend are constant over a period of time.<br/>6. De-seasonalization: this is the process of removing the effect of seasons from the time series data.<br/>7. Scatter Diagram:  This is obtained by plotting the time series data in the co-ordinate manner, the values of the independent variables are called along x-axis and that of the dependent variables y are scaled along the y –axis<br/>8. Freehand method: These methods consist of fitting trend line on the time plot [graph] through mere looking at the points on the graph. However this approach has obvious disadvantage since it depends much on human eye judgment.<br/>9. Moving Average method: this is the method of estimating the trend value by using the moving average of appropriate order.<br/>10. Semi-Average method : this consist of separating the data into two parts [preferably equal parts] and averaging the data in  each part this obtaining low points on the graph of the time series.<br/>11. Auto- correlation: Auto-correlation is a simple autocorrelation coefficient which measures the correlation between observations at different distance apart.<br/>12. Outliers: Outliers are data different from the entire data i.e data executed from the entire data.<br/>13. Time Series Analysis: Time series analysis is a set of order observations of quantitative variables taken at successive point of time; the period can be daily, weekly, etc.<br/>14.

The serial dietitian technique was employed up to 10-3 using nutrient agar, potato dextrose agar and sabourand agar plates. The isolation of both bacterial and fungal organisms were made  before treating the soil types with the two pesticides), D.D.T and BHC.  and after treating the soil types with D.D.T after treating  and BHc. The highest bacterial count before treating the soil types with D.D.T and BHc was got in loamy soil with 133 per ml having  PH 7.1, followed by clay soil with 78 per ml and  least was sandy soil with 42 per ml. while the highest bacterial count  after treating the soil types with D.D.T was gotten in loamy soil 105 per ml, followed by clay soil with  51 and least count was got in sandy with 28 per ml. Also the  highest bacterial count after treatment with BHc was obtained in loamy soil with 12F per ml, followed by clay soil with 64 per ml and the least count was got from sand soil with 37 per ml. The highest bacterial isolate from all the soil types before  treatment with the two pesticides was pseudomonas with 25 per ml, followed by Bacillus SPP with   24 per ml, and  next was achnomycetes with 19 per ml  while the least bacterial organism was Rhizobrium SPP. The fungal organisms isolates were Aspergillus species, syncophatastrum species, pernicillum species and mucor species. The results of this project showed that there was reduction in microflora of the soil types after treatment separately with the two pesticides. But the effect was more with  D.D.T than with BHc. Also the effects of the two pesticides was highest in sandy soil followed by clay and lastly the loamy soil. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>Introduction <br/>1.2              Aims and objectives<br/>1.3              Statement of problem<br/>1.4              Hypothesis<br/>1.5              Limitation of the study<br/>CHAPTER TWO <br/>Literature review                                                                                            <br/>2.1       Pesticide labeling and safety                                                           <br/>2.2              Various classes and types of pesticides.                                        <br/>2.3              Effects of pesticide on population of invertebrates in soil        <br/>2.4              Effects of  pesticides on population of vertebrates in the soil   <br/>2.5              Effects of pesticides on population of micro organism in the soil<br/>HAPTER THREE <br/>3.0       Materials and methods                                                                                   <br/> 3.1      materials                                                                                                         <br/>3.2       Methods                                                                                                         <br/>3.2.1    Sterilization                                                                                                    <br/>3.2.2  Collection of pesticides                                                                  <br/>3.2.3    Collection of three types of soil loamy clay sandy                            <br/>3.2.4  Preparation of media                                                                            <br/>2.2.5    Playing technique                                                                                             <br/>3.2.6 Microbial count, staining and microscopic work                                  <br/>3.2.7    Identification of would                                                                                 <br/>3.2.8  Biochemical test for identification      <br/>CHAPTER FOUR <br/> Result                                                            <br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>Discussions                                                                                        <br/>CHAPTER SIX <br/>6.0       Conclusion and recommendation                                                      <br/>6.1              conclusion<br/>6.2              recommendation                                                                                            <br/>References                                                                                                              <br/>Appendix                                                                                                                   <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/> INTRODUCTION <br/>According to crupta and Daroren (2003) soil is that portion of the surface of the land which is essential for plant growth. Plant are anchored in the soil by their root, which spread in all direction and which by holding on to the soil keep the plant in position plant draw all their water and  most of their food or nutrient from the soil. Soil is therefore the source of food for plants, animals and man. Soil is of different types, sandy, clay and loamy soil. Sandy soil has or size range of 0.2 to 2mm diameter. They are free draining and do not retain any appreciable amount of soil water. It is brown loose and dry. While clay soil range in size from 0.002mm and lower and contains more than 40% of clay particles. They are sticky, plastic and  easily moldable into  shape. Another type is loamy soil which contains a fair balance of clay , silt and sand particle and it is the best  soil for agriculture, as it has a high proportion of organic matter or content soil organic malter represents on accumulation of  partially decayed and animal residues. Such material is continually being broken down as a result  of the  work of soil micro –organism consequently. It is a rather  transitory soil constituent and must be renewed constantly by the additionb of plant residues. The organic matter content of a soil is small, only 3-5 percent by weight in a representative minerals topsoil. It is a major soil source of two important mineral elements namely phosphorous and suefur and essentially the sole source of nitrogen. Through its effect on the physical condition of soil, organic matter also increase the amount of water a soil can hold and the proportion of water available for plant growth. Further more   organic matter is the main source of energy for soil microflora. Without it biochemical activity would come practically to a stand still soil organic matter consist of two groups (a) Original tissue and its partially decomposed equivalent and (b) the humus. The original tissue include the under composed roots and the tops of higher plants. The materials are subject to vigorous attack by soil organism and both plant  and animal which use them as sources of energy and tissue building material. The gelatinous, more resistant products of this decompository both the synthesized by the micro organisms and those modified from the original plant tissue are collectively known as HUMUS. This material, usually black or brown in colour is coloidal in nature. Its capacity to hold water and nutrient ions greatly exceeds that of clay, its inorganic counterpart. Small amount of humus thus augment remarkably the soil capacity to promote plant production.<br/>According to Burges and Raw (1967) loamy like clay is a product of degradation and synthesis. And the agencies responsible are the living organisms in the soil both the animal (fauna) and the plant (flora). These organism engineer a myriad of biochemical changes as decay takes place. They also physically chum the soil and help stabilize soil structure. A rast number of organism live in the soil. By far the greater proportion of these belong to plant life. Yet animal are not to be minimized especially in the early stage of organic decomposition.<br/>Edward and lofty in 1969 explain that the activities of specific group of soil organisms are commonly identified by (a) their numbers in the soil (b) their weight per unit volume or area of soil (biomass) and (c) their metabolic activity. Although the relative metabolic activities are not shown, they are generally related to biomass of the organism. As might be expected, the numbers are highest among the micro organism. So great are microflora number that they do minate the biomass in spite of the minute size of each individual organisms. The microflora monopolize the metabolic activity in soil. It is estimated that 60-80% of the total soiil metabolism is due to the microflora.<br/>They further said that some of the many naturally and artificially occuring substance have deleterious effect on the life of at least some species of organism in the soil by inhibiting the development of these species. However, there is continuing concern that these chemical substance may also adversary affect various non parasitic segment of the soil microflora. These chemical compound substance are called pesticide. Pesticides are  therefore material useful for  the control  nutigation of animals detrimental to human or economy. Algaecides, deforlant and descant herbicides plant growth  regulator and fungicide are used to regulate population of undesirable organisms which compete with or  pristine crop or namental plants. Attractant insecticides, muticides, accredits, molluscide, nematodes, repellant and rodenticide are used principally  to reduce parasitism and trasmission in domestic animals, the loss of crop plant, the destruction of processed  food textile wood products as well as parasitism and disease transmission to human.<br/>Jones (1956) and fletcher (1960) have shown the effect of different pesticide on type, number and activities. They explain that herbicide and insecticides can destroy soil micro organism or suppress their activities if applied at excessive rate. But when applied at recommended rate these chemicals reach soil concentration of  more than 2 or 3 part per million (PPm) however, some pesticide are obtained from plant and minerals, while few other are obtained by the mixed culture of micro organisms insecticides like pyrethin, cruelties and nicotine are  extracted from plant. Also toxin produced by bacillus thuringiesis are active ingredient against moth and butterfly larrac. The toxins are sometime called miracle gene”. DDt is an out standing example of insecticide and probably the most commonly used pesticide. It is known to contain remarkable properties and does not occur naturally too. Its first synthesis  was recorded in 1874 by a German research chemist called. Zeidler<br/>In the mid 60s, the  benefits steaming from the ability of DDT to control insect pest could be counter balanced by adverse effects on other element of the enriroment. Detailed reviews of properties, stability, prehistoric and impact upon all facets of the environment were carried out  with DDT and other chlorinated organic insecticides. Concern over the  undesirable effects of pesticide culminated insecticides, fungicide,nd rodenticide act (FIFRA) by public.  Law o2-516, the federal environmental  pesticide control act (FEPCA) in united state of American to prevent unreasonable environmental hazard from pesticides for general and restricted users as a function of acute toxicity Benzene hexachloride (BHC) is an organochiloride pesticide for its efficiency in the control of anthropoid pests. There is fear that BHc will probable have adverse effect on non targeted microflora  of the soil the aplastic anemia reported in individual said to have been exposed to BHC has been attributed to benzene, which causes aplastic anaemia. But BHc is based on cylohexane. Which does not cause anaemia (grawhill 1982).<br/>1.2              AIM AND OBJECTIVES <br/>i.          To determine the effect of pesticide dicblorodipheny trichloroethane (DDT) and benzene hexachloride (BHC) on the microflora of three types of soil.<br/>ii.         To isolate soil microflora from the three types of soil.<br/>Iii         To identify soil microflora of the three type of soil.<br/>iv.                To determine the type of soil that is mostly affected by pesticides.<br/>1.3              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>According to (Higa 1990) Agricultural practices can have a significant positive and negative impact on soil.

From the available statistical data the evidence have been showing alarming rate of sexually transmitted diseases every day as mankind gets more civilized.  The sexually transmitted diseases can be categorized into three: the first category are referred to as the first category are referred to as the first generation, these are gonorrhea, syphilis, and chancroid.  The second generation includes hympho granuloma venereum and granuloma ingunale.  The third generation which is Aids  (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). These sexually transmitted disease have become a major public health problem to most countries of the world, including Nigeria on the account of their frequency, their impact on maternal and infant health and their special consequences as well as their economic cost in terms of health expenditure and cost of productivity.  It has a serious effect on pregnancy, and new borns are seriously affected which may lead to miscarriage, failure of development of new baby, blindness congenital defects etc.   The implication in woman such as pekvic inflammatory disease ectopic pregnancy, infertility and chronic ill health are caused by sexual transmitted diseases where the incidence of undiagnosed or poor treated cases is very high.  <br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>            The disease, sexually transmitted disease (STDS) is an old strong disease that was discovered before the amalgamation of Nigeria in the year 1914 by a great medical scientist known as lordchester field, in the year 1985.  this disease has killed very many paple, yet, as at that time people doesn’t believe it, not until a good number of research work was carried out in the laboratory and evidence showed that it is a communicable disease that can be contracted from one person to another through  predominantly sexual contact; such as gonorrhea, syphilis enters the body veins through blood and weakens or makes the white blood cell known as lymphocyte inactive to attack the disease of the sexual transmitted disease and this deadly disease will dry the victim to the extent that you will be able to count the bones and extent that you will be able to count the bones and ribs of the patient.  But some people are still doubting the existence of the deadly disease STDS while statistical data table shows that 7,548 people was a victim within the year of 1985 to 1990.  But the recent data collected shows that 17,277 people were infected as it was recorded at the Federal Medical Centre Umuahia.  In addition, the above collected data will help the masses to reduce the rate of sexual act and sexual promiscuity.  The federal ministry of health warns that total abstinence and mutual fidelity remains the best protective measure for or against sexually  transmitted disease (STDS)  such as  gonorrhea, syphilis etc.  That is why the federal government supported the introduction of sex education and the use of condom as a program in most of our media, such as newspaper, radio, television etc.  In order to educate the poor masses on the subject matter and how to avoid contacting the deadly disease (STDS).<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>            The rapid spreading of these deadly diseases (STDS) does not mean that both the internal and external bodies’ even corporate organizations are not working to remedy the issue.  But we should not unemphasize the problem facing the efforts. Some of this problems includes inadequate central surveillance system from which all of us will be getting the information that we carry and reply in our program, because what we get now in Nigeria is information that is fragment not reconcilable.  Even when there is seeming different, there are not other third sources of reference to cross check.  Here the problem of finance contributed to the collapse of the efforts been made.  Take for instance, the latest inhibitors introduced by Hoffmann – LaRoche of the Switzerland Eortovase and Viracept cannot be obtained by poor countries like Nigeria.<br/>            We know that it will sound unbelievable even at the moment to some people mainly the youths of today that kept adamant on the warnings and dangers of being a prostitute, a homosexual, a Hetero Sexual and equally having unprotected sexual intercourse.  All that the World Health Organization (WHO) had warned that partners should be truthful to themselves and take preventive measures.<br/>1.3       AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>i.                    To know how far people have known about existence of the sexually transmitted disease.<br/>ii.                  To know whether the rate at which male are infected is the same at which the females are infected.<br/>iii.                To recommend preventive measures on how to avoid contacting the sexually transmitted diseases and give appropriate treatment to avoid rapid spread of the deadly disease.<br/>iv.                To specify the age group that is mostly affected.<br/>v.                  Finally, the objective of this study is in picking the types of sexually transmitted diseases under study one by one and uses statistical methods predicting what their incidence rate will be in the year 2005 and 2006.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The study has revealed that the awareness of the existence of sexual transmitted disease.  Through this study, their causes, sources and mode of transmission have been have been highlighted.  Having known all these a greater result can be achieved by embarking on the program against sexually transmitted disease, such as making use of condom as one of the preventive measures and total abstinence as another measure.  Another important significance is that, the health standard of the people is improved, while the death effect and other consequences of sexually transmitted diseases are minimized by profiling good medical attention and the use of skilled practitioners.<br/>            Finally, by achieving all these goals, we can have a good social economic planning for the present and future generation.<br/>1.5       SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS<br/>            The Federal Medical Centre Umuahia (FMC) is my scope of study.  It has ten wards (10) two medical ward on each for male and female, two surgical wards one each for male and female, two surgical wards one each for male and female, maternity wards with eighty (80) beds, one ward with forty (40) beds for booked patients while the other is for unbooked patients. Other are the pediatrics ward with twenty (20) beds and a gynecological ward with fourty (40) beds.  But my area of concentration is based on the steadily increase of the sexually transmitted diseases (STDS).  And we are taking a more look at the four varieties of sexually transmitted diseases (STDS).  And we are taking a more look at the four varieties of sexually transmitted disease (STDS) such as gonorrhea, syphilis, arthritis and Aids.  This study is faced with a lot of limitations and some problems encountered din the project research must not be overlooked.  Some problems as: problem of finance, a lot of expense was made on the process of collecting the data.  Time factor is another problem that delays the collection of data.<br/>            In addition, the duplication of the data and the production of this project work also included.  On this note I was to study records from the year 1995 – 2002.  This further more confined to the statistical analysis only, which has to do with the incidence rate of the sexually transmitted disease under study as arranged or grouped into sex, age groups and years.  There will also be some forecast or production of the type of sexually transmitted disease under study in a specifically year to come.<br/>1.6       FOR THE HYPOTHESIS<br/>i.                    The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between age group.  This means that the incident rate of age group is the same.  The alternative hypothesis is that the incident rate of age group differ which reconcile that the incident rate is not he same.<br/>ii.                  The null hypothesis is also used for the incident rate sex that means that there is no difference between incident rate of sex then.  The alternative hypothesis is that the incident rate of sex is differ which states that the incident rate of sex is not the same.<br/>1.7       ASSUMPTIONS<br/>i.                    That is an existence of sexually transmitted disease (STDS) virus<br/>ii.                  Attempts on how to prevent or cure the sexually transmitted diseases (STDS) have been made.<br/>iii.                Maximum cooperation is needed from all and sundry.<br/>1.8       DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>i.          STDS: Sexually Transmitted Diseases<br/>ii.         AIDS: Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome<br/>iii.        HIV:                Human Immunodeficiency Virus<br/>iv.        VIRUS:           Any living thing that is smaller than<br/>bacteria, that causes the spread of infections disease.  It can only be seen with the use of microscope.<br/> v.         SEROLOGICAL TEST FOR HIV:               Blood test<br/>that allows the presence of anti bodies to HIV in the body to be dictated.<br/>ABORTION:  Removal   of unwanted child out of her<br/>mothers’ womb<br/>IMPOTENCY:           Inability of a man to impregnate a<br/>woman due to the destruction of the manhood by sexually transmitted disease(s).<br/>PRE – MARITAL SEX:        Sex before marriage<br/>RACE:            Different type of people living in the world<br/>INFERTILITY:          Inability to bear a child or children.<br/>LYPHOCYTE:           A group of white blood cells that helps to<br/>prevent infections from spreading<br/>ANTI-BODY:            This is an organism that is not a part of<br/>the body but was being introduced to that body<br/>PERINATAL:            This simply means mother<br/>HOMO-SEXUALITY:          This is sexual intercourse between<br/>persons of the same sex e.g male to male.<br/>LESBIANISM:          Sexual intercourse between people of<br/>the same sex eg female to female<br/>HETERO SEXUALITY:       This is a sexual intercourse<br/>between persons of opposite sex, example female to male.<br/>INFECTION: An inversion of the body (entry) of a<br/>disease causing organism<br/>CONDOM:                 A preservative or “rubber” sheath<br/>(usually made of latex) used to cover the penis or virgin by women during sexual intercourse to prevent pregnancy or to protect against disease.<br/> WHO: WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION<br/>MOD OF TRANSMISSION:            This is simply the way at<br/>which a disease or disease can be transferred over from a carrier to a non carrier.     <br/><br/>\n\nA STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF REPORTED CASES OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITED DISEASE IN THE FEDERAL MEDICAL CENTRE UMUAHIA (F.M.C) FROM 1995 -

however, these advances may appear insignificant when compared to the magnitude of the problems still to be solved especially as it concerns infant diseases and infant mortality.<br/>            According to the Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary, Mortal means to die; that cannot live forever.  Encyclopedia Britannica expressed the state of being mortal as the state of temporalness of living, or not to live forever.<br/>            In these modern times there have been an increase in world population and stability ad decline in number would be regarded as abnormal.  As Berkley (1958) said, “modern phrase of recent origin started from the peiod of 1600; the growth is quite unprecedented in any comparable period”.  One can view from the above statement, that such changes in population are inherently transitory.<br/>            In countries of West Africa records of health did not start until orthodox medium arrived, but it was recognized prior to the arrival of the white men.  There were high incidence of killer diseases which affected maternal and infant health leading to high mortality of infants.  Moreover, the sanitary condition of our local populace, mode of feeding and general condition leaves much to be desired, also lack of health infrastructures created problems that led to high infant mortality.<br/>            Again, other causes of infant mortality are recognized killer childhood diseases viz; measles, malaria, small pox, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis, poliomyelitis, dyphytaria and jaundice.  In late 80’s government of Nigeria through the National Programme on Immunization and Expanded Programme on Immunization has achieved a lot to the improvement of infant health.<br/>            Now, according to recent health journals “Health care” the liming legs are fastly dis appearing, the plague of onchosochaisis caused by the black fly is gone.  Our children and infants are living today without it.  Poliomyelitis is about being kicked out from the shores of our country courtesy of the three months immunization programme of year 2000.<br/>1.1       HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>            The federal medical center Umuahia was built in the early 1950’s by the joint effort of the protestant churches, the Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian churches.  The three churches agree to build a joint hospital and work together as a means and avenue of a joint Christian medical services and Christian evangelism.  Trained and qualified competent Christian ladies were generally nurses and midwifery and this created an environment for true Christian gospel and evangelism.  The hospital was first named Union Mission Joint Training Hospital.  Nurses and student nurses were drawn from hospitals named by three denominations and located at Iyi Enu Ituk Mbang and Etinagi all in Calabar to run the hospital.  Later as a mark of appreciation and courtesy to Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain when she formally and officially opened the hospital in 1956, during the regime of his excellency the governor of the Eastern Region of Nigeria, Sir. Clement Plear, it was renamed Queen Elizabeth Hospital.<br/>            Soon after its establishment, the hospital gained popularity and reputation, but it suffered a set back during the Nigeria civil war from 1967 – 1970 when most of the medical equipments were looted.  Moreover, indigenous missionaries could not maintain the hospital after the departure of the foreign missionaries at the end of the war.<br/>            Consequently, it management was taken over by the government, which converted it to a sepcialsit hospital by the East Central State of Nigeria Edit No 6 of 1972: with the creation of the Imo State Government, she changed the name of Ramat specialist Hospital in honour of the later Head of State General Ramat Murtala Mohammed, under the direction of Navy Captain Ndubuisi Kanu, the then military governor.  I t reverted to Queen Elizabeth hospital o the 16th December 1983, sequel to a request by the people of old Imo State. <br/>The hospital was again taken over by the Federal Government on 1st May, 1992 and was renamed Federal Medical Centre Umuahia.<br/>            The Federal Medical Centre Umuahia is located at Umuahia the capital of Abia State.  The hospital has ten wards, two medical wards on each for male and female, maternity wards, the pediatrics ward, two theatres, one for obstetrics and other for general surgery.  Other areas of the hospital includes: the Antenatal clinics, x – ray department, pharmacy and medical laboratories units, medical records/ statistics among others. <br/>The hospital has two training schools, the school of Nursing and the school of midwifery.  It has a staff strength of about 720; made up of medical doctors, Nurses, House of Officers, Laboratory Technicians and Scientists, Accounting of Officers, records Officers, Pharmacists, Administrative Officers, Attendants, among others.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>            The researcher was very much worried and concerned about the alarming rate at which infants were dying in Abia State and the following statements and questions below prompted him to go into the study about the rate of infant mortality in Abia State.<br/>1.                  The rate of infant mortality in Abia State was alarming.<br/>2.                  The rate of infants mortality may have been more in a particular sex<br/>3.                  The rate of infant’s mortality may have been caused by many factors among which disease were the chief.<br/>4.                  The rate of infant’s mortality in Abia State should follow a particular trend over the years.<br/>5.                  There should be some preventive measures to reduce the number of infant’s death that may occur in Abia State.<br/>1.3       RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>1.                  What are the major causes of infant mortality in Abia State?<br/>2.                  Is there any means to compare mortality rate of infant male and female to know whether there is significant yearly difference in their mortality rate?<br/>3.                  Does infant mortality rate in Abia State dependent on sex?<br/>4.                  Can the trend of infant mortality in Abia State be established?<br/>5.                  Are there some preventive measures to reduce the number of infants death that may occur in Abia State?<br/>1.4       AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>1.                  To compare mortality rate of infant male and female in order to know whether there is significant yearly difference in their mortality rate.<br/>2.                  To determine whether infant mortality in Abia State is independent of sex.<br/>3.                  To suggest possible preventive measures to reduce the number of infant deaths that may occur.<br/>4.                  To determine the trend of the infant mortality rate.<br/>5.                  Based on the findings, recommendation will be made.<br/>1.5       STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESES<br/>            This study is testing for the following hypothesis:-<br/>H0:       There is significance difference in the yearly mortality rate of infants male and female.<br/>H1:       There is not significance difference in the yearly mortality rate of infants male and female.<br/>H0:       Infant mortality in Abia State is independent of sex<br/>H1:       Infant mortality in Abia State is not independent of sex.<br/>1.6       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This project work is restricted to the federal medical center, Umuahia in Abia State.  The study covers a period of ten years from 1995 to year 2004.<br/>1.8       DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>            The terms used in this study are all Demography terms and are peculiar t o the subject matter alone.<br/>            Below are some of the terms commonly used in this study, which constitute the reference terms and will aid data analysis.<br/>Demograph<br/>Mortality<br/>Neo-natal mortality<br/>Morbidity<br/>Disease<br/>Infants<br/>(i)         DEMOGRAPHY:     This is the study of human population and some of the factors that causes change in its composition and size.<br/>(ii)        MORTALITY:         The state of being mortal, mortal means that must die; that cannot live forever, a state of temporal living or existence.<br/>(iii)       NEO-NATAL MORTALITY:        This is the mortality of infants within the first 28 days of birth.  Some of which are caused by the circumstances of birth.<br/>(iv)       INFANT – MORTALITY RATE: Mortality rate is the index of death over the index of birth for a given period of at least one year.  Infant mortality can be defined as the number of death under one year over the number of live birth times 1000.<br/>i.e        D         x          K         Where D is the number of death in<br/>B                                 a particular year.<br/>B is the number of birth in the same year<br/>K is a constant and is equal to 1,000<br/> Which is No of death under one year             x          1000?<br/>                               No of live births<br/> This shows clearly the measures within a given year of chances of birth failing to survive in one year life time.<br/>To calculate separately for the sexes:<br/> Female =          No of female death     x          1000<br/>                                    No of female births<br/> Males   =          No of males death       x          1000<br/>                                    No of males birth<br/> (v)        MORBIDITY:           Morbidity involves the statistics of ill health of a population.  It includes the rate of illness, injuries, accidents etc.<br/>(vi)       DISEASE:     This is the state of being morbid, it is caused by infections or undergrowth.  There are air borne disease, water borne diseases, insect borne diseases, and sexually transmitted diseases.<br/>(a)        Water Borne Diseases:          These are caused by some aquatic living organisms which when they enter human body cause disease. They include some Fungi, Algae, bacteria etc.  Also bad source of water supply where sewage and refuse are badly disposed can lead to severe cause of water borne diseases.  These diseases include typhoid fever, cholera, diarrhea, dysentery etc.<br/>(b)       Air Borne Disease:    These are diseases which can be contacted or transmitted from a carrier to a healthy person through the air. Free-living bacteria or parasite transmits these diseases.  These diseases are coughs, measles, catarrh, whooping cough, chicken pox and polio.<br/>(c)        Insect Borne Diseases:          These are diseases carried by insect vectors.  These vectors visits and plague human environs disposing bacterium to their food.  Diseases like typhoid fever, diarrhea and cholera are carried by housefly.  Mosquitoes carry malaria parasite and trypanosomiasis is caused by tsetse fly, while onchosochaisis is caused by African black fly.<br/>(d)       Sexually Transmitted Diseases:        These are significantly important because some of them affects fertility rate, there are disease acquired through sexual intercourse between the victim and any member of the adult population. Examples of such diseases are Gonorrhea, syphilis HIV/AIDS etc.           <br/>(vii)      POPUALTION:        This refers to the total number of individuals or items relevant to a phenomenon under investigation.<br/>(viii)     STILL BIRTH:         This refers to that fetus that has not developed to a full baby and is release from the utemis prematurely and as a result couldn’t

their goods, produce and products, and/or they themselves from one location to another have played an important role in the development process, thus, serving as one of the aspects of developmental change indicators and structural well-being of the society and government among other sectors or areas of the world socio-economic development.  It provides room not only for transaction of business to take place, market possibility for our goods, produce and products produced, but also makes it possible for such to reach the find consumer(s).<br/>For instance, in Costa Rica, before the inter America – highway was constructed, driving beed cattle on the hoof from grazing lands to San Jose often resulted in a 40 percent less of weight, and imports were necessary to supply local needs.  But with and weather highway, it was possible to deliver truck-traider units of cattle over night, and costs Rica become self-supporting in meet.  Also in Bolivia, the highway from cochabamba to santa cruz reduced the travel time in the rainy season from several weeks to fifteen hours and provided a link between the country’s food supplies and its people.  Until then the price of home-grown rice was 50 percent higher than the imported rice because of the high cost of transport.  Furthermore, transportation as an integral part of national production and distribution system calls for its development, improvement and better network system as to necessitate or provide a means of servicing domestic and international market.<br/> This is of primary importance in the early stages of economic development because it promotes an accumulation of capital, which allows the economy to progress from the subsistence level at which most production is consumed locally.  Therefore, transportation and other government programmes such as education and health care, necessarily compete for public expenditures particularly in the underdeveloped countries.<br/>From the foregoing, the developed nation are efficient and effective in transport business as a result of their improvement and technological advancement over the years.<br/>Nigeria has one of the most modern and best development transport systems – roil, road, air and in-land waterings which transverse the length and breath of the country to link the industrial, commercial, and agricultural centers, that is to say, transportation in Nigeria is traditionally under four major mades namely;- road, rail, water and air.  However, in this study, the researcher zeros down to road transport.<br/>In Nigeria road network, roads are categorized into three; the truck A roads which is the responsibility of the federal Government, truck B roads which is the responsibility of the state Government and the third category-truck C which is the responsibility of the local Government.  Whether truck A, truck B, and truck C roads, these roads are used by the motorists, cyclists, pedestrians either to convey their passengers, goods, produce, products or to reach, transact and communicate with another n different destination.  Road transportation has not only been discovered as the cheapest means of transportation but also provides door-to-door transport services and delivery of goods.<br/> But apart from road congestion which is symptom of the availability of insufficient road space to satisfy, with but difficulty, all demands made upon it, road accident is another difficulty task in traffic management schemes and has been of much concern to various governments of our timer hence, the concern of any well-organised government is how to identify and minimize (if possible curb) the high rate of accidents on our roads today.<br/> We are aware of the number of deaths on the highway being recorded these days.  This places a question mark on the value we attach to human life and property.  It is clear on the basis of logic backed by observations that certain people have worse accident records than others.  This research will investigate why it is so and would also proffer suggestions to check the ugly trends people who drive recklessly or dangerously are potential victims of accidents and are prone to such conditions.  They also constitute a nuisance to the society.<br/>Most accidents have been caused by a whole lot of actors.  Prominent among them are as listed below:   <br/>1.         Over-Speeding:          Some times may be due to greediness or the tendency to drive as many turn as possible always want to be at the head of others, without considering the consequences.  By so doing they neglect road signs warnings and road traffic regulations and laws.  Thus, the risk of some dangerous.<br/>2.         Drugs/Alcohol:          The side effects of drugs or alcohol our body cannot be over emphasized.  These cause drowsiness and finally sleep when during.  They lead to wrong calculations and loss of regard to lvies of human beings and property of such driver concerned.  Some causes excessive alertness and nervousness, loss of control and finally a breakdown of the body system of such person involved.<br/>3.         Roads (Road Accidents Immuned Delusion Syndrome):  Some drivers because they have driven a particular vehicle for years, taxy develop the feeling that they have overmastered the vehicle and also fully experienced do believe that they cannot be involved in road traffic accident, others or other drivers because of their belief either a shrine, ring, talisman, etc. do believe that they cannot be involved and/or die in road accident, they drive without regard to road traffic regulations and other road users.<br/>4.         The Road:      The construction of the road matters a lot.  Roads with multiple bands experience many accidents.  Poorly constructed road witness many accidents e.g. presence of informal bymps, very narrow roads.  Roads that are poorly maintained cause a lot of accidents.  The absence of road signs also contributes to road accidents e.g to show construction sites, narrow bridges, cross roads, bumps, “T” junction etc.<br/>5.         Negligence of road Signs:     Most Nigeria drivers are so illiterate that they cannot read road signs and as such endanger their lives and the lives of others and property.<br/>6.         Aggression:    This is psychological.  Also result of or may be due to lack of sleep in the previous night due to one problem or the other.  The driver then wake up annoyed and aggressive.  He jumps into the vehicle without the morning drills, quarrels with the vehicle passengers, co-drivers and road traffic officers etc. thus the risk of accident victimized and even others.   <br/>7.         The Weather:            This comprises the rain and the sun and their effects on the roads.  The rains wet the roads and make them slippery therefore, tyres treads loase grip of the roads and render braking almost impossible as and when desired.  The sun heats up the tar on the road which in tam heats up the tyres.  When this happens, weak tyres tends to burst very easily.  Both conditions causes accidents on our road if not observed.<br/>8.         Topography:  This includes hilly, rocky forest and savanna areas.  Areas where the roads run in between hills particularly with dedling rock constitute a lot danger to road users.  Where such exits, viewing distance are shortened, the rocks can fall into the road at any time and cause accidents.  Likewise where roads run across forests, trees, and/or their branches, many fall into the road and where this is not noticed in a good time, they can cause serious accidents.  Animal shiving is the forests can cross the roads at any time while grazing animals common in the savanna requires can also  cause accidents.<br/>9.         Carelessness of Pedestrians: The other road user that is seen as the commonest – the pedestrian(s) may out of illiteracy and inexperience in using the road disobey the road traffic sign by crossing when it is not due for him or her to do so.  Or cross the busy road without looking left or tight as to see when the road is free for crossing.<br/>10.       Foods: It takes many drivers time to understand the effect of some foods on their body.  Most eat one type of food because others do.  They fail to understand that, while some people or such people will be active after a heavy food, others or themselves imitating feel dull and will be sleeping after such a heavy food and thus, endangering their lives and property while driving.<br/>1.1       SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF ROAD ACCIDENTS<br/>Several aspects of road transport negative impact (road accident) on the society have already been discussed.  Some additional negative effects deserve mention.  Road accidents have significant effects, which they impact.  Adversely on the economic and social welfare of a nation.  The effects on the economy usually take the form of costs which under certain circumstance can be measured.  Some of these costs; private costs are borne by those responsible for the accident, while others are social in nature in that society as a whole bears them.  In this section, the study examines specific effects of road accidents.<br/>1.         Traffic hold-up and associated waste:        When an accident occurs, the most easily observed effect is a rapidly built-up traffic holdup.  In the process, fuel is wasted, engines are overheated, delays lead to lost business and social opportunities.  The direct effect is a showed down and more expansive business transactions.<br/>2.         Destruction of motor vehicle:           Road accidents usually entail the complete destruction of motor vehicle involved.  In some cases, the vehicles are salvaged at considerable cost to owners.  In Nigerian environment, accidental vehicles are either left on the scene of accidents indefinitely or are towed away to police stations where they are similarly abandoned.  The implication of this practice is that scrap value of such vehicle is lot to the economy and stock of transportation, facilities necessary to move people and goods from place to place is reduced.  The opportunities for realizing gains from within an integrated economic systems are lost, and the welfare of citizen earlier mentioned corresponding reduced.  Loss to the economy arising from road accidents is easily measurable.<br/>3.         Destruction of transport infrastructure:     Accidents destroy valuable road transport infrastructure whose replacement would cost multiples of the original capital expenditure.  These costs are significantly foreign exchange are imported.  Components of transport infrastructure that may be damaged include;<br/>i.                    Roads<br/>ii.                  Bridges<br/>iii.                Culverts etc<br/>Thus, resulting to capital reduction instead of capital accumulation.<br/>4.   Destruction of other infrastructure:            Road accidents also destroy other infrastructure such as telecommunication poles and wires, electricity poles and transformers, real estate including residential and office buildings.  Damage to these infrastructure disrupt electricity supply, telecommunications services and normal office facilities; all these tend to show down normal economic and social transactions with adverse consequences on the quality of life.<br/>5.   Short supply of goods:          Accidents cause the damage or destruction of goods being transported.  The loss reduces total quantity of goods available for consumption by the final consumer(s) and reduces profits for or made by the companies whose goods are destroy.  Where insurance cover is provided, cost of damage are passed on the insurance companies thus, reducing their capital gain if the goods are essential for normal subsistence, large scale destruction may necessitate importation which would either place a downward pressure on foreign exchange rates or lead to substantial devaluation of the exchange rate in a system of  flexible exchange rates.<br/>6.   Medical bills for treating accident victims:       Medical bills of accident victims are some of the adverse effect of road accidents.  Treatment in the orthopedic hospitals is time-consuming and expensive, after discharge of patients, the ability of such a person to perform duties is usually reduced.  This has adverse effect on production in the economy.<br/>1.2              AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>The main objectives of this project are to;<br/>1.                  Identify the causes of road accident in Enugu and compare the attendant fatalities/deaths.<br/>2.                  Ascertain whether the causes of road accident are unrelated with vehicles.<br/>3.                  Investigate whether there is any seasonal pattern of occurrence of road accidents and trend and/or compare the number of cases.<br/>4.                  Establish the trend of road accident over the years.<br/>5.                  Recommend methods or ways of reducing road accidents to the Enugu State Government, the institutions concerned for traffic management and enforcement of the laws within the geo-political entity and the road users.<br/>1.3              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study would help the government, the general public, the Nigerian Police Force, the Federal Road Safety Commission and other agencies concerned with safety on our roads in the following ways:<br/>1.                  It will help the Federal Road Safety Commission and other authorities concerned with similar assignment to assess their performance over the years.<br/>2.                  It will help the Federal and state governments particularly Enugu State to articulate policies on road transportation and safety, such policies will form the basis of planning the socio-economic infrastructure necessary to ensure safety and enhance the performance of road users.<br/>3.                  it will help the Federal Road, Safety Commission and other institutions concerned organizing sensitization workshop on seminars programmes for road users ascertain the positive impact of such workshop or seminar being organized.<br/>4.                  It will awaken the sense of responsibility of road users and government.<br/>5.                  It will help reduce or put to a stop the ill attitude poster by some of the law enforcement agencies (the Nigerian Police N20 syndrome) hindering the reduction of road accident.<br/>1.4              SOURCES OF DATA COLLECTION<br/>The data used for this project work were collected internally in secondary form.  Secondary data imply statistical materials or information not originated or obtained by the investigator himself, but obtain from someone’s record or published source such as the central bank, government agencies and non-governmental duties such as universities, research institutes etc.  The data were however, provided by Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) Enugu Division and the Federal Road Safety Commission, Enugu Sector Command.<br/>1.5              PROBLEMS OF THE DATA COLLECTION<br/>The problems encountered during collection of data cannot all be stated here.  This research work posed a lot of problems.  Since the researcher did not originally collect the data, there was mistrust between the primary users and the secondary user of the data.  It took me a lot of money, time and energy traveling from my destination to the office of the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) and that of the Federal Road Safety Commission all in Enugu, so as to get the relevant data for this research work.  This made me to miss most of my lecture hours and also disappointed my supervisor Mr. Pius Ugwu by not coming when I promised to see him several times.<br/>It was very difficult to collect the relevant data from these offices because they said that they couldn’t release the data for security reasons.  But after presenting letters from my Department Head Mr. Nwagbara G.P. dated 4th July, 2005, the desired information was given to me.<br/> <br/>\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF ROAD ACCIDENTS \r\n(A CASE IN ENUGU STATE FROM 1993 TO 2000)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\"
